AB  - Renewal describes the recovery of an extinguished response when extinction and recall contexts differ, demonstrating the context-dependency of extinction. The unexpected outcome change during extinction presumably directs attention to the context and promotes renewal. Accordingly, studies show that context processing for renewal is modulated by salience of and attention to context. Besides context-processing hippocampus, renewal involves ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, which mediate response processing. Since showing renewal is a trait-like processing tendency, individuals with and without renewal may differ in resting-state functional connectivity of prefrontal regions with networks mediating attentional and salience processing. We analyzed resting-state functional MRI data from healthy participants (n = 70) of a non-fear-related contextual extinction task particularly suited for investigation of renewal. Participants without renewal exhibited significantly higher functional connectivity between prefrontal regions and bilateral intraparietal sulcus of the dorsal attention network. Functional connectivity between these regions correlated negatively with renewal level. Only in participants with renewal, the renewal level correlated positively with connectivity between left frontal eye field and several prefrontal regions. In contrast, functional connectivity of prefrontal regions with the salience network did not differ between groups. The results deliver first-time evidence for differences in resting-state functional connectivity between participants with and without renewal in non-fear-related extinction. Intraparietal-sulcus-guided top-down attentional control appears more strongly related to prefrontal activity in participants without renewal, and thus may have a role in their default processing mode of focusing on the stimulus and disregarding the context.

AB  - Chemical communication is critical in establishing angiosperm-pollinator mutualisms. However, our understanding of how chemical communication shapes coevolution remains limited. Here, we integrated information theory to model three coevolutionary scenarios (I-III), where the pollinator fitness is always optimized by the highest certainty of chemical information provided by plants, but plant fitness is determined by (I) the certainty of chemical information attracting pollinators, (II) the uncertainty of chemical information confusing antagonists, or (III) both aspects. We found that the statistical properties of empirical plant volatiles from 45 pairs of fig-pollinator mutualisms were best explained by the selection from both pollinators and antagonists (scenario III). Under this scenario, plant-pollinator mutualisms evolve to be specialized and as few as two volatile chemicals could supply sufficient information for pollinators' host identification. Our study provides new insights into plant-pollinator coevolution and will facilitate further studies on the evolution and diversification in specialized plant-pollinator-herbivore systems.

AB  - Simple Summary The hypothalamus plays an important role in goat reproduction. In this research, RNA sequencing technology was used to detect and identify microRNAs (miRNAs) related to goat fertility in the goat hypothalamus. The results showed that several key miRNAs may affect the expression of their target genes in different ways with the high-fecundity goats during the luteal phase (LP-HF) vs. low-fecundity goats during the luteal phase (LP-LF), thereby affecting the key reproductive processes. These results reveal the mechanism on the reproductive performance of different litter sizes during the luteal phase of goats, from the perspective of the hypothalamus. A normal estrus cycle is essential for the breeding of goats, and the luteal phase accounts for most of the estrus cycle. The corpus luteum (CL) formed during the luteal phase is a transient endocrine gland that is crucial for the reproductive cycle and pregnancy maintenance, and is controlled by many regulatory factors. However, the molecular mechanism of the hypothalamus effect on the reproductive performance of different litter sizes during the luteal phase of goats has not been elucidated. In this study, RNA-sequencing was used to analyze the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of the hypothalamic tissues with the high-fecundity goats during the luteal phase (LP-HF) and low-fecundity goats during the luteal phase (LP-LF). The RNA-seq results found that there were 1963 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (890 up-regulated and 1073 down-regulated). The miRNA-seq identified 57 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), including 11 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated, of which 199 DEGs were predicted to be potential target genes of DEMs. Meanwhile, the functional enrichment analysis identified several mRNA-miRNA pairs involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic activity, such as the common target gene MEA1 of novel-miR-972, novel-miR-125 and novel-miR-403, which can play a certain role as a related gene of the reproductive development in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and its regulated network, by regulating the androgen secretion. While another target gene ADIPOR2 of the novel-miR-403, is distributed in the hypothalamus and affects the reproductive system through a central role on the HPG axis and a peripheral role in the gonadal tissue. An annotation analysis of the DE miRNA-mRNA pairs identified targets related to biological processes, such as anion binding (GO:0043168) and small molecule binding (GO: 0036094). Subsequently, the KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were performed to analyze the miRNA-mRNA pairs with negatively correlated miRNAs. We found that the GnRH signaling pathway (ko04912), the estrogen signaling pathway (ko04915), the Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (ko04666), and the IL-17 signaling pathway (ko04657), etc., were directly and indirectly associated with the reproductive process. These targeting interactions may be closely related to the reproductive performance of goats. The results of this study provide a reference for further research on the molecular regulation mechanism for the high fertility in goats.

AB  - Fields studying animal movement are data-starved due to large monetary and time costs of data collection, and, moreover, not all quantities of interest can be measured. Despite limited data, diverse models have been developed to study animal movement. Many of these models are based on random walks that use Gaussian noise. Examinations of real movement data show that the assumptions made in these models are not always valid on all spatial and time scales, and these shortcomings suggest that new models may be needed. We provide methods for developing and training more realistic models, specifically agent-based models of animal movement, by taking a data-driven approach. We took an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach that allowed us to develop a model that best reproduced the movement patterns we observed in a real dataset of animal locations. In our EDA, we examined distributions of positions, calculated the autocorrelation of the movement data, used Fourier analysis, calculated mean-squared displacements, and tested for correlations. We introduce the fused-lasso regression-analysis method for identifying large and sudden changes in position through a non-parametric fit that is sensitive to discontinuities. We introduce the copula and kernel-density estimates as methods for approximating coordinate-system-independent movement correlations from the marginal location differences represented in our data set; use of the copula allows us to create correlated, non-Gaussian noise. With the insights gained from our EDA, we created a Langevin model that describes the movements of an individual animal, features non-Gaussian noise and incorporates multiple movement patterns. We extended this model to an agent-based model that describes the movements of several groups of deer. We compared our Langevin model to three models built on different assumptions that result in substantial differences in the area covered by an animal. Using our agent-based model, we simulated three groups of deer with parameters sampled from our data to illustrate the amount of area covered by deer in our model and the ability of groups to overlap in space. This overlapping behavior is an important feature of models of processes driven by interactions between animals, such as infectious diseases; our model could be useful for studying the spread of infectious diseases in animal populations, such as chronic wasting disease. While we have applied our data-driven methods to animal movement, these methods are widely applicable to developing and training models using a wide range of data sources.

AB  - The present study was carried out to study the morphology of the goat's soft palate and palatine tonsil by gross anatomy, morphometry, light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Twelve heads of normal adult (18-24 months) apparently healthy goats of both sexes were collected from local commercial slaughterhouses in Qena Governorate, Egypt. The oral cavity was dissected, and samples were collected for both light and SEM. The soft palate of the goat formed the caudal continuation of the hard palate. It was relatively short, it extended from the level of the caudal border of the last upper molar tooth to terminate caudally against the base of the epiglottis. The oral mucous membrane of the soft palate was covered by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The lamina propria and submucosa contained connective tissue fibers, diffuse and nodular lymphatic tissue, striated muscle fibers, and a large number of mucous and serous palatine glands. By SEM, the ventral surface had several rounded openings occupied by flower-like structures. These openings represented the entrances to the palatine glands. The palatine tonsil was large and protruded from a fossa in the lateral wall of the oropharynx. It had 2-3 elongated irregular openings that lead to the underlying crypts. These crypts were well-developed and lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The epithelium of the tonsillar crypts directly covered lymphoid tissue and was infiltrated by lymphocytes. Tonsillar glands of pure mucous type were demonstrated. In conclusion, the study provides the basic morphological features of soft palate, as well as the palatine tonsil of the goat by gross observation, light and SEM. The palatine tonsils of goat were well-developed with extensive crypt system, suggesting their essential role in the immunological response against antigens that enter through the oral cavity. The current findings may be useful to understand the role of the palatine tonsil in immunity and disease pathogenesis.

AB  - The rising global energy demand, alongside concerns regarding environmental deterioration due to the use of fossil fuels, has spurred extensive investigation into renewable energy alternatives. Biomass-derived biodiesel, especially from lesser-known oil sources, emerges as a promising option. This research focuses on analyzing the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) derived from Kariya (Hildegardia barteri (Mast.) Kosterm) seed oil through basic catalytic transesterification using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis, assessing its potential as a biodiesel feedstock. Oil extraction from Kariya seeds was carried out using three solvents (n-hexane, ethanol, and a 1:1 blend of hexane and ethanol), followed by transesterification with methanol. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-FID analyses were utilized to identify and quantify FAMEs in the resulting biodiesel. The results revealed various FAMEs, including methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate, and methyl linolenate. Significant differences in FAME composition were observed among the samples, with hexane-ethanol Kariya oil biodiesel (HE-KOB) showing the highest FAME content (76.1%). This combination of solvents exhibited synergistic effects on the composition of HE-KOB, suggesting potential optimization strategies for biodiesel production. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provided additional insights into the molecular composition of the biodiesel samples, confirming their biodiesel nature through the identified functional groups such as methyl, methylene, hydrocarbon, ester, aldehyde, and alkene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for thermal decomposition also gave an insight into FAME composition and its contribution to the degree of conversion of biodiesel to energy. These findings highlight the feasibility of utilizing Kariya seed oil as a biodiesel feedstock, emphasizing the importance of solvent selection and transesterification conditions in optimizing FAME yield and composition. This research contributes to the exploration of underutilized oil sources for sustainable biodiesel production, aligning with the global shift towards cleaner and renewable energy sources.

AB  - Soil moisture is a critical environmental factor for the survival and behavior of subterranean termites (family Rhinotermitidae). The invasive Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, and the native eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), co-occur in the southeastern United States, while R. flavipes is distributed in a wider geoclimatic range. Previous studies showed that subterranean termites preferred higher soil moisture levels for tunneling and feeding; however, the impacts of constant moisture remained to be characterized to understand their moisture tolerance. In this study, we hypothesized that different soil moisture regimes can alter termite foraging and survival, and that the effects differ between the two species. The tunneling activity, survivorship, and food consumption of termites were documented for 28 days with different sand moisture conditions ranging from no moisture to full saturation (0%, 1%, 5%, 15%, 25%, and 30%). We found that there were no significant differences in the responses between C. formosanus and R. flavipes. In both species, termites did not survive or tunnel with 0% moisture. Termites performed tunneling with only 1% sand moisture, although they did not survive for 28 days. A minimal of 5% sand moisture was required for survival, and there were no significant differences in survivorship, tunneling activity, or food consumption among moisture contents of 5-30%. The results suggest that subterranean termites are resilient to moisture extremes. Colonies can tolerate low moisture conditions in their foraging environment for extended times, which may allow them to tunnel and find new moisture sources for colony survival.

AB  - Resveratrol (RES) is a class of natural polyphenolic compounds known for its strong anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties. Granulosa cells (GCs) are one of the important components of ovarian follicles and play crucial roles in follicular development of follicles in the ovary. Here, we explored the effects of RES on the proliferation and functions of yak GCs. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of RES dose and time in culture on the viability of GCs, and then the optimum treatment protocol (10 mu M RES, 36 h) was selected to analyze the effects of RES on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, lipid droplet content, ATP production, and steroidogenesis of GCs, as well as the expression of related genes. The results show that RES treatment significantly (1) increased cell viability and proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis by upregulating BCL-2 and SIRT1 genes and downregulating BAX, CASP3, P53, and KU70 genes; (2) increased the proportion of GCs in the S phase and upregulated CCND1, PCNA, CDK4, and CDK5 genes; (3) reduced ROS accumulation and MDA content and increased GSH content, as well as upregulating the relative expression levels of CAT, SOD2, and GPX1 genes; (4) decreased lipid droplet content and increased ATP production; (5) promoted progesterone (P4) secretion and the expression of P4 synthesis-related genes (StAR, HSD3B1, and CYP11A1); and (6) inhibited E2 secretion and CYP19A1 expression. These findings suggest that RES at 10 mu M increases the proliferation and antioxidant properties, inhibits apoptosis, and promotes ATP production, lipid droplet consumption, and P4 secretion of yak GCs.

AB  - Simple Summary The acorn-fed Iberian pig is known worldwide due to its unique and exclusive feeding regime for finishing, which consists exclusively of grazing acorns and grass in the dehesa agroforestry system. However, some farmers try to increase the carrying capacity of their farms using supplementary feed for grazing pig fattening. The current regulation to certificate products using this breed is based on traceability and visual observations, which can be considered subjective. Therefore, considering that background, the present study seeks to provide an analytical approach through the analysis of faecal volatilome to authenticate the acorn-fed Iberian pig diet and to discriminate the animals that receive supplementary feed during the finishing period. The acorn-fed Iberian pig is known worldwide due to the quality of the resulting products commercialized after a natural and free grazing period of fattening in the dehesa agroforestry ecosystem. The quality regulation of the pig breed reserves "acorn" denomination for only those products obtained from animals exclusively fed grazing acorns and other natural resources; however, sometimes, feed supplementation of the pig's diet is fraudulently employed to reach an earlier slaughtering weight and to increase pig stocking rate, a strategy called postre (meaning "feed supplement"). In this sense, although many studies focused on Iberian pig diet have been published, the field detection of feed use for acorn-fed pig during the last finishing stage foraging in the dehesa, a practice which clashes with the official regulation, has not been explored yet. The present study employs a volatilome analysis (gas chromatography coupled to ion mobility spectrometry) of a non-invasive biological sample (faeces) to discriminate the grazing diet of only natural resources, that acorn-fed Iberian pigs are supposed to have, from those pigs that are also supplemented with feed. The results obtained show the suitability of the methodology used and the usefulness of the information obtained from faeces samples to discriminate and detect the fraudulent use of feed for acorn-fed Iberian pig fattening: a classification success ranging between 86.4% and 100% was obtained for the two chemometric approaches evaluated. These, together with the results of discriminant models, are discussed, in addition to the importance that the methodology optimized implies for the Iberian pig sector and market, which is also introduced. This methodology could be adapted to control organic farming animals or other upstanding livestock production systems which are supposed to be fully dependent on a natural grazing diet.

AB  - Purpose This study evaluated the response of hot pepper (Capsicum annuum var. Red chili) towards cow vermicompost application under field conditions.
   Method Cow vermicompost was supplied in four levels (0, 5, 10, and 15 t ha(-1)) across the two growing seasons in 2017 and 2018.
   Results Vermicompost application significantly increased the plant height, internode distance, and number of lateral branches in both seasons. It was noticed that manuring with 15 t ha(-1) of cow vermicompost resulted with enhancedchlorophyll contents, fruit yield, and fruit number in both years. In both seasons, the highest leaf number, fruit weight, and total soluble solids are related to the third treatment (10 t ha(-1) of cow vennicompost). The results showed that 1000-seed weight and vitamin C content were affected by cow vermicompost. Data showed that manuring with vermicompost (5 t ha(-1)) caused the best quality components in 2017 and 2018.
   Conclusion the results showed that vennicompost had a significant impact on vegetative and reproductive growth and fruit quality of hot pepper.

AB  - Parasite infection poses a significant risk to goat health due to low birth weights, poor body condition, low weight gain, and difficulties in kidding. This study aims to investigate the clinico-hematology and epidemiology of parasites along with the therapeutic effect of eprinomectin in goats in south Punjab. A total of 320 goats were selected to collect 160 fecal samples and 160 skin scraping samples. For therapeutic trials, six healthy goats and six goats having parasitic infection were selected to apply eprinomectin. Blood samples were taken from both groups for serum biochemistry and complete blood count. Overall prevalence of ectoparasites was 31.8%. The Bahawalpur area has high prevalence of ectoparasite (59.3%) with a significant difference that include a higher prevalence in older goats (52%) as compared to younger goats (24.44%). In the ectoparasite, ticks are the major species that are more prevalent (20%) than Lice (8.75%) and Mites (3.12%) in goats. The prevalence of endoparasites was 56.8%. Our study also revealed that Ahmedpur area has high prevalence of endoparasite (78.1%), including a higher prevalence in older goats (64.66%) as compared to younger (26.31%). Among endoparasites, the prevalent species were Toxocara (11.25%), Stronglyus (9.37%), Emaria (17.5%), Haemonchus (6.25%), Marshliagia (1.25%), Monizia (5.0%), and Gardia (6.25%) in the Bahawalpur area. Hematological results revealed a significant (P<0.05) variation in WBC, RBC, hemoglobin and MCV between infected and healthy groups on 7(th) day, while WBC, MCV, and MCH showed a significant difference (P<0.05) on 14(th) day after the eprinomectin administration. On the 14(th) day after treatment, albumin, SGOT, total protein, and SGPT values were not significantly different (P>0.05) in both groups, which showed that eprinomectin did not cause stress or any physiological changes in goats. Therapeutic trials revealed that 3 (50%) goats were recovered on the 7(th) day, while 5 (83%) goats were completely recovered on 14(th) day. It has been demonstrated that parasitic infestation in goats is a major problem in the Bahawalpur division, and eprinomectin can reduce the the parasitic burden and improve animal health.

AB  - The conventional storage temperature of 16-18 degrees C provides optimal conditions for the preservation of boar sperm quality, which are extremely cold sensitive cells. On the other hand, however, it requires the addition of antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth. Rising numbers of antibiotic resistant bacteria call for alternatives to this conventional storing method. As potential alternative, three different bacteriocin candidates with known bacteriolytic activity against E. coli were examined on possible negative effects concerning the sperm quality and on their impact on bacterial growth of E. coli ILSH 02692 in BTS extended semen w/o antibiotics. Although the lower concentrations (0.01 and 0.25%) of all bacteriocins did not show any impact on the quality of the semen, the higher concentrations (0.5 and 1.0%) of two bacteriocins led to a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in several sperm quality characteristics. The bacteriocin 860/1c after AMS/dialysis did not affect the sperm quality in any of the tested concentrations and in all tested extenders (BTS, MIII, Androstar Premium and Androhep all w/o antibiotics) at 16 degrees C as well as at 6 degrees C. This bacteriocin reduced growth of E. coli ILSH 02692 in BTS-extended semen by 50% compared to the control w/o bacteriocin. Furthermore, a preliminary insemination trial indicated no impact of the selected bacteriocin on fertility. These promising results show that the application of bacteriocins in liquid-preserved semen is a feasible possibility in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of application of soil material from topsoil and different doses of marble sludge (MBS) and sheep manure (SM) on physicochemical and biological properties of acidic Kettara mine tailings.MethodsTwo main mixtures were prepared: M1-70:30 ratio of mine tailings (MT) to soil material from topsoil (TS) with 10% MBS; M2-60:40 ratio of MT to TS with 6% MBS. Both mixtures received SM treatment at doses ranging from 4 to 12%.ResultsThe application of TS and MBS significantly increased the pH of MT (from 2.11 to 7.54), while reducing the EC (from 7.86 mS cm-1 to 2.74 mS cm-1). The addition of the organic amendment increased the organic carbon, total nitrogen and P availability in all treatments. Data also indicated that organo-mineral amendments efficiently reduced CaCl2- exchangeable Pb, Cu (1.7-two fold), and Zn (33 fold) if compared to the untreated MT. The improvement of physicochemical properties of MT resulted in an increase in soil microbial abundance and in the activity of urease, dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, the addition of 10 and 12% of SM to M1 and M2 significantly increased seedlings' root length (2- 2.5 fold) compared to the treatments without SM. A remarkable increase was observed in Peganum harmala L. root length (60-73%) if compared to Lollium perenne.ConclusionsOverall, the treatment containing M2 and 10% of sheep manure was the most effective treatment suggesting its efficient use for the restoration of contaminated mining sites.

AB  - Organisms utilizing lower trophic levels consume nutrient-poor foods with little energy and must maximize nutrient extraction during digestion. In fishes, there is a strong inverse relationship between trophic level and intestine length and a positive relationship between body length and intestine length. Adaptation to lower trophic levels and concomitant increases in intestine length may influence either the size of the abdominal cavity region or overall body size, as the fish must accommodate longer intestines. This study evaluates these two alternative adaptive pathways in 122 North American species from the order Cypriniformes. We used traditional dissection and microcomputed tomography scans to measure intestine length and abdominal cavity volume. We used a suite of phylogenetic comparative methods to determine whether diet influenced intestine length, body size, and abdominal cavity volume. Our results show that the herbivore-detritivore trophic group has significantly longer intestines than at least one other trophic group and is evolving towards a larger optimal intestine length than all other trophic groups. Furthermore, we see a positive, significant relationship between abdominal cavity volume and body size. These results support the inverse trophic position-body length pattern seen in the group and further elucidate the evolutionary limitations based on body shape covariation in predicting diversification in freshwater fishes.

AB  - Herbivory can induce changes in flower traits influencing the community of flower-visiting insects and ultimately impacting the plant's reproductive output. Here, we investigated how leaf herbivory on sweet pepper plants, Capsicum annuum L., by Diabrotica speciosa (Germar) adults influences the community of insect floral visitors and alters plant reproduction. In an experimental field, we found that flowers of herbivore-infested plants were less visited by insects than those of uninfested plants. A similar pattern was found for the abundance of the three most common species of floral visitors in the collections, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus), Toxomerus sp.1, and Trigona spinipes (Fabricius). The insect community associated with the flowers of herbivore-infested plants was distinct, less rich, and diverse than that of uninfested plants. Leaf herbivory also impacted flower abundance that likely influenced the visual attraction of insects. The changes in flower-visiting insect community associated with herbivore-infested plants coincided with a reduced number of fruits, which were smaller and contained fewer seeds than those from uninfested plants.

AB  - Effective wildlife conservation relies on surveying species, yet traditional methods are often financially and labour-intensive. Leveraging social media posts is potentially a more efficient alternative. Here, community assemblages derived from mammal sightings in Kruger National Park, South Africa, over the same four-month period, were compared for five social media platforms: Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Flickr, and Kruger Latest Sightings (a bespoke platform). In total, 7860 unique sightings of 45 species were recorded. Latest Sightings was the most comprehensive and consistent platform (37 species, 82%), while X provided the least complete species assemblage (28 species, 62%). There were significant inter-platform differences in species community composition, but records of charismatic megafauna including lion and leopard were extremely high across platforms (37% of total sightings), highlighting user biases. Use of multi-platform data proved superior to any single platform in isolation, underscoring the need for a diversified approach. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of using social media for wildlife monitoring, emphasising the importance of understanding platform-specific user behaviours. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on iEcology and the use of social media in conservation efforts, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and provides advice for integration into ecological monitoring strategies.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is one of the essential wood oil trees in the world. C.oleifera was propagated by nurse seedling grafting. Since the scion of C.oleifera had a significant regulated effect on the properties of rootstock after grafting and impacted on the growth of the grafted seedlings, it was necessary to understand the characteristics of buds among varieties to cultivate high-quality grafted seedlings. The metabolome was thought to be a powerful tool for understanding connecting phenotype-genotype interactions, which has an important impact on plant growth and development. In this study, UPLC-MS was used to determine the metabolites of the apical buds of CL3, CL4, CL40, and CL53 spring shoots after 30 days of sprout and to measure the growth characteristics of roots and stems after grafting. Metabolomics analysis revealed 554 kinds of metabolites were significant differences among four varieties, and 29 metabolic pathways were identified to have significant changes (p< 0.05), including carboxylic acids and derivatives, fatty Acyls, organooxygen compounds, and prenol lipids metabolites. The metabolites appeared in all varieties, including phenethyl rutinoside in glycosyl compounds and hovenidulcioside A1 in terpene glycosides. Metabolite-metabolite correlations in varieties revealed more complex patterns in relation to bud and enabled the recognition of key metabolites (e.g., Glutamate, (+/-)Catechin, GA(52), ABA, and cs-Zeatin) affecting grafting and growth ability. Each variety has a unique metabolite type and correlation network relationship. Differentiated metabolites showed different growth trends for development after grafting. Many metabolites regulate the growth of scions in buds before grafting, which plays a crucial role in the growth of seedlings after grafting. It not only regulates the growth of roots but also affects the development of this stem. Finally, those results were associated with the genetic background of each cultivar, showing that metabolites could be potentially used as indicators for the genetic background, indicating that metabolites could potentially be used as indicators for seedling growth characteristics. Together, this study will enrich the theoretical basis of seedling growth and lay a foundation for further research on the molecular regulation mechanism interaction between rootstock and scion, rootstock growth, and the development of grafted seedlings after grafting.

AB  - Alterations in the microbiota composition, or ecological dysbiosis, have been implicated in the development of various diseases, including allergic diseases and asthma. Examining the relationship between microbiota alterations in the host and cough variant asthma (CVA) may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies. To elucidate the diversity and difference of microbiota across three ecological niches, we performed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on lung, ileum, and colon samples. We assessed the levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) in guinea pig bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We applied Spearman's analytical method to evaluate the correlation between microbiota and cytokines. The results demonstrated that the relative abundance, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity of the microbial composition of the lung, ileum, and colon varied considerably. The ELISA results indicated a substantial increase in the level of IL-13 and a decreasing trend in the level of IL-12 in the CVA guinea pigs. The Spearman analysis identified a correlation between Mycoplasma, Faecalibaculum, and Ruminococcus and the inflammatory factors in the CVA guinea pigs. Our guinea pig model showed that core microorganisms, such as Mycoplasma in the lung, Faecalibaculum in the ileum, and Ruminococcus in the colon, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CVA. The most conspicuous changes in the ecological niche were observed in the guinea pig ileum, followed by the lung, while relatively minor changes were observed in the colon. Notably, the microbial structure of the ileum niche approximated that of the colon niche. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that CVA development is closely related to the dysregulation of ileal, lung, and colon microbiota and the ensuing inflammatory changes in the lung.

AB  - The encroachment of agricultural landscapes on natural ecosystems poses a significant threat to native wildlife persistence. In the Boland Mountain Complex (BMC), the presence of mammals was well documented in the 20th century, but an updated account is lacking. This study relied on Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) to elucidate perceived medium- to large-sized (>300 g) mammal occurrences, distribution ranges, and relative abundance on private agricultural properties adjacent to protected areas in the BMC. In total, 30 mammal species were reported to be present, and inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolations were created for species that had more than five independent citations (n = 24), to display reported relative abundance-distributions beyond the scope of the sampled locations. Species with severely isolated relative abundance-distribution profiles (e.g. leopard, Panthera pardus, Cape clawless otter, Aonyx capensis and honey badger, Mellivora capensis), species with low overall incidence (e.g. aardwolf, Proteles cristata and Smith's red rock rabbit, Pronolagus rupestris), and non-native species with high incidences (e.g. feral dog, Canis familiaris and feral pig, Sus scrofa) were identified, and can now be prioritised further for future research and conservation efforts within the BMC region.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala azar), caused by Leishmania donovani, transmitted by Phlebotomus orientalis, is a serious systemic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality rates in Sudan and other parts of East Africa and the world. Despite progress in understanding the epidemiology of the disease in East Africa, little is known about the host preference of P. orientalis in kala azar endemic villages of Sudan, which have some of the highest VL incidence rates in the world. The present study used host choice experiments and blood-meal identification approaches to determine the host preference of P. orientalis in kala azar endemic villages in Gedarif state, eastern Sudan. In the host choice experiment, tent traps were used to compare the attractiveness of cows, donkeys, sheep and goats for host-seeking P. orientalis. In the blood-meal identification study, blood-fed P. orientalis females, captured inside houses and peri-domestic habitats, were subjected to molecular typing using cytochrome b gene (cyt b) amplification and sequence analysis. Cows and donkeys were the most attractive to blood-seeking P. orientalis, followed by goats. Similarly, the blood-meal analysis of P. orientalis showed that the vector preferentially feeds on cows, followed by donkeys, humans and goats. The human blood index of P. orientalis was 19.4% (42/216), indicating a high zoophilic habit of the vector, both inside and outside the houses. Although the order of host preference varied by location, it was clear that cows are the most preferred host of P. orientalis in the area. Results are discussed in relation to the role of domestic/livestock animals in VL zoopotentiation and zooprophylaxis. Inference is made on the potential impact of insecticide treatment of cows in control of the vector and the transmission of VL in Sudan and other parts of East Africa.

AB  - Camera-traps are valuable tools for estimating wildlife population density, and recently developed models enable density estimation without the need for individual recognition. Still, processing and analysis of camera-trap data are extremely time-consuming. While algorithms for automated species classification are becoming more common, they have only served as supporting tools, limiting their true potential in being implemented in ecological analyses without human supervision. Here, we assessed the capability of two camera-trap based models to provide robust density estimates when image classification is carried out by machine learning algorithms. We simulated density estimation with Camera-Trap Distance Sampling (CT-DS) and Random Encounter Model (REM) under different scenarios of automated image classification. We then applied the two models to obtain density estimates of three focal species (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, red fox Vulpes vulpes and Eurasian badger Meles meles) in a reserve in central Italy. Species detection and classification was carried out both by the user and machine learning algorithms (respectively, MegaDetector and Wildlife Insights), and all outputs were used to estimate density and ultimately compared. Simulation results suggested that the CT-DS model could provide robust density estimates even at poor algorithm performances (down to 50% of correctly classified images), while the REM model is more unpredictable and depends on multiple factors. Density estimates obtained from the MegaDetector output were highly consistent for both models with the manually labelled images. While Wildlife Insights' performance differed greatly between species (recall: badger = 0.15; roe deer = 0.56; fox = 0.75), CT-DS estimates did not vary significantly; on the contrary, REM systematically overestimated density, with little overlap in standard errors. We conclude that CT-DS and REM models can be robust to the loss of images when machine learning algorithms are used to identify animals, with the CT-DS being an ideal candidate for applications in a fully unsupervised framework. We propose guidelines to evaluate when and how to integrate machine learning in the analysis of camera-trap data for density estimation, further strengthening the applicability of camera-traps as a cost-effective method for density estimation in (spatially and temporally) extensive multi-species monitoring programmes.

AB  - Purpose: This research aimed at compost quality optimization through Plackett-Burman's design application. This statistical method was used to identify and evaluate key factors that impact compost quality and determine its optimal levels. Method: Eight experiments were carried out with variables such as leachate recirculation, Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, manure type, bacterial and fungi incorporation, type of plant material, and compost pile height. Results: Obtained results revealed significant influence of guinea pig manure in compost quality, improving pH and electric conductivity (dS/m) values, as well as its influence on purple corn fresh and dry weight increase. However, the use of guinea pig manure can increase arsenic, mercury, and lead compost levels, but within the range allowed by Peruvian technical standards. Leachate recirculation showed significant effect on compost humidity increase, which decreased its physical quality to not permitted values by Peruvian technical standards. In addition, leachate uses a reduced number of corn leaves, as well as its fresh and dry weight. It was possible to identify optimal conditions to maximize composting process efficiency, through Plackett-Burman's Design. Conclusion: These findings provide a solid foundation for composting practice's continuous improvement, contributing to high-quality organic fertilizer production more efficiently and sustainably. This study has the potential to guide future research and feasible applications in the agricultural field, favoring more environmentally friendly practices adoption.

AB  - When sons and daughters have different fitness costs and benefits, selection may favor deviations from an even offspring sex ratio. Most theories on sex ratio manipulation focus on maternal strategies and sex-biased maternal expenditure. Recent studies report paternal influences on both offspring sex ratio and postpartum sex-biased maternal expenditure. We used long-term data on marked kangaroos to investigate whether and how paternal mass and skeletal size, both determinants of male reproductive success, influenced (a) offspring sex in interaction with maternal mass and (b) postpartum sex-biased maternal expenditure. When mothers were light, the probability of having a son increased with paternal mass. Heavy mothers showed the opposite trend. A similar result emerged when considering paternal size instead of mass. Postpartum maternal sex-specific expenditure was independent of paternal mass or size. Studies of offspring sex manipulation or maternal expenditure would benefit from an explicit consideration of paternal traits, as paternal and maternal effects can modulate each other.

AB  - Camellia plants include more than 200 species of great diversity and immense economic, ornamental, and cultural values. We sequenced the transcriptomes of 116 Camellia plants from almost all sections of the genus Camellia. We constructed a pan-transcriptome of Camellia plants with 89 394 gene families and then resolved the phylogeny of genus Camellia based on 405 high-quality low-copy core genes. Most of the inferred relationships are well supported by multiple nuclear gene trees and morphological traits. We provide strong evidence that Camellia plants shared a recent whole genome duplication event, followed by large expansions of transcription factor families associated with stress resistance and secondary metabolism. Secondary metabolites, particularly those associated with tea quality such as catechins and caffeine, were preferentially heavily accumulated in the Camellia plants from section Thea. We thoroughly examined the expression patterns of hundreds of genes associated with tea quality, and found that some of them exhibited significantly high expression and correlations with secondary metabolite accumulations in Thea species. We also released a web-accessible database for efficient retrieval of Camellia transcriptomes. The reported transcriptome sequences and obtained novel findings will facilitate the efficient conservation and utilization of Camellia germplasm towards a breeding program for cultivated tea, camellia, and oil-tea plants.

AB  - Invasive organisms are key drivers of environmental change globally. Both native and non-native species can become pests that require management or control. Vertebrate pest animals may cause a range of economic, environmental and social impacts for which various plans are developed at a local, state and national scale to aid their management. There are multiple vertebrate pest species in Australia which vary in the type and severity of their negative effects. Prioritisation of these pests and their impacts is critical for management to be cost-effective. We accessed pest management plans (PMPs) from 66 (of 71) local government areas (LGAs) across the state of Queensland to collate a list of vertebrate pest species present in each LGA. Local government areas were then grouped into easily identifiable regions (Regional Organisation of Councils, 'ROC' regions, 10 in all) and vertebrate pest species lists were collated for each region. At regional workshops, each pest species was ranked as no, low, medium or high priority by stakeholders. Rankings were used to develop impact scores resulting in a priority list of vertebrate pest animal species at the state level. Fifty-three species were identified in individual LGA PMPs of which 25 were considered priorities at the regional level. Most species prioritised at the state level were mammals, with Wild Dogs (including Dingoes; Canis familiaris), Feral Pigs (Sus scrofa) and Feral Cats (Felis catus) being the three highest ranked. Similarities in priority species were evident across ROC regions, however, several regions prioritised pests specific to their location. The data supported a further amalgamation of the 10 ROC regions into five main groups based on the set of vertebrate pest species that were present. Prioritisation lists should be regularly updated as technologies develop, established pest animal impacts change and new species incursions occur.

AB  - It remains uncertain how different N inputs as synthetic fertilizer or manure and irrigation types affect nitrous oxide (N2O) production and effluxes in the subsurface. A field trial was carried out in 2016 to evaluate the impacts of conventional urea, animal manure, and a 50/50 mix of urea and manure on N2O production/effluxes from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field under flood or drip irrigation in northwestern China. Soil N2O concentrations were monitored at 5, 15, 30, and 60 cm depths to assess the production and diffusion rates of N2O in the soil profile. The results showed that N2O concentrations in 0-60 cm ranged between 221 and 532 nL L-1 and averaged 344 nL L-1, which was generally lower compared to other studies in the same region. Manure and flood irrigation significantly increased N2O production at 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm, respectively. That is, the effects of nitrogen management and irrigation types on the N2O production of the profile were reflected in the surface layers and subsurface layers, respectively. All N2O production occurred in the 0-15 cm layer, with the 0-5 cm depth contributing 87%-100% of the surface emissions. The response discrepancy of N2O production/diffusion to irrigation and nitrogen management in different soil depths should be fully considered in developing agricultural N2O emission reduction measures.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat's milk is a food that contains proteins of value for nutrition. The protein profile in the milk of goat breeds is different from that of cow milk, with a lower relative abundance of allergenic proteins. In addition, regardless of the breed, goat milk has beta-casein of type A2 in a more significant proportion than cow milk, which impacts different bioactive peptides hydrolyzed in the milk of the species. Of the diversity of proteins and high digestibility, goat milk will be a food of significant value for infant nutrition. The genetic polymorphisms of milk proteins play an essential role in the different degrees of allergic reactions. This work aimed to identify the proteins and peptides in the composition of goat milk and compare them to those in cow's milk. The work was performed with goats French Alpine, Nubian, and Creole breeds and Holstein Friesian milking cows at the Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Amazcala. We investigated the relative abundance of goat and cow milk protein fractions by SDS-PAGE resolution and the densitometric analysis of gels. The protein alfa-casein was (17.67 +/- 0.46) for Creole, (19.18 +/- 0.88) French Alpine, (17.35 +/- 0.49) Nubian, and (35.92 +/- 1.96) Holstein cows. The relative abundance obtained from alfa-casein was statistically different between goats and cows, and this protein was vital because it is a protein related to allergies. On the other hand, the amino acid in position 67 of the beta-casein from three goat breeds is a Proline, so it is assumed that the beta-casein variant of goat milk is an A2-type. The latter has excellent relevance for infant nutrition and differs from cow milk.

AB  - Most lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have expanded in recent years. Zonag lake, a critical habitat for Tibetan antelopes in the continuous permafrost zone, burst and overflowed after several years of expansion, resulting in a reduction of approximately 100 km(2) in the lake area. Observations have revealed new permafrost is forming on the exposed bottom, accompanied by various periglacial landscapes. The permafrost aggradation on the exposed bottom is rapid, and the permafrost base reached 4.9 m, 5.4 m, and 5.7 m in the first three years, respectively. In this study, the future changes and influencing factors of recently formed permafrost are simulated using a one-dimensional finite element model of heat flow. The simulated results indicate that the permafrost on the exposed bottom is likely to continue to develop, appearing first quick back slow trend. Besides the surface temperature, the annual amplitude is also an important factor in affecting the aggradation of permafrost. The unidirectional permafrost aggradation in the study area is different from the bidirectional permafrost aggradation on the closed taliks around the Arctic. Additionally, snow cover and vegetation are two important factors influencing the future development of permafrost on the exposed lake bottom.

AB  - Respiratory organs and cardiovascular system are interconnected and perform extremely vital functions of the organism, the main goals being performing gas exchange with the environment and emitting carbon dioxide produced in the organism into the environment. Therefore, we carried out comparative histo- and cytomorphometric evaluation of morphological structures of the heart and lungs of cattle, sheep and horses. Using complex methods of research, we determined specifics of microscopic structure and histometric parameters of parenchyma of the lungs and myocardium of the ventricles of the hearts of clinically healthy animals in species aspect - cattle, sheep and horses. The studies revealed that the histoarchitectonics of the studied animals were similar in structure, characteristic of other species of agricultural mammals, and distinct morphometric peculiarities of their histostructures. The study indicated that the respiratory zone of the lungs is most developed in horses. This parameter was lower in ruminants - cattle and sheep. Connective tissue septum of parenchyma of lungs was better expressed in cattle and sheep, and less in horses. At the same time, mean volume of lung alveoli in clinically healthy animals varied: being highest in horses - 699 +/- 106 thou mu m(3), then cattle - 337 +/- 43 thou mu m(3) and sheep - 158 +/- 37 thou mu m(3). Such variation in histometric parameters of parenchyma of the lungs in experimental animals indicates adaptive specifics of the organism of animals in terms of living conditions. Therefore, the respiratory zone was most developed in the lungs of horses, animals that experience significant physical and physiological load on corresponding organs and systems. As a result of histometric studies of myocardium, we determined patterns of sizes of thickness of its cardiomyocytes and volume of their nuclei. We determined that in myocardium of the heart ventricles, in the same microscope field of view, cardiomyocytes of varying thicknesses occur. At the same time, thickness of cardiomyocytes, their mean volume of nuclei in the ventricle myocardium were expressed the most in cattle, then in horses and sheep, and their histometric parameters in myocardium of the left ventricle of the heart in the experimental animals were higher than in the right one. Therefore, thickness of cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle in cattle equaled 14.06 +/- 0.41 mu m, and volume of nuclei of cardiomyocytes respectively 124.55 +/- 7.99 mu m(3). Similar changes in such parameters of histometry were found in sheep and horses. We attribute such varying histometric parameters of the thickness of cardiomyocytes and volume of their nuclei in myocardium of the left ventricle of the heart in experimental animals, compared with such parameters in the right ventricle, to the activities of the ventricles (the left one generally functions as a pump, right one - as a volumetric) and functional specifics of this myocardium tissue, which is capable of spontaneous rhythmic contractions, resulting in blood flow in the vessels: cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle carry greater load, promoting blood flow in vessels of greater (somatic) blood circulation, respectively cardiomyocytes of the right ventricle - less load, promoting blood flow in vessels of lesser (pulmonary) blood circulation.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning involves multiple stressors and is one of the most critical periods for piglets. It is known that pigs try to compensate stressful events by different coping strategies that might culminate in the biting of other pigs. The reduction in the number of stressors by optimizing housing conditions might be a way to reduce tail biting, one huge challenge in modern pig production. Since tail docking as a measure to avoid injuries is banned by EU regulations, this study aims to present alternatives to combat tail biting. The present work shows that the group housing of lactating sows and their litters improves pig welfare after regrouping events in terms of skin lesions. Rearing in the farrowing pen with reduced regrouping positively affected the incidence of tail lesions and losses of undocked pigs. Against expectations, free farrowing and group housing systems had no negative impact on later performance during rearing or fattening. Feasible alternatives to stressful weaning and tail-docking are needed to inhibit tail biting. Therefore, we investigated the effects of housing systems for 1106 pigs that were weaned from: (1) conventional farrowing crates (FC), (2) free-farrowing pens (FF), or (3) group housing of lactating sows (GH) into (1) conventional rearing pens (Conv) or (2) piglets remained in their farrowing pens for rearing (Reaf). Tails were docked or left undocked batchwise. All pigs were regrouped for the fattening period. Pigs were scored for skin lesions, tail lesions and losses. After weaning, Conv-GH pigs had significantly less skin lesions than Conv-FC and Conv-FF pigs. After regrouping for fattening, Reaf-GH pigs had significantly less skin lesions than Conv pigs, Reaf-FC and Reaf-FF. The frequency of tail lesions of undocked Conv pigs peaked in week 4 (66.8%). Two weeks later, Reaf undocked pigs reached their maximum (36.2%). At the end of fattening, 99.3% of undocked Conv pigs and 43.1% of undocked Reaf pigs lost parts of their tail. In conclusion, the co-mingling of piglets during suckling reduced the incidence of skin lesions. Rearing in the farrowing pen significantly reduced the incidence of tail lesions and losses for undocked pigs. No housing system negatively affected the performance.

AB  - Background and aimsPhytotoxicity following addition of hydrothermal-carbonised waste amendments (hydrochar) to soils is primarily attributed to toxic-organic compounds formed in hydrochars during hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC). However, factors influencing toxin formation in hydrochar and subsequent phytotoxicity have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of hydrochar feedstock and HTC temperature on phytotoxicity.MethodsHydrochars from sawdust, rice straw, chicken manure, paunch-hair, pig manure, biosolids and digestate, produced at three HTC temperatures (170, 200 and 260 & DEG;C), were assessed for phytotoxicity using plant-bioassays, spectroscopy and wet-chemistry.ResultsHydrochar had no effect on seed germination, but reduced (30 to 50%) or had no significant effect on wheat growth under limited nutrient supply. Importantly, under luxury-nutrient supply, hydrochars (170 and 200 & DEG;C) that reduced growth in limited-nutrient conditions had no significant effect, and only hydrochars produced at 260 & DEG;C consistently reduced (20 to 30%) growth. Elemental-analysis and fourier transform infrared spectra indicated an increase in potential toxic functional groups in hydrochars produced at high temperature (260 & DEG;C). This suggested that phytotoxicity was due to toxic organic compounds, and occurred at high temperature. Conversely, at low temperature (170 to 200 & DEG;C), apparent phytotoxicity in nutrient-limited conditions was not due to hydrochar toxins, but nutrient deficiency exacerbated by hydrochar-induced nutrient immobilisation. Feedstock-type had no significant effect on phytotoxicity.ConclusionFindings provide new understanding of hydrochar-induced phytotoxicity. Fundamentally, hydrochars (170 to 200 & DEG;C) are potential soil-amendments, but nutrition regimes to offset nutrient-drawdown need consideration. Research to mitigate toxicity in hydrochar-260 & DEG;C is warranted.

AB  - Background Alhagi maurorum Medik. (camelthorn) is a dominant desert plant indigenous in various habitats, including the Western Desert of Egypt. The plant is especially prevalent in and around economic iron ore deposits. Nutrient and heavy metal levels in A. maurorum tissues and soil samples were assessed to identify associations between heavy metal levels in plants and soil. The objective was to evaluate this species as an indicator of heavy metal pollution. Photosynthetic pigments, protein, proline, alkaloids, flavonoids, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylscavenging, reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, antioxidant enzymes, and stress-related gene expression were assessed to determine their functional roles in metal stress adaptation in ultra- and molecular structure. Additionally, the molecular genetic variation in A. maurorum samples was assessed using co-dominant sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Results A substantial difference in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants of A. maurorum was observed in samples collected from three sites. A. maurorum is suited to the climate in mineralized regions. Morphologically, the stem shows spines, narrow leaves, and a reduced shoot system. Anatomically, modifications included a cuticle coating on leaves and stems, sunken stomata, a compact epidermis, and a thick cortex. Significant anatomical-physiological differences were observed with varying heavy metal soil content, antioxidative enzyme activities increased as a tolerance strategy, and glutathione levels decreased in response to heavy metal toxicity. Heavy metal accumulation also affected the expression of stress-related genes. The highest levels of expression of GST, G6PDH, 6PGD, nitrate reductase 1, and sulfate transporter genes were found in plants collected from site A1. However, auxin-induced protein exhibited its highest expression in plants collected from A2. Six SRAP combinations yielded 25 scoreable markers with a polymorphism rate of 64%, and 5 ISSR markers produced 11 bands with a polymorphism rate of 36.36% for three A. maurorum genotypes. The ME1xEM7 primer combinations provided the most polymorphic information content and resolving power, making it the most useful primer for differentiating A. maurorum genotypes. SRAP markers exhibited a higher diversity index (0.24) than ISSR markers (0.16). Conclusions A. maurorum displayed adaptive characteristics for heavy metal sequestration from mining site soils and is proposed as a strong candidate for phytoremediation.

AB  - In social mammals, post-conflict resolution can involve the reunion of former opponents (reconciliation), spontaneous/solicited post-conflict affiliation of a third party with either opponent (triadic contacts), and affiliation between other individuals (hereafter bystanders; quadratic contacts). Quadratic contacts-possibly informing complex cognitive abilities-have been neglected in post-conflict studies. We investigated quadratic affiliation in semi-free ranging pigs Sus scrofa, at the ethical farm Parva-Domus (Cavagnolo, Italy). Kinship was known. We collected behavioral data on adult pigs (n = 104) via video recordings (43 h) followed by video analyses. Affiliative and anxiety behaviors between bystanders were collected under post-conflict (PC; following a conflict between non-bystanders) and matched-control (MC; no conflict) conditions. Quadratic affiliation was present in pigs, as bystanders affiliated more in PC than MC, and such affiliation was followed by a decrease in the anxiety behaviors of both the interacting bystanders. Thus, quadratic contacts may be partly aimed at reducing one's own anxiety (intrinsic regulation). Quadratic affiliation was highest between closely related bystanders, which suggests that such affiliation may be most effective when close kin is involved. Quadratic affiliation was lowest after reconciliation and spontaneous triadic contacts. This suggests that direct peacemaking between opponents and spontaneous triadic contacts with close kin may most likely replace quadratic affiliation. Hence, pigs can be influenced by the negative events that affect other pigs-but not themselves-and their response may be modulated by social factors. Such non-random quadratic affiliation may point toward the presence of elements of social appraisal abilities in pigs.

AB  - Research on impacts of subsistence hunting on habitat use and species communities of forest wildlife is limited. Subsistence hunting of mammals in one of the world's most biodiverse region, Manu National Park, Peru, is considered sustainable, but this is based on sparse evidence. We analyzed change in species relative abundance and functional composition of mammal communities, including non-hunted species along a hunting pressure gradient. We used camera trap data and tested for confounding effects of environmental and disturbance gradients (distances to rivers, lakes, settlements, and trails; NDVI at survey point). We found that sites with no hunting or at further distances from settlements harbor relatively more species with a larger body mass, long generation lengths, and small litters (primarily carnivores: 36% at non-hunted site vs. 13%-29% at hunted sites), indicating selective impacts of hunting pressure on mammal communities. However, all carnivore species still occurred at all sites. Species with a smaller body mass, short generation lengths, and large litters were more prevalent at the hunted sites (mostly rodents: 23%-31% at hunted sites vs. 20% at non-hunted site). Surprisingly, large herbivores appeared unaffected by hunting despite being one of the most hunted mammals in Manu (25% at non-hunted site vs. 23%-27% at hunted sites). Our findings suggest that current hunting pressure is largely sustainable with only local depletion of a few sensitive species. Habitat is more important for some species than hunting pressure (e.g., distance to lake), further emphasizing the importance of local forest management.
   Los estudios sobre el impacto de la cacer & iacute;a de subsistencia en el manejo del h & aacute;bitat y las comunidades de especies silvestres son limitados. En una de las regiones con mayor biodiversidad del mundo, el Parque Nacional del Manu (Per & uacute;), la cacer & iacute;a de subsistencia de mam & iacute;feros se considera sostenible, pero se basa en escasas evidencias. Analizamos los cambios en la abundancia relativa de especies y la composici & oacute;n funcional de las comunidades de mam & iacute;feros, incluidas las especies que no son objeto de caza, a lo largo de un gradiente de presi & oacute;n de caza. Utilizamos datos de c & aacute;maras trampa y comprobamos los efectos de confusi & oacute;n de los gradientes ambientales y de perturbaci & oacute;n (distancias a r & iacute;os, lagos, asentamientos y senderos; NDVI en el punto de estudio). Descubrimos que los lugares en los que no se caza o que se encuentran a mayor distancia de los asentamientos albergan relativamente m & aacute;s especies con mayor masa corporal, mayor duraci & oacute;n de la generaci & oacute;n y camadas peque & ntilde;as (principalmente carn & iacute;voros: 36% en los lugares en los que no se caza frente a 13%-29% en los lugares en los que se caza), lo que indica impactos selectivos de la presi & oacute;n de la caza sobre las comunidades de mam & iacute;feros. Sin embargo, todas las especies de carn & iacute;voros segu & iacute;an presentes en todos los lugares. Las especies con menor masa corporal, generaciones cortas y camadas numerosas fueron m & aacute;s frecuentes en los lugares de caza (sobre todo roedores: 23%-31% en los lugares de caza frente al 20% en los no cazados). Sorprendentemente, los herb & iacute;voros grandes no parecieron afectados por la caza a pesar de ser uno de los mam & iacute;feros m & aacute;s cazados en Manu (25% en el lugar libre de caza frente a 23%-27% en los lugares cazados). Nuestros resultados sugieren que la presi & oacute;n de caza actual es en gran medida sostenible, con un reducido descenso local de algunas especies vulnerables. El h & aacute;bitat es m & aacute;s importante para algunas especies que la presi & oacute;n de caza (por ejemplo, la distancia a un lago), lo que subraya a & uacute;n m & aacute;s la importancia de la gesti & oacute;n forestal local.

AB  - Precisely timed behavior and accurate time perception plays a critical role in our everyday lives, as our wellbeing and even survival can depend on well-timed decisions. Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modeling, we found that human subjects' beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in the active inference framework. We discuss potential key applications of the presented approach to the fields of cognitive phenotyping and computational psychiatry.

AB  - Copy number variations (CNV) contribute significantly to genetic variations. Numerous studies have shown that CNV affects phenotypic traits in livestock. The SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2) is a leading candidate gene in reproduction and has a crucial effect on litter size. Additionally, SMAD2 is also required for male reproduction and influences male germ cell development. However, there are no reports on investigating the effect of CNVs in the SMAD2 gene on reproductive traits in goat. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore associations between CNV of the SMAD2 gene and litter size and semen quality in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats. In this study, two CNVs within the SMAD2 were identified in 352 SBWC goats (50 males and 302 females). The association analysis revealed that only CNV2 was significantly associated with female goat first-born litter size (P = 3.59 x 10-4), male semen concen-tration (P < 0.01), ejaculation volume, live sperm count, and sperm deformity rate (P < 0.05). In terms of phenotypic performance, the individuals with loss genotypes outperformed those with other genotypes. CNV1 and CNV2 genotype combinations containing their dominant genotypes were also associated with goat litter size (P = 1.7 x 10-5), but no differences in semen quality were found. In summary, CNV2 of the SMAD2 gene is useful for molecular marker-assisted selection breeding, as it is associated with essential goat reproductive traits.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aiming to reveal the humification process of organic waste and its contribution to the heavy metal behaviour affected by earthworm activity, it was studied about the variation of humic acid (HA) and heavy metal behaviour during vermicomposting of the mixed pig manure and C-13-labelled rice straw. The results showed that earthworms could well adapt to the culturing environment and feed organic matter for its growth and reproduction, the vermicomposting process increased the content of humic substances (HS), HA, and fulvic acid (FA) in substrate residues, but led to less transformation of HA into FA. The elemental, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis indicated that vermicomposting led to more aromatic structures and much higher humification degree in HA, whereas less protein, FA-like substances and plastein in HA. Vermicomposting could enhance the total Cu content and decrease Cu/Zn bioavailability in the substrate residues, and vermicomposting especially can help stabilize Cu in the substrate residues by forming more complexed HA-Cu.

AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of experimental intraperitoneal infection with haemotropic Mycoplasma ovis (0.5 mL of blood containing 80% parasitaemia) on selected serum biomarkers and cellular pathology in mice. After infection, M. ovis cells appeared in the blood films within one week. A dose-dependent peak of parasitemia was observed during the 3(rd)-week post-infection (pi), with a significant decrease in mean PCV between treatment versus control group at week 3 (t (14) = -3.693, P < 0.02), week 5 (t (14) = -2.096, P = 0.055), and week 7 (t (14) = -4.329, P = 0.001). There was a significantly (t (8) = -2.330, P = 0.048) lower serum oestrogen in treatment (10.38 +/- 5.07) than control (17.43 +/- 4.48), while serum progesterone was significantly (t (8) = 5.415, P = 0.001) increased in treatment (27.37 +/- 2.17) than control (15.92 +/- 4.20). Serum haptoglobin was significantly (t (8) = 8.525, P < 0.01) lower in treatment (8.72 +/- 1.49) than control (18.16 +/- 1.98) while the SAA was significantly (t (8) = 3.362, P = 0.01) higher in treatment (16.79 +/- 2.71) than control (11.59 +/- 2.15). Prominent lesions observed in the ovary include degeneration, necrosis, vacuolation, and hypertrophy of the lutein cells in corpora lutea. In the lymph nodes, diffused cellular hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue in the cortex. In the liver, degeneration and necrosis accompanied by leucocytic cellular infiltration and Kupffer cell proliferation within the sinusoids. There were diffused leucocytic infiltrations and proliferative lesions in the glomerulus of the kidneys. The disturbance in progesterone and ovarian pathology highlights the potential role of haemotropic M. ovis in reproductive disorders. The observed changes in biomarkers and cellular reactions following M. ovis infection in the mouse may be further advanced in sheep and goats.

AB  - With recent advances, nuclear genome data for phylogenomic analyses can now be sequenced from minuscule quantities of DNA(1) and from specimens that are more than a million years old.(2) DNA analysis from hair is a well-established approach(3) widely used in forensic science(4) and wildlife conservation.(5) Hair samples can be effectively decontaminated(6) and can be used to identify the mammalian species from which the hair was shed.(7)(,)(8) We aimed to use advances optimized for degraded DNA to systematically identify dietary prey species from hair compacted in the teeth of two Tsavo lions that lived during the 1890s in Kenya (see description of samples in the STAR Methods and Patterson(9) and Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske(10) for background on the Tsavo "man-eaters"). Analysis of hair DNA identified giraffe, human, oryx, waterbuck, wildebeest, and zebra as prey and also identified hair that originated from lion. DNA preservation allowed for analyses of complete mitogenome profiles of zebra, giraffe, and lion. Giraffe mitogenomes are phylogeographically partitioned, and we found that the lions ate at least two individuals that belong to a subspecies of Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi tippelskirchi) typically found in southeast Kenya. The lion mitogenome from a hair sample was identical to the Tsavo lion endogenous mitogenome and most closely matched other East African lions from Kenya and Tanzania. Our approach enables a better understanding of the hunting behaviors, diets, and ecology of historical individuals, populations, and species and holds promise for extinct populations and species.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the activity of the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) in resistance to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behaviours. Rats were divided into resistant, PTSD(-), and susceptible, PTSD(+) groups based on the time spent in the central area in an open field test and freezing duration during exposure to an aversive context one week after stress experience (electric foot shock). The PTSD(-) rats, compared to the PTSD(+) group, had an increased concentration of corticosterone in plasma and changes in the activity of the dHIP, specifically, increased c-Fos expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) and increased Neuroligin-2 (marker of GABAergic neurotransmission) expression in the DG and CA3 area of the dHIP. Moreover, in the hippocampus, the PTSD(-) group showed decreased mRNA expression for corticotropin-releasing factor receptors type 1 and 2, increased mRNA expression for orexin receptor type 1, and decreased miR-9 and miR-34c levels compared with the PTSD(+) group. This study may suggest that the increase in GABA signalling in the hippo -campus attenuates the activity of the CRF system and enhances the function of the orexin system. Moreover, decreased expression of miR-34c and miR-9 could facilitate fear extinction and diminishes the anxiety response. These effects may lead to an anxiolytic-like effect and improve resistance to developing PTSD-like behaviours.

AB  - Understanding how variation in vital rates interact to shape the trajectories of populations has long been understood to be a critical component of informed management and restoration efforts. However, an expanding body of work suggests that the expectations for population dynamics of ungulates may not be applicable to small, declining, or threatened populations. Populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) suffered declines at the turn of the 20th century, and restoration efforts have been mixed such that many populations remain small and isolated. Here, we utilized survey data collected from 1983 to 2018 from 17 populations of bighorn sheep in Montana and Wyoming to estimate the parameters of a stage-specific population model that we used to (1) characterize the spatial and temporal variation in key vital rates including whether populations were stable, increasing, or declining; (2) estimate the contributions of vital rates to variation in population growth rates; and (3) evaluate potential sources of variation in lamb survival. We found substantial variation in all vital rates both among years and populations, strong evidence for an overall decline in nine of the 17 populations, and clear evidence for multiple combinations of vital rates that resulted in positive population trajectories. The contribution of ewe survival and lamb survival to the total variation in population growth rates varied among populations; however, declines in ewe survival dominated transitions of population trajectories from stable or increasing to declining, whereas reversals of declining population trajectories were dominated by improved lamb survival. We found strong evidence for a diverse set of associations between lamb survival and environmental covariates related to growing season and winter severity. The estimated relationships predict that environmental drivers can cause important changes in lamb survival and provide suggestive evidence that the presence of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is not sufficient to prevent population growth. Although our work demonstrates that the trajectories of these populations of bighorn sheep are driven by a variety of processes, the diversity of relationships between vital rates and population growth rates also suggests that there are multiple pathways to manage for population recovery.

AB  - Simple Summary The New Zealand dairy sheep industry is relatively new, and more studies are needed to support New Zealand dairy sheep farms for more efficient production. The objective of the present study was to model the lactation curves of dairy sheep from a New Zealand commercial flock, providing information on the lactation yields of milk, fat, protein, and lactose. The factors affecting the lactation yields and lactation persistency of dairy sheep were described. The low production per ewe and the large variation between animals reported in the present study indicate that there is room for improvement in lactation yields and in lactation persistency in dairy sheep in New Zealand, and this could be achieved through the improvement of farming systems and through the building of a national genetic improvement programme targeted at dairy sheep. Lactation curves were modelled for dairy sheep in a New Zealand flock, providing information on the lactation yields of milk, fat, protein, and lactose, corrected for 130 days of milking. From 169 ewes, a total of 622 test-day records were obtained during the milk production season of 2021-2022 (from October to January). The flock produced an average of 86.1 kg of milk, 5.1 kg of fat, 4.5 kg of protein, and 4.1 kg of lactose, and moderate to large coefficients of variation were observed (27-31%) for these traits. The lactation persistency of milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields ranged from 52.3 to 72.7%. Analyses of variance for total yield and persistency were performed with an animal model that included the fixed effects of age (parity number), litter size, coat colour, and milking frequency (days in twice-a-day milking) and random residuals. Age and milking frequency were the only factors that significantly affected the yields of milk, fat, protein, and lactose. Age significantly affected the lactation persistency of milk and lactose yields, whereas litter size affected the persistency of protein, and milking frequency affected the persistency of fat. This study on this single flock provides valuable experience for a larger-scale animal breeding programme in New Zealand.

AB  - Simple Summary As they are the primary meat goats of Hainan, how to safely and stably transport Hainan black goats through the perinatal period has become one of the major issues. Likewise, anthocyanin-rich Dioscorea alata L. is grown to some extent in Hainan but is wasted in great quantities. The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of Dioscorea alata L. anthocyanins (DAC) on the antioxidant capacity of perinatal Hainan black goats, as well as the possible mechanism on the effect of prior protection, thereby enhancing the reproductive ability of goats and developing characteristic forage resources. Our results indicated feeding a diet in which Dioscorea alata L. powder replaces 30% of corn can increase the antioxidant capacity of perinatal female goats and newborn kids. Furthermore, under H2O2 stress, the use of DAC to treat goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) may serve an effective pre-protective function. This will provide data to support the protection of perinatal black goat females and the development of specific food resources. (1) Background: The mammary glands of the perinatal goats are susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative injury. Although Dioscorea alata L. is rich in anthocyanins with high safety and excellent free-radical-scavenging ability, the effect and mechanism of Dioscorea alata L. anthocyanins (DAC) on the antioxidant capacity of the black Hainan goat has been the subject of few studies to date; (2) Methods: For this reason, feeding experiments were performed by feeding experimental diets, and the pre-protective capacity of DAC on goat mammary epithelial cells was explored on the basis of the established model of H2O2 injury; (3) Results: As well as altering rumen fermentation parameters in perinatal female goats, dietary challenge also improves antioxidant capacity in their blood and milk. thereby enhancing children's antioxidant capacity and increasing their resistance to oxidative stress. However, we also found that DAC pretreatment was capable of activating both Nrf2 and MAPK/JNK pathways, which results in enhanced antioxidase activity and elimination of ROS; (4) Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that DAC may have a pre-protective role on perinatal Hainan black goats through the regulation of Nrf2 and MAPK/JNK pathways in GMEC.

AB  - Modern livestock farming systems face the challenge of meeting the growing demand for dairy and meat products while ensuring the well-being of animals. Body Condition Scoring serves as a vital process for assessing the body reserves in animals, impacting their health, welfare, and productivity. However, traditional body condition score (BCS) evaluation methods via observation and palpation of specific anatomical regions are laborintensive and subjective, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this issue, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) techniques, particularly those involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI), have emerged as promising solutions. In this work, we explore the use of AI, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the assessment of BCS in goats utilizing imagery data. Our model was trained on 5000 images illustrating the dorsal view of the backside of goats achieving an overall accuracy of 97.94 % which was the highest compared to other popular deep learning architectures from literature (e.g. VGG16, ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet, GoogleNet). The proposed custom CNN model for goat-specific BCS estimation overcomes the limitations of manual sketching, providing automatic region identification for BCS assessment. Moreover, it is a lightweight model specifically designed for seamless integration with IoT devices, allowing for efficient onboard processing via cameras. The model's pose-independent nature and adaptability to environmental constraints make it a valuable tool for efficient and sustainable goat farming. This research advances the application of AI as a precision livestock farming tool, contributing to the reinforcement of the animal welfare and productivity, and supporting evidence-based decision-making processes to increase farms' resilience.

AB  - Livestock manure and digestate (biogas slurry [BS] and biogas residue [BR]) contain bacteria that can potentially destroy the environment microecology and affect human health. This is a problem in China since it is a big producer of livestock and poultry. Thus, herein we have analyzed the bacterial content of both manure and digestate in 18 pig farms located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region. Specifically, we show that mid-temperature anaerobic fermentation affects both bacterial colony structure of swine manure (SM) and the relative abundance of bacteria and human pathogens. Indeed, the bacterial composition of SM changed after manure was fermented into BR and BS. These changes were dependent on bacterial adaptability; although some bacteria were reduced after fermentation, we observed an increase in Novosphingobium, Acidovorax, Longilinea, and Mycobacterium. The first three can potentially degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other harmful substances and may have a beneficial effect on the control of soil environmental pollution. However, the increased abundance of Mycobacterium poses a greater threat to human health. Thus, the transition from SM to digestate in the current condition for mid-temperature anaerobic fermentation needs to be optimized to reduce the entry of potential human pathogens in the soil after anaerobic fermentation.

AB  - Deepfake technology utilizes deep learning (DL)-based face manipulation techniques to seamlessly replace faces in videos, creating highly realistic but artificially generated content. Although this technology has beneficial applications in media and entertainment, misuse of its capabilities may lead to serious risks, including identity theft, cyberbullying, and false information. The integration of DL with visual cognition has resulted in important technological improvements, particularly in addressing privacy risks caused by artificially generated "deepfake" images on digital media platforms. In this study, we propose an efficient and lightweight method for detecting deepfake images and videos, making it suitable for devices with limited computational resources. In order to reduce the computational burden usually associated with DL models, our method integrates machine learning classifiers in combination with keyframing approaches and texture analysis. Moreover, the features extracted with a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), local binary pattern (LBP), and KAZE bands were integrated to evaluate using random forest, extreme gradient boosting, extra trees, and support vector classifier algorithms. Our findings show a feature-level fusion of HOG, LBP, and KAZE features improves accuracy to 92% and 96% on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF(v2), respectively.

AB  - Improving soil fertility using crop residues is essential for circular agriculture in arid agroecosystems such as oases. This study aimed to evaluate effects of composts based on palm leaves on nitrogen (N) mineralization, soil properties, silage corn yield, and nutrient uptake in oasis agroecosystems. A 2-year field study was performed to compare impacts of two composts, one based on dry palms and rock phosphate (C1, C:N > 30) applied at 25 t ha(-1), and the other based on dry palms, rock phosphate, and sheep manure (C2, C:N = 17) applied at three rates (10, 25, and 40 t ha(-1)). The fifth treatment included application of only mineral N fertilizer (MNF). The sixth treatment received no fertilizer (control). The compost-amended plots had significantly higher organic matter, total N, and available phosphorus (P) and potassium contents in the soil after silage corn harvest in both seasons than MNF and control plots did. Applying compost C2 resulted in net N mineralization in both seasons, while applying compost C1 resulted in N immobilization in the second season. Mean dry biomass yield was 21.6 and 21.0 t ha(-1) with MNF and 40 t ha(-1) of C2 in the first year, respectively, and 21.3 and 19.1 t ha(-1) in the second season, respectively. Increasing the compost application rate significantly increased yields in both seasons. Applying either compost resulted in higher P uptake at silage corn harvest than applying MNF. Recycling date palm residues as compost improves soil fertility and forage production, which promotes sustainable farming systems in arid regions.

AB  - Brachytrupes membranaceus (Drury) is one of the edible crickets consumed in Nigeria as a source of nutrient proteins by majorly children, specifically during the wet seasons of the year. This study was conducted to compare the nutrient content of cricket and other animal protein sources. Majority of Nigerians are in dire need of alternative food sources with high protein contents other than the most commonly used; beef, goat meat, chicken, and fish which cannot be afforded by the majority of low-income earners. There is a lack of information on the nutrient composition of edible insects with particular reference to crickets in Nigeria. Nutrient composition (moisture content, ash content, fat, crude fibre, crude protein, and carbohydrate) of cricket, fish, egg, goat meat, and beef was therefore evaluated in the Department of Physical and Applied Chemistry, University of Calabar, Nigeria. Moisture content was determined by percentage moisture using the oven drying method as described by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Fat content was determined using the procedure of AOAC using n-hexane as solvent. Crude fibre was determined by sequential hot digestion of defatted sample with dilute acid and alkaline solutions. Crude protein content was evaluated using the macro Kjeldahl method. Carbohydrate was determined by differential calculation which involves carbohydrates, moisture content, protein and crude ash. The result showed that cricket has low amount of ash, high amount of crude fibre, low carbohydrate compared with other sources. However, cricket and fish recorded higher amount of protein compared with other nutrient sources. Although fish was the most expensive food source that could easily be afforded by the upper class. In conclusion, edible insects which have little or no value in our daily diet are strongly recommended for consumption due to their protein content and cost, which is significantly lower than other protein sources.

AB  - Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding protein that contributes to a wide variety of biological processes and diseases. HuR has been demonstrated to regulate muscle growth and development, but its regulatory mechanisms are not well understood, especially in goats. In this study, we found that HuR was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle of goats, and its expression levels changed during longissimus dorsi muscle development in goats. The effects of HuR on goat skeletal muscle development were explored using skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) as a model. The overexpression of HuR accelerated the expression of myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), Myogenin (MyoG), myosin heavy chain (MyHC), and the formation of myotubes, while the knockdown of HuR showed opposite effects in MuSCs. In addition, the inhibition of HuR expression significantly reduced the mRNA stability of MyoD and MyoG. To determine the downstream genes affected by HuR at the differentiation stage, we conducted RNA-Seq using MuSCs treated with small interfering RNA, targeting HuR. The RNA-Seq screened 31 upregulated and 113 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in which 11 DEGs related to muscle differentiation were screened for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) detection. Compared to the control group, the expression of three DEGs (Myomaker, CHRNA1, and CAPN6) was significantly reduced in the siRNA-HuR group (p < 0.01). In this mechanism, HuR bound to Myomaker and increased the mRNA stability of Myomaker. It then positively regulated the expression of Myomaker. Moreover, the rescue experiments indicated that the overexpression of HuR may reverse the inhibitory impact of Myomaker on myoblast differentiation. Together, our findings reveal a novel role for HuR in promoting muscle differentiation in goats by increasing the stability of Myomaker mRNA.

AB  - Termite hindguts are inhabited by symbionts that help with numerous processes, but changes in the gut microbiome due to season can potentially impact the physiology of termites. This study investigated the impact of seasonal changes on the composition of bacteria and protozoa in the termite gut. Termites were obtained monthly from May to October 2020 at a location in the central United States that typically experiences seasonal air temperatures ranging from < 0 to > 30(degrees)C. The guts of 10 termites per biological replication were dissected and frozen within 1 day after collections. DNA was extracted from the frozen gut tissues and used for termite 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene analysis and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence surveys. Phylogenetic analysis of termite 16S rRNA gene sequences verified that the same colony was sampled across all time points. On processing bacterial 16S sequences, we observed alpha (observed features, Pielou's evenness, and Shannon diversity) and beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac, Bray-Curtis, and Jaccard) metrics to vary significantly across months. Based on the analysis of the composition of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOM-BC) at the genus level, we found several significant bacterial taxa over collection months. In addition, Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that 41 bacterial taxa were significantly correlated (positively and negatively) with average soil temperature. These results from a single termite colony suggest termite microbial communities go through seasonal changes in relative abundance related to temperature, although other seasonal effects cannot be excluded. Further investigations are required to conclusively define the consistency of microbial variation among different colonies with season.

AB  - Simple Summary Purple Neem foliage has been mostly found in Thailand. This plant contains anthocyanins, which may be useful to ruminants. Therefore, as a result, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect Purple Neem foliage as a feed supplement on nutrient apparent digestibility, nitrogen utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidants and meat quality in goats. We observed that giving Purple Neem foliage to goats improved feed intake, nutrient digestion, nitrogen utilization, growth performance, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidant, meat quality and fatty acid profile in meat goat by increasing polyunsaturated fatty acid and antioxidant gene expression in meat goat by improve glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). As a results, Purple Neem foliage as a ruminant feed supplementation may become a viable alternative feed addition in the future. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of Purple Neem foliage as a feed supplement on nutrient apparent digestibility, nitrogen utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidants, meat quality and fatty acid profile of goats. Eighteen Boer male goats (approximately 20 +/- 2 kg body weight; mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) were randomly allocated into three treatments. All goats were fed a 60 d daily feeding with three treatments: (1) control, (2) 3% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3% sunflower oil (SFO) in concentrate, and (3) 6% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3% sunflower oil (SFO) in concentrate. The findings indicate that goat feed containing 6% PNF + 3% SFO in concentrate increased feed consumption, nutrient intake, nutrient apparent digestibility and nitrogen utilization compared to the goat feed at 3% PNF + 3% SFO and the control group. The feeding of goats with 6% PNF + 3% SFO in concentrate resulted in high ammonia nitrogen, BUN, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and the total VFA levels were increased at 2 and 4 h after feeding (p < 0.01). The individual microbial population with 6% PNF + 3% SFO had higher (p < 0.01) total bacteria, higher Butyrivibrio fibrisolven, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefacises, and Streptococcus bovis, decreased protozoa and methanogen levels at 2 and 4 h after feeding. The antioxidant in plasma indices varied, with 6% PNF + 3% SFO having higher total antioxidant (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and catalase (CAT) antioxidant activity and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma at 2 and 4 h after feeding. Additionally, goat fed 6% PNF + 3% SFO can improve meat quality by lowering drip loss, cooking loss, shear force, and saturated fatty acid as well as increase the fatty acid profile (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in goat meat. Our findings suggest that Purple Neem foliage might be an excellent alternative additive for goat feed.

AB  - A scientific experiment for assessing the effect of added milk thistle extract (Silybum marianum Gaertn) on some biochemical parameters in the blood of fattening pigs with average live weight 39.813 kg - 39.827 kg was carried out. The animals are divided into two groups, each with fifteen pigs. The feeding of the experimental groups was done with feed with an equalized component composition, to the ration of the second group (experimental) a milk thistle extract was added in a dose of 10 g/day per animal. The additive in the combined feed of pigs during the first fattening subperiod has a positive effect on the health of the animals, expressed by changes in some basic biochemical parameters of the blood, good weight development and feed utilization. The inclusion of 10 g/day per animal of milk thistle extract in the compound feed of fattening pigs significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the average daily gain.

AB  - Simple Summary Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been extensively used for estimation of genetic diversity in wild vertebrate populations on account of their exceptionally high polymorphism and key role in pathogen resistance. The complexity of the MHC region varies greatly, even between closely related species, and consequently influences the choice of genotyping strategy. Here, we compared and evaluated MHC genotyping in a single-locus species, the roe deer, and red deer, a species with multiple loci, by utilisation of molecular cloning and two high-throughput sequencing platforms (Illumina and Ion Torrent). For high-throughput data processing, we applied a web version of the Amplicon Sequencing Analysis Tools that analyses the first 5000 reads per sample as well as its locally installed script that analyses a total number of reads per sample, up to a maximum of 200,000. We observed genotype discrepancies only in red deer, with Illumina sequencing scoring the maximum number of detected alleles, regardless of the number of reads used for data analysis. This study facilitates the adoption of an optimal strategy for MHC genotyping in wild mammals that does not include complex bioinformatic analyses. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are widely recognised as valuable markers for wildlife genetic studies given their extreme polymorphism and functional importance in fitness-related traits. Newly developed genotyping methods, which rely on the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), are gradually replacing traditional cloning and Sanger sequencing methods in MHC genotyping studies. Allele calling in NGS methods remains challenging due to extreme polymorphism and locus multiplication in the MHC coupled with allele amplification bias and the generation of artificial sequences. In this study, we compared the performance of molecular cloning with Illumina and Ion Torrent NGS sequencing in MHC-DRB genotyping of single-locus species (roe deer) and species with multiple DRB loci (red deer) in an attempt to adopt a reliable and straightforward method that does not require complex bioinformatic analyses. Our results show that all methods work similarly well in roe deer, but we demonstrate non-consistency in results across methods in red deer. With Illumina sequencing, we detected a maximum number of alleles in 10 red deer individuals (42), while other methods were somewhat less accurate as they scored 69-81% of alleles detected with Illumina sequencing.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is a highly significant agricultural pest that poses a threat to crop production worldwide. It is polyphagous, has a strong migratory ability, and is difficult to control, which makes it a threat not only to crops but also to woody plants. However, research on its adaptability to woody plants is limited. This study compares the feeding adaptations (survival rate, pupation time, pupation rate, weight, length, and daily food consumption), protective enzyme activities, and feeding preferences of S. frugiperda on leaves of six economically important tree species (Areca catechu L., Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Spreng, Cocos nucifera L., Camellia oleifera Abel, Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen, and Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.) M & uuml;ll. Arg.), with Zea mays L. used as a control treatment. The results indicate that S. frugiperda did not survive when fed with A. catechu, C. oleifera, and D. odorifera. A. catechu had similar survival rates (83.33%), pupation (86.67%), weight, and length data compared to the maize control. C. nucifera had lower survival rates (46.67%) but no significant differences in pupation (76.67%), weight, and length data of S. frugiperda. H. brasiliensis exhibited significantly lower survival (50.00%) and pupation rates (46.67%) compared to maize. However, there was no significant difference in weight and length data, and its preference index was higher among the six tree species treatments. Therefore, A. sinensis is a vulnerable tree with a high risk, while H. brasiliensis and C. nucifera showed varying degrees of susceptibility. A. catechu, C. oleifera, and D. odorifera were found to be unsuitable hosts for S. frugiperda. In conclusion, this study extensively explores the feeding effects of S. frugiperda on six economically important tree species. It provides insights into the feeding preferences of the pest, thereby informing the potential threat posed by S. frugiperda to economically important trees. It helps to prevent further damage from S. frugiperda and provides a reference for agriculture and forestry to develop effective joint prevention and control measures.

AB  - We analyzed leaf functional traits, chemical defenses and their effects on herbivory in three plant species that occur at two contrasting successional stages: mature and secondary forests in Mexico. In each successional stage, 15 individuals of Cordia elaeagnoides, C. alliodora and Achatocarpus gracilis were selected to analyze physical and chemical defenses and herbivory. Chlorophyll content, leaf thickness, leaf water content and leaf fresh mass were higher in mature forests, whereas SLA was higher in secondary forests, partially supporting the prediction that leaf traits vary from conservative to acquisitive along the leaf economics spectrum during succession. Content of secondary compounds did not show a consistent pattern among successional stages, but a relatively consistent trend was observed for C. elaeagnoides and A. gracilis, which exhibited higher levels of phenols and flavonoids in mature forests. Herbivory was higher in secondary than in mature forests for Cordia species, but the opposite pattern was found for A. gracilis. These results contradict the predictions of the resource availability hypothesis for tropical dry plant species, which state that resource-conservative plants in secondary forests invest more in chemical defenses and have less herbivore damage than resource-acquisitive plants in mature forests. Such idiosyncratic responses make it difficult to use a single hypothesis to predict plant defense and herbivory variations along environmental gradients at both intra- and interspecific levels. Considering the current intensity of human disturbance in forests, further studies are necessary to evaluate the impacts of changes in leaf functional traits on plant fitness during succession in the tropics.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are sensitive ecosystems that give habitat to large number of species. The extent of the impact of microplastic pollution in the aquatic system and humans is not known. In this study, the occurrence of micro-plastics (MPs) was assessed in 7 aquatic species from the Anzali Wetland (40 fish and 15 shrimp specimens), a listed wetland on the Montreux record. Specifically, the tissues analyzed were gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gills, skin, and muscles. The total frequency of MPs (all detected MPs in the GI tract, gill and skin samples) varied from 5.2 +/- 4.2 MPs/specimen for Cobitis saniae to 20.8 +/- 6.7 MPs/specimen for Abramis brama. Among all tissues studied, the GI tract of the Chelon saliens, a herbivorous demersal species, had the greatest level of MPs (13.6 +/- 10 MPs/specimen). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the abundance of MPs in different species, tissues, living domains and feeding habit types. The findings support that fish may uptake MPs through adherence in gills (respiration) in addition to ingestion. White/transparent and black/grey polyamide (PA) fibers were the most common type of MP which may be originated from municipal wastewater and intensive fishing activities. About 34% of the MPs were in the range of 250 mu m-500 mu m, and those >100 mu m were not detected in muscles from the study fish. All species had unhealthy weight according to the Fulton's condition index (K). Positive relationships existed between biometric properties (total length and weight) of species and the total frequency of uptaken MPs, pointing to detrimental impact of MPs in the wetland.

AB  - Skeletal muscle grows in response to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and its growth and development influence the quality of pork. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating the growth and development of skeletal muscle is of great significance to both animal husbandry and farm management. The Jiangquan black pig is an excellent pig breed based on the original Yimeng black pig, importing the genes of the Duroc pig for meat traits, and cultivated through years of scientific selection and breeding. In this study, full-length transcriptome sequencing was performed on three growth stages of Jiangquan black pigs, aiming to study the developmental changes in Jiangquan black pigs at different developmental stages at the molecular level and to screen the key genes affecting the growth of skeletal muscle in Jiangquan black pigs. We performed an enrichment analysis of genes showing differential expression and constructed a protein-protein interaction network with the aim of identifying core genes involved in the development of Jiangquan black pigs. Notably, genes such as TNNI2, TMOD4, PLDIM3, MYOZ1, and MYH1 may be potential regulators of muscle development in Jiangquan black pigs. Our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle development in this pig breed, which will facilitate molecular breeding efforts and the development of pig breeds to meet the needs of the livestock industry.

AB  - Wild boars have been reported as bioindicators for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in a variety of studies. However, data about PFAS levels in wild boars from sites with limited industrial and general human activity is scarce. In this study, wild boar (Sus scrofa) organs from the Bohemian Forest National Park (Czech Republic) were used as bioindicators for PFAS pollution. In this work, 29 livers and 24 kidneys from 30 wild boars (0.5-5 years) were investigated using a fluorine mass balance approach. For this, the samples were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), targeting 30 PFAS, including legacy and replacement PFAS, direct total oxidisable precursor assay (dTOPA) and combustion ion chromatography (CIC). Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) from C-7 to C-14 and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were detected in >50 % of samples. In the livers, PFCAs dominated the profile with median concentrations of 230 mu g/kg for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and 75 mu g/kg perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFOA and PFNA concentrations in the livers were one order of magnitude higher than in livers from wild boars caught in rural NE Germany considered as background concentration. PFOS in liver contributed only 30 % to the Sigma c(PFAS(Target)) with a median concentration of 170 mu g/kg. Kidneys and livers contain an average of 2460 mu g F/kg and 6800 mu g F/kg extractable organic fluorine (EOF) respectively. Sigma c(PFAS(Target)) add up to a maximum of 10 % of the extractable organic fluorine. After oxidisation of the samples, PFOA, PFNA and Sigma c(PFAS(dTOPA)) increased in livers, but could not explain the EOF. The elevated concentration of PFOA and PFNA may indicate differences in biomagnification for different habitats or an unidentified PFAS source in proximity to the national park.

AB  - Simple Summary Social pressure, especially in Europe, towards the ban of farrowing crates has driven research on alternative farrowing systems. However, few studies comparing the welfare and performance of pigs in different types of farrowing pens with temporary crating have been carried out under commercial conditions. Additionally, the weaning stress response of pigs that are previously housed in alternative farrowing systems is overlooked. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare how the sows and piglets from three types of farrowing systems adapt to the weaning challenge. Behavioral observation, number of skin lesions, and salivary stress biomarkers were carried out at different time points around weaning, to assess the adaptability of sows and piglets to weaning. Our results found that the post-weaning aggression level in piglets from three farrowing systems was similar. Piglets' saliva samples from one of the alternative farrowing systems showed a reduced stress response at weaning, which may suggest better weaning adaptability of these pigs. Sows from the same alternative farrowing system vocalized most on the day of weaning and decreased drastically over time. This vocalization frequency pattern after weaning might indicate a greater effect of abrupt separation from the piglets in this type of farrowing system. The study investigated the effect of farrowing environment on the weaning adaptability of sows and piglets. One farrowing crate (FC) and two farrowing pens with temporary crating (TC: SWAP and JLF15) were compared. Sixty-four sows and 663 piglets were followed until 5 days post-weaning. At weaning (D24), sows and piglets were moved to group pens and nursery pens, respectively. Sows and piglets' behaviors were observed on D24, D25, and D26. On D23, D25, and D26, piglets' skin lesions were counted, and sows and piglets' saliva samples were collected for stress biomarkers (cortisol and chromogranin A, CgA). Piglets were weighed on D23 and D29. All the piglets' skin lesions increased on D25 and decreased on D26 (p < 0.05). Compared to D23, cortisol of JLF15 and CgA of FC piglets increased, whereas those of SWAP piglets remained similar after weaning (p < 0.05). Post-weaning performance in piglets was similar across farrowing systems. SWAP sows vocalized more than FC and JLF15 on D24 and D25 (p < 0.001). Results suggested that SWAP piglets showed a lower weaning stress response. Frequent post-weaning vocalization in SWAP sows might be linked with a negative effect of the abrupt separation from the piglets.

AB  - Springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) is an understudied species with a dearth of scientific work having been conducted, especially so for the Nama-Karoo vegetation type, in southern Namibia. We studied variations in herd composition and time budget of springbok by direct observations during a dry and wet season in southern Namibia and found significant differences (p < 0.001) in mean herd size between the dry and wet seasons. Herd size decreased from early morning to late afternoon during the dry season (p = 0.037) but not the wet season (p = 0.362). Springbok spent more time browsing during the dry season compared to the wet season (p < 0.001) when they spent more time grazing (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the time springbok spent walking between the two seasons (p = 0.181). Other energy-intensive activities such as grooming and running increased during the wet season (p < 0.001) due to favourable environmental conditions, breeding season and possibly an increase in parasite load.

AB  - Balochi sheep is one among the established sheep breeds of Balochistan province in Pakistan. As far as its size is concerned, it is medium sized, having fat tail and inhabits in the Northern regions in Balochistan. Molecular studies are the base of breed characterization. Hence, nearly 25 unrelated (including both male and female) animals of Balochi breed were sampled for DNA extraction. Some specific markers (15 out of available 30 SSR markers) were employed in the present study to highlight genetic polymorphism. The PCR was utilized for amplification of individual DNA samples. All of the 15 SSR markers were amplified. After gel documentation, a total number of 97 alleles were recognized having 1 to 5 polymorphic forms (OARFCB193, OARJMP29, MAF33) to 4 (OARHH47, DYMS1, SRCRSP5). For total loci, number of alleles averaged 2.1162 +/- 0.3769. Shannon's Information index (I) 0.6184 +/- 0.2447 and the effective number of alleles (Ne) averaged 1.6251 +/- 0.4604. Average observed, expected and average heterozygosities were found to be 0.5815 +/- 0.1059, 0.4330 +/- 0.5811 and 0.4331 +/- 0.5811, respectively. It was noted that the F-statistic was ranging from 0.2166 to 0.95182 for the microsatellite markers employed in the study. Expected reduction in heterozygosity was higher than mean value in case of most of the markers with lower standard errors showing the prevalence of homozugous Balochi sheep population. The main cause reason behind prevalence of homozygous population might be inbreeding as only few rams had been used for breeding the flocks. This study would provide basis for breed characterization and lead to breed improvement program.

AB  - The persistence and transmission of emerging pollutants such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have caused concern to scientific community. Composting practises are often adapted for the reduction of organic waste or to enhance fertility in agriculture soil but its continuous usage has posed a potential risk of increased abundance of ARGs in soil. Thus, the present study scrutinises the emerging risk of ARGs and MGEs in agriculture soil and its potential mitigation using biochar owing to its proven environmental sustainability and performance. After 30 days incubation, ARG distribution of SulI, SulII, dfrA1, dfrA12, tetA, flor, and ErmA was 50, 37.5, 37.5, 62.5, 42.11, 62.5, and 52.63% in control samples whereas it was 5, 15.78, 21.05, 15.79, 10.53, 21.05, and 31.58%, respectively, for biochar amended samples. Similarly, IntI1 and IntI2 in control and biochar amended samples were 18.75 and 6.25% and 10.53 and 5.26%, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) factor suggests that biochar amendment samples showed enhanced value for pH, organic matter, and organic carbon over control samples. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis performed between detected ARGs and MGEs demonstrated the positive and significant correlation at p < 0.05 for both control and biochar amended samples.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation is associated with sperm vulnerability to oxidative stress and ice crystal-induced damage, adversely affecting in vitro fertilization (IVF) success. This study aimed to investigate the effects of freezing diluent supplemented with antioxidant limonin (Lim), myo-inositol (MYO), and the ice crystal formation inhibitor L-proline (LP) through sperm motility, morphological integrity, and antioxidant capacity. The Lim (150 mM), MYO (90 mM), and LP (100 mM) significantly ameliorated the quality of post-thaw sperm in Debao boar, and combined treatment of these agents significantly enhanced sperm motility, structural integrity, and antioxidant capacity compared with individual agents (p < 0.05). Notably, the combined use of these agents reduced glycerol concentration in the freezing diluent from 3% to 2%. Meanwhile, the integrity of the sperm plasma membrane, acrosome membrane, and mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly improved (p < 0.05), and the result of IVF revealed the total cell count of the blastocysts was also greater in the 2% glycerol group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the newly developed freezing diluent for semen, by adding Lim (150 mM), MYO (90 mM), and LP (100 mM), can enhance the quality of frozen-thawed Debao boar sperm and reduce the concentration of glycerol from 3% to 2% as high concentrations of glycerol can impair the quality of thawed sperm and affect in vitro fertilization outcomes. In conclusion, the improved dilution solution formulated demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the quality of porcine spermatozoa following cryopreservation and subsequent thawing.

AB  - Early-life environment can affect organisms for life on many levels. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene has a pivotal role mediating organismal physiological and behavioral responses to environmental change, and is sensitive to early-life environmental conditions and epigenetic programming. Longitudinal studies require nonlethal sampling of peripheral tissues (e.g. blood), but this approach is dependent on the extent to which GR expression in peripheral tissues covaries with GR expression in central tissues. To test for the long-term effects of early life adversity on GR expression across brain and peripheral tissues, we manipulated developmental conditions of captive zebra finches (n = 45), rearing them in either benign or harsh conditions through manipulation of parental foraging costs. We measured relative GR mRNA expression in blood and five brain regions in adulthood: hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, ventral striatum, and the nidopallium caudolaterale (analogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex), using qPCR. We further tested whether GR expression was modulated by natal brood size (which affected growth), age at sampling, and sex. GR expression correlations among tissues varied widely in magnitude and direction, ranging from -0.27 to +0.80, indicating that our understanding of developmental effects on GR expression and associated phenotypes needs to be region specific rather than organism wide. A more consistent pattern was that GR expression increased with age in blood, ventral striatum and hippocampus; GR expression was independent of age in other tissues. Developmental treatment did not affect GR expression in any of the tissues measured directly, but in blood and ventral striatum of adult females we found a positive correlation between nestling mass and GR expression. Thus, GR expression in blood was affected by early life conditions as reflected in growth in adult females, a pattern also found in one brain tissue, but not ubiquitous across brain regions. These results point at sex-dependent physiological constraints during development, shaping early life effects on GR expression in females only. Further study is required to investigate whether these tissue-dependent effects more generally reflect tissue-dependent long-term effects of early life adversity. This, together with investigating the physiological consequences of GR expression levels on individual performance and coping abilities, will be fundamental towards understanding the mechanisms mediating long-term impacts of early life, and the extent to which these can be quantified through non-lethal sampling.

AB  - The elasmotheres were well diversified and widespread throughout the Neogene in Eurasia and East Africa. Here we report a new elasmothere genus and species, Tongxinotherium latirhinum gen. et sp. nov., from the Zhang'enbao Formation (middle Miocene) of Tongxin, Ningxia, China. The new genus is characterized by a broad and thick nasal bone, the 'U'-shaped nasal notch located at the level of P3, the anterior margin of the orbit situated at the level of M2, subhypsodont teeth covered and filled by plentiful cement, slightly developed enamel foldings, expanded protocone with anterior and posterior constrictions, the middle valley and posterior valley closed on the premolars, protoloph separated from the ectoloph on P2, and buccal and lingual cingula present on premolars, but absent on molars. A phylogenetic analysis reveals that Tongxinotherium latirhinum gen. et sp. nov. is more derived than the early elasmotheres, and more primitive than Iranotherium and Ningxiatherium, bridging a morphological and stratigraphical gap between them. The discovery of new material improves the morphological characteristics of the early elasmotheres' horns and increases the diversity of the middle Miocene elasmotheres.

AB  - Simple Summary This study compares two methods of preparing boar sperm for in vitro fertilization: the traditional density gradient selection (DGS) using centrifugation and the newer microfluidic chip-based sperm (MCS) sorting. MCS resulted in lower sperm concentration and fewer morphologically abnormal sperm compared to DGS. Additionally, although DGS showed higher progressive motility, both methods had similar fertilization outcomes in terms of cleavage rates, blastulation rates, and embryo quality. The results show that MCS performs at least as well as DGS and may offer advantages due to its gentler approach and potential for more consistent results in IVF procedures.Abstract Porcine in vitro embryo production (IVP) protocols have conventionally used density gradient selection (DGS) by centrifugation to prepare sperm samples and achieve successful fertilisation. However, the possible toxicity of the solutions used and the potential damage caused by the centrifugation step may have a negative effect on the quality of the sample. Microfluidic chip-based sperm (MCS) sorting has been proposed as an alternative technique for the selection of high-quality sperm with the purpose of improving reproductive outcomes in IVF. This device does not require centrifugation or any toxic solution to prepare the sample for fertilisation. The sample is not subjected to unnecessary stress, and the process is less operator-dependent. In this study, we compared the sperm parameters of unselected extender-diluted boar semen samples with selected samples using DGS and MCS methods. The results show an expected reduction in sperm concentration after both methods. All the groups were significantly different from one another, with MCS being the group with the lowest concentration. Though the three groups had a similar overall motility, significant differences were found in progressive motility when comparing the unselected group (control, 19.5 +/- 1.4%) with DGS and MCS. Progressive motility in DGS was also significantly higher than in MCS (65.2 +/- 4.9% and 45.7% +/- 5.3, respectively). However, MCS selection resulted in enriched sperm samples with a significantly lower proportion of morphologically abnormal sperm compared to DGS. After fertilisation, no statistical differences were found between the two methods for embryological parameters such as cleavage rates, blastulation rates, and embryo quality. The number of cells in blastocysts derived from MCS was significantly greater than those derived from DGS sperm. Thus, we demonstrate that MCS is at least as good as the standard DGS for most measures. As a more gentle and reproducible approach for sperm selection, however, it could improve consistency and improve IVP outcomes as mediated by a greater proportion of morphologically normal sperm and manifested by a higher cell count in blastocysts.

AB  - Herders play essential roles in sustaining Mongolia's economy and rangeland conditions. As about 90% of Mongolia's livestock grazes on natural pasture, how herders manage it largely affects the future sustainability of the livestock industry. Since Mongolia transformed its grazing practices from communal management into loosely regulated household practices in 1990, overgrazing has become a growing concern. Considering this concern, this paper examines the extent to which traditional and non-traditional herders perceive pasture conditions and practice management. We conducted the questionnaire survey among 120 herders in Murun Soum of Khentii Province and asked about rangeland degradation and their coping strategies. To determine correlations between their perceptions/practices and sociodemographic characteristics, we conducted multiple regression analyses. We found that, overall, most herders identified rangeland conditions degrading and grass yield declining with less plant diversity and more soil damage by Brandt's vole. Herders' mobility and herd movement frequency have decreased since 1990, placing more strains on limited pasture areas. In coping with overgrazing, about 20% of the respondents had practiced traditional rangeland management, whereas many others had overlooked pasture conditions and increased goat production as the world's demand for cashmere rose. In response to our question about herders' future contribution of their traditional knowledge to sustainable rangeland management, traditional herders demonstrated their willingness to help local officials manage the pasture. This paper then explores how local administrations and herders may collaborate in the future.

AB  - Many studies in the last decades addressed the antifeedant and repellent effects of neem (Azadirachta indica)-based pesticides on arthropod herbivores with azadirachtin as the leading active ingredient. However, results for aphids regarding repellence and feeding were often contradictory and mainly based on laboratory studies with self-made neem extracts in high concentrations. Moreover, no data are available on the presence of azadirachtin in the phloem of treated plants-the tissue that most aphids feed on. We investigated how the application of the commercial neem product NeemAzal-T/S onto only one plant half (upper or lower) affects nymphs of the aphid Macrosiphum rosae in clip cages on the untreated plant half. Results for aphid mortality indicate that active ingredients of NeemAzal-T/S are translocated both upwards and downwards in rose plants and that active ingredients are transported in the phloem. Furthermore, we investigated whether NeemAzal-T/S has a repellent or antifeedant effect on M. rosae. A choice test in the greenhouse as well as the quantification of honeydew excretion and electrical penetration graph analysis do not show differences in settling or feeding on untreated and NeemAzal-T/S-treated rose plants. Collectively, our data show that the effect of approved concentrations of NeemAzal-T/S on M. rosae is based on the toxicity after feeding on treated plants, not on starvation.

AB  - Simple Summary Exogenous glutamate administration to yearling-anestrous goats enhanced not only ovarian function (i.e., ovulation rate and antral follicle number) but also denoted undoubted effects at the hypothalamic-pituitary level, augmenting LH pulsatility. Our results show not only the use of glutamate as a clean alternative but also as an interesting reproductive strategy to amplify ovarian function, considering goats as an animal model. While this should enlarge the possibility of escalating our knowledge regarding the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal modulation by glutamate, such research outcomes may also embrace potential translational implications. The potential effect of intravenous administration of glutamate on the ovarian activity and the LH secretion pattern, considering the anestrous yearling goat as an animal model, were assessed. In late April, yearling goats (n = 20) were randomly assigned to either (1) Glutamate supplemented (GLUT; n = 10, Live Weight (LW) = 29.6 +/- 1.02 kg, Body Condition (BCS) = 3.4 +/- 0.2 units; i.v. supplemented with 7 mg GLUT kg(-1) LW) or (2) Non-supplemented (CONT; n = 10; LW = 29.2 +/- 1.07 kg, BCS = 3.5 +/- 0.2 units; i.v. saline). The oats were estrus-synchronized; blood sampling (6 h x 15 min) was carried out for LH quantification. Response variables included pulsatility (PULSE), time to first pulse (TTFP), amplitude (AMPL), nadir (NAD), and area under the curve (AUC) of LH. Ovaries were ultra-sonographically scanned to assess ovulation rate (OR), number of antral follicles (AF), and total ovarian activity (TOA = OR + AF). LH-PULSE was quantified with the Munro algorithm; significant treatment x time interactions were evaluated across time. The variables LW and BCS did not differ (p > 0.05) between the experimental groups. Nevertheless, OR (1.77 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.20 units), TOA (4.11 vs. 1.87 +/- 0.47 units) and LH-PULSE (5.0 vs. 2.2 pulses 6 h-1) favored (p < 0.05) to the GLUT group. Our results reveal that targeted glutamate supplementation, the main central nervous system neurotransmitter, arose as an interesting strategy to enhance the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-ovarian response considering the anestrous-yearling goat as an animal model, with thought-provoking while promising translational applications.

AB  - The lower Yangtze Valley provides a rich context for studying the interplay between the origins and intensification of agriculture and socio-political complexity. While the adoption of agriculture was closely associated with the developing societal complexity in major core centres during the Liangzhu period (3300-2300 BC), smaller and peripheral sites, which were also integral parts of the regional social fabric, exhibited contrasting subsistence choices and varying societal development. By examining these locations, a better understanding of the core-hinterland relationships within the region's complex social structure and agricultural background would be clarified. In this paper, we present a zooarchaeological study of the Jiangzhuang site, located on the northern periphery of the Liangzhu culture. The faunal assemblage is primarily composed of cervids with a small proportion of suids, indicating subsistence heavily relying on wild resources. The morphological variation in suids is likely a result of the co-existence of domesticated pigs, wild boar, feral pigs, and probably the hybrid of the three, unveiling a complex human-suid relationship. The intensive utilisation of cervid bones for tool production is also a distinctive feature. While the Jiangzhuang community might have been articulated with the Liangzhu centre through the circulation of ritual jades, the subsistence economy there remained largely self-sufficient. The economic independence in the peripheral region might have contributed to the increasing decentralisation in the late Liangzhu period, providing a plausible explanation for the collapse of Liangzhu society.

AB  - Milk and its derivatives are included in a balanced diet of humans as excellent sources of proteins, vitamins, and essential minerals that are functional nutrients. Knowledge about the nutritional benefits or harms due to milk consumption has been expanding in recent years. We previously explored, in rodent models, the metabolic effects of isoenergetic intake of milk derived from cows, donkeys, or humans, while the impact of goat's milk intake has remained unexplored. The aim of this work was to investigate, in an animal model, the effects of dietary supplementation with goat's milk on energy homeostasis and inflammatory state, focusing on the modulation of mitochondrial functions in most metabolically active organs, such as skeletal muscle and the liver. In addition, we highlighted a link between nutrient intake, substrate metabolism, and the orexinergic system. Our results indicate that goat milk improves mitochondrial oxidative capacity and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in both organs. Notably, goat milk lowers the circulating levels of Orexin-A, a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in regulating peripheral energy balance and central nervous system mechanisms. These data provide the first evidence that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of goat milk are mediated by the modulation of mitochondrial functions and orexinergic signaling.

AB  - This research characterized the traditional knowledge on the use and management of wildlife in the Nahuatl community of Santa Catarina, Morelos, Mexico. A qualitative methodology was used, applying ethnozoological research techniques such as semi-structured interviews (n = 55), ethnographic observation, and guided tours with local experts. In addition, the Cultural Importance Index (IIC) was calculated for each species used. A total of 41 species from different phyla were recorded, which are part of the tangible and intangible cultural manifestations of the Nahuas. Eleven categories of use are reported, of which nutritional (n = 57.5 %), forecast (n = 25 %), medicinal (n = 22.5 %) and legends (n = 12.5 %) recorded the higher percentage of species. The wild animals with the highest IIC were the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; 16.8), the field rabbit (Sylvilagus cunicularius; 13.6), the huilota (Zenaida macroura; 10.9), the rattlesnake (Crotalus culminatus; 12.8) and the winged ant (gynes and males of Atta mexicana; 10.8). Obtaining wildlife resources is done through individual or group gathering and hunting with firearms and traditional weapons in forest areas and agroecosystems within their territory. Wild fauna is a renewable natural resource that has a socio-cultural importance for the Nahua inhabitants because it is part of their subsistence strategies and cosmology: it provides them with raw materials for material needs, but also has symbolic representations associated with animals in traditional medicine, the practice of hunting and in the narratives of oral tradition.

AB  - In many countries, livestock slurry must be injected or incorporated into the soil to reduce nitrogen losses. However, when the injection is not feasible, farmers adopting conservation practices discard the use of slurry as fertilizer. New approaches related to slurry treatment or application management can stimulate the use of slurry in conservation agriculture (CA). This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic effects of some new management strategies to use dairy slurry for fertilization of ryegrass grown on stubble-covered soil, using as reference standard practices (slurry injection and mineral fertilizer application). The following treatments were considered: (i) bare soil: control (CB), mineral fertilizer (MB), injection (IN); (ii) stubble: control (CS), acidified dairy slurry (ADS), raw dairy slurry (RDS), irrigation following RDS (IR), mineral fertilizer (MS), RDS placed under the stubble (US), raw slurry applied 16 days after sowing (RDS T16). Effects on ryegrass yield, apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) and soil chemical properties were assessed. ADS reached 94% equivalence to MS and performed similarly to IN for productivity, ANR and soil parameters showing to be a sustainable alternative to replace mineral nitrogen and a potential solution to enable dairy slurry application in CA without injection or incorporation into the soil.

AB  - Selenium deficiency is still a global problem in livestock husbandry, and this micronutrient is commonly supplemented in ruminants around the world, especially during the neonatal period. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of selenium and vitamin E supplementation in young goats in the neonatal period on the activity of the process of thrombopoiesis based on cytological evaluation of bone marrow smears. Twelve clinically healthy goats at the age of 2 days divided into two equal groups (n=6) participated in the study. Only animals from the experimental group received a single dose of Se and vitamin E on the second day of life. Bone marrow was collected three times (2nd day of life and after 15 and 25 days), stained with the MGG method, and subjected to cytological evaluation. Peripheral blood smears were also analyzed three times. The bone marrow cells in the group receiving the supplement absorbed dyes faster and more intensively than the same cells in the control animals. The numbers of megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes were higher in goats from the experimental group than in the control group, which indicated the intensification of thrombopoiesis in animals supplemented with selenium and vitamin E. The results of the morphological tests clearly indicated an increase in the number of platelets and a higher platelet volume in experimental group. It can be concluded that selenium and vitamin E supplementation has a positive impact on the thrombopoiesis in caprine bone marrow.

AB  - There is a growing need for animal care institutions to house multiple bull elephants as the population increases due to transfers from private ownership and the births of male offspring in managed care. Elephants in North American, European, and Latin American zoos exhibit stereotypies-repetitive, fixed behaviors. Previous research demonstrated that housing Asian elephants alone increased stereotypic behavior. Therefore, for animals in managed care, social restriction can contribute to stereotypy and, by extension, reduce welfare. In this study, we examine how being alone affects stereotypic behavior by monitoring pacing and head-bobbing in individual bull Asian elephants at Denver Zoo when housed alone as well as with other bulls. Two young males arrived at Denver Zoo in September 2018 and joined an existing all-male group of three elephants that were previously socialized and housed together. From July 2018 to December 2019, we used instantaneous scan sampling to collect data on stereotypic behavior of focal bulls when they were housed alone and socially. The frequency of pacing and head-bobbing significantly decreased when the elephants were housed socially compared to when they were housed alone; these stereotypies were lower when elephants were housed with at least one other bull and were in close proximity to a conspecific. Additionally, pacing decreased as the proportion of affiliative behaviors increased, and the amount of agonistic behavior did not significantly affect stereotypic behavior. When housed alone, bulls in musth engaged in significantly more pacing behavior than when they were out of musth. Our results indicate that housing bull Asian elephants in all-male groups substantially improves their welfare by reducing stereotypies and provides a basis for future evidence-based management.

AB  - The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a wild bovid with a historical distribution across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Genomic analysis can provide insights into the evolutionary history of the species, and the key selective pressures shaping populations, including assessment of population level differentiation, population fragmentation, and population genetic structure. In this study we generated the highest quality de novo genome assembly (2.65 Gb, scaffold N50 69.17 Mb) of African buffalo to date, and sequenced a further 195 genomes from across the species distribution. Principal component and admixture analyses provided little support for the currently described four subspecies. Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces analysis suggested that geographical barriers have played a significant role in shaping gene flow and the population structure. Estimated effective population sizes indicated a substantial drop occurring in all populations 5-10,000 years ago, coinciding with the increase in human populations. Finally, signatures of selection were enriched for key genes associated with the immune response, suggesting infectious disease exert a substantial selective pressure upon the African buffalo. These findings have important implications for understanding bovid evolution, buffalo conservation and population management.

AB  - Salt stress is a widespread environmental constraint that impairs crop growth, development, and productivity, reducing seed germination and seedling growth. Plants respond to salinity by modulating physiological and molecular processes, but these responses are inefficient, with salinity issues rapidly escalating worldwide. Salicylic acid (SA) is the most important signal molecules. that protects plants from the damaging effects of salt. This study examined the tolerance potential of 10-day-old Capsicum annuum L. Pusa Sadabahar seedlings against various concentrations of salt stress (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mM NaCl) with or without 1 mM salicylic acid (SA) to understand how SA could help Capsicum annuum avoid salt toxicity. The results showed that physiochemical attributes such as seed germination, were higher in the control (0 mM NaCl) and low to medium NaCl (50 and 75 mM) concentrations compared to the high NaCl (150 mM) concentration, which inhibited seed germination, shoot (180.75%) and root (507.20%) lengths, fresh and dry weights, % moisture content, tolerance index, vigor index, chlorophyll content and a-amylase, but increased enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD, 37.50%), peroxidase (POX, 62.21%), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, 30%), glutathione reductase (GR, 40.46%), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glyoxalase I (Gly I, 44.37%) and glyoxalase II (Gly II, 34.58%) activities, non-enzymatic antioxidants, ascorbate (AsA, 48.51%), carotenoids, phenolics, proline (71.85%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA, 60.05%), and protein contents. The exogenous SA treatment enhanced all studied parameters except AsA, H2O2, and MDA, protecting the cells from lipid peroxidation and stimulating the ascorbate-glutathione (AsH-GSH) cycle, glyoxalase system, and proline accumulation, which helped to alleviate salt-induced ionic and oxidative damage. Overall, the study highlighted the potential of SA in aiding Capsicum annuum's resistance to salt stress and reducing its harmful effects.& COPY; 2023 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary The most recent experiments performed on somatic cells describe the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on various levels. In male gametes, these two gasotransmitters have been studied individually up until today. Both NO and H2S participate in crucial sperm structural and functional changes before and after ejaculation. Moreover, the two gasotransmitters can augment or mitigate the negative impact of oxidative stress, depending on the concentration. Oxidative stress is a concomitant condition to various male reproduction disorders. In this experiment, we investigated in vitro the simultaneous application of NO and H2S donors, which was compared to single-donor application (NO or H2S) at 100 nM concentrations in boar spermatozoa under oxidative stress. The evaluation of sperm qualitative traits revealed a positive effect of the combination of the two donors in DD treatment on progressive motility and plasma membrane integrity compared to the control sample under oxidative stress (CtrOX). The results of this experiment indicate that the combination of NO and H2S donors exceeds the effect of single-donor application under given conditions. In conclusion, our research indicates the importance of gasotransmitter interaction in male gametes. Various recent studies dedicated to the role of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in somatic cells provide evidence for an interaction of the two gasotransmitters. In the case of male gametes, only the action of a single donor of each gasotransmitter has been investigated up until today. It has been demonstrated that, at low concentrations, both gasotransmitters alone exert a positive effect on sperm quality parameters. Moreover, the activity of gaseous cellular messengers may be affected by the presence of oxidative stress, an underlying condition of several male reproductive disorders. In this study, we explored the effect of the combination of two donors SNP and NaHS (NO and H2S donors, respectively) on boar spermatozoa under oxidative stress. We applied NaHS, SNP, and their combination (DD) at 100 nM concentration in boar spermatozoa samples treated with Fe2+/ascorbate system. After 90 min of incubation at 38 degrees C, we have observed that progressive motility (PMot) and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) were improved (p < 0.05) in DD treatment compared to the Ctr sample under oxidative stress (CtrOX). Moreover, the PMot of DD treatment was higher (p < 0.05) than that of NaHS. Similar to NaHS, SNP treatment did not overcome the PMot and PMI of CtrOX. In conclusion, for the first time, we provide evidence that the combination of SNP and NaHS surmounts the effect of single-donor application in terms of PMot and PMI in porcine spermatozoa under oxidative stress.

AB  - PremiseSynchronous, highly variable flower or seed production among years within a population (i.e., masting) has been reported in numerous perennial plants. Although masting provides ecological advantages such as enhancing pollination efficiency and/or escape from predator attack, little is known about the degree of these advantages and variations in masting behavior among populations of conspecific plants. MethodsWe determined flowering ramet density and reproductive success (fruit-set success and herbivorous damage) of a perennial herb, Veratrum album subsp. oxysepalum, across six lowland and six alpine populations in northern Japan during 2-3 years. We then analyzed the relationship between floral density and reproductive success to assess the ecological significance of mast flowering. Flowering intervals of individual plants were estimated by counting annual scars on rhizomes. ResultsMost populations had mast flowering, but the intervals between flowering for individual plants were shorter in the alpine populations than in the lowland populations. Floral damage by stem borers (dipteran larvae) and seed predation by lepidopteran larvae were intense in the lowland populations. Seed production of individual ramets increased with higher floral density owing to the effective avoidance of floral-stem damage and seed predation. Although stem borers were absent in the alpine habitat, seed predation decreased with higher floral density also in the alpine populations. Pollination success was independent of floral density in both of the alpine and lowland populations. ConclusionsThese results strongly support the predator satiation hypothesis for mast flowering by this species.

AB  - The premise that the intensity of biotic interactions decreases with increasing latitudes and elevations is broadly accepted; however, whether these geographical patterns can be explained within a common theoretical framework remains unclear. Our goal was to identify the general pattern of elevational changes in trophic interactions and to explore the sources of variation among the outcomes of individual studies. Meta-analysis of 226 effect sizes calculated from 134 publications demonstrated a significant but interaction-specific decrease in the intensity of herbivory, carnivory and parasitism with increasing elevation. Nevertheless, this decrease was not significant at high latitudes and for interactions involving endothermic organisms, for herbivore outbreaks or for herbivores living within plant tissues. Herbivory similarly declined with increases in latitude and elevation, whereas carnivory showed a fivefold stronger decrease with elevation than with latitude and parasitism increased with latitude but decreased with elevation. Thus, although these gradients share a general pattern and several sources of variation in trophic interaction intensity, we discovered important dissimilarities, indicating that elevational and latitudinal changes in these interactions are partly driven by different factors. We conclude that the scope of the latitudinal biotic interaction hypothesis cannot be extended to incorporate elevational gradients.

AB  - Simple Summary The main objective of this work was to evaluate the degree of association that exists between three fecal indices (concentrations of 2,6 diaminopimelic acid, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and biomarkers of ruminal activity, as a non-invasive way to estimate the nutritional status in sheep grazing on annual rangeland. It was possible to establish that fecal indices, and especially fecal nitrogen and phosphorus, were linearly and positively correlated with the ruminal concentration of some volatile fatty acids, especially branched-chain, and rumen ammonia. Due to the above, these fecal indices could be used to evaluate the ruminal activity and the nutritional status of grazing sheep, with minimal manipulation of the animals. For a simple, non-invasive evaluation of nutritional status of sheep kept under extensive grazing conditions on annual rangeland, fecal indices (2,6 diaminopimelic acid, nitrogen, and phosphorus) obtained during the vegetative, reproductive, and dry grassland phenological stages, were correlated with ruminal physiological biomarkers (volatile fatty acids and ruminal ammonia). Through correlation analysis and linear regressions, the degree of association between the variables studied was established. The fecal indices that presented the highest degree of association with ruminal variables were FN and FP, being highly correlated with the production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids (isobutyrate and isovalerate) and with ruminal ammonia (r >= 0.65), establishing simple linear regression equations of high significance (p <= 0.05). Therefore, fecal indices, especially fecal concentrations of N and P, could reflect the metabolism at the ruminal level and with it the availability of compounds for microbial growth, which would help to establish the nutritional status of sheep herds under extensive grazing conditions.

AB  - The changes in epigenetic modifications during early embryonic development significantly impact mammalian embryonic genome activation (EGA) and are species-conserved to some degree. Here, we reanalyzed the published RNA-Seq of human, mouse, and goat early embryos and found that Zfp296 (zinc finger protein 296) expression was higher at the EGA stage than at the oocyte stage in all three species (adjusted p-value < 0.05 |log2(foldchange)| & GE; 1). Subsequently, we found that Zfp296 was conserved across human, mouse, goat, sheep, pig, and bovine embryos. In addition, we identified that ZFP296 interacts with the epigenetic regulators KDM5B, SMARCA4, DNMT1, DNMT3B, HP1 & beta;, and UHRF1. The Cys(2)-His(2)(C2H2) zinc finger domain TYPE2 TYPE3 domains of ZFP296 co-regulated the modification level of the trimethylation of lysine 9 on the histone H3 protein subunit (H3K9me3). According to ChIP-seq analysis, ZFP296 was also enriched in Trim28, Suv39h1, Setdb1, Kdm4a, and Ehmt2 in the mESC genome. Then, knockdown of the expression of Zfp296 at the late zygote of the mouse led to the early developmental arrest of the mouse embryos and failure resulting from a decrease in H3K9me3. Together, our results reveal that Zfp296 is an H3K9me3 modulator which is essential to the embryonic genome activation of mouse embryos.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) secretion by the anterior pituitary (AP) is responsive to changes in physiological condi-tions and many external factors that also affect brain neurosteroid levels. This study tested the hy-pothesis that neurosteroids can affect PRL secretion in sheep under basal, stressful and advanced pregnancy conditions. In Experiment 1, luteal-phase sheep were subjected to a three-day series of intracerebroventricular (icv.) control (n = 12) or allopregnanolone (AL, 4 x 15 mu g/60 mu L/30 min at 30-min intervals, n = 12) infusions. Acute stressful stimuli, isolation and partial movement restriction were applied on the third day of infusion to half of the animals in each group. In Experiment 2, pregnant sheep were subjected to a three-day series of icv. control (n = 6) or finasteride (4 x 25 mu g/60 mu L/30 min at 30-min intervals, n = 6) infusions during the 16th week of pregnancy. As a result, the relative abundance of PRL transcript increased in the AP of luteal-phase sheep treated with stress, AL and AL in combination with stress (P < 0.05 -P < 0.01) compared to controls. The level of PRL mRNA in stressed-AL-treated sheep was higher (P < 0.01) than in sheep only subjected to stress. The PRL protein content in the AP decreased in stressed-only sheep compared to controls (P < 0.05) and increased in stressed-AL-treated sheep compared to controls and other groups (P < 0.05 -P < 0.01). Plasma PRL concentration increased (P < 0.05 -P < 0.01) in stressed-only sheep compared to controls; AL infusion counteracted the stress-induced increase in PRL levels (P < 0.05 -P < 0.01) and had no effect in non-stressed animals. Inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in the brain of pregnant sheep by finasteride caused transient in-creases (P < 0.05 -P < 0.001) in plasma PRL concentration compared to controls. In conclusion, the presented results indicate a bimodal effect of AL on PRL secretion in sheep: first at the molecular level -stimulation of PRL mRNA expression; second -inhibition of hormone release from pituitary lactotrophs. Both AL activities may involve various mechanisms regulating PRL secretion. In general, cerebral neu-rosteroids can affect the supply of pituitary PRL in the body under certain conditions, such as stress and pregnancy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to their physicochemical properties, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) persist and bioaccumulate in living organisms, causing adverse health effects. Since exposure to xenobiotics is influenced by factors related to both the living organism and the considered compounds, biomonitoring PFASs' presence in the environment is of crucial importance. This study aimed to detect and quantify 15 PFASs in the muscle and liver of 40 roe deer from a specific area in Northern Italy by UPLC-HRMS. In the roe deer, liver PFAS concentrations were higher than those seen in muscle (p < 0.05). Although PFAS content in animals from urbanized areas was higher than those found in deer from rural areas, this difference was not statistically significant. In female roe deer, the concentration was higher than in males (p < 0.05); moreover, older animals showed higher concentrations of PFASs in the liver than younger animals (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the amount of PFASs was higher in tissues from roe deer belonging to urbanized areas, showing that this species might serve as a good bioindicator due to its territorial behavior. PFAS content was significantly higher in female roe deer, although the reason is not fully known. Finally, PFAS concentration was higher in the liver of older animals, probably due to compromised hepatic function.

AB  - The inadequate management of agro-waste in intensive agriculture has a severe negative impact on the environment. The valorization of crop residue as a source of crop nutrients is a valid alternative to close the nutrient cycle and reduce the use of external input. In this study, plant material was incorporated into the soil as fresh crop residue, after either composting and vermicomposting processes, to evaluate their effects on tomato yield and nutritional status (petiole sap analysis: NO3 and K+ concentration) over three crop cycles. A control treatment with mineral fertigation and an organic control treatment with goat manure were also included. Enzymatic activity and microbial population in the soil were evaluated. Although no differences between treatments were observed in the first cycle, in the second and third cycles, the yield obtained with the application of organic amendments derived from agro-waste was comparable to the yield obtained with mineral fertilizers. Overall, the sap analysis did not reveal a clear relationship with yield performances. The compost treatment resulted in higher microorganism presence in the soil. Soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA), acid phosphatase activity (ACP), and beta-glucosidase activity (beta-GLU) were generally more stimulated when organic amendments were used. The study confirms the applicability of soil fertilizers derived from agro-waste as a good alternative to mineral fertilizers.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) posits that introduced species often leave their enemies behind when introduced to a new range. This release from enemies may allow introduced species to achieve higher growth and reproduction and may explain why some invaders flourish in new locations. Red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) were introduced to HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai from Florida over a century ago. Because HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai has no native mangroves, the arrival of R. mangle fundamentally changed the structure and function of estuarine shorelines. While numerous enemies affect red mangroves in their native range (tropical America), in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, mangroves apparently experience little herbivory, which may explain why introduced mangroves are so productive, fecund, and continue to spread. In this study, we compared the effects of enemies in native and introduced populations of brackish red mangroves (R. mangle) in 8-10 sites in the native range (Florida, Belize, and Panama) and introduced range of mangroves (HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai). At each site, we measured the (1) occurrence of enemies using timed visual surveys, (2) occurrence of damage to different mangrove structures (leaves, apical buds, dead twigs, roots, propagules, and seedlings), and (3) rate of propagule herbivory using tethering experiments. Consistent with the ERH, we found an order of magnitude less damage and fewer enemies in introduced than native mangrove sites. While introduced mangroves harbored few enemies and minimal damage, native mangroves were affected by numerous enemies, including leaf-eating crabs, specialist bud moths, wood-boring insects and isopods, and propagule predators. These patterns were consistent across all plant structures (roots to leaves), among marine and terrestrial enemies, and across functional groups (browsers, borers, pathogens, etc.), which demonstrates enemy escape occurs consistently among different functional groups and via trophic (e.g., herbivores) and non-trophic (e.g., root borers) interactions. Our study is among the first biogeographical enemy release studies to take a comprehensive approach to quantifying the occurrence of damage from a broad suite of marine and terrestrial taxa across an array of wetland plant structures. Understanding how natural enemies alter this key foundation species will become increasingly relevant globally as mangroves continue to invade new regions through intentional plantings or range expansion driven by climate change.

AB  - Measurements with high time resolution are necessary to capture variation patterns and to facilitate the estimation of uncertainty in ammonia inventories. Continuous real-time monitoring of ammonia was carried out in a naturally ventilated nursery pig house during two periods in winter and summer, respectively. A higher ventilation rate of about 73,799 +/- 39,655 m(3)/h was obtained during the summer period in comparison with 1646 +/- 604 m(3)/h in the winter. Correspondingly, ammonia level observed in summer (0.25 +/- 0.10 mg/m(3)) was lower than that in winter (1.28 +/- 0.74 mg/m(3)). Spatial variation of ammonia concentration was observed during the winter monitoring period. The mean ammonia emission factor was about 0.3221 +/- 0.2921 g d(-1) pig(-1) in summer and 0.1039 +/- 0.0550 g d(-1) pig(-1) in winter, ranging from 0.0094 to 1.9422 g d(-1) pig(-1) and 0.0046 to 0.2899 g d(-1) pig(-1), respectively. Significant correlation was found between ammonia emission and indoor temperature and relative humidity during the winter period. For the summer measurement, effects of ventilation rate and ammonia concentration on ammonia emission were significant. Prominent diurnal pattern existed for both ammonia concentration and emission, with higher emission rates during daytime. The results confirmed the existence of considerable uncertainty associated with the ammonia emission factor, acquired by snapshot measurements.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of different roughages on the intestinal microbiota of yak calves, we fed them oat hay in substitution of alfalfa hay, in addition to milk replacer and starter powder. Twenty-one 45-day-old male yak calves were selected and randomly assigned to three groups: the milk replacer + starter + alfalfa hay group (AH), the milk replacer + starter + oat hay group (OH), and the milk replacer + starter + mixed hay group (AO), in which the alfalfa hay and oat hay were administered in a 1:1 ratio. All calves in the three groups were fed the same milk replacer and an equivalent amount of dry matter. The formal experiment commenced after a 21-day pre-test period and lasted for 120 days. Following the experiment, the contents of the jejunum and colon were collected to investigate the intestinal microbiota and metabolites using 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics. The result showed that the AO group had greater final body weights overall than the AH group and OH group (p < 0.05). The AH group and OH group had considerably greater feed-to-gain ratios than the AO group (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, the OH group exhibited an increased relative abundance of Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota in the jejunum (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Actinobacteriota in the colon was increased in the AO group (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the AO group exhibited a decreased abundance of Clostridium sensu_stricto_1 (p < 0.05), and the OH group showed an increased abundance UCG-005 and Alistipes in the jejunum. There were many differential metabolites in the OH group and AO group compared to the AH group, and the different metabolites of the OH group were associated with the metabolic pathways of the nervous system, sensory system, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the jejunum and with lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the nervous system in the colon. In the AO group, these metabolites were associated with the digestive system and the translation and metabolism of cofactors in the jejunum and with the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in the colon. In summary, it is feasible to replace alfalfa hay with oat hay based on milk replacer and starter. The combination of the two forages enhanced nutrient absorption, improved immune function, maintained the internal homeostasis of yak calves, and was more beneficial to their growth and development.

AB  - During the Formative period by the Late-Holocene (ca. 3000-1500 BP), semi-sedentary and sedentary human occupations had emerged in the oases, salares, and riverine systems in the central depression (2400-1000 masl) of the Atacama Desert, northern Chile (19-25 degrees S). This hyperarid core was marginally occupied during the post-Pleistocene and middle Holocene droughts. Settlement on these lower belts was accompanied by a rise in humidity, the introduction of Andean crops, flourishment of Prosopis spp. (algarrobo) forests, and increasing integration of domestic camelid caravans. Here, we explore lowland husbandry within risk-spreading strategies, focusing on silvopastoralism and endozoochory between camelids and algarrobos. Analysis of camelid coprolites from seven archeological sites located in the Pampa del Tamarugal, Loa River, and Salar de Atacama found intense grinding from camelid chewing and indicated a ruminal digestive system. Abundant macro and microremains in the form of tissues, phytoliths, crystals, cell structures, and others, were identified as Prosopis, Atriplex, Schoenoplectus, Distichlis, and Phragmites. We conclude that camelids were foraging for Prosopis, although the rather low number of entire seeds preserved in the coprolites leads us to think that these herbivores might not have been the main vectors for the spread and germination of algarrobos. More samples and interdisciplinary studies are needed to comprehend the complex socioecological web in the shaping of these forests and the management of the Atacama Desert landscapes.

AB  - Plants emit an array of volatile organic compounds in response to stresses. Six-carbon green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and five-carbon pentyl leaf volatiles (PLVs) are fatty acid-derived compounds involved in intra- and inter-species communications. Unlike extensively studied GLVs, the biological activities of PLVs remain understudied. Maize (Zea mays L.) contains a unique monocot-specific lipoxygenase, ZmLOX6, that is unable to oxidize fatty acids and instead possesses a hydroperoxide lyase-like activity to specifically produce PLVs. Here, we show that disruption of ZmLOX6 reduced resistance to fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) and fungal pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola and Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Metabolite profiling revealed that reduced resistance to insects and pathogens was associated with decreased production of PLVs and ketols, including the better studied alpha-ketol, 9,10-KODA (9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid). Exogenous PLV and 9,10-KODA treatments rescued the resistance of lox6 mutants to FAW and the pathogens. Surprisingly, the susceptible-to-herbivory lox6 mutants produced greater levels of wound-induced jasmonates, suggesting potential substrate competition between JA and PLV pathway branches and highlighting a strong role of PLVs in defense against insects. Similarly, likely due to substrate competition between GLV and PLV synthesis pathways, in response to C. graminicola infection, lox6 mutants accumulated elevated levels of GLVs, which promote susceptibility to this pathogen. Mutation of the GLV-producing ZmLOX10 in the lox6 mutant background reversed the susceptibility to C. graminicola, unveiling the contrasting roles of PLVs and GLVs in resistance to this pathogen. Overall, this study uncovered a potent signaling role of PLVs in defense against insect herbivory and fungal pathogens with distinct lifestyles.
   Pentyl leaf volatiles possess a potent and unique signaling role in promoting defense against insect herbivory and fungal pathogens via enhancing ketol-mediated defense responses.

AB  - An exploratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the culture performance and total microbial load of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus reared on the microalga Chlorella sp. cultured with 50% of the standard Bolds' Basal medium (BBM) supplemented with poultry manure filtrate (POMF), sheep manure filtrate (SHMF), water hyacinth root compost filtrate (WHRCF), water hyacinth leaf compost filtrate (WHLCF), water hyacinth root and leaf compost filtrate (WHR + LCF) and a control treatment with 100% BBM. The results indicated that the POMF-substituted culture of Chlorella sp. gave the highest mean cell density (1.83 x 10(8) +/- 4.03 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)), followed by the 100% BBM culture (1.74 x 10(8) +/- 1.44 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)), supporting 272 +/- 6.4 and 122.2 +/- 5.53 individuals mL(-1) of B. calyciflorus, respectively. The SHMF culture had the third highest Chlorella sp. density (5.94 x 10(7) cells mL(-1)) and supported 83.4 +/- 13.78 individuals mL(-1)B. calyciflorus population. The three treatments with the compost filtrate from the different parts of the water hyacinth compost filtrate had the lowest Chlorella sp. cell density and B. calyciflorus population. In terms of the total viable bacteria of B. calyciflorus cultured on the substitution of the different organic media, B. calyciflorus cultured on 100% BBM and 50% POMF-based culture showed the lowest mean total bacterial counts (6.9 x 10(6) +/- 9.9 x 10(5) and 8.05 x 10(6) +/- 4.94 x 10(5) CFU mL(-1), respectively). In contrast, the mean total bacterial counts were greater for the SHMF, WHR + LCF, WHLCF, and WHRCF groups (1.62 x 10(7) +/- 2.83 x 10(5), 1.09 x 10(7) +/- 7.78 x 10(5), 1.25 x 10(7) +/- 7.07 x 10(4), and 1.03 x 10(7) +/- 7.07 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1), respectively). Although firm conclusions could not be drawn from the results obtained in this experiment due to low biological replicates, it can be stated that a 50% substitution of standard BBM medium for Chlorella sp. culture with organic manures such as POMF can be a sustainable alternative for culturing the rotifer B. calyciflorus for larval fish culture. We recommend further investigation of the potential of POMF as a synthetic medium substitute for Chlorella sp. culture as live feed for B. calyciflorus culture.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we focus on the evaluation of the conservation priority of amphibian species in Chile. We emphasize the importance of establishing standardized criteria to evaluate and classify this priority, considering factors such as extinction risk, geographic distribution, and ecological importance. We establish priority categories for species, allowing us to identify those that require immediate attention in terms of conservation. Six species with a high priority, eight with a medium priority, twenty-two with a low priority, and twenty-two with no priority were identified. We emphasize the relevance of the Telmatobiidae and Alsodidae families as conservation priorities, highlighting the need to focus our conservation efforts on these amphibian families in Chile. This approach provides a solid basis for informed decision making in the allocation of limited resources for biodiversity conservation.Abstract Resources are limited in global biodiversity conservation efforts, which emphasizes the significance of setting conservation priorities. Using standardized criteria, we evaluated 58 amphibian species in Chile to determine their conservation priority (CP). Species with insufficient historical data had their values marked as missing. With a median value of p = 1.67, the results demonstrated CP values ranging from p = 0.48 to p = 3.0, classifying species into priority and non-priority groups. Four levels were established for the priority categories: no priority, low priority, medium priority, and high priority. Additionally, the Telmatobiidae and Alsodidae families were identified as two more priority families. Notably, the species with the highest priority were found to be T. halli, T. fronteriensis, T. philippii, T. chusmisensis, A. pehuenche, and Alsodes tumultuosus, where T. philippii and T. fronteriensis have equal priority for conservation at the national level according to the conservation priority analysis. Eight priority families-the Alsodidae, Batrachylidae, Bufonidae, Ceratophryidae, Leptodactylidae, Rhinodermatidae, and Telmatobiidae-were determined, and 14 species-or 24% of the species examined-need further study. Based on the conservation priority analysis, the species T. fronteriensis and T. philippii share the highest priority for conservation at the national level (p = 2.50). With 70% of the amphibians under study being threatened mainly by habitat loss, pollution, and emerging diseases, the creation of conservation categories made the threat assessment process easier. Due to a lack of information on geographic distribution and abundance, quantitatively classifying amphibians in Chile remains difficult. The analysis of conservation priorities and potential extinction threats informs appropriate management strategies.

AB  - Habitats of large herbivores have shrunk owing to the expansion of human activities. Consequently, wild herbivores frequently venture into adjacent farmlands to forage for crops. As a result, farmers use fences to prevent these herbivores from foraging. A dynamic game exists between whether farmers choose to set up fences and whether herbivores choose to venture into farmlands. This study established an evolutionary game model between farmers and herbivorous species. The effects of different factors on the game process were studied using model simulations to provide theoretical guidance for the conservation and management of herbivore species. Model simulations showed that food resources in herbivore habitats are key to protecting their populations. Therefore, management needs to restore and protect herbivore habitats, and in cases of extreme food shortages, herbivores should be artificially fed. Simultaneously, herbivores need to obtain certain food supplements from outside their habitats when food resources are scarce. Therefore, subsidies should be provided to farmers close to herbivore habitats to encourage them to use fences that allow a certain number of herbivores to pass through. In addition, increasing the buffer zone between herbivore habitats and farmland has positive implications for the conservation of large herbivore populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The high environmental temperature of the tropical area compromises milk production in dairy animals, and an increase in the energy required for heat dissipation produces both acid and reactive oxygen species. This response causes an acid-base imbalance and oxidative stress which indirectly affect milk synthesis. We previously showed that a high dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) supplement increased heat dissipation. Moreover, a high-dose vitamin C (vit C) supplement has been used in dairy ruminants to decrease oxidative stress. The present experiment aimed to investigate the relationship between acid-base balance, oxidative stress, and mammary gland function under high environmental temperature conditions. The results showed that high DCAD and vit C could change acid-base balance and oxidative status. In addition, milk compositions were changed when the oxidative stress was compromised. We conclude that the high environmental temperature compromises milk synthesis in part by changing acid-base balance and oxidative stress. High ambient temperature (HTa) causes acid-base imbalance and systemic oxidative stress, and this may indirectly affect the mammary gland. Furthermore, HTa induces intracellular oxidative stress, which has been proposed to affect cell metabolism directly. We previously showed in dairy goats that the negative effect of HTa was compromised by enhancing heat dissipation during a high dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) regimen. Moreover, high-dose vitamin C or ascorbic acid (AA) supplements have been used to manage oxidative stress in ruminants. The present study hypothesized that high DCAD and AA supplements that could alleviate the HTa effect would influence the milk synthesis pathway and mammary gland function. The results showed that goats fed with high DCAD had higher blood pH than control goats in the 4th week. The high dose of AA supplement decreases urine pH in the 8th week. The percent reduction of urine pH from the AA supplement was significant in the DCAD group. The high-dose AA supplement decreased plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and malonaldehyde. This effect was enhanced by a high DCAD supplement. In addition, supplementation with AA increased milk protein and citrate and decreased milk FFA. These alterations indicate the intracellular biochemical pathway of energy metabolism and milk synthesis. It can be concluded that a high DCAD regimen and AA supplement in dairy goats fed under HTa could influence the milk synthesis pathway. The evidence suggests that HTa decreases mammary gland function by modification of acid-base homeostasis and oxidative stress.

AB  - Background Tea plants originated in southwestern China. Guizhou Plateau is an original center of tea plants, and is rich in germplasm resources. However, the genetic diversity, population structure and distribution characteristics of cultivated-type tea plants in the region are unknown. In this study, we explored the genetic diversity and geographical distribution of cultivated-type tea accessions in Guizhou Plateau. Results We used 112,072 high-quality genotyping-by-sequencing to analyze the genetic diversity, principal components, phylogeny, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium, and develop a core collection of 253 cultivated-type tea plant accessions from Guizhou Plateau. The results showed Genetic diversity of the cultivated-type tea accessions of the Pearl River Basin was significantly higher than that of the cultivated-type tea accessions of the Yangtze River Basin. Three inferred pure groups (CG-1, CG-2 and CG-3) and one inferred admixture group (CG-4), were identified by a population structure analysis, and verified by principal component and phylogenetic analyses. The highest genetic distance and differentiation coefficients were determined for CG-2 vs CG-3. The lower genetic distance and differentiation coefficients were determined for CG-4 vs CG-2 and CG-4 vs CG-3, respectively. We developed a core set and a primary set. The primary and core sets contained 77.0 and 33.6% of all individuals in the initial set, respectively. The primary set may serve as the primary population in genome-wide association studies, while the core collection may serve as the core population in multiple treatment setting studies. Conclusions The present study demonstrated the genetic diversity and geographical distribution characteristics of cultivated-type tea plants in Guizhou Plateau. Significant differences in genetic diversity and evolutionary direction were detected between the ancient landraces of the Pearl River Basin and the those of the Yangtze River Basin. Major rivers and ancient hubs were largely responsible for the genetic exchange between the Pearl River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin ancient landraces as well as the formation of the ancient hubs evolutionary group. Genetic diversity, population structure and core collection elucidated by this study will facilitate further genetic studies, germplasm protection, and breeding of tea plants.

AB  - Coniferous trees of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) are under continuous threats by numerous herbivorous insect species and pathogens attacking nearly all parts and tissues of the plants. To defend themselves, pine trees produce large amounts of oleoresin that is accumulated in a highly developed network of specialized resin ducts, which are distributed in the wood, bark, and needles. Such defense reactions in pines can be induced by the attack of herbivores. The banded pine weevil, Pissodes castaneus (De Geer, 1775) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), is an important pest of Pinus in Brazil, where it has been an invasive species since 2001. The female lays its eggs under the tree bark of trees and the larvae feed in the phloem of the trunk and branches, interrupting the sap circulation and eventually causing its death. In the present study, we conducted detailed GC-MS analyses of volatiles emitted by twigs of Pinus taeda L. We analyzed how the attack by P. castaneus males and females affects the volatile pattern emitted by the twigs. When comparing volatiles produced by healthy plants and by female- and male-attacked P. taeda, qualitative and quantitative differences were detected, as the decreased production of limonene, germacrene D and (E)-caryophyllene and the increase of alpha-pinene. Laboratory bioassays showed that plants attacked by male and female P. castaneus were more attractive to the insects. Understanding about what compounds may attract or repel the insects may help in the development of more effective traps, as well as preventing stress to avoid infestation.

AB  - The presence of methicillin-resistant or -susceptible S. aureus in pig nostrils has been known for a long time, but the occurrence of extended -spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli has hardly been investigated. Here, we collected 25 E. coli recovered from nasal samples of 40 pigs/10 farmers of four farms. Nine ESBL-producing isolates belonging to ST48, ST117, ST847, ST5440, ST14914 and ST10 were retrieved from seven pigs. All blaESBL genes (blaCTX-M-32, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-65, and blaSHV-12) were horizontally transferable by conjugation through plasmids belonging to IncI1 (n=3), IncX1 (n=3) and IncHI2 (n=1) types. IncI1-plasmids displayed different genetic environments: i) IS26-blaSHV-12-deoR-IS26, ii) wbuC-blaCTX-M-32-ISKpn26 (IS5), and iii) IS930- blaCTX-M-14-IS26. The IncHI2-plasmid contained the genetic environment IS903-blaCTX-M-65-fipA with multiple resistance genes associated either to: a) Tn21-like transposon harbouring genes conferring aminoglycosides/betalactams/chloramphenicol/macrolides resistance located on two atypical class 1 integrons with an embedded Delta Tn5393; or b) Tn1721-derived transposon displaying an atypical class 1 integron harbouring aadA2-arr3- cmlA5-blaOXA-10-aadA24-dfrA14, preceding the genetic platform IS26-blaTEM-95-tet(A)-lysR-floR-virD2-ISVsa3- IS3075-IS26-qnrS1, as well as the tellurite resistance module. Other plasmids harbouring clinically relevant genes were detected, such as a ColE-type plasmid carrying the mcr-4.5 gene. Chromosomally encoded genes (fosA7) or integrons (intI1-dfrA1-aadA1-qacE-sul1/intI1-IS15-dfrA1-aadA2) were also identified. Finally, an IncY plasmid harbouring a class 2 integron (intI2-dfrA1-sat2-aadA1-qacL-IS406-sul3) was detected but not associated with a blaESBL gene. Our results evidence that pig nostrils might favour the spread of ESBL-E. coli and mcr-mediated colistin-resistance. Therefore, enhanced monitoring should be considered, especially in a sector where close contact between animals in intensive farming increases the risk of spreading antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - Spermatogenesis is a highly productive and intricate process occurring in testes that produces functional haploid sperm capable of fertilization therefore sustaining lifelong male fertility. A cornerstone of spermatogenesis is primitive spermatogonia, including spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), that are able to self-renew and differentiate. The molecular mechanisms for spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation in large domestic animals such as pigs, in comparison with their counterparts in mice, are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the expression pattern of ZBTB16 (a key transcription factor also known as PLZF) and its regulatory repertoire in porcine immature spermatogonia. We first co-stained ZBTB16 with spermatogonial/proliferative markers (DBA, SALL4, UCHL1 or Ki67) on testis sections from four ages of boars, demonstrating that ZBTB16(+) cells in prepubertal porcine testes are a subpopulation of immature spermatogonia. Then, we knocked down ZBTB16 in enriched porcine immature spermatogonia, and the following RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that ZBTB16 knockdown resulted in the manifest transcriptomic change, characterized by downregulation of genes related to spermatogonial self-renewal as well as upregulation of differentiation genes, corroborating ZBTB16 as a factor crucial to porcine spermatogonial self-renewal. Later, by performing a CUT&Tag analysis, we identified the genomic targets of ZBTB16 in porcine immature spermatogonia, and the final integrative analysis for RNAseq and CUT&Tag data revealed the correlation of ZBTB16 with GDNF and mTOR signaling that facilitates porcine immature spermatogonial self-renewal. Altogether, our results enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms for spermatogonial self-renewal in pigs, thereby facilitating the in vitro culture of porcine SSCs.

AB  - Anti-M & uuml;llerian Hormone (AMH), secreted by granulosa cells (GCs) of preantral follicles, regulates early-stage follicle growth by inhibiting the activation of primordial follicles. While GCs facilitate follicle development and ovulation through estrogen and progesterone secretion, the role of AMH in sheep GCs and its impact on follicle development remains unclear. Here, we show that exogenous AMH inhibits primordial follicle development utilizing in vitro culture of fetal sheep ovarian cortex model. Knockdown of AMH in sheep GCs increases cell proliferation, decreases apoptosis, and elevates estradiol (E2) secretion, while overexpression has the opposite effects. RNA-seq analysis suggests that AMH modulates genes involved in cell cycle regulation and MAPK signaling. Notably, AMH downregulates estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) expression and suppresses FSH-induced upregulation of aromatase (CYP19A1). These findings demonstrate AMH regulates GCs function through multiple pathways, offering insights into sheep fertility and potential targets to enhance reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Immune maturation of broiler chickens may be affected by management, such as early life feeding strategy (early versus delayed nutrition) or by low or high sanitary conditions (LSC versus HSC). We compared systemic maternal (MAb), natural (NAb), natural auto- (NAAb), and antigen specific antibody (SpAb) levels (IgM, IgY) between broilers (n = 48 per treatment) that received early (EN) or delayed nutrition for 72 h (DN) housed in either low (LSC) or high sanitary conditions (HSC) between 7 and 35 d of age. We found minimal interactions between feeding strategy and sanitary conditions. At 7 d of age, broilers receiving EN compared with DN, had elevated levels of IgM binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), phosphoryl-conjugated ovalbumin (PC-OVA), and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), whereas effects of feeding strategy diminished at later ages. In LSC compared with HSC broilers, levels of NAb agglutinating RRBC and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were already elevated from 14 d of age onwards. At 33 d of age, antibody levels (NAb, NAAb, anti-LPS, anti-MDP) were all elevated in LSC, compared with HSC broilers, for both IgM and IgY, but not IgM against KLH. Western blotting revealed different binding patterns of NAAb against chicken liver homogenate, which may indicate that the NAAb repertoire is affected by antigenic pressure. Our data suggest that antibody levels are affected for an important part by environmental conditions (feeding strategy and sanitary conditions), but minimally by their interaction. However, it remains to be further studied whether the enhanced levels of antibodies as initiated by EN and LSC contribute to enhanced resistance to infectious diseases.

AB  - Yaks are often subject to long-term starvation and a high prevalence of respiratory diseases and mortality in the withered season, yet the mechanisms that cause this remain unclear. Research has demonstrated that fi-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) plays a significant role in regulating the immune system. Hence, we hypothesize that the low glucose and high BHB condition induced by severe starvation might have an effect on the pro-inflammatory response of the alveolar macrophages (AMs) in yaks. To validate our hypothesis, we isolated and identified primary AMs from freshly slaughtered yaks and cultured them in a medium with 5.5 mM of glucose or 2.8 mM of glucose plus 1-4 mM of BHB. Utilizing a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunoblot assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we evaluated the gene and protein expression levels of GPR109A (G-protein-coupled receptor 109A), NF-kappa B p65, p38, and PPAR gamma and the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the supernatant. The results demonstrated that AMs exposed to low glucose plus BHB had significantly higher levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05) and higher activity of the GPR109A/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. A pretreatment of either pertussis toxin (PTX, inhibitor of GPR109A) or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC, inhibitor of NF-kappa B p65) was effective in preventing the elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by low glucose plus BHB (p < 0.05). These results indicated that the low glucose plus BHB condition would induce an enhanced pro-inflammatory response through the activation of the GPR109A/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in primary yak AMs, which is probably the reason why yaks experience a higher rate of respiratory diseases and mortality. This study will offer new insight into the prevention and treatment of bovine respiratory diseases.

AB  - Background Genetically modified (GM) crops have become a common tool for managing insect pests of economic importance. However, before their commercialization, bio-safety evaluation on non-target arthropods such as pollinators and biological control agents is a pre-requisite to save services rendered by them in agro-ecosystem. Results In the present experiment, the potential adverse effects of Bt protein (Vip3Aa) were studied on the life table parameters (pupation and emergence rates, 7-day larval weights, larval development time, and adult weight) of a predatory beetle, Propylea japonica (Thunberg) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in the laboratory. P. japonica was exposed to Bt protein incorporated in synthetic diet at the rate of 200 mu g/g of fresh weight of diet. Temporal stability, bioactivity and the uptake of insecticidal protein were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a sensitive insect bioassay. The results indicated that pupation and adult emergence rates did not differ significantly from that of negative control (pure synthetic diet). Similarly, the fresh weight of male and female adults emerged in Vip3Aa treatment (2.87 mg and 3.86 mg, respectively) did not vary significantly from that of the negative control treatment (2.66 mg, 3.75 mg). However, the time taken by the larvae to complete their development (12.70 days) was significantly extended than that of the negative control (10.21 days). In contrast, the tested life-table parameters of P. japonica were adversely affected when fed on synthetic diet containing boric acid (positive control) indicating experimental fitness to detect adverse effects. Conclusions On the basis of the results, it is suggested that GM crops expressing Bt protein (Vip3Aa) are safe for non-target insects such as P. japonica and are compatible with other biological programs for the integrated management of insect pests.

AB  - Simple Summary Certain proteins present in semen regulate the reproductive physiology of females. Beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), which is abundantly expressed in the semen of camelids, has a potent ovulatory and luteotrophic effect in llamas after systemic injection. Here, we investigated the effects of intramuscular NGF during the preovulatory stage on endocrine parameters and pregnancy rates after artificial insemination in dairy heifers. Heifers injected with NGF showed enhancement of hormones related to ovulation and gestation maintenance. We also detected the enhancement of genes related to uterine receptivity and higher pregnancy rates. We conclude that the improvement in reproductive hormones related to gestation is possibly linked to the higher pregnancy rate detected here. More research is needed to ensure the NGF effects remain on commercial exploitation farms. The neurotrophin beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), which is present in the semen of different mammals, elicits potent ovulatory and luteotrophic actions in llamas following systemic administration. Here, we determine if purified NGF given intramuscularly (IM) during the preovulatory stage affects the corpus luteum (CL), hormone production, endometrial gene expression, and pregnancy rate of dairy heifers. Holstein-Friesian heifers were estrus-synchronized using estradiol benzoate (EB) plus an intravaginal progesterone (P4) device (DIB). After eight days, the device was removed and cloprostenol was given IM; the next day (day 9), heifers received EB IM plus one of the following: (i) 1 mg of NGF (NGF D9 group), (ii) 1 mg of NGF 32 h after EB (NGF D10 group), or (iii) phosphate buffer saline (control group). To measure pregnancy rates, heifers were treated similarly, then artificially inseminated with sexed semen 48-52 h after DIB removal, then an ultrasound was conducted 30 days after insemination. The females given NGF along with EB (NGF D9) showed significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, larger CL vascular areas, and higher plasma P4 concentrations than the NGF D10 and control animals. Downregulation of the P4 receptor (PGR), and upregulation of both lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and Solute Carrier Family 6 member 14 (SLC6A14) endometrial genes, were detected in NGF D9 heifers. Furthermore, these heifers had a 10% higher pregnancy rate than the control group. We conclude that the higher P4 output, in response to the early NGF administration, led to the enhanced gene expression of transcripts related to uterine receptivity that may result in enhanced pregnancy rates.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study investigated the effects of gardenia pomace on growth performance, blood metabolites, immune and antioxidant indices, and meat quality in Xiangcun pigs. Gardenia pomace supplementation improved the immunity and antioxidant capacities of the Xiangcun pigs and did not negatively affect the growth performance or meat quality of Xiangcun pigs. Gardenia pomace could potentially be used as an unconventional feedstuff in the diet of finishing pigs. To investigate the effect of gardenia pomace (GP) as an unconventional feed of antioxidants, 180 Xiangcun pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups during the finishing period, with 6 replicates per group and 10 pigs per replicate. During the 47-day feeding period, the pigs were fed either a control diet based on corn and soybean meal (control group), or the control diet added with 50 g/kg or 100 g/kg GP (groups GP5 and GP10, respectively). Feed and water were provided ad libitum. One pig per replicate was slaughtered and sampled. The effects on growth performance, meat quality, digestibility, metabolism, and immunity and antioxidant properties of the pigs were investigated. The results showed that GP had no significant effect on the growth performance of Xiangcun pigs. Compared with the control group, the digestibility of crude ash, phosphorus, and crude fibre of pigs in the GP groups improved (p < 0.01), and the content of inosinic acid in the longissimus dorsi muscle increased (p < 0.05). The addition of GP to the diet significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the liver and spleen, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the longissimus dorsi muscle and spleen (p < 0.05). Additionally, it significantly reduced the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and spleen (p < 0.05). The GP5 group had a higher inosinic acid content in the longissimus dorsi and lower levels of the inflammatory factor interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). The GP10 group had a higher IgA level (p < 0.05). Adding different proportions of GP to the diet improved the a* and b* of the longissimus dorsi muscles of Xiangcun pigs (p < 0.05). In summary, GP, as an unconventional feed, improved the apparent digestibility of the diet and body antioxidant capacity in Xiangcun pigs during the finishing period and did not negatively affect the growth performance or meat quality.

AB  - Simple Summary The mucus layer is an important part of the system protecting the gut against injuries and bacterial infections. The main components of mucus responsible for its properties are mucins. They are large glycoproteins with a protein core rich in threonine (Thr) and many sugar side chains that differ in structure and affect mucin functions. Diet composition affects the amount of secreted mucins and their quality. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of Thr and wheat gluten (WG) protein, added as a source of non-essential amino acids, on the content of tissue and luminal mucins in different parts of the intestine of young pigs. Results showed that tissue and luminal mucin content was only affected by WG levels in the duodenum and middle jejunum, and in the proximal colon, respectively. The effect of WG on luminal mucin content in the proximal colon depended on the analytical method applied. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of threonine (Thr) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA) levels on mucin secretion and sugar composition of digesta and crude mucin preparations analyzed in different segments of the gut in young pigs. A two-factorial experiment was conducted on 72 pigs using the following factors: Thr level (5.1, 5.7, 6.3 and 6.9 g standardized ileal digestible(SID) Thr/kg) and wheat gluten (WG) level used as a source of NEAA (20.4, 40.4 and 60.4 g WG protein in WG20, WG40 and WG60 diets, respectively). Mucin content was affected only by WG level. Tissue mucin content in the duodenum was higher in WG60 pigs than in WG20 and WG40 pigs, whereas in the middle jejunum was higher in WG40 and WG60 pigs than in WG20 pigs. In contrast, luminal crude mucin content in the proximal colon was lower in WG60 pigs compared to WG40 pigs. The lowest and highest Thr levels reduced arabinose and xylose contents and increased glucose content in ileal digesta. The highest WG level reduced arabinose and xylose contents and increased glucose content in ileal digesta. The lowest WG level increased mannose content in ileal digesta. WG60 level decreased the content of arabinose and galactose compared to lower WG levels in colonic digesta. Arabinose content was higher, while glucose and galactose contents were lower in crude mucin preparations isolated from colonic digesta in pigs fed diets containing the highest Thr level. The content of tissue mucin was higher in the ileum and proximal colon and lower in the duodenum than in the middle jejunum, whereas luminal mucin content was lower in the proximal colon than in the ileum. Ileal digesta contained less arabinose and glucose and more galactose as compared to colonic digesta. In conclusion, no effect of dietary Thr levels on mucin secretion in the gut of young pigs was found. Wheat gluten added to the diet with adequate Thr content positively affected mucin secretion only in the duodenum and middle jejunum.

AB  - The small red brocket deer, Mazama bororo Duarte, 1996 was described based on karyotypical and morphological characters. However, the original description of Mazama americana jucunda suggested that this subspecies could represent the same taxon as Mazama bororo. This assumption was based on the type locality of Mazama americana jucunda and on morphological similarities between Mazama americana jucunda and Mazama bororo. To solve this question, we obtained DNA sequences of the holotype of Mazama americana jucunda and compared it with other species of Mazama, including the holotype of M. bororo. A phylogenetic tree was obtained to verify the relationships among these taxa. The results clearly showed that M. americana jucunda and M. bororo represent the same biological entity. Therefore, the oldest name available for the small red brocket occurring in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil should be Mazama jucunda, remaining M. bororo as a junior synonym. We emphasise the importance of using DNA from museum specimens, especially from holotypes, in order to obtain a more accurate taxonomic identification. We also highlight the importance of application of valid names for labelling all aspects of biodiversity research, as well as for monitoring and conservation efforts.

AB  - The bacterial and archaeal communities of two full-scale biogas producing plants (P1 and P2), associated with a 999 kW cogeneration unit, both located in North Italy, were analyzed at start up and fully operating phases, by means of various molecular approaches: (i) Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis; (ii) cloning and sequencing of PCR amplicons of archaeal genes 16Srrna and mcrA; (iii) 16S rDNA high throughput next generation sequencing. P1 and P2 use the same technology and both were fed with cattle manure and corn silage. During the study of P1 also the post digester (fed with pig manure) was analyzed. The aim of this research was to characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities in two very similar plants to profile the core microbiota. The results of this analysis highlighted that the two plants (producing comparable quantities of volatile fatty acids, biogas, and energy) differed in anerobic microbiota (Bacteria and Archaea). Notably the methanogenic community of P1 was dominated by the strict acetoclastic Methanosaeta (Methanothrix) (up to 23.05%) and the unculturable Candidatus Methanofastidiosum (up to 32.70%), while P2 was dominated by the acetoclastic, but more substrate-versatile, Methanosarcina archaeal genus (49.19%). The data demonstrated that the performances of plants with identical design, in similar operating conditions, yielding comparable amount of biogas (average of 7237 m(3) day(-1) and 7916 m(3) day(-1) respectively for P1 and P2), VFA (1643 mg L-1 and 1634 mg L-1) and energy recovery (23.90-24 MWh day(-1)), depend on the stabilization of effective and functionally optimized methanogenic communities, but these communities are taxonomically different in the two biodigesters.

AB  - Simple Summary Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a protozoan parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. This parasite affects all warm-blooded animals. It is one of the more common causes of abortions in sheep, which threatens both the welfare of the animals and the economic sustainability of the farms. The virulence of different T. gondii isolates have been studied in mice and humans, but little information is available regarding sheep. The aim of this work was to study how the genetic variability of six T. gondii strains, that were recently isolated from Spanish sheep, affected different phenotypic traits in an in vitro model using ovine monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results showed that the type III isolates had a higher internalization/infection rate than type II isolates. Moreover, these two isolates also were shown to have higher increments in cytokines that favored inflammation and a Th1 immune response. The results of this study differ with earlier findings in mouse models and in vitro investigations, as well as from results between the same genotypes and different genotypes; proving that more phenotypic traits are needed for the study of the virulence of T. gondii isolates. Ovine toxoplasmosis is one the most relevant reproductive diseases in sheep. The genetic variability among different Toxoplasma gondii isolates is known to be related to different degrees of virulence in mice and humans, but little is known regarding its potential effects in sheep. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetic variability (types II (ToxoDB #1 and #3) and III (#2)) of six recently isolated strains that showed different phenotypic traits both in a normalized mouse model and in ovine trophoblasts, in ovine monocyte-derived macrophages and the subsequent transcript expression of cytokines and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase). The type III isolate (TgShSp24) showed the highest rate of internalization, followed by the type II clonal isolate (TgShSp2), while the type II PRU isolates (TgShSp1, TgShSp3, TgShSp11 and TgShSp16) showed the lowest rates. The type II PRU strains, isolated from abortions, exhibited higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS than those obtained from the myocardium of chronically infected sheep (type II PRU strains and type III), which had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present results show the existence of significant intra- and inter-genotypic differences in the parasite-macrophage relationship that need to be confirmed in in vivo experiments.

AB  - Installing conservation fences to prohibit feral animal access to wetlands can become a barrier for non-target species of interest. We collected 161 turtles (Chelodina rugosa, Emydura subglobosa worrelli, Myuchelys latisternum) from twenty floodplain and riverine wetlands during post-wet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) surveys (2015-2018) in northern Australia. Wetlands were fenced (150 x 150 mm square, 1.05 m high wire mesh) or unfenced around the wet perimeter. Ninety-seven percent of individuals caught in either fenced or unfenced wetlands had a shell carapace width greater than mesh width, of these 44 (46%) were captured inside fenced wetlands, while 50 were caught in unfenced wetlands. The remaining 35 turtles were smaller than 150 mm and would likely pass easily through fence mesh. Sixty-five turtles partook in a fencing manipulative experiment. Turtles with carapace widths wider than mesh often successfully escaped through fences by lifting one side of their shell and passing diagonally through the mesh. In a second experiment where a piece of vertical wire (1500 x 300 mm) was removed, turtles located 'gates' after prospecting and fitting through meshing areas that were too small to pass. Ninety-two percent of turtles were able to locate and pass through gates, while 8% failed to locate a gate after 2 h. Gates applied every 4 m showed an 83% passage rate, every 2 m was 91%, and every 1 m was 100%. Combing field and manipulative experiments revealed that large turtles will prospect and move along a fence until they find suitable passage, which has important consequences when considering that gates could be easily retrofitted to existing sites, as well in new fencing programs, which has enormous positive conservation benefits for turtles in an already challenging and changing floodplain environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Increasing growth traits can impact the economic benefit of livestock. Polymorphisms can offer us potential molecular markers for the growth traits of cattle, and provide a reference for cultivating an improved cattle population according to the markers in the future. In this study, the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor gene polymorphism is significantly associated with the body conformation traits of Chinese Dabieshan cattle, and it could be used as a candidate genetic marker for body conformation trait selection in cattle. This study further verified that the GHRHR gene plays a vital role in Chinese cattle, and provides a data basis for the research and improvement of cattle breeding programs in China. This study was performed to expose the polymorphisms of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor gene in Chinese Dabieshan cattle, evaluate its effect on body conformation traits, and find potential molecular markers in Chinese cattle. The GHRHR structure and the phylogenetic tree were analyzed using bioinformatics software. The polymorphism of the GHRHR gene in 486 female cattle was genotyped by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing, and the association between SNPs and body conformation traits of Chinese Dabieshan cattle was analyzed by one-way ANOVA in SPSS software. GHRHR was often conserved in nine species, and its sequence of cattle was closest to sheep and goats. Six polymorphic SNPs were identified, g.10667A > C and g.10670A > C were missense mutation. The association analysis indicated that the six SNPs significantly influenced the body conformation traits of Chinese Dabieshan cattle (p < 0.05). Six haplotypes were identified and Hap1 (-CAACGA-) had the highest frequency (36.10%). The Hap3/5 (-GCCCCCGGAAGG-) exhibited a significantly greater wither height (WH), hip height (HH), heart girth (HG), and hip width (HW) (p < 0.05). Overall, the polymorphisms of GHRHR affected the body conformation traits of Chinese Dabieshan cattle, and the GHRHR gene could be used as a molecular marker in Dabieshan cattle breeding programs.

AB  - Mistletoes are ecologically important parasitic plants, with > 1600 species from five lineages worldwide. Mistletoe lineages exhibit distinct patterns of species diversification and host specificity, however, the mechanisms underlying these differences are poorly understood. In this study, we analysed a comprehensive parasite-host network, including 280 host species from 60 families and 22 mistletoe species from two lineages (Santalaceae and Loranthaceae) in Xishuangbanna, located in a biodiversity hotspot of tropical Asia. We identified the factors that predict the infection strength of mistletoes. We also detected host specificity and the phylogenetic signal of mistletoes and their hosts. We found that this interaction network could be largely explained by a model based on the relative abundance of species. Host infection was positively correlated with diameter at breast height and tree coverage, but negatively correlated with wood density. Overall, closely related mistletoe species tend to interact more often with similar hosts. However, the two lineages showed a significantly different network pattern. Rates of host generality were higher in Loranthaceae than in Santalaceae, although neither lineage showed phylogenetic signal for host generality. This study demonstrates that the neutral interaction hypothesis provides suitable predictions of the mistletoe-host interaction network, and mistletoe species show significant phylogenetic signals for their hosts. Our findings also indicate that high species diversification in Loranthaceae may be explained by high rates of host generality and the evolutionary history shared by Loranthaceae species with diverse host plants in the tropics.

AB  - Decreased agricultural diversity from extensive use of the corn (Zea mays L.)- soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation and occasional inclusion of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), has threatened cropping system sustainability. Using specialty oilseeds crops to extend the corn-soybean rotation might improve yields and promote sustainability. We tested whether corn, soybean, and wheat yields would be improved in a rotation following oilseed crops versus corn or soybean. In Phase 1, replicated blocks of nine different flowering oilseeds and two traditional grain crops (corn and soybean) were grown. In phase 2, corn, soybean, and wheat were planted in replicated blocks perpendicular to the previous year crops. This 2-year rotation was repeated for three site-years, two in Morris, MN and one in Brookings, SD. Soil water balance was evaluated during Phase 1 of the rotation to determine seasonal water use. Potential N mineralization was measured in the spring prior to planting in a subset of phase 1 treatments (spring canola, cuphea, corn, and soybean). Linear mixed models were used to analyze Phase 2 corn, soybean and wheat yield responses to previous crop. N dynamics and water use responses to phase 1 crops were also analyzed with mixed models. Corn yield was higher with any previous crop other than corn. Soybean and wheat yields did not significantly respond to previous crop. Yield patterns were partially explained by N mineralization potential and previous crop water use. Spring canola treatments provided higher potential net nitrification compared to corn. Canola, camelina, borage, and crambe had lower seasonal water use than both corn and soybean in at least one site-year. This short-term study indicated that corn and soybean yields following specialty oilseed crops had similar yields to a traditional corn-soybean rotation. Further, oilseed crops in rotation provided additional environmental benefits.

AB  - Climate change poses challenges for plant species in less hospitable regions, yet resilient varieties like Camelina sativa may thrive. This study, conducted during the winter seasons of 2016-17 and 2017-18 across three locations in the Pothwar region, Pakistan, aimed to assess Camelina sativa's adaptability to varying environments and macronutrient levels. Employing five nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) rates alongside a constant potassium (K) rate, the experiment utilized a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement. Results indicated significant effects from all factors tested (NPK levels, locations, and years). Application of NPK @ 50:30:20 kg ha(-1 )notably enhanced plant height (119.45cm), pod count per plant (804.8), seeds per pod (19.9), thousand seed weight (1.84 g), seed yield (1789 kg ha(-1)), and biological yield (7952.7 kg ha(-1)). Conversely, control treatments yielded minimal results. Furthermore, NARC exhibited the tallest plants (94.7cm) and highest biological yield (7708 kg ha(-1)), while Talagang showed superior attributes such as pod count per plant (449.9), seeds per pod (14.7), thousand seed weight (1.41g), and seed yield (1437 kg ha(-1)).Oil content decreased with rising NPK levels, while protein content displayed an inverse relationship. NPK @ 50:30:20 kg ha(-1 )resulted in lower oil content (40.8%), but higher protein content (34.1%) compared to controls. Overall, oil and protein content exhibited a negative correlation and responded significantly to NPK variations. Application of NPK fertilizers notably improved Camelina growth, yield, and quality traits across precipitation levels. NPK fertilizers (50:30:20 kg ha(-1)) enhanced Camelina yield attributes under diverse precipitation conditions.

AB  - L-carnitine, an increasingly vital compound in livestock nutrition, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the beta -oxidation of fatty acids. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of L-carnitine supplementation, administered at varying doses, on pregnancy toxemia susceptible goats. A total of 150 goats underwent estrus synchronization, natural mating, and pregnancy confirmation. Among these, 90 goats carrying multiple fetuses were categorized into three groups on the 100th day of pregnancy, with their feed supplemented as follows: CAR50 (50 mg/kg of L-carnitine), CAR100 (100 mg/kg of L-carnitine), and CON (control without Lcarnitine). Subsequently, blood samples were collected from 15 randomly selected goats from each group on days 100, 115, 130, and 145 of pregnancy to quantify serum levels of beta-HBA (beta-hydroxybutyrate) and NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids), alongside glucose levels. Dietary supplementation of L-carnitine did not exert a significant impact on blood glucose levels in the CAR50 and CAR100 groups, in comparison to the CON group, during the third trimester of pregnancy (P>0.05). Nevertheless, serum NEFA levels exhibited a noteworthy reduction in the CAR50 and CAR100 groups compared to the CON group on day 145 (P<0.01). Furthermore, no substantial fluctuations in mean NEFA and beta-HBA levels were observed in the CAR100 group between days 100 and 145 of gestation (P>0.05). The body condition score exhibited consistent maintenance both within and between groups (P>0.05). To conclude, this study underscores the efficacy of dietary supplementation with L-carnitine in mitigating ketone and NEFA levels in pregnant goats, particularly when administered at a dosage of 100 mg/kg. Consequently, the integration of a standardized quantity of Lcarnitine into the diet holds the potential to serve as a valuable preventive strategy for goats susceptible to pregnancy toxemia.

AB  - The pollution generated by the heavy metals (HM) contained in mining wastes (tailings) is a worldwide recognized environmental concern. Due to the persistence, toxicity, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification capacity through the food chains, the release of HM into the environment causes negative effects on human health and the ecosystems. Wigandia urens Kunth (Boraginaceae) is a plant species that naturally establishes and grows in tailings and is consumed by the grasshopper Sphenarium purpurascens Charpentier (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae). HM accumulation in this plant and their subsequent consumption by defoliating insects allow these contaminants to enter the food webs and favor their biomagnification. This study evaluated the effect of HM bioaccumulation in the leaf tissue of W. urens on the characteristics associated with its physical defense against herbivores and the effect of HM exposure on population parameters of grasshoppers through their ontogeny under controlled conditions. The results showed a significant increase in leaf hardness and in the number of simple and glandular trichomes in the leaves of W. urens growing on mine tailing substrate compared to those grown on the control substrate without HM. W. urens individuals growing on mine tailing substrate presented the following heavy metal foliar bioaccumulation pattern: Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu. These metals were also bioaccumulated in individuals of S. purpurascens fed with leaves of the plants exposed to mine tailings, observing differences in their concentration pattern through ontogeny. Grasshoppers fed on leaf tissue containing HM showed higher mortality in the first two developmental instars and lower body biomass throughout their ontogeny in comparison to the individuals fed on leaf tissue of plants growing on the control treatment without HM. In conclusion, W. urens is a species with phytoremediation potential for soils contaminated with HM, since it is naturally established in contaminated sites, has a wide geographic distribution, and bioaccumulates significant amounts of different HM. Furthermore, as was observed in this report, the W. urens physical and chemical defense against herbivores was enhanced by HM exposure, compromising the fitness and development of the herbivore S. purpurascens through its ontogeny and thus interrupting the entry and transfer of heavy metal through the food chain.

AB  - Termites are eusocial insects that host a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gut symbionts and can differentiate into a range of caste phenotypes. Soldier caste differentiation from termite workers follows two successive molts (worker-presoldier-soldier) that are driven at the endocrine level by juvenile hormone (JH). Although physiological and eusocial mechanisms tied to JH signaling have been studied, the role of gut symbionts in the caste differentiation process is poorly understood. Here, we used the JH analog methoprene in combination with the antibiotic kanamycin to manipulate caste differentiation and gut bacterial loads in Reticulitermes flavipes termites via four bioassay treatments: kanamycin, methoprene, kanamycin+methoprene, and an untreated (negative) control. Bioassay results demonstrated a significantly higher number of presoldiers in the methoprene treatment, highest mortality in kanamycin+methoprene treatment, and significantly reduced protist numbers in all treatments except the untreated control. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing provided alpha and beta diversity results that mirrored bioassay findings. From ANCOM analysis, we found that several bacterial genera were differentially abundant among treatments. Finally, follow-up experiments showed that if methoprene and kanamycin or untreated termites are placed together, zero or rescued presoldier initiation, respectively, occurs. These findings reveal that endogenous JH selects for symbiont compositions required to successfully complete presoldier differentiation. However, if the gut is voided before the influx of JH, it cannot select for the necessary symbionts that are crucial for molting. Based on these results, we are able to provide a novel example of linkages between gut microbial communities and host phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - The temporal dynamics of insect populations in agroecosystems are influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic interactions, including trophic interactions in complex food webs. Predicting the regulation of herbivorous insect pests by arthropod predators and parasitoids would allow for rendering crop production less dependent on chemical pesticides. Curtsdotter et al. (2019) developed a food-web model simulating the influences of naturally occurring arthropod predators on aphid population dynamics in cereal crop fields. The use of an allometric hypothesis based on the relative body masses of the prey and various predator guilds reduced the number of estimated parameters to just five, albeit field-specific. Here, we extend this model and test its applicability and predictive capacity. We first parameterized the original model with a dataset with the dynamic arthropod community compositions in 54 fields in six regions in France. We then integrated three additional biological functions to the model: parasitism, aphid carrying capacity and suboptimal high temperatures that reduce aphid growth rates. We developed a multi-field calibration approach to estimate a single set of generic allometric parameters for a given group of fields, which would increase model generality needed for predictions. The original and revised models, when using field-specific parameterization, achieved quantitatively good fits to observed aphid population dynamics for 59% and 53% of the fields, respectively, with pseudo-R2 up to 0.99. But the multi-field calibration showed that increased model generality came at the cost of reduced model reliability (goodness-of-fit). Our study highlights the need to further improve our understanding of how body size and other traits affect trophic interactions in food webs. It also points up the need to acquire high-resolution data to use this type of modelling approach. We propose that a hypothesis-driven strategy of model improvement based on the integration of additional biological functions and additional functional traits beyond body size (e.g., predator space search or prey defences) into the food-web matrix can improve model reliability.
   They have shown that this ATN model is not yet at the stage where it can be generally and easily applied to the real world. They propose to improve our knowledge of high-quality data acquisition and to better understand the traits useful for predicting trophic interactions.image

AB  - Premise: While some studies have found leaf variegation to reduce photosynthetic capacity, others showed that it can increase photosynthesis. Thus, what maintains variegation remains an open question. Two primary hypotheses-the anti-herbivory and abiotic heterogeneity hypotheses-have been posited, yet little empirical research explicitly investigates the maintenance of naturally occurring variegation. Methods: We used field surveys, image analysis, and climatic associations to explore the anti-herbivory and abiotic heterogeneity hypotheses in 21 populations of Hexastylis heterophylla and H. shuttleworthii, both polymorphic for leaf variegation. We measured the frequency of variegated individuals, variegation intensity, and herbivory for each morph, assessed abiotic correlates with variegation, and measured photosynthetic efficiency. Results: We found a strong elevational cline in leaf variegation strongly linked with abiotic heterogeneity; variegation was more common in lower-elevation populations characterized by higher temperatures, UV-B exposure, seasonal light change, and drier, more basic soils. Variegated and nonvariegated individuals experienced similar levels of herbivory. Morphs had similar photosynthetic quantum yields. However, nonvariegated leaves experienced more nonphotochemical quenching, an indication of photoinhibition, and had higher surface temperatures under high light. Conclusions: Our results suggest that variegation may serve as an adaptation to high temperatures and light conditions and can reduce photoinhibition in certain environmental contexts. Thus, abiotic factors can maintain variegation in wild populations and shape geographic clines in variegation.

AB  - Cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), is native to the southern United States and widespread throughout regions where cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is commercially grown. It is considered a major cotton pest only in certain cotton-growing regions, while in other areas it rarely reaches pest status. Bacterial symbionts associated with sucking insects have been linked to their pest status on their insect hosts. We tested whether variation in bacterial communities within P. seriatus correlated with pest status of the insect on cotton. We used 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene to characterize the bacterial microbiota associated with P. seriatus from eight cotton-growing regions in the United States. We found 65 bacterial taxa in the dataset, and three phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota, accounted for 78.5, 16.3, and 4.6% of the bacterial community. Overall bacterial composition and diversity did not correlate with P. seriatus pest status or geographical origin. However, abundances of three taxa, Spiroplasma sp., Swaminathania, sp., and Aureimonas sp., were significantly different between regions in which P. seriatus occurs as major versus occasional pest. We found Pseudomonas spp. in all samples, with different strains/species in different samples, suggesting variant Pseudomonas could be a primary endosymbiont of P. seriatus. Characterization of the P. seriatus bacterial microbiota showed it was distinct from other well-characterized hemipteran herbivores. Whether variation in microbiota corresponds with variation in traits relevant to pest control warrants further investigation.

AB  - Sheep (Ovis aries), among the first domesticated species, are now globally widespread and exhibit remarkable adaptability to diverse environments. In this study, we perform whole-genome sequencing of 266 animals from 18 distinct Chinese sheep populations, each displaying unique phenotypes indicative of adaptation to varying environmental conditions. Integrating 131 environmental factors with single nucleotide polymorphism variations, we conduct a comprehensive genetic-environmental association analysis. This analysis identifies 35 key genes likely integral to the environmental adaptation of sheep. The functions of these genes include fat tail formation (HOXA10, HOXA11, JAZF1), wool characteristics (FER, FGF5, MITF, PDE4B), horn phenotypes (RXFP2), reproduction (HIBADH, TRIM71, C6H4orf22), and growth traits (ADGRL3, TRHDE). Notably, we observe a significant correlation between the frequency of missense mutations in the PAPSS2 and RXFP2 genes and variations in altitude. Our study reveals candidate genes for adaptive variation in sheep and demonstrates the diversity in how sheep adapt to their environment.

AB  - The efficacy and high specificity of the RNA interference pathway has prompted its exploration as a potential molecular management tool for many insect pests, including the destructive southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, in which gene knockdown and mortality via double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) have already been demonstrated in the laboratory. The nucleotide sequence of dsRNAs requires an exact match of at least 16 nucleotides with the targeted messenger RNA to trigger knockdown of that gene. This allows vital genes in a target pest to be silenced and mortality induced while reducing the probability of adverse effects in nontarget organisms. However, prior to utilization in forest ecosystems, demonstration of the specificity of dsRNAs through laboratory bioassays evaluating potential nontarget effects on model insects is required for proper risk assessment analyses. Consequently, we evaluated three SPB-specific dsRNAs for lethal effects, sublethal effects (larval growth rate, adult emergence or adult fecundity), and relative gene expression in three model nontarget insects representing key functional guilds, including a predator, herbivore, and pollinator. The SPB-specific dsRNAs had no effect on survival of our nontarget insects. Additionally, no sublethal effects were found and the gene expression analyses corroborated bioinformatic analyses in finding no gene knockdown. Our findings support the high specificity of RNAi technology and provide support for its development and deployment for protection of conifer forests against SPB with minimal nontarget concerns.

AB  - Objective: The presentation of a novel prospective treatment for scenarios where bubble presence in the bloodstream poses a clinical risk. The method relies on generating resonant acoustic standing waves within a limb to non-invasively accelerate the dissolution of bubbles present in the bloodstream via bubble rupture. Additionally, a preliminary assessment of the effects of the resonant acoustic waves and bubble rupture events on red blood cell viability is provided.
   Methods: Two semicircular piezoelectric (PZT) transducers electrically connected to each other were assembled around a small-girth segment of a rear thigh removed from a swine specimen. When driven at the frequency of electric resonance, this swine thigh and PZT transducer arrangement generates resonant acoustic standing waves within the swine thigh. Consequently, mechanical resonance of the system was non-invasively established by monitoring the electric response of the PZT to the applied frequency. The resonant acoustic field generated was used for the detection and rupture of bubbles that travel through a simulated blood vessel installed across the swine thigh. Two sets of experiments were carried out using this methodology, one with the artificial blood vessel filled with saline solution and one with defibrinated sheep blood. For the latter case, a preliminary hematologic assessment was done with red blood cell counts.
   Conclusion: Resonant acoustic standing waves effectively rupture bubbles of 300 mu m to 900 mu m within a simplified swine thigh model. The average dissolved gas content was 44% due to resonant acoustic waves at powers above 20W. No significant effect on red blood cell counts was observed.

AB  - Various prenatal factors including the number of littermates (fraternity size) and exposure to male littermate (fraternity sex ratio) during fetal period have been reported to influence postnatal fertility in the mammals. The present research was conducted to study the association of fraternity size and sex ratio with reproductive performance of nulliparous ewes and does. To this end, data associated with number of littermates, exposure to male littermate, birth weight, age at first pregnancy, as well as litter size, sex ratio of offspring, litter weight, and birth weight of female and male offspring after the first parturition retrieved from the database of sheep (n = 536 Romane and 289 Blanche du Massif Central ewes) and goat (n = 174 Alpine and 267 Saanen does) flocks. Fraternity size was negatively associated with birth weight of ewes and does (P < 0.05). Exposure to male littermate during fetal period was associated with younger age at first pregnancy and larger litter size in the does (P < 0.05), but not in the ewes (P > 0.05). Exposure to male littermate during fetal period was positively associated with the odds of male-biased litters in the ewes and does (P < 0.05). Fraternity size was positively associated with litter weight in the does (P < 0.05), but not in the ewes (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the present study showed that the number and sex of littermates during fetal period could impact postnatal reproduction of ewes and does. In this context, some associations, particularly those related to exposure to male littermate during fetal period, were only observed in does, which implicates that the effect of androgens on developmental programming of reproduction may be species-specific.

AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) stores defensive compounds in glands covering its leaves and other tissues. The density and the chemical filling of these glands increase systematically in developing leaves in response to herbivory on older leaves. Cotton seedlings are known to respond more strongly to actual caterpillar herbivory than to mere physical damage. It is not clear whether this amplified response is linked to insect-derived elicitors or difference in damage properties. To investigate this, we assessed the effect of repeated artificial damage without and with application of regurgitant from Spodoptera exigua caterpillars. Repeated mechanical damage led to a systemic increase of gland density, gland size, and content of defensive terpenes, with no detectable additional elicitation upon regurgitant treatment. Dual choice feeding assays further showed that defense induction triggered by just physical damage made newly developing leaves far less palatable to S. exigua larvae as compared to leaves from undamaged seedlings, whereas they did not distinguish between leaves from damaged plants treated with or without regurgitant. Our study confirms that the systemic induction of cotton glands is an unspecific response to physical damage, although cotton is known to respond to caterpillar-associated elicitors for other defensive traits. Cotton glands induction can be readily visualized under modest magnification, making the experiments described in this study highly suited to teach chemical ecology and aspects of plant defense theory in practical classes.

AB  - In modern Western societies, consumers are often disconnected from the animal origins of meat, which facilitates meat consumption by reducing empathy towards animals, and feelings of disgust and guilt. Conversely, animal advocates may appeal to meat's animal origins to evoke moral emotions that discourage meat consumption. This preregistered study investigated the effectiveness of such meat-animal reminders among 421 meat-eating participants from the UK, recruited via Prolific. Participants were randomly exposed to one of three images: a pork chop without animal reminder (control condition), a pork chop paired with a human petting a pig (animal caring appeal) or paired with a human stunning a pig before slaughter (animal cruelty appeal). Based on harm-based accounts of moral judgment, we measured moral emotions oriented to the pig victim (e.g., empathy, sadness), the human perpetrator (e.g., anger, disgust) and the self (e.g., guilt, shame), and examined their effects on participants' willingness to change pork chop consumption and tendency to justify pork-eating. ANOVA analysis revealed that both animal appeals (vs. control) increased moral emotions, while mediation analyses indicated that these emotions indirectly decreased pork-eating justification and increased willingness for dietary change. The animal cruelty appeal seemed particularly effective by evoking perpetrator-and victim-oriented emotions. However, we also found evidence of counteractive effects on pork-eating justification and willingness for dietary change once moral emotions were controlled for, suggesting moral disengagement. Hedonic motivations to eat meat remain a significant barrier. Future research should further explore interventions that enable consumers to translate moral concerns into lasting dietary change.

AB  - Phenological mismatch can occur when plants and herbivores differentially respond to changing phenological cues, such as temperature or snow melt date. This often shifts herbivore feeding to plant stages of lower quality. How herbivores respond to plant quality may be also mediated by temperature, which could lead to temperature-by-phenology interactions. We examined how aphid abundance and mutualism with ants were impacted by temperature and host plant phenology. In this study system, aphids Aphis asclepiadis colonize flowering stalks of the host plant, Ligusticum porteri. Like other aphids, abundance of this species is dependent on ant protection. To understand how host plant phenology and temperature affect aphid abundance, we used a multiyear observational study and a field experiment. We observed 20 host plant populations over five years (2017-2021), tracking temperature and snow melt date as well as host plant phenology and insect abundance. We found host plant and aphid phenology to differentially respond to temperature and snow melt timing. Early snow melt accelerated host plant phenology to a greater extent than aphid phenology, which was more responsive to temperature. Both the likelihood of aphid colony establishment and ant recruitment were reduced when aphids colonized host plants at post-flowering stages. In 2019, we experimentally accelerated host plant phenology by advancing snow melt date by two weeks. We factorially combined this treatment with open top warming chambers surrounding aphid colonies. Greatest growth occurred for colonies under ambient temperatures when they occurred on host plants at the flowering stage. Altogether, our results suggest that phenological mismatch with host plants can decrease aphid abundance, and this effect is exacerbated by temperature increases and changes to the ant-aphid mutualism.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of neonatal exposure to endocrine-active compounds (EACs): flutamide (antiandrogen), 4-tert-octylphenol (an estrogenic compound), and methoxychlor (an organochlorine insecticide exhibiting estrogenic, antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities) on androgen production within porcine adrenal glands. The expression of genes related to androgen synthesis and the level of androgen production were analyzed (i) in the adrenal glands of piglets exposed to EACs during the first 10 days of life (in vivo study), and (ii) in adrenal explants from sow-fed or formula-fed 10-day-old piglets incubated with EACs (ex vivo study). EACs affected the expression of genes linked to adrenal androgen biosynthesis. The prominent effect of methoxychlor on downregulation of StAR, CYP11A1 and HSD3B and upregulation of CYP17A1 and SULT2A1 were demonstrated. Furthermore, our study revealed divergent response to EACs between sow-fed and formula-fed piglets, suggesting that natural feeding may provide protection against adverse EACs effects, particularly those interfering with estrogens action.

AB  - Long-term application of biosolids to agricultural soil results in the slow accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), which are regulated by maximum permitted limit values to protect human health and the environment. Two programmes of UK government-funded (MAFF/DoE) research were commissioned in the 1990s to investigate the safety of the controls on PTEs in relation to the potential transfer to the food chain via the animal ingestion route by sheep grazing biosolids-amended soil. Here, we re-examine this evidence in the light of other recent research and revised food quality standards, to determine the significance of lead (Pb) accumulation in soil from the agricultural use of biosolids. Direct ingestion of biosolids-amended soil is the main transfer pathway of Pb to grazing livestock. The concentrations of Pb in muscle tissue of animals grazing biosolids-amended soil observed in the MAFF/DoE trials, and reported in the scientific literature, were generally small and similar to background, control values. Lambs and ewes ingesting biosolids-amended soil with a total Pb concentration > 200 mg kg(-1) dry soil at a rate of 10 % in the diet exceeded the current maximum permitted concentration of Pb in offal (0.5 mg kg(-1) fresh weight). However, the decline in PTE concentrations found in biosolids, due to improved industrial practices and stricter controls on the emissions of contaminants to the environment in general and wastewater in particular, has mitigated the risk of Pb accumulation above the food quality standard for this element in offal. Given the significant improvements in biosolids quality, and particularly in the Pb content, regulatory soil and sludge limits for Pb are no longer likely to have a practical or significant impact on the amount of Pb entering the food chain through the animal ingestion route from biosolids-amended agricultural soil.

AB  - Simple Summary The transition from milk to solid feed in commercial pig-production systems negatively affects gut health, particularly the composition of the residing microbial community. This can subsequently impair pig growth and long-term health. Natural dietary supplements including seaweed extracts have the capacity to reduce pathogen load (antibacterial activity) and/or increase beneficial microbes (prebiotic activity). This study evaluated the antibacterial and prebiotic potential of two seaweed species, Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria digitata, and their extracts using laboratory-based simulations of the gut microbial community of weaned pigs. Our investigation identified seaweed extracts that could decrease the numbers of pig- and food-related pathogens or increase the number of beneficial microbes, albeit to a different extent. These findings indicate that seaweeds are a promising source of antibacterial and prebiotic dietary supplements for use in pigs during the weaning period. Laminaria spp. and their extracts have preventative potential as dietary supplements during weaning in pigs. The first objective of this study was to evaluate increasing concentrations of four whole seaweed biomass samples from two different Laminaria species harvested in two different months in a weaned pig faecal batch fermentation assay. Particularly, February and November whole seaweed biomass samples of L. hyperborea (LHWB-F and LHWB-N) and L. digitata (LDWB-F and LDWB-N) were used. In the next part of the study, the increasing concentrations of four extracts produced from L. hyperborea (LHE1-4) and L. digitata (LDE1-4) were evaluated in individual pure-culture growth assays using a panel of beneficial and pathogenic bacterial strains (second objective). The LHE1-4 and LDE1-4 were obtained using different combinations of temperature, incubation time and volume of solvent within a hydrothermal-assisted extraction methodology (E1-4). In the batch fermentation assay, the L. hyperborea biomass samples, LHWB-F and LHWB-N, lowered Bifidobacterium spp. counts compared to the L. digitata biomass samples, LDWB-F and LDWB-N (p < 0.05). LHWB-F and LDWB-N reduced Enterobacteriaceae counts (p < 0.05). LHWB-F and LDWB-F were selected as the most and least promising sources of antibacterial extracts from which to produce LHE1-4 and LDE1-4. In the pure-culture growth assays, E1- and E4-produced extracts were predominantly associated with antibacterial and bifidogenic activities, respectively. LHE1 reduced both Salmonella Typhimurium and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli with LDE1 having a similar effect on both of these pathogenic strains, albeit to a lesser extent (p < 0.05). Both LHE1 and LDE1 reduced B. thermophilum counts (p < 0.05). LDE4 exhibited strong bifidogenic activity (p < 0.05), whereas LHE4 increased Bifidobacterium thermophilum and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum counts (p < 0.05). In conclusion, antibacterial and bifidogenic extracts of Laminaria spp. were identified in vitro with the potential to alleviate gastrointestinal dysbiosis in newly weaned pigs.

AB  - The efficiency of different plant defenses is expected to vary depending on the combination and abundance of herbivores. Effectiveness of ant-mediated defenses can also depend on ant activity and local ant assemblage, which can vary due to human activities such as intensive grazing. We used the plant Crotalaria pallida (Fabaceae), its two pod-boring herbivores and the ants that visit the extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) to understand how chemical defense and ant-plant associations affect plant damage. We hypothesized causal relationships between plant chemical defense, ant presence on plants and herbivore damage in scenarios of constitutive and induced plant defenses and tested the different possible relationships using path analysis. The constitutive model explained the data more adequately, and each plant defense had different effects on each herbivore species. First, chemical defense significantly reduced damage by the generalist pod borer Etiella zinckenella but not by the specialist Utetheisa ornatrix. Second, ant presence reduced damage by the generalist, but had no effect on damage by the specialist. Third, a larger number of pods on the plant increased ant presence, as expected since more pods results in more EFNs. Finally, we show that these density-dependent responses by ants mediate indirect cascades on herbivory and generate context-specific responses reducing damage by E. zinckenella in sites with cattle grazing. In synthesis, we highlight that plant defenses have distinct effects on co-occurring herbivores and that indirect defenses can mediate ecological cascades that generate context dependency in the efficiency of different defenses.

AB  - Pleistocene vertebrate faunas have long been known from the island of Timor but have rarely been studied. In particular, dwarf elephant-like proboscideans such as Stegodon were once widespread across the island, including to the Atambua Basin, but the cause of their extinction is unknown. Here, we document the fossil Pleistocene fauna of this basin with their palaeoenvironmental context. We also investigate the possibility of human-Stegodon chronological overlap. Our methods include field survey, excavation, pollen analysis, and U-series dating. Palaeoenvironmental data based on geomorphology and hydrological information show a transition from marine to fluvial depositional conditions in the basin during Pleistocene. Pollen data supports this interpretation and shows a clear shift from mangrove to terrestrial vegetation types. Palaeoclimatic conditions after the transition are characterized by a high humidity with high-flow water across the basin. Fossils of vertebrate faunas are restricted to fluvially-derived sandstone units. Meanwhile lithic artefacts were recorded widely across the basin, in the from of surface finds. There is so far no example of direct association of lithic artefacts with extinct Pleistocene faunas. Direct dating of the vertebrate fossils suggest they came from the Middle Pleistocene or earlier, and consequently pre-date the oldest current records of modern human existence on the island similar to 45,000 years ago.

AB  - Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are essential pollinators in a wide range of ecosystems, including agricultural systems. Addressing the critical knowledge gap in species-specific nutritional requirements, which leads to inconsistent colony development in native bumblebees like Bombus eximius, this study investigated the effects of pollen diet on microcolony development and reproduction. We examined the effects of three monofloral pollen diets, namely, Brassica napus, Camellia sinensis, and Zea mays, on worker egg-laying, drone larval development, lifespan, and gene expression. Our findings revealed that pollen nutritional quality significantly affected reproductive output, including the preoviposition period (time to first egg) and oviposition periods (duration of egg-laying), as well as offspring development in bumblebees. Worker bees fed C. sinensis and B. napus pollen exhibited significantly higher expression of the vitellogenin (encoding a yolk protein precursor crucial for oocyte development and egg production) and hexamerin (encoding a major storage protein vital for development and amino acid reserves) genes in their abdomens than did those fed Z. mays pollen. Microcolonies fed C. sinensis pollen demonstrated the highest reproductive success, the shortest mean semi-generation time, and the longest lifespan, indicating its superior nutritional quality for B. eximius. These results highlight the critical role of pollen nutrition in bumblebee health and suggest that C. sinensis pollen could enhance the performance of managed bumblebee colonies.

AB  - Threatened animal taxa are often absent from most of their original habitats, meaning their ecological niche cannot be fully captured by contemporary data alone. Although DNA metabarcoding of scats and coprolites (palaeofaeces) can identify the past and present species interactions of their depositors, the usefulness of coprolites in conservation biology is untested as few endangered taxa have known coprolite records. Here, we perform multilocus metabarcoding sequencing and palynological analysis of dietary plants of >100 coprolites (estimated to date from c. 400-1900 A.D.) and > 100 frozen scats (dating c. 1950 A.D. to present) of the critically endangered, flightless, herbivorous kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a species that disappeared from its natural range in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) after the 13th C. A.D. We identify 24 orders, 56 families and 67 native plant genera unrecorded in modern kakapo diets (increases of 69, 108 and 75% respectively). We found that southern beeches (Nothofagaceae), which are important canopy-forming trees and not an important kakapo food today, dominated kakapo diets in upland (c. >900 m elevation) habitats. We also found that kakapo frequently consumed hemiparasitic mistletoes (Loranthaceae) and the holoparasitic wood rose (Dactylanthus taylorii), taxa which are nutrient rich, and now threatened by mammalian herbivory and a paucity of dispersers and pollinators. No single dataset or gene identified all taxa in our dataset, demonstrating the value of multiproxy or multigene datasets in studies of animal diets. Our results highlight how contemporary data may considerably underestimate the full dietary breadth of threatened species and demonstrate the potential value of coprolite analysis in conservation biology.

AB  - Given the growth in the number of biogas power plants and the increase in the generation of waste from energy production, it is relevant to study the sustainable nature of this waste. Digestate is a product of the anaerobic digestion process, and is a valuable bio-fertilizer containing organic matter and nutrients necessary for agricultural plants' growth. The study showed that different rates of liquid and solid phases of anaerobic digestate influenced the contents of carbon and nitrogen in genetically young soil in alluvial deposits-Fluvisol. The application of solid digestate (SD) considerably increased soil organic carbon content (SOC) in the 0-10 cm soil layer; however, SOC did not reach the 20-30 cm layer. Liquid digestate (LD) significantly increased SOC in the deeper layers. The levels of mineral nitrogen (N-min) and water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) increased in the 0-10 cm soil layer soon after fertilization with LD and SD. The mobile components of the soil (N-min and WEOC) were characterized by high variability during the growing season. Within the 2-month period, their concentrations decreased drastically and were close to those of unfertilized soil. The research indicates that anaerobic digestate had a greater effect on mobile forms of carbon and nitrogen in the soil than on their total amounts.

AB  - Composted manure is the greatest nitrogen (N) source in organic agriculture, where the use of chemical fertilizers, except the use of rock phosphate as P source, is not allowed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the soil type and compost characteristics on the potential rates of mineralization and on the kinetics of the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) release patterns. For this, an aerobic incubation study was conducted over the course of 119 days at 25 degrees C using two different composts as amendments: a compost from biosolids and wood shavings (CRUB), and a compost from poultry manure with wheat straw (CSP). The composts were incorporated into two different soils of contrasting texture, sandy loam (S1) and silty clay loam (S2), at the dose of 160 kg N ha(-1). Samples were collected eight times during the incubation period. The N and C dynamics were studied separately according to the different soil type. In both soils, a predominance of the nitrification process immediately after compost application was observed, showing a higher mineralization in the sandy loam soil, this trend being followed by a decrease and even an immobilization process, associated with stable organic materials such as compost. Moreover, both composts presented high contents of available P, but without exceeding 50 mg P kg(-1), due to the slow release from the stable organic P fractions present in compost. The results obtained showed that despite the initial mineralization, both composts showed a significant period of N immobilization after their application into the pampean soils, which makes it necessary to anticipate their incorporation to avoid this lack period for crops. Furthermore, the application of these composts to the pampean soils implied an incorporation of available P, but with a slow release that avoided overfertilization, but also reducing N:P ratio and producing a relative deficit of N. Therefore, the results obtained suggested that it is necessary to study nutrient mineralization processes of the amendments prior to their use, according to the edaphoclimatic condition of each crop, in order to predict the release dynamics on soils and the fertilization potential to minimize potential environmental impacts.

AB  - Goat kids are frequently disbudded in intensively farmed units to reduce the number of accidental injuries to other animals and farm workers due to horn growth. The most commonly used method is thermal disbudding which is increasingly causing animal welfare concerns. Therefore the objective of the present study was to evaluate alternative disbudding methods either by injecting clove oil or its synthetic analogue isoeugenol. In this study 40 male Saanen goat kids aged between one and five days were treated using 4 different methods (n = 10 each): injection of 0.2 mL clove oil, 0.2 mL isoeugenol, 0.2 mL isotonic NaCl solution and thermal disbudding. For thermal disbudding general anesthesia was performed. Horn growth of all goat kids was measured. Computer tomography (CT) of the horn bud region and histological examination of biopsy samples taken from the horn bud region were performed. Additionally, saliva cortisol concentrations were measured. Highest success rate was reached with thermal disbudding and disbudding with isoeugenol followed clove oil. Scurs growth after disbudding appeared in 11 horn buds (4 thermal disbudding, 4 clove oil, 3 isoeugenol). CT images of animals after thermal disbudding showed complete destruction of the horn buds but also damage to the frontal bones. CT images of animals after clove oil or isoeugenol injection demonstrated partial destruction or malformation of the horn buds. Purulent osteomyelitis was detected after thermal disbudding (n = 2) and clove oil treatment (n = 1). Histological examination of biopsy sample showed different changes of skin, dermis and epidermis. A significant difference of between the cortisol concentrations before treatment and 10 minutes after treatment was only found in the isoeugenol group (P = 0.015). In the other groups, the increase was not significant. Likewise, only the isoeugenol group showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations (p = 0.019) following treatment in comparison with the control group (NaCl). Highest efficacy was reached with thermal disbudding and with isoeugenol followed by clove oil. Disbudding goat kids with isoeugenol caused less tissue damage than thermal disbudding. Injection of clove oil or isoeugenol may therefore be considered as an alternative to thermal disbudding. Future research is required to evaluate the behavioral responses of goat kids to these methods of disbudding. In addition, more research is needed to optimize the injection technique and to validate the growth of scurs after disbudding in goat kids. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially those obtained from microalgae,are an efficient and sustainable strategy to enrich ruminant products with biofunctional molecules.However, the high dietary inclusion needed to substantially affect product quality can also bringnegative effects on lipid metabolism. The dietary forage-to-concentrate ratio (F:C) is also a lever todrive metabolic functions, including lipid metabolism, with the advantage of its easy manipulation.To address this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment assessing the interaction of two inclusionlevels ofSchizochytriumspp. (20 or 40 g/day), a microalga rich in PUFA, and two F:C ratios (60/40 or40/60) on regulating gene networks involved in lipid metabolism in goats' tail fat. Results showed adecreasing gene expression under the effect of high microalgae levels or the high-grain diet. However,when the diet was based on forages, the negative effect of high microalgae levels on lipogenic geneexpression was more attenuated. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to be effective in enhancing the quality of ruminant products, including meat and milk. However, under these dietary conditions, the de novo lipogenesis could be influenced, too. On the other hand, even if the forage-to-concentrate ratio (F:C) is also a key factor affecting lipid metabolism in small ruminants, there is scarce information about its interaction with dietary PUFA. This study investigates the potential of the F:C ratio as a lever to manipulate lipid metabolism in dairy goats under high dietary PUFA supplementation. For this purpose, twenty-two crossbred dairy goats [Alpine x Local (Greek) breeds] (BW = 50.6 +/- 6.1 kg) at early lactation (70 +/- 10 days in milk) during the age of 3-4 years old, were separated into two homogeneous subgroups (n = 11). In the first phase, each goat was fed 20 g Schizochytrium spp./day followed by either a high-forage (20 HF) or a high-grain (20 HG) diet, while in the second phase, each goat was fed 40 g Schizochytrium spp./day followed once again either a high-forage (40 HF) or a high-grain (40 HG) diet. The F:C ratio of a high-forage and high-grain diet was 60:40 and 40:60, respectively. Tail fat tissue samples were collected by biopsy on the 42nd day of each experimental phase (last day). Significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the gene expression of ACACA, CBR2, COX4I1, ELOVL5, ELOVL7, LEP, and SCD were presented in goats fed 40 g compared to those fed 20 g Schizochytrium spp., while the gene expression of ACACA, AGPAT2, AGPAT3, ELOVL5, ELOVL6, EPHX2, FASN, and SCD was decreased in high grain compared to high-forage diets. This study also indicated that with the aim to enrich goat products with PUFA by increasing their levels in the diet, lipid metabolism is negatively affected. However, a diet with higher forage inclusion can partially attenuate this condition.

AB  - Global positioning system (GPS) receivers allow researchers to collect location data that provide information about fine-scale animal movements. For large carnivores, these data are routinely processed to identify clusters of GPS locations which are investigated to validate feeding sites, estimate prey species composition and model the likelihood of predation events based on characteristics of GPS location data within clusters. Although developing predation models entails a high level of field effort, researchers are apprehensive in applying system-specific models to other systems both spatially and temporally. Our objectives were to apply and compare multiple predation models to predict and identify feeding events outside of the geographic areas where models were developed. Using our multi-model approach, we identified feeding sites and estimated kill rates and prey composition of mountain lions Puma concolor in southwest Wyoming, USA from 2017 to 2019. Our approach increased our field efficiency by reducing potential field site investigations by 63%. We provide results of estimated diet composition in our study area where mountain lion prey included relatively high proportions of pronghorn (12.3%) and smaller mammals, particularly coyotes (7.6%). We also provide a comparison of the predation models developed across unique ecoregions of North America, and how they performed when applied to our area. We believe a similar approach could be adopted for other large carnivore populations where multiple models have been developed to characterize feeding events.

AB  - Fungus weevils (family Anthribidae) are morphologically and ecologically diverse, with highly varied feeding habits, mainly mycetophagy but also phytophagy, palynophagy and entomophagy. The phylogeny of the family is virtually unexplored, its evolutionary history obscure; thus, the existing classification is controversial and likely artificial. We generated the first multi-gene higher-level phylogeny estimate of Anthribidae using DNA data from 400 nuclear genes obtained via anchored hybrid enrichment from 40 species representing 17 tribes plus genera incertae sedis. As in previous studies, the family Anthribidae was consistently recovered as the sister group of Nemonychidae. We recovered two main clades in Anthribidae as sister groups with strong statistical support, viz. a monophyletic subfamily Urodontinae and the traditionally recognized Anthribinae, which was rendered paraphyletic by the subfamily Choraginae. Paraphyly and polyphyly among tribes of Anthribinae indicate that current tribal concepts-all based on morphology and without phylogenetic analysis-are artificial. Based on our results, we subsume the subfamily Choraginae into Anthribinae and place its six current tribes (Apolectini, Araecerini, Choragini, Cisanthribini, Valenfriesiini and Xenorchestini) in an expanded subfamily Anthribinae. We also transfer three genera currently treated as Anthribinae incertae sedis to three generally recognized tribes, namely Pleosporius Holloway to Sintorini, Xylanthribus Kuschel to Proscoporhinini and Anthribidus F & aring;hraeus to Platystomini. The phylogenetic positions of Urodontinae and Trigonorhinini suggest that phytophagy is the ancestral feeding mode of Anthribidae, with a few taxa of Anthribinae having secondarily evolved plant-feeding from mycetophagy, the predominant feeding habit of the subfamily. Overall, our results provide the first molecular phylogenetic context for research on Anthribidae and a first step towards reconstructing a natural tribal classification of the Anthribinae. Our study highlights the need for a phylogenetic approach, sampling of type genera and deeper taxon sampling to identify natural tribal-level groupings.

AB  - Thermal processing has been promoted to recycle phosphorus (P) contained within animal bone. There is a dearth of information on the mechanisms that control P solubility and availability from thermally treated bones. Chemical extraction, XRD, and FTIR were used to elucidate P solubility, and incubation and pot experiments to evaluate P bioavailability from different animal bones, thermal processing methods (pyrolysis vs. combustion), and production temperatures. Pyrolysis resulted in higher formic P than combustion, particularly at temperatures >500 degrees C. Chicken bone showed the highest water-soluble P content (p < 0.001), irrespective of processing methods and temperatures. In contrast, pig bone exhibited the lowest water-soluble P despite its high total P content. The XRD and FTIR studies confirmed higher degree of crystallization for those produced from pig bone, combustion, and higher temperatures (>700 degrees C). Infrared splitting factor and width at 85% of the height of the 604 cm(-1) peak were used to assess bioapatite crystallinity, and confirmed a negative correlation between crystallinity and P availability (p < 0.001), indicating the attribution of bioapatite crystallization for low soluble P during combustion and higher temperatures. In low pH soil (pH similar to 4), the addition of thermally treated bones increased Olsen-P and plant P uptake by two- to five-folds compared with unamended soils; however, no significant variation was observed in higher pH soil (pH similar to 7). The finding suggested processing bones below temperatures of 700 degrees C resulted in less crystallinity, thus higher P solubility. The P-fertilizing value of thermally treated bones was more pronounced in lower pH soil.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the signaling pathways involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pig Sertoli cells (SCs) mediated by thyroid hormone (T3) to provide a theoretical and practical basis for enhancing pig semen production. The effects of different concentrations of T3 on the proliferation of pig SCs were evaluated using the CCK8 assay. The impact of T3 on the proliferation and differentiation of pig SCs was further examined using RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western Blotting techniques. Additionally, the involvement of the p38 MAPK and NFxB pathways in mediating the effects of T3 on SCs proliferation and differentiation was investigated. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the dosage of T3 and the inhibition of pig SCs proliferation and promotion of maturation. T3 regulated the activation state of the NFxB signaling pathway by upregulating IKK alpha, downregulating IKK beta, and promoting IxB phosphorylation. Furthermore, T3 facilitated SCs maturation by upregulating AR and FSHR expression while downregulating KRT-18. In conclusion, T3 inhibits pig SCs proliferation and promote pig SCs maturation through the IKK/NFxB and p38 MAPK pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which T3 influences the proliferation and maturation of pig SCs.

AB  - Regulation of labile fraction of excreted manure represents a promising advance for environmental pollution mitigation. However, investigation of the properties of various pollutant fractions within manure and potential influence of dietary nutrient fractions on the release of labile manure remains unclear. Feeding trials involving pigs at three distinct growth stages fed by diets with nine different energy levels were conducted and the characteristics of labile manure generated under various treatments based on nutrient profiles were analyzed. The impact of dietary nutrient fractions on variables such as labile manure pollutants, pig performance, manure weight and dominant microorganisms were evaluated via theoretical modeling and correlation analysis. The results indicated that critical dietary nutrient factors such as dietary C fraction, protein N-materials and dietary P fraction varied respectively with pig growth stages. The labile manure composition and proportion were influenced by dietary C/N/P fractions and indigestible components, through regulation of the structure of the gut microbiota and the relative abundance of gut microbes. This study finds that initiating dietary regulatory measures could effectively control the release of labile manure and reduce its proportion in the overall manure and thus, provides a novel approach to achieve manure source pollution control, ensure environmental-friendly diet formula and mitigate manure-related environmental pollution.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The pertinent consequences of global warming substantially affect both animal productivity and fertility. Noteworthy, tropical and subtropical animal breeds are productively suited to hot climate conditions. Therefore studying the physiological changes accompanying high temperature, especially in tropically adapted species such as buffalo, will help in understanding the mechanisms that the animal use to accomplish the necessary functions efficiently. Concerning fertility-related activity, granulosa cells are important for the regulation of ovarian function and the completion of oocyte maturation. In this study, the buffalo granulosa cells were examined for their viability, physiological and molecular responses under in vitro heat stress conditions. Buffalo granulosa cells displayed different adaptive responses, at the physiological and molecular levels, to the different heat stress conditions. At 40.5 degrees C, granulosa cells exhibited a functional persistence compared to the control and other heat-treated groups. These results will provide insights into ways that tropically adapted breeds may be able to maintain better reproductive function when exposed to heat stress compared to temperate breeds.
   The steroidogenesis capacity and adaptive response of follicular granulosa cells (GCs) to heat stress were assessed together with the underlying regulating molecular mechanisms in Egyptian buffalo. In vitro cultured GCs were exposed to heat stress treatments at 39.5, 40.5, or 41.5 degrees C for the final 24 h of the culture period (7 days), while the control group was kept under normal conditions (37 degrees C). Comparable viability was observed between the control and heat-treated GCs at 39.5 and 40.5 degrees C. A higher release of E2, P4 and IGF-1 was observed in the 40.5 degrees C group compared with the 39.5 or 41.5 degrees C groups. The total antioxidant capacity was higher in response to heat stress at 39.5 degrees C. At 40.5 degrees C, a significant upregulation pattern was found in the expression of the stress resistance transcripts (SOD2 and NFE2L2) and of CPT2. The relative abundance of ATP5F1A was significantly downregulated for all heat-treated groups compared to the control, while TNF alpha was downregulated in GCs at 39.5 degrees C. Expression analyses of stress-related miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-181a and miR-27b) exhibited a significant downregulation in the 40.5 degrees C group compared to the control, whereas miR-708 was upregulated in the 39.5 and 40.5 degrees C groups. In conclusion, buffalo GCs exhibited different adaptive responses, to the different heat stress conditions. The integration mechanism between the molecular and secretory actions of the GCs cultured at 40.5 degrees C might provide possible insights into the biological mechanism through which buffalo GCs react to heat stress.

AB  - Intercropping, i.e., the simultaneous cultivation of different crops on the same field, has demonstrated yield advantages compared to monoculture cropping. These yield advantages have often been attributed to complementary resource use, but few studies quantified the temporal complementarity of nutrient acquisition and biomass production. Our understanding of how nutrient uptake rates of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and biomass accumulation change throughout the growing season and between different neighbors is limited. We conducted weekly destructive harvests to measure temporal trajectories of N and P uptake and biomass production in three crop species (oat, lupin, and camelina) growing either as isolated single plants, in monocultures or as intercrops. Additionally, we quantified organic acid exudation in the rhizosphere and biological N-2-fixation of lupin throughout the growing season. Logistic models were fitted to characterize nutrient acquisition and biomass accumulation trajectories. Nutrient uptake and biomass accumulation trajectories were curtailed by competitive interactions, resulting in earlier peak rates and lower total accumulated nutrients and biomass compared to cultivation as isolated single plants. Different pathways led to overyielding in the two mixtures. The oat-camelina mixture was characterized by a shift from belowground temporal niche partitioning of resource uptake to aboveground competition for light during the growing season. The oat-lupin mixture showed strong competitive interactions, where lupin eventually overyielded due to reliance on atmospheric N and stronger competitiveness for soil P compared to oat. Synthesis: This study demonstrates temporal shifts to earlier peak rates of plants growing with neighbors compared to those growing alone, with changes in uptake patterns suggesting that observed temporal shifts in our experiment were driven by competitive interactions rather than active plant behavior to reduce competition. The two differing pathways to overyielding in the two mixtures highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics in intercropping systems to understand the underlying mechanisms of overyielding.

AB  - Simple Summary: In this study, the bacterial community structure and composition in the skin ecosystem of Barbour's seahorses (Hippocampus barbouri) were assessed by the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, with particular emphasis on members belonging to the Aeromonadaceae family due to its implications for the health of fish species. The results revealed that sequences affiliated with the Aeromonas genus were found in the skin of Barbour's seahorses, with abundances being slightly similar between female and male specimens. Comparative analysis also demonstrated that the presence of Aeromonas species in the skin of Barbour's seahorses was strongly influenced by the surrounding sediment. These findings could be used as a baseline for further studies about the role of Aeromonas species in the normal and disturbed microbiota associated with seahorses.
   Although several studies have described the bacterial community composition associated with marine fish, there is limited information related to seahorses. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that the skin microbiota is useful for determining health status and common disorders in the host. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the skin bacterial community composition in Barbour's seahorse (Hippocampus barbouri) using high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Water and sediment samples from the surrounding environment were also analyzed for comparative purposes. The results revealed that sequences affiliated with the Shewanellaceae family were dominant in the skin of female Barbour's seahorses and sediment samples, whereas sequences affiliated with the Bacillaceae family were dominant in the skin of male Barbour's seahorses. Interestingly, sequences affiliated with the Aeromonas genus were found in the skin of Barbour's seahorses, whose abundance was slightly similar between the female and male specimens. Further comparative analysis showed that the presence of Aeromonas species in the skin of Barbour's seahorses was strongly influenced by the surrounding sediment. Given that some Aeromonas species are known to be important pathogens in humans and fish, these results may be used for further research on the dependency of the skin microbial composition on the environment as well as determine whether the presence of Aeromonas and other detected species has implications on seahorse health.

AB  - What influences support for local environmental morality policies? Since Earth has entered the Anthropocene era, municipalities are facing the growing challenge of managing local environmental governance. Thus, to theorize this dynamic in the fields of public administration, politics, and policy, we examine how human-wildlife interaction and political factors affect support for local environmental morality policies-defined here as municipal environmental interventions that are rooted in ethical, societal, or religious values and tend to elicit strong public reactions and normative conflict. We focus on three such policies: thinning, trap-neuter-return (TNR), and regulation against wild-animal feeders. These policies often evoke public controversy, as they are grounded in ethical, societal, or cultural values that shape urban environmental conflict. Using a quantitative, large-scale, time-series public opinion survey, we analyze the case of wild boars on Mount Carmel and the Haifa Municipality across two political moments: pre- and post-local elections. We find that both human-wildlife interaction and political incentives shape support for local environmental morality policies. Implications for local environmental governance and local politics are discussed.

AB  - The recombinant genotypes that can be produced when closely related species mate improve the genetic diversity of the population. Among closely related species, the link between interspecific reproduction behaviors and genetic diversity has barely been studied. Reticulitermes chinensis and R. flaviceps, which live close to each other, were used as research subjects in our study to find out how preferring conspecifics affects reproductive behavior between species. We discovered that neither R. chinensis nor R. flaviceps displayed preference behavior for conspecifics. Males of R. chinensis and R. flaviceps chased and groomed not only intraspecific females but also interspecific females. In a brief period of time, 2 mating behaviors, intra- and interspecific mating, were also observed. There were no significant differences in the duration of each behavior (tandem, grooming, and mating) between interspecies and intraspecies partners. Moreover, genetic analysis showed both interspecific mating and intraspecific mating can produce living offspring when the 2 types of mating occur in a colony. Our findings showed that there was no obvious intraspecific preference between the 2 species of termite Reticulitermes when it came to tandem, grooming, and mating, which not only makes it easier for interspecific hybridization to occur but also sheds light on the genetic diversity.

AB  - Introduction. The thymus is the site of development and maturation of functional T lymphocytes and is critically important to the immune system. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of markers of T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes and plasmocytes in the yak thymus. Materials and methods. Twenty healthy male yaks were divided into newborn (2-4 weeks old, n = 10) and adult (3-4 years old, n = 10) group. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression level of the main markers of the studied cell types. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the distribution of CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages, SIRPa+ dendritic cells, CD79a+ B lymphocytes, IgA and IgG+ plasmocytes. Results. Within the same age group, the mRNA expression of CD3e was highest (P < 0.05), followed by that of CD68, SIRPa, CD79a, IgG and IgA. Furthermore, CD3e, CD68, and SIRPa mRNA expression levels were higher in newborn yaks than in the adult ones (P < 0.05), whereas those of CD79a, IgA, and IgG were higher in adults (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical results showed localization of CD3+ T lymphocytes in the thymic cortex and medulla. CD68+ macrophages, SIRPa+ dendritic cells, CD79a+ B lymphocytes, IgA+ and IgG+ plasmocytes were mainly observed in the cortico-medullary region and medulla. In the same age group, the frequency of CD3+ T lymphocytes was higher than that of CD68+ macrophages and SIRPa+ dendritic cells (P < 0.05), followed by those of CD79a+ B lymphocytes and IgA+ and IgG+ plasmocytes. No significant difference was observed between B lymphocyte and plasmocyte frequencies in the yak thymus in both age groups (P > 0.05). The frequency of CD3+, CD68+ and SIRPa+ cells decreased from newborns to adults (P < 0.05). However, the frequencies of CD79a+, IgA+ and IgG+ cells increased from newborn to adult yaks (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The thymus of newborn yaks is well-developed, with higher numbers of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells than those in the adult thymus. However, higher frequencies of plasmocytes and B lymphocytes were detected in the adult thymus, suggesting that adults may better resist infections through humoral immunity as this organ undergoes involution. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the number of IgA and IgG plasmocytes, which differs from what is observed in rodents and humans. This difference might be related to the fact that yaks live in low-oxygen plateaus.

AB  - In recent years, research has gradually uncovered the mechanisms of animal adaptation to hypoxic conditions in different altitude environments, particularly at the genomic level. However, past genomic studies on high-altitude adaptation have often not delved deeply into the differences between varying altitude levels. This study conducted whole-genome sequencing on 60 Tibetan sheep (Medium Altitude Group (MA): 20 Tao sheep (TS) at 2887 m, High Altitude Group (HA): 20 OuLa sheep (OL) at 3501 m, and Ultra-High Altitude Group (UA): 20 AWang sheep (AW) at 4643 m) from different regions of the Tibetan Plateau in China to assess their responses under varying conditions. Population genetic structure analysis revealed that the three groups are genetically independent, but the TS and OL groups have experienced gene flow with other northern Chinese sheep due to geographical factors. Selection signal analysis identified FGF10, MMP14, SLC25A51, NDUFB8, ALAS1, PRMT1, PRMT5, and HIF1AN as genes associated with ultra-high-altitude hypoxia adaptation, while HMOX2, SEMA4G, SLC16A2, SLC22A17, and BCL2L2 were linked to high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. Functional analysis showed that ultra-high-altitude adaptation genes tend to influence physiological mechanisms directly affecting oxygen uptake, such as lung development, angiogenesis, and red blood cell formation. In contrast, high-altitude adaptation genes are more inclined to regulate mitochondrial DNA replication, iron homeostasis, and calcium signaling pathways to maintain cellular function. Additionally, the functions of shared genes further support the adaptive capacity of Tibetan sheep across a broad geographic range, indicating that these genes offer significant selective advantages in coping with oxygen scarcity. In summary, this study not only reveals the genetic basis of Tibetan sheep adaptation to different altitudinal conditions but also highlights the differences in gene regulation between ultra-high- and high-altitude adaptations. These findings offer new insights into the adaptive evolution of animals in extreme environments and provide a reference for exploring adaptation mechanisms in other species under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Hunting of cervids is commonly regulated by quotas that are specific to sex and age groups. There is substantial cultural variation in how quotas are regulated. In Scandinavia, the entire quotas are often not shot making deer management potentially less predictable. However, the effect of quota size and demographic composition on harvest offtake by recreational hunters has, to a limited extent, been empirically investigated in Scandinavia. Hunters are limited by time and opportunity and may not respond to changes in quota, as anticipated by managers. We analysed the variation in the proportion of quotas filled depending on quota size relative to population size and demographic composition of quotas during the period of 1986-2019 involving a population size varying from approximately 5000 to 15,000 reindeer on Hardangervidda, Norway. We found that the proportion of quota being filled by hunters varied substantially (12-48%) on an annual basis. The quota occasionally exceeded the estimated population size, but the proportion of the quota filled increased the higher the population size was relative to the quota size. The proportion of quota being filled by hunters was markedly lower for calf licences. High annual variation in the proportion of quota being filled by hunters causes considerable implementation uncertainty when managers aim to regulate cervid populations. Nevertheless, there was a strong correlation between quota size and harvest size. Facing new management requirements, a harvest rate of similar to 47% of the adult male population size was achieved in 2019, compared to an average of 16%. Hence, managers compensated for the low proportion of quota being filled by increasing quotas to reach target harvesting aims, but there remains a limit as to how precisely such a wide-ranging reindeer population can be regulated using recreational hunters.

AB  - Polar habitats offer excellent sites to isolate unique bacterial strains due to their diverse physical, geochemical, and biological factors. We hypothesize that the unique environmental conditions of polar regions select for distinct strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with novel biochemical properties. In this study, we characterized ten strains of psychrotrophic LAB isolated from hitherto poorly described sources-High Arctic and maritime Antarctic soils and soil-like materials, including ornithogenic soils, cryoconites, elephant seal colonies, and postglacial moraines. We evaluated the physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates. Based on 16S rRNA and housekeeping genes, the four LAB strains were assigned to three Carnobacterium species: C. alterfunditum, C. maltaromaticum, and C. jeotgali. The remaining strains may represent three new species of the Carnobacterium genus. All isolates were neutrophilic and halophilic psychrotrophs capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, organic acids, and alcohols. The identified metabolic properties of the isolated Carnobacterium strains suggest possible syntrophic interactions with other microorganisms in polar habitats. Some showed antimicrobial activity against food pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and human pathogens like Staphylococcus spp. Several isolates exhibited unique metabolic traits with potential biotechnological applications that could be more effectively exploited under less stringent technological conditions compared to thermophilic LAB strains, such as lower temperatures and reduced nutrient concentrations. Analysis of extrachromosomal genetic elements revealed 13 plasmids ranging from 4.5 to 79.5 kb in five isolates, featuring unique genetic structures and high levels of previously uncharacterized genes. This work is the first comprehensive study of the biochemical properties of both known and new Carnobacterium species and enhances our understanding of bacterial communities in harsh and highly selective polar soil ecosystems.

AB  - Mali and the other Sudano-Sahelian countries hold one of the lowest human development indexes due to climate, social and economic conditions that prevent food and fibre production. The growing demand for food production coupled with the lack of knowledge about the limiting attributes of soils induce soil degradation. Inadequate management of soils results in significant vulnerability for food security in Mali. This study aimed to analyze soils from Southern Mali with varying influences of plinthite, providing insights regarding specific management and restoration practices. Seven soil profiles in Southern Mali were studied. Morphological, physical, chemical and mineralogical attributes were assessed. The biggest physical limitations identified in Mali were: poor water infiltration, erosion and stoniness. Physical limitations were mostly due to cemented horizons and clay increase with depth. Main chemical limitations were acidity and low natural fertility. Low fertility is related to the advanced weathered-leached status of soils and the influence of sandstone, a nutrient-poor, quartz-rich parent material. Soils from Bandiagara II presented more acidity values and soil fertility limitations compared to those from Siani. Higher soil fertility in Siani could be related to volcanic sediments associated with sandstones of the studied region. Siani soils presented more clay increase with depth and are considered more erosion-prone in this sense. In soils from Southern Mali, specific management practices aiming to increase and preserve soil organic matter should be highlighted, such as integrated crop-livestock systems, cover plants (e.g., elephant grass) and corn-sunn hemp consortium.

AB  - BACKGROUND The population dynamics of polyphagous pests such as Bemisia argentifolii (B. tabaci MEAM1) are governed by complex, interacting factors involving its cultivated and wild host plants, seasonality, movement and demography. To understand mechanisms contributing to population development and pest success within the agroecosystem, contiguous multi-host field sites were established in three environmentally distinct areas in Arizona. Life tables quantified and partition models described mortality sources and rates for immature insect stages on each host plant. RESULTS Predation and dislodgement were the largest sources of marginal mortality, supplied the highest irreplaceable mortality and predation was the key factor. Rates of mortality were best predicted, in order, by source, temperature, host plant and season. Marginal mortality was highest for fourth-stage nymphs followed by eggs. Mortality rates were predicted in descending order by stage, temperature and season. Survivorship patterns varied among host plants, and generational mortality averaged 70% on spring cantaloupes but nearly 95% on all other hosts. Population density varied seasonally, persisting at low levels on winter hosts and expanding beginning in the spring; perennial hosts and weeds bridge populations year-round. CONCLUSION Survival on winter hosts such as broccoli, albeit low, enables population continuity, whereas unusually high survivorship on spring crops like cantaloupe is an ecological release propelling population growth and driving regional dynamics in the summer and fall. This detailed understanding of mortality dynamics provides clues to the success of this invasive pest in our agroecosystems and facilitates opportunities for improved pest management at a broader landscape scale.

AB  - Many phoretic relationships between arthropods are understudied because of taxonomic impediments. We here illustrate for avian lice riding on hippoboscid flies how new natural history data on phoretic relationships can be acquired quickly with modern and cost-effective barcoding techniques. Most avian lice are host-specific, but some can arrive on new hosts by hitchhiking on hippoboscid flies that feed on bird blood. Our summary of the literature yielded 254 published records which we here show to belong to two large and 13 small interaction networks for birds, flies, and lice. In order to generate new records, we developed a protocol based on screening bird carcasses sourced with the help of citizen scientists. The inspection of 131 carcasses from Singapore led to the first record of a Guimaraesiella Eichler (Ischnocera: Philopteridae) louse species riding on Ornithoica momiyamai Kishida flies collected from a pitta carcass. Phoresy may explain why this louse species is now known from three phylogenetically disparate hosts (Pitta moluccensis (Muller), Ficedula zanthopygia (Hay); Pardaliparus elegans Lesson). A second new case of phoresy enhanced a large interaction network dominated by Ornithophila metallica (Schiner), a cosmopolitan and polyphagous hippoboscid fly species. Overall, we argue that many two- and three-way phoretic relationships between arthropods (e.g., mites, pseudoscorpions, beetles, flies) can be resolved with cost-effective large-scale NGS barcoding, which can be used to partially overcome taxonomic impediments by pre-sorting specimens for taxonomic revision.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration is indispensable in male pigs intended for the production of high-quality dry-cured ham; however, for welfare reasons, alternatives are being sought and, among them, immunocastration stands out. The literature shows that immunocastration might generate lower fat deposition than surgical castration, which is undesirable for the dry-curing process. Therefore, it would be interesting to confirm the impact of immunocastration in male pigs and to test feeding plans that benefit fatness. The aim of this trial was to assess the effect of type of castration (surgical vs. immunological) and diet (control vs. high energy vs. low crude protein and amino acids) on growth performance, serum sex hormones and metabolites, and carcass quality of male pigs destined for the Protected Designation of Origin Teruel ham. Although immunocastration improved productive performance, it reduced carcass fatness. Also, alternative diets to control improved the feed conversion ratio but did not influence carcass quality traits. In conclusion, under a quality point of view, surgical castration would be preferable over immunocastration for dry-cured ham production, and the use of moderately high-energy or low-crude-protein and -amino-acids diets from 80 to 137 kg of body weight would not provide improvements. A trial was carried out to study the effect of type of castration and diet on pigs destined for Teruel ham production, which is a Spanish protected designation of origin for dry-cured ham. A total of 144 Duroc x (Landrace x Large White) male pigs were used. Half of them were surgically castrated and the other half were immunocastrated with three doses at approximately 25, 58 and 79 kg of body weight. Furthermore, three diets (control vs. high energy vs. low crude protein-CP- and amino acids-AA) were tested from 80 to 137 kg of body weight. Growth performance, serum sex hormones and metabolites, and carcass quality were evaluated. Immunocastrated males grew faster and had better feed conversion ratio than surgically castrated males, but presented lower carcass fatness. Pigs fed the high-energy diet and the low-CP and -AA diet were more efficient at transforming feed into gain than those fed the control diet, but no effect was detected on carcass quality. In conclusion, surgically castrated males are preferable than immunocastrated males for Teruel dry-cured ham elaboration. Besides, a high-energy diet or a low-CP and -AA diet might improve productive performances, but does not provide any benefit in terms of carcass quality.

KW  - PRESSURE
AB  - Barbiturate overdose is a common method for euthanizing pigs. However, barbiturates can cause tissue damage and may affect experimental results, so the minimal dose should be used. The minimal dose of barbiturate for euthanasia in pigs under isoflurane anesthesia has not yet been determined. In this study, we compared the effect of low and high doses of 2 barbiturates (pentobarbital, 30 or 60 mg/kg; thiopental, 20 and 40 mg/kg) on hemodynamic parameters and time to cardiac arrest in female pigs maintained on isoflurane. Acute decreases in blood pressure and end-tidal CO(2 )occurred in all pigs shortly after administration of the barbiturate. However, these changes were not different between either of the high-and low dose groups. Cardiac arrest occurred significantly faster for high dose as compared with low dose thiopental groups, but this parameter was different between the 2 pentobarbital groups. The bispectral index fell immediately after dosing, in all pigs, but no significant differences were observed in the time needed to achieve 0 for the high or low-doses of either drug. In pigs maintained on isoflurane, a low dose of barbiturates is adequate for euthanasia and may result in less tissue damage.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever, caused by African swine fever virus, seriously affects domestic pigs and wild boars and has brought huge economic losses to endemic countries and regions. However, there is still a lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics at present. The prevention and control of African swine fever largely depends on early and accurate detection, and thus the desired detection method of clinical African swine fever virus is indeed needed. Despite a number of detection methods available, we here develop a lateral flow strip detection method for African swine fever virus, based on the viral gene of structural protein named p17 and the new technology called the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas 12a nuclease system. This visual detection method is simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific and has the potential for clinical detection of African swine fever virus.Abstract African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus that is highly infectious and seriously affects domestic pigs and wild boars. African swine fever (ASF) has caused huge economic losses to endemic countries and regions. At present, there is still a lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection is essential for the prevention and control of ASF. The portable DNA endonuclease (Cas12a)-mediated lateral flow strip detection method (Cas12a-LFS) combined with recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA) has been gradually recognized as effective for virus detection including ASFV. In this study, based on the ASFV structural protein p17 gene (D117L), an RPA-Cas12a-LFS detection method was established. The detection method exhibits a sensitivity of up to two gene copies and has no cross-reaction with nine other swine viruses. Thus, the method is highly sensitive and specific. In 68 clinical samples, the coincidence rate of the p17 strip was 100%, compared to the traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR). In conclusion, we have developed a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific ASFV visual detection method and demonstrated the potential of on-site detection of ASFV.

AB  - The tight linkage between mineral status and health and demographics in ani-mals is well documented. Mineral deficiencies have been coupled to population declines in wildlife. Current practices typically rely on liver, kidney and/or serum samples to assess mineral levels. Such destructive sampling strategies are, however, not feasible for remote or endangered populations. Hair may constitute an alternative tissue, sampled through non-invasive means, to inves-tigate mineral levels in wildlife. In the pilot study presented here, we examine whether mineral levels in hair samples from a well-studied muskox (Ovibos moschatus) population in High-Arctic Greenland are associated with a vital rate and may, therefore, serve as indicators of wildlife population demographics. We show that inter-annual variations in levels of three minerals-copper, selenium and molybdenum-are associated with fluctuations in annual calf recruitment, with poor recruitment in years of low mineral levels in hair. Local environmen-tal conditions also varied with calf recruitment but appeared to be less robust predictors of calf recruitment than hair mineral levels. Our results suggest that hair mineral levels may serve as an indicator of vital demographic rates and, ultimately, of wildlife population trends.

AB  - Key message In Pinus radiata, both primary and secondary compounds may play a role in defence against herbivory. Allocation of constitutive and induced primary and secondary compounds varies among needles, bark and roots. Responses to stresses are stronger in primary than secondary compounds and some responses of root chemistry to above-ground stressors were detected. The capacity of trees to cope with pests and pathogens depends in part on the variation of constitutive and induced chemical defences within the plant. Here we examined the constitutive and induced variation of primary (sugars and fatty acids) and secondary (mono-, sesqui- and di- terpenoids as well as volatile phenolics) metabolites in the needles, bark and, for the first time, roots of 2-year old Pinus radiata. A total of 81 compounds were examined. The plant parts differed significantly in constitutive levels of individual sugars, fatty acids, mono-, sesqui- and di- terpenoids as well as volatile phenolics. Overall, the bark had more compounds and a higher amount of most secondary compounds and the levels of compounds in the roots differed from that of the needles and bark. For example, glucose was the dominant sugar in the needles and bark whereas fructose dominated in the roots. Of the fully identified secondary compounds, monoterpenoids dominated in all plant parts but with different qualitative patterns. Following methyl jasmonate and bark stripping treatments, a marked reduction in sugars but weaker changes in secondary compounds were detected in the needles and bark. Responses in the roots were minor but the few that were detected were mostly in response to the bark stripping treatment. Changes in correlations among chemicals within plant parts and between the same compound across the different plant parts were also detected after stress treatments. Overall, results showed that the constitutive composition in the roots differs from that of the bark and needles in P. radiata and inducibility is stronger in the primary than secondary metabolites and differs between plant parts. This detailed assessment of Pinus radiata chemistry in the needles, bark and roots, including the compounds that respond to simulated biotic stress will potentially facilitate the identification of related chemical defence traits.

AB  - As climate change leads to increase flood risks, South Africa continues to rely on government driven ex post relief initiatives for flood management whilst commercial insurance providers are not yet incorporated into broader flood management strategies. The willingness to pay (WTP) for flood risk insurance is investigated among this most vulnerable demographic of low income households. Using discrete choice experiments (DCE) and mixed logit models, it uses primary data from respondents in Buffalo City metropolitan municipality to analyse preferences for insurance attributes, such as coverage levels, premiums and excess fees. The findings also show that there is a strong preference for lower premiums, better quality insurers, and easier application processes for adoption. The results of mixed logit show that attributes like the increased building coverage results in positive WTP and further confirms the need for insurance plans that are easily accessible and affordable. Taken together, the findings in this research highlight the value of trust, transparency, and the cost effectiveness of policy design in boosting both consumption of flood insurance and community resilience to floods among vulnerable populations.

AB  - Reproduction in female mammals is characterized by major changes in steroid hormone concentrations, which can be linked to fluctuations in energy expenditure (EE). Estradiol and cortisol can increase EE and metabolic rates (MRs), but knowledge on MR changes during the estrous cycle and gestation is scarce for many species. This also applies to the domestic guinea pig, a species exhibiting an exceptional estrous cycle among rodents. In this study, MRs were measured through oxygen (O2) consumption in female guinea pigs during different reproductive stages. Mean O2 consumption over 2.5 h, resting metabolic rate (RMR, lowest and most stable O2 consumption over 3 min), body mass, fecal estrogen and progesterone, and saliva cortisol concentrations were measured in twelve female guinea pigs in a repeated measurements design during diestrus, estrus, and the second trimester of gestation. In estrus, body mass was significantly lower and estrogen and cortisol concentrations were significantly higher compared to diestrus and gestation. Mean O2 consumption and RMR both were significantly increased in estrus compared to diestrus. Additionally, a positive effect of body mass on MRs detected during diestrus and gestation was not found during estrus. Mean O2 consumption was also higher during gestation compared to diestrus, and a significant increase in cortisol concentrations during the 2.5-h MR measurement was recorded. The results indicate that estrus in guinea pigs is energetically demanding, which probably reflects catabolic effects of estrogens and cortisol that uncoupled MRs from body mass. Knowledge on the energetic requirements associated with different reproductive stages is important for future physiological and behavioral studies on female guinea pigs.

AB  - Atta Fabricius is an ecologically dominant leaf-cutting ant genus, the major herbivore of the Neotropics, and an agricultural pest of great economic importance. Phylogenetic relationships within Atta have until now remained uncertain, and the delimitation and identification of a subset of Atta species are problematic. To address these phylogenetic uncertainties, we reconstruct the most comprehensive phylogenetic estimate to date of Atta by employing ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We recovered 2340 UCE loci from 224 Atta specimens, which include 14 out of the 15 identifiable species from across their geographic distributions, and 49 outgroup specimens. Our results strongly support the monophyly of Atta and of the four clades that coincide with the previously recognized subgenera Archeatta Goncalves, Atta s.s. Emery, Epiatta Borgmeier, and Neoatta Goncalves. The Archeatta clade contains three species occurring in North and Central America and the Caribbean and is the sister group of the remainder of all other Atta species. The Atta s.s. clade is composed of two species occupying North, Central, and South America. The Epiatta clade contains seven entirely South American species and the two species of the Neoatta clade occur in Central and South America. Divergence-dating analyses identify a series of major events in the Miocene, such as the divergence of Acromyrmex Mayr and Atta 16.7 million years ago (Ma) and the crown-group origin of Atta around 8.5 Ma. Extant Atta species evolved very recently, originating in the early Pleistocene, approximately 1.8-0.3 Ma (crown-group ages). We provide the first evidence that Atta goiana Goncalves belongs to the Epiatta clade and that Atta robusta Borgmeier is the species with the youngest crown-group age of 0.3 Ma. The very young ages of Atta and its component species indicate a recent, rapid radiation. Biogeographic analyses suggest that the range of the most recent common ancestor of Atta consisted of the combined North/Central America and NW South America bioregions and that one daughter lineage subsequently dispersed into South America, rapidly diversifying in the newly formed Cerrado biome and Chaco, and further dispersing into the Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, and Pampas bioregions.

AB  - Avocado seeds (which are discarded during fruit processing) generate residue that could be utilized in pig feeding. The objective of this study was to test the effects of dietary inclusion of dried-milled avocado seeds (DAS) on pig performance, nutrient and energy digestibility, plasma biochemical parameters, and carcass and meat traits. Twenty-four Landrace x Large White barrows (24 kg body weight, BW) were randomly allocated to three experimental treatments: control diet (CO; 18% CP, 1.12% Lys, and 14 MJ ME/kg), and two diets in which 100 or 200 g DAS/kg partially replaced a CO diet (S10 and S20, respectively). Pigs were individually housed (22 +/- 1 degrees C), and feed and water were provided ad libitum. Animals were weighed weekly and individual intake was monitored daily. The total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) and nitrogen balance were determined. The experiment ended at 40 kg BW, when the animals were slaughtered for blood and tissue sampling. Voluntary feed intake was not affected by the addition of up to 200 g DAS/kg to the diet. However, growth, nutrient TTAD, and nitrogen retention were depressed at the highest DAS inclusion level. The nutritional characteristics of longissimus lumborum muscle were not affected by DAS ingestion. The inclusion of up to 100 g DAS/kg in the diets of growing pigs could be used to add value to this waste product.

AB  - Variation in the distribution and abundance of food resources are key factors affecting animal sociality. In environments with variable resources, dynamic social organization, such as the fission and fusion of groups, is thought to increase the benefits of group living, while reducing the costs. We investigated the relationship between social organization and prey abundance in a highly social predator, the killer whale. This was achieved by analysing 12 years (2006-2018) of seasonally delineated (coinciding with high and low prey abundances) association data obtained from nearly 90 000 identification photographs of killer whales in-shore at Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. Association network measures were compared between periods using randomized association matrices. Half-weight association index, degree, number of modules and group size were all greater during periods of high prey abundance while mean distance, centrality and modularity were lower during this same period. Results suggest that killer whales at Marion Island were more social, formed larger groups and had more associations during periods of high prey abundance. During periods of lower prey abundance, fewer interactions, stronger clustering and more division in the association network were observed. These results indicate that the social organization of this population of killer whales is seasonally dynamic, with increased sociality measures coinciding with periods of higher prey abundance. These results are similar to those of other social species, emphasizing the importance of resource abundance as a driver of social structure in animal societies.

AB  - Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) are the leading terrestrial animals used for meat production. The gut microbiota significantly affect host nutrition, metabolism, and immunity. Hence, characterization of the gut microbial structure and function will improve our understanding of gut microbial resources and the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions. Here, we investigated the gut microbiomes of seven pig breeds using metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We established an expanded gut microbial reference catalog comprising 17 020 160 genes and identified 4910 metagenome-assembled genomes. We also analyzed the gut resistome to provide an overview of the profiles of the antimicrobial resistance genes in pigs. By analyzing the relative abundances of microbes, we identified three core-predominant gut microbes (Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, Prevotella copri, and Oscillibacter valericigenes) in pigs used in this study. Oral administration of the three core-predominant gut microbes significantly increased the organ indexes (including the heart, spleen, and thymus), but decreased the gastrointestinal lengths in germ-free mice. The three core microbes significantly enhanced intestinal epithelial barrier function and altered the intestinal mucosal morphology, as was evident from the increase in crypt depths in the duodenum and ileum. Furthermore, the three core microbes significantly affected several metabolic pathways (such as "steroid hormone biosynthesis," "primary bile acid biosynthesis," "phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis," and "phenylalanine metabolism") in germ-free mice. These findings provide a panoramic view of the pig gut microbiome and insights into the functional contributions of the core-predominant gut microbes to the host.

AB  - Simple Summary Cytokines and prostaglandins are inflammatory mediators that are secreted by the immune cells but also by the female genital tract to regulate immune maternal tolerance. The balance of an adequate uterine immune response promotes reproductive success. No information is available regarding the characterization of inflammatory mediators in the uterine fluid of llamas during different stages of the reproductive cycle. Therefore, the main goal of the study was to determine the presence of these inflammatory mediators in the uterine fluid of llamas in the follicular and luteal phase induced using different stimuli of ovulation induction, among them, the intrauterine infusion of llama seminal plasma. Although there were inflammatory mediators present in both phases of the reproductive cycle, llamas in the luteal phase induced by seminal plasma presented the highest concentration of inflammatory mediators indicating that seminal plasma is rich in compounds that significantly influence the endometrial secretion of these inflammatory mediators. The establishment of a state of immunotolerance in the female reproductive tract is important for embryo development, implantation and placentation. Llamas are induced ovulators and more than 98% of pregnancies occur in the left uterine horn. The objective of this study was to determine the uterine immune response of llamas in different stages of the reproductive cycle. Adult llamas (n = 20) were examined daily by transrectal ultrasonography to determine follicular growth and then randomly assigned to four groups: Follicular phase (n = 5); Luteal phase induced by an intramuscular administration of 50 ug of GnRH analogue (n = 5); Luteal phase induced by intrauterine infusion of seminal plasma (n = 5); and Luteal phase induced by mating (n = 5). Uterine fluid was collected separately from both uterine horns by non-surgical flushing to determine the presence of cells, total proteins and concentration of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IFN gamma, TNF-alpha and PGE2. Inflammatory cells were not observed in the uterine fluid and total protein pattern and inflammatory mediators did not differ between the left and the right horn amongst groups. Llamas treated with an intrauterine infusion of seminal plasma showed the highest concentration of total proteins, inflammatory cytokines PGE2, IL-8 and IL-1 beta in the uterine fluid. In conclusion, seminal plasma is made up of significant numbers of signaling molecules that are able to modify the uterine immune response in llamas.

AB  - Main conclusionInter-plant signalling effects on cotton defences are shaped by the joint effects of emitter herbivore load and soil salinity stress, with latter strengthening such effects on direct defences but weakening those on indirect defences.AbstractVolatile-mediated plant-to-plant signalling in response to herbivory is well documented, but its contingency on abiotic factors and variation in herbivore load is poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated how soil salinity levels and herbivore load may influence signalling effects on plant defences and resistance in wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), using the specialist herbivore Alabama argillacea (cotton leafworm). We conducted a greenhouse experiment where plants were grouped in triplets: one acting as the emitter and the other two as receivers. Each triplet was placed inside a mesh cage. Both emitters and receivers were exposed to either ambient (control) or augmented soil salinity. Emitters at each salinity level underwent three treatments: no damage, damage by one or three caterpillars. After 48 h of damage, we collected VOCs from the emitters, which were removed from the cages at 72 h. Afterwards, we damaged the receiver plants to test for the priming effects on the induction of extrafloral nectar (EFN) and terpenoid aldehyde content, as well as on resistance to herbivory. Herbivory increased VOC emissions significantly under high herbivory load, but salinization reduced this effect. Receivers exposed to VOC from plants with high herbivore load induced a greater EFN concentration compared to those exposed to control emitters, an effect that disappeared under augmented salinity. Soil salinity did not affect the signalling effect on terpenoid aldehyde content but did influence herbivore resistance. These findings suggest that signalling depends on herbivore load and soil salinity, with the latter enhancing or affecting the induction depending on the plant defense traits.

AB  - Birds are some of the most diverse organisms on Earth, with species inhabiting a wide variety of niches across every major biome. As such, birds are vital to our understanding of modern ecosystems. Unfortunately, our understanding of the evolutionary history of modern ecosystems is hampered by knowledge gaps in the origin of modern bird diversity and ecosystem ecology. A crucial part of addressing these shortcomings is improving our understanding of the earliest birds, the non-avian avialans (i.e. non-crown birds), particularly of their diet. The diet of non-avian avialans has been a matter of debate, in large part because of the ambiguous qualitative approaches that have been used to reconstruct it. Here we review methods for determining diet in modern and fossil avians (i.e. crown birds) as well as non-avian theropods, and comment on their usefulness when applied to non-avian avialans. We use this to propose a set of comparable, quantitative approaches to ascertain fossil bird diet and on this basis provide a consensus of what we currently know about fossil bird diet. While no single approach can precisely predict diet in birds, each can exclude some diets and narrow the dietary possibilities. We recommend combining (i) dental microwear, (ii) landmark-based muscular reconstruction, (iii) stable isotope geochemistry, (iv) body mass estimations, (v) traditional and/or geometric morphometric analysis, (vi) lever modelling, and (vii) finite element analysis to reconstruct fossil bird diet accurately. Our review provides specific methodologies to implement each approach and discusses complications future researchers should keep in mind. We note that current forms of assessment of dental mesowear, skull traditional morphometrics, geometric morphometrics, and certain stable isotope systems have yet to be proven effective at discerning fossil bird diet. On this basis we report the current state of knowledge of non-avian avialan diet which remains very incomplete. The ancestral dietary condition in non-avian avialans remains unclear due to scarce data and contradictory evidence in Archaeopteryx. Among early non-avian pygostylians, Confuciusornis has finite element analysis and mechanical advantage evidence pointing to herbivory, whilst Sapeornis only has mechanical advantage evidence indicating granivory, agreeing with fossilised ingested material known for this taxon. The enantiornithine ornithothoracine Shenqiornis has mechanical advantage and pedal morphometric evidence pointing to carnivory. In the hongshanornithid ornithuromorph Hongshanornis only mechanical advantage evidence indicates granivory, but this agrees with evidence of gastrolith ingestion in this taxon. Mechanical advantage and ingested fish support carnivory in the songlingornithid ornithuromorph Yanornis. Due to the sparsity of robust dietary assignments, no clear trends in non-avian avialan dietary evolution have yet emerged. Dietary diversity seems to increase through time, but this is a preservational bias associated with a predominance of data from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Lagerstatte. With this new framework and our synthesis of the current knowledge of non-avian avialan diet, we expect dietary knowledge and evolutionary trends to become much clearer in the coming years, especially as fossils from other locations and climates are found. This will allow for a deeper and more robust understanding of the role birds played in Mesozoic ecosystems and how this developed into their pivotal role in modern ecosystems.

AB  - Polyphagous butterflies, i.e., those that feed on multiple host plants, need to evolve adaptations against the defenses of many plants. Studies have focused on chemical defenses of host plants and counter-adaptations of their herbivores. Physical defenses, despite being the first line of defense of many plants, have received little attention. Grass feeding butterflies are among the most speciose adaptive radiations among insects. Grasses rely primarily on physical rather than chemical defenses. Therefore, it is interesting to understand how butterflies have adapted to grass feeding. Mandibles are the principal biting and chewing organs in insect larvae, and mandible morphology should affect the ability of butterflies to effectively feed on their host plants. We here ask whether grass feeding butterflies have plasticity in mandibular morphology to cope with grass physical defenses, using the widespread grass feeding butterfly Mycalesis mineus as a model. We first show that physical defenses of grasses, such as leaf toughness, presence of silica deposits and trichomes, negatively affect body size of the butterfly. Our results further indicate that larvae of M. mineus show mandible plasticity, with increased mandibular length and relative mass investment, when feeding on tougher leaves and leaves with silica deposits. We suggest that the evolution of mandible plasticity may have been a key component of the coevolutionary arms race between grasses and herbivorous insects. This plasticity may have also allowed butterflies such as M. mineus to colonize a broad range of habitats and geographic regions.

AB  - The presented work considers the population of the maral (Cervus elaphus sibiricus Severtzov, 1873) as a species naturalized in the middle reaches of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River, on the territory of the Tunguska State Nature Reserve. For the first time, successful settlement and naturalization of maral in the middle taiga forests of the south of Evenkia, which began in 2018-2019, was described. The climatic, biological and anthropogenic factors of the expansion of its range were considered. In this area, the average annual air temperature has so far remained below the temperature regime typical of most of the maral's range within Krasnoyarsk krai. This is evidence in favor of the hypothesis of an indirect influence of climatic changes that manifested themselves in the north of Central Siberia on the settlement of the maral. The most likely decisive factor in the red deer's northward movement is anthropogenic impact, which resulted in an increase in the number of feeding stations and the anxiety factor in the native range.

AB  - To investigate the mitigative effects of glycyrrhiza extract (GE) and curcumin (CUR) on the antioxidant and immune functions of the Guizhou black goat exposed to cadmium (Cd), 50 healthy Guizhou black goats (11.08 +/- 0.22 kg, male, six months old) were used in a 60-day trial and were randomly assigned to five groups with 10 replicates per group, one goat per replicate. All goats were fed a basal diet, with drinking water and additives varying slightly between groups. Control group: tap water (0.56 mu g<middle dot>L-1 Cd); Cd group: drinking water containing Cd (20 mg Cd<middle dot>kg(-1)<middle dot>body weight, CdCl2<middle dot>2.5H(2)O); GE group: drinking water containing Cd, at days 31 to 60, the basic diet had added 500 mg<middle dot>kg(-1) GE; CUR group: drinking water containing Cd, at days 31 to 60, the basic diet had added 500 mg<middle dot>kg(-1) CUR; combined group: drinking water containing Cd, at days 31 to 60, the basic diet had added 500 mg<middle dot>kg(-1) GE and CUR. Compared with the Cd group, GE and CUR significantly increased the levels of hemoglobin and red blood cell count in the blood, and the activities of serum antioxidant enzyme activity and immune function in the Guizhou black goat (p < 0.05). The treatment effect in the combined group was better than that in the GE and CUR groups. The results showed that GE and CUR improved the antioxidant and immune functions of the serum and livers of the Guizhou black goat and alleviated the toxicity damage of Cd contamination. This research has positive implications for both livestock management and human health.

AB  - Many factors, involving parity and body condition can have a profound effect on physiological and sensory determinants of maternal behavior and, consequently, the establishment of the ewe-lamb bond. Thus, exploring the factors and their interactions that influence maternal behavior is critical to improve the overall lamb survival and welfare. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of parity and body condition score (BCS) on early ewe-lamb bonding behaviors and pre-weaning growth performance in lambs. The study was carried out with 12 first-parity (primiparous; PP), 12 second-parity (biparous: BP), and 14 third or more parity (multiparous: MP) Norduz ewes and 38 singleton lambs. In the study, ewe-lamb bonding behaviors were analyzed based on parity (PP, BP, and MP) and body condition score groups (BCS <= 3 and BCS > 3). Behaviors of ewes and lambs from each group were monitored for a period of 3 hours after parturition, and the ewe-lamb separation test was performed within the first 24 hours after parturition. Maternal behaviors such as latency to grooming, the number of low and high pitch bleats, and preventing sucking and neonatal behaviors such as latency to successful suck, the number of bleats and the total sucking duration were determined. The live weights of the lambs were recorded every 2 weeks until the 90th day. Ewes were grazed entirely on pasture without extra feed supplementation during the pasture season. Ewes were fed with alfalfa hay and gradually supplemented with barley and concentrate throughout the winter. While the grooming duration was not affected by parity, BCS > 3 ewes had longer grooming duration than BCS <= 3 ewes (P < 0.05). More prevention of sucking, butting, and low and high pitch bleating were counted for PP ewes than BP and MP ewes (P < 0.05). Parallel to these results, PP lambs had the longest latency to successful suck (P = 0.046) and the highest number of sucking attempts (P = 0.033). The mean sucking duration of MP lambs was significantly longer than PP lambs (P < 0.038). Birth weight of PP lambs was lower than MP lambs, but neither parity nor BCS had a significant effect on growth performance of lambs. In conclusion, the findings of the study showed that lack of maternal experience caused a negative effect on co-operation with lamb sucking attempts, but did not significantly affect growth performance. It can be suggested that BCS had little effect on maternal behavior and growth performance of lambs for ewes with a body condition score of 2.85-3.33 during the mating period. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) greatly suppresses the growth and recrystallization by curving the hexagonal shape of ice crystals. Study was conducted to evaluate effect of GO as cryoprotectant in semen extender for augmenting sperm viability in dairy (cattle and buffalo) animals. In experiment one, semen was extended with TRIS Egg Yolk Glycerol (TEYG) extender supplemented with different concentrations of GO: 0.0125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.2 mg ml(-1). Freezing of semen samples was conducted at 30 degrees C min(-1) from temperature drop from 4 degrees C to -15 degrees C and -15 degrees C to -60 degrees C followed by 50 degrees C min(-1) from -60 degrees C to -140 degrees C, and the semen straws were plunged in liquid nitrogen. Second experiment evaluated the performance of TEYG extender supplemented with combinations of GO (G05 as 0.05 and G10 as 0.1 mg ml(-1)) and glycerol (T48 as 4.8 and T64 as 6.4%) in four groups as G05T48, G05T64, G10T48 and G10T64. Freezing rates of 30 degrees C min(-1)[Protocol (PRT) I], 40 degrees C min(-1) (PRT II) and 50 degrees C min(-1) (PRT III) in the critical temperature fall zone of -15 degrees C to -60 degrees C were evaluated for semen extender supplemented with glycerol 6.4% and GO 0.05 mg ml(-1) in the third experiment. Cattle (n = 3) and buffalo (n = 3) bulls were chosen for the study taking six ejaculates per bull per treatment. Post-thaw sperm motility, membrane integrity, viability and abnormalities were observed by means of CASA, Hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST), Eosin-Nigrosin stain and Rose Bengal stain procedures, respectively. Post-thaw total motility (TM), progressive motility (PM), VCL, VSL, VAP, HOST response and viability increased significantly in extender with GO concentrations of 0.1 and 0.05 mg ml(-1) as compared to control. Per cent abnormalities were significantly (p < .05) lower in group with GO 0.025 and 0.0125 mg ml(-1) as compared to control. Results from the second experiment showed higher post-thaw TM, PM, VCL, VAP, VSL, HOST response, viability increased significantly (p < .05) in G05T64 and G05T48 as compared to G10T64. Sperm abnormalities did not vary among the groups as compared to control for cattle spermatozoa. In the third experiment post-thaw TM, PM, VCL, VSL, VAP, HOS response and sperm viability increased significantly (p < .05) in PRT III as compared to PRT I for buffalo and cattle spermatozoa. Sperm abnormalities were significantly (p < .05) lower in PRT II and PRT III as compared to PRT I for buffalo, whereas, lower in PRT II as compared to PRTI for cattle spermatozoa. GO as cryoprotectant when added to semen extender at the rate of 0.05 and 0.1 mg ml(-1), resulted in better plasma membrane function and viability. Glycerol concentration below 6.4% in buffalo semen extender reduced post-thaw quality of sperm even when GO was added to the extender. Higher freezing rate of 50 degrees C min(-1) in the critical temperature fall zone of -15 to -60 degrees C perform better than the freezing rate of 30 degrees C min(-1). It is concluded that TEYG extender having glycerol 6.4% and GO 0.05 mg ml(-1) improved post-thaw semen quality of cattle and buffalo.

AB  - Zooplankton are important linkages in the food web and can respond nonlinearly to environmental changes. Marine organisms thrive from spring to summer. Thus, it is crucial to understand how ecological functions of zooplankton communities may shift under seasonal environmental changes during this period. Samples were collected from May to August (May, June-I, June-II, July-I, July-II, and August) in 2018 in Haizhou Bay, Jiangsu, East China for zooplankton and environmental variables. Crustaceans accounted for 75 out of 134 zooplankton taxa and 91.8% of total zooplankton abundance. The average abundance of crustacean varied between 2 824.6 +/- 635.4 inds./m(3) in July-II and 6 502.7 +/- 1 008.8 inds./m(3) in June-II. Multivariate analyses results showed that the dissimilarity of community increased gradually in the time series. Body length, feeding type, trophic group, and reproduction mode were used to investigate crustacean community functions. Trait-based functional groups contained species with similar ecological roles. Functional diversity fused the differences of species and trait. The proportion of large-sized species (2-5 mm) decreased with the increasing proportion of medium-sized species (1-2 mm). The proportion of current feeders increased with the drop in the proportion of mixed feeders. Parthenogenesis species increased with decreasing free spawners, and omnivores-carnivores increased with decreasing omnivoresherbivores. Generalized additive models suggested that temperature was the main driver of variations in crustacean zooplankton function. Seven identified functional groups varied with increasing temperature. Omnivorous-herbivorous copepods declined (90.0%-68.0%), whereas the parthenogenetic cladocerans increased (0-24.1%). The small egg-brooding ambush copepods fluctuated (6.5%-9.3%) with increasing water temperature. The other functional groups changed slightly. Functional diversity also varied according to temperature changes.

AB  - Multitrophic plant-insect interactions are mediated by plant volatiles. The emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles is influenced by environmental conditions, such as soil microbes and nutrient composition, with consequences for above-ground trophic interactions. Here, we investigated whether insect exuviae in the soil alter the plant's volatile blend and attraction of parasitoids in the laboratory and whether this attraction also occurs in the field. We studied the effects of soil amendment with exuviae originating from three insect species, Tenebrio molitor, Acheta domesticus and Hermetia illucens, on the proportion of parasitised Plutella xylostella caterpillars and Brevicoryne brassicae aphids in the field in three consecutive years. In the laboratory, we collected and analysed the volatile blend of amended plants infested with caterpillars or aphids. The attraction of the parasitoids Diadegma semiclausum and Diaeretiella rapae, respectively, towards these volatile blends was assessed in an olfactometer. Our study shows that insect exuviae-amended soil enhanced the proportion of parasitised herbivores of two species in the field. Relative amounts of several components of the plant volatile blend were affected by soil amendment. Soil amendment with Acheta domesticus or Tenebrio molitor exuviae resulted in an increased attraction of the two parasitoid species in the olfactometer. Soil amendment with insect exuviae altered the plant volatile blend leading to enhanced attraction of parasitoids in laboratory assays. These effects were sustained under the complex and variable biotic and abiotic conditions in the field. Our results underline the importance of belowground processes, such as the decomposition of insect exuviae, on aboveground volatile-mediated multitrophic interactions.

AB  - Context. The wide-ranging movement of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) is largely driven by the spatio-temporal distribution of water and forage, and often leads to their travelling outside of formally protected areas. With an increase in drier periods predicted across Africa due to climate change, it is critically important to understand how elephants physiologically respond to alterations in the availability and distribution of resources. Aims. We assessed variation in the adrenal activity of elephants living in Kenya's Tsavo East National Park between wet and dry seasons, as well as among individuals found in Tsavo East National Park and privately protected Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary (part of the Kasigau REDD+ wildlife corridor) in the dry season, when the area experiences an influx of elephants in search of alternative resources. Methods. We opportunistically collected fresh elephant faecal samples across the two seasons and locations for analysis of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM, a proxy for stress) and nitrogen (Nf, an indirect measure of diet quality) concentrations. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was employed as an additional indicator of habitat quality. Key results. In Tsavo East N.P. Nf and NDVI were both significantly lower during the dry season, indicating poorer habitat quality compared with the wet season. Although elephant fGCM concentrations tended to be higher in the dry season than the wet, the differences were not significant. There was no difference between elephant fGCMs measured in Tsavo East N.P. and Rukinga W.S. during the dry season, nor in habitat quality between the two locations. Conclusions. Elephants living in Tsavo may be physiologically unaffected by (or adapt to) typical seasonal changes in habitat quality that could lead to nutritional stress; however, whether this is the case during extended periods of severe drought requires further investigation. Rukinga W.S. provides a safe haven of sufficient habitat quality for elephants searching for alternative resources during this period.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat production is the least popular and most underrated livestock sector in the Republic of Serbia. Back in the 1950 & PRIME;s, goats were anathematized as being the ''destroyers'' of the woods, and in 1954, the infamous Law on the Prohibition of Goat Keeping was implemented on the pretext of preserving the woods. This was unprecedented and never seen anywhere worldwide, but it led to the almost complete devastation of goats as it lasted for decades. Revitalization of the goat sector began decades later through the import of high-yield breeds such as French Alpine and Saanen goats. However, the autochthonous populations of goats that were on the brink of extinction are still to this day considered endangered. There is insufficient scientific data supporting goat production in Serbia, but there's primarily a lack of relevant research concerning autochthonous breeds. The present study is an attempt to contribute to overall scientific research in the goat sector and particularly to goat genetic resources through their characterization, as recognizing, preserving, and encouraging the breeding of locally specific breeds is important from the standpoint of zootechnical, ethical, cultural, as well as scientific reasons. This study investigated the possibility of using morphometric measurements to differentiate the autochthonous Serbian White goat breed from Saanen and Balkan goats, which were used as sire and dam breeds in its creation. For this purpose, a multivariate discriminant analysis was used. A total of 11 morphometric traits were measured in 98 does of 3 breeds: Saanen (n = 28), Balkan (n = 28), and Serbian White (n = 42), aged 2 to 7 years, in 4 different locations. Univariate analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in body measurements of all three breeds, with Saanen goat being the largest in format and Balkan the smallest. Discriminant analysis extracted six out of eleven tested morphometric traits with the strongest discriminatory power: heart girth, head length, chest depth, head width, pelvic width, and body length. Mahalanobis distances were significant between all three genetic groups. The discriminant function correctly classified 95.24% of the Domestic White goats investigated to their source group. The classification accuracy of the function was cross-validated and indicated an overall success rate of 91.84%. The results of this research showed that there was a clear separation between Serbian White, Saanen, and Balkan goats. The present findings could help a more rapid field assessment of Serbian White goats.

AB  - The endogenous biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in fish is species specific and depends on several factors, such as trophic level, feeding habits, environmental characteristics, taxonomic position and mainly the conservation and activity of fatty acid desaturases (Fads) and elongases (Elovl). Therefore, the study of the evolutionary conservation of these genes in different species of fish has become routine in order to understand lipid metabolism and its essentiality in each species studied. Despite its importance to fish, there is a lack of understanding how the environment and trophic level affect the capacity for biosynthesis of LC-PUFAs in freshwater carnivorous teleosts. The red piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri) is a carnivorous freshwater fish of interest in Brazilian aquaculture. In this present project, at a bioinformatics level, we identified the genes and characterized the proteins of the Fads2 and Elovls present in the red piranha genome. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Fads2 and Elovls proteins are closely related to previously characterized proteins from freshwater carnivorous and herbivorous fish species. As a conclusion, we suggest that the red piranha has the possible, at least partial, ability to bioconvert C18 PUFA into LC-PUFAs through the activities of Fads2 and Elovls.

AB  - Despite the role of microorganisms in nitrogen biotransformation has been extensively explored, how microorganisms mitigate NH3 emissions in the transformation of nitrogen throughout the composting system is rarely addressed. The present study explored the effect of microbial inoculants (MIs) and the contribution of different composted phases (solid, leachate, and gas) on NH3 emissions by constructing a co-composting system of kitchen waste and sawdust with and without the addition of MI. The results showed that NH3 emissions increased markedly after adding MIs, in which the contribution of leachate ammonia volatilization to NH3 emissions was most prominent. The core micro-organisms of NH3 emission had a clear proliferation owing to the MIs reshaping community stochastic process. Also, MIs can strengthen the co-occurrence between microorganisms and functional genes of nitrogen to promote nitrogen metabolism. In particular, the abundances of nrfA, nrfH, and nirB genes, which could augment the dissimilatory nitrate reduction process, were increased, thus enhancing NH3 emissions. This study bolsters the fundamental, community-level understanding of nitrogen reduction treatments for agricultural.

AB  - The present study determined i) the presence of proteins (oviduct-specific glycoprotein, OVGP1; heat shock protein-70A, HSPA1A; heat shock protein-A8, HSPA8; annexin A1, ANXA1; annexin A5, ANXA5; and myosin-9, MYH9) known to be involved in early reproduction in the oviduct fluid (OF) of anestrous goats; and ii) the functional effect of during IVF on polyspermy modulation and embryonic development. In vitro-matured oocytes were co-cultured with spermatozoa (1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 x 106 cells/mL) for 18 h in SOF medium supplemented with 5 mg/mL of heparin, 4 mg/mL gentamicin, and 10% estrus sheep serum (CTRL1, CTRL2, and CTRL4 groups) or the same medium plus 10% OF (OF1, OF2, and OF4 groups) obtained from anestrus goats. The analysis of OF by western blotting confirmed the presence of the six proteins tested for. The increase in sperm concentration had no effect (P > 0.05) on the penetration rate in any group; however, monospermy rate decreased as sperm concentration was increased in both OF and CTRL. Regardless of the concentration used, when data were pooled, OF supplementation improved (P < 0.05) monospermy and tended (P <1/4> 0.057) to enhance IVF efficiency. Additionally, IVF efficiency was higher (P < 0.05) in OF1 than in OF4 [60 +/- 13 vs 37 +/- 5%). The development capacity was not affected (P > 0.05) by the sperm concentration and OF treatment, and the average values were cleavage (72 +/- 2.6%), blastocyst (37 +/- 3.0%), blastocyst in relation to the cleaved (51 +/- 4.8%), hatched (62 +/- 1.2%), and number of cells per blastocyst (174 +/- 1.8%). In conclusion, the six proteins analyzed are present in the OF of anestrous goats, and the supplementation of this OF during IVF may modulate the polyspermy incidence and enhance IVF efficiency, especially when 1x10(6) sperm per mL is used.

AB  - Sheep husbandry has played a crucial role in supporting rural livelihoods. However, climate change associated heat stress in sheep has a detrimental impact on growth performance. In order to address the negative effects of heat stress on animal growth, scientists have been exploring nutritional solutions like herbal supplements as they have significant effects on feed intake, water intake, and hormonal and molecular mechanisms governing growth in major livestock. However, negligible studies have delved into these aspects in heat-stressed sheep. Thus, the study targeted addressing these concerns focusing on the native Indian sheep breed, Kenguri. The 60-day study conducted using 24 ewes was divided into four groups under different treatments in climate-controlled chambers, including herbal supplementation. The results indicated that herbal supplements improved feed intake and growth-related hormones in heat-stressed ewes. Further, the herbal supplement had a significant role in increasing the expression pattern of genes governing growth. The study established that herbal supplements support the growth performance of heat-stressed sheep. The conclusions show promise for improving climate resilience in Kenguri ewes and open the way for navigating future strategies that sustain sheep production through innovative nutrition and breeding strategies. A study was designed to explore the possibility of using herbal supplementation to sustain growth performance during heat stress exposure in Kenguri sheep. This 60-day study was conducted on 24 Kenguri ewes (1-2 years old), randomly assigned to four treatment groups (n = 6 per group) as follows: KC (n = 6; Kenguri Control), KHS (n = 6; Kenguri Heat Stress), KCS (n = 6; Kenguri Control and herbal supplement), and KHSS (n = 6; Kenguri Heat Stress and herbal supplement). The herbal mixture of Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi), Emblica officinalis (Amla), Morinda citrifolia (Noni), Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), and Phyllostachys edulis (Bamboo) was used in this study. The herbal supplement used in the present study was given to the KCS and KHSS groups' animals in dry powder form at a dose of 0.8 g/Kg BW/Day. All variables were recorded fortnightly, and gene expression analysis was performed at the end of the experiment. The results indicated that the recorded temperature-humidity index (THI) provided thermal comfort for KC and KCS while inducing extremely severe heat stress to the KHS and KHSS groups. Heat stress did not alter the feed intake, while the herbal supplement during heat stress increased the feed intake from day 30 onwards. Furthermore, heat stress significantly (p < 0.001) increased the water intake, while the herbal supplement did not alter the heat stress-induced water intake. In addition, neither heat stress nor herbal supplements influenced the body weight and allometric measurements studied. Furthermore, heat stress significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the level of plasma tri-iodo-thyronine (T-3) and thyroxin (T-4) and had a non-significant effect on plasma growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), while the herbal supplements significantly (p < 0.01) increased the levels of all these hormones studied. Likewise, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the expression patterns of growth hormone receptor (GHR), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) were significantly (p < 0.001) downregulated during heat stress (0.25, 0.3, and 0.48-fold change, respectively). However, the herbal supplement significantly (p < 0.
   01) increased the heat stress-induced reduction in the expression pattern of these three genes (0.65, 0.61, and 0.61-fold change, respectively). Therefore, from this study, it could be concluded that although the herbal supplements did not bring positive changes in body weight and allometric measurements, it still had a beneficial impact on the endocrinology and genes governing growth performance in Kenguri ewes. Thus, the herbal feed additive used in the study shows promise for relieving heat stress in Kenguri ewes.

AB  - Simple Summary Average daily gain (ADG) is influenced by both an individual's direct genetic effect (DGE) and by a social genetic effect (SGE) derived from pen mates. Therefore, identifying the DGE and SGE on ADG is essential for a better understanding of pig breeding systems. We conducted this study to elucidate the genetic characteristics and relationships of DGE and SGE on ADG using purebred and crossbred pigs. We found that the DGE and SGE both contributed to ADG in both populations. In addition, the SGE of purebred pigs was highly correlated with the DGE of crossbred pigs. Furthermore, we identified several genomic regions that may be associated with the DGE and SGE on ADG. Our findings will contribute to future genomic evaluation studies of socially affected traits. Average daily gain (ADG) is an important growth trait in the pig industry. The direct genetic effect (DGE) has been studied mainly to assess the association between genetic information and economic traits. The social genetic effect (SGE) has been shown to affect ADG simultaneously with the DGE because of group housing systems. We conducted this study to elucidate the genetic characteristics and relationships of the DGE and SGE of purebred Korean Duroc and crossbred pigs by single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction and a genome-wide association study. We used the genotype, phenotype, and pedigree data of 1779, 6022, and 7904 animals, respectively. Total heritabilities on ADG were 0.19 +/- 0.04 and 0.39 +/- 0.08 for purebred and crossbred pigs, respectively. The genetic correlation was the greatest (0.77 +/- 0.12) between the SGE of purebred and DGE of crossbred pigs. We found candidate genes located in the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the SGE that were associated with behavior and neurodegenerative diseases, and candidate genes in the QTLs for DGE that were related to body mass, size of muscle fiber, and muscle hypertrophy. These results suggest that the genomic selection of purebred animals could be applied for crossbred performance.

AB  - The success of consumers often depends on synchronizing with their resources; however, recent climate change has affected the phenology of many species, resulting in mismatches and leading to community-wide changes. Field studies chronicling both the dynamics and behavior of four trophic levels seldom run for more than a few years, thereby bringing into question the longer term trajectories of these phenological shifts at multiple levels. Do these shifts between trophic levels remain constant over time, or do they continue to move apart? To address these questions, in 2004, I initiated a long-term study of the phenological relationships of two ferns, a host caterpillar (and its moth), its principal primary parasitoid wasp, and hyperparasitoid wasp. The study involves only a few species at each level, but they make up nearly all the members of the community. Ferns emerged progressively earlier in the spring, at rates exceeding one day per year, while moths eclosed roughly 0.6 days earlier per year, the primary parasitoid at 0.8 days earlier per year, and the hyperparasitoid fluctuated widely. Each of these changes fostered significant mismatches. Year-to-year changes of the moth and primary parasitoid varied much more than those of the ferns. In each instance, dates of last eclosions moved earlier more rapidly than did early eclosion dates, truncating their seasons. The extremely rapid, though variable, changes in phenology of the various trophic levels follow the unprecedentedly rapid temperature increase of the immediately adjacent Gulf of Maine.

AB  - Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) is a vulnerable subspecies, and creation of new colonies is required for its conservation. Capturing mountain ungulates is not only logistically challenging, but also requires careful planning and clinical monitoring in order to ensure animal welfare and survival. This study reports collective physical capture followed by anesthesia of 21 Apennine chamois for translocation with conservation purposes. The chamois were captured with up-net((R)) (Fondazione Universitaria "Centro Ricerche sulla Gestione della fauna selvatica"-CE.RI.GE.FA.S., Sampeyre-CN) or box-traps, then anesthetized with medetomidine-ketamine-acepromazine and monitored with advanced field techniques, including venous blood gas analysis, which was used for the first time on mountain ungulates in Europe. Despite the risk of metabolic acidosis and catching myopathy, 19 chamois survived and adapted to the new environment to found new colonies, which were monitored through GPS radiocollar data of all released chamois.
   The Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) is one of the rarest subspecies in Italy, listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive and currently included as a vulnerable subspecies in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The Maiella National Park population has recently been defined as a source population for reintroduction into other parks. Since collective captures allow for better selection of target animals for the establishment of new colonies, the aim of this study is to evaluate the physiological conditions and animal welfare in free-ranging Apennine chamois after collective physical capture followed by chemical immobilization with medetomidine 0.054 mg +/- 0.007, ketamine 2.14 mg +/- 0.28, and acepromazine 0.043 mg +/- 0.006. Twenty-one Apennine chamois (18 females and 3 males) were captured and translocated for conservation purposes. The effects of capture and anesthesia were evaluated using clinical variables, hematology, serum biochemistry, and venous blood gas analysis, the latter being used in the field for the first time in chamois capture. A risk of metabolic acidosis and capture myopathy was identified, although it did not compromise the survival of 19 chamois, which adapted to novel environments and founded new colonies, as verified through GPS radiocollars. The protocol applied in this study represents an innovative approach to assessing animal physiology and welfare in collective mountain ungulate captures, useful for improving management activities for conservation purposes.

AB  - Synaptic heterogeneity is a hallmark of nervous systems that enables complex and adaptable communication in neural circuits. To understand circuit function, it is thus critical to determine the factors that contribute to the functional diversity of synapses. We investigated the contributions of voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) abundance, spatial organization, and subunit composition to synapse diversity among and between synapses formed by two closely related Drosophila glutamatergic motor neurons with distinct neurotransmitter release probabilities (P-r). Surprisingly, VGCC levels are highly predictive of heterogeneous P-r among individual synapses of either low- or high-P-r inputs, but not between inputs. We find that the same number of VGCCs are more densely organized at high-P-r synapses, consistent with tighter VGCC-synaptic vesicle coupling. We generated endogenously tagged lines to investigate VGCC subunits in vivo and found that the alpha 2 delta-3 subunit Straightjacket along with the CAST/ELKS active zone (AZ) protein Bruchpilot, both key regulators of VGCCs, are less abundant at high-P-r inputs, yet positively correlate with P-r among synapses formed by either input. Consistently, both Straightjacket and Bruchpilot levels are dynamically increased across AZs of both inputs when neurotransmitter release is potentiated to maintain stable communication following glutamate receptor inhibition. Together, these findings suggest a model in which VGCC and AZ protein abundance intersects with input-specific spatial and molecular organization to shape the functional diversity of synapses.

AB  - Soil is an essential element in sustainable agriculture. Improving soil properties and increasing soil fertility can be achieved by increasing the organic matter content of soils. Organic fertilizers are important in eliminating the negativity of the insufficiency of this component of soil. For this purpose, the study was carried out to determine the effect of manure made from sheep wool on some biochemical properties of soil with clay loam texture. Sheep wool manure (SWM) was added to the soil at rates of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 t da(-1). Pepper was grown and some biochemical analyses were done after the harvest. According to the results of the research, pH, salinity, organic matter content, potassium (K), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) concentrations of the soils increased. The contents of other elements [phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu)] did not change in the study. In addition, the effects of sheep wool manure applied in increasing doses on some biological properties of the soil [urease (UEA), dehydrogenase (DEA), acid (ACPEA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALPEA), catalase (CEA) and arylsulfatase enzyme activity (ARSEA), basal soil respiration (BSR)] were statistically significant (p < .01). As the dose of sheep wool manure increases, the aeration of the soil and the water-holding capacity increase.

AB  - Copepods dominate marine zooplankton in abundance and play key roles in pelagic food webs. These small crustaceans show high taxonomic and functional diversity. Although there has been considerable research on their taxonomy, only a few studies have focused on their functional traits. In this study, we analyzed the functional traits of 95 copepod species, considering their body size, trophic regime, feeding behavior, and spawning strategy. Based on samples collected during two surveys (autumn 2020 and summer 2021) located in the coastal waters of three gulfs (Gaeta, Naples, and Salerno) in the highly populated Campania region (the central Tyrrhenian Sea, NW Mediterranean), we identified nine functional groups of copepods with different characteristics. The group that comprised herbivorous copepods with feeding currents and a broadcast strategy was the most abundant in both seasons and all gulfs. This group was dominated by Acartia clausi, Centropages typicus, Temora stylifera, and the Paracalanus parvus complex. The other functional groups showed differences in their temporal and spatial distribution. Our study reports the functional diversity of copepods along the Campania coast, thus contributing to advancing our knowledge of the planktonic trophic structure in a region of considerable importance due to its marine resources and services.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the immunostimulatory effect of tea leaf extract (Camellia sinensis) on Labeo rohita and its resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila infection. The ethanolic extract of green tea (GTEE) was found to be the most potent as compared to other solvent extract which was used for further study. It was used to evaluate immune-biochemical response of L. rohita fingerlings, fed with tea leaf extract (control -0.0%, 0.2% (T1), 0.4% (T2), 0.8% (T3) and 1% (T4) of GTEE kg-1 feed). Different biochemical parameters like glucose, ALP, GPT, GOT, and immunological parameters like lysozyme activity, NBT, anti-protease activity, myeloperoxidase activity, plasma protein, and immune relevant genes (IL-10, C3, Lysozyme G type and iNOS) expressions were carried out. The immunological parameters such as lysozyme activity, NBT and myeloperox-idase activity showed significantly high value once fed with GTEE incorporated diets. Significant up-regulation of immune genes indicated the enhancement of immune response at molecular level. The biochemical parameters were found to be significantly decreasing, indicating that the extract had hepato-protective effect and can help to overcome stress. The fish, fed with GTEE incorporated diets, showed resistance against A. hydrophila when compared with the control group. 0.2% GTEE showed the highest post-challenged survival (76.67%). From the present study, it is concluded that GTEE @ 0.2% can be used as potent immunostimulant as a sustainable alternative prophylactic and therapeutic agent in aquaculture.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are involved in phosphorus (P) mobilization and turnover; however, the impact of their interaction on plant P absorption and organic P mineralization in the hyphosphere (rootless soil) are unknown. This study examined the interactive effects of two native microorganisms, namely Claroideogolmus etuicatum and Bacillus aryabhattai, and the effects of co-inoculation of both microorganisms on organic P mineralization and the subsequent transfer to Camellia oleifera, using a three-compartment microcosm with a nylon mesh barrier. The results demonstrated that the co-inoculation treatment (AMF + PSB) significantly increased the plant P content and biomass accumulation in C. oleifera compared to those of the non-inoculated control. Furthermore, co-inoculation boosted soil phosphatase and phytase activities as well as the liable P content. Compared to the non-inoculated control, inoculation of AMF decreased the NaOH-Po content. A correlation analysis showed that AMF colonization and hyphal density was significantly positively correlated with H2O-P and NaHCO3-Pi and negatively correlated with NaOH-Po. It was shown that co-inoculation could increase phosphatase activity, phytase activity, and promote the liable P content, thus increasing the phosphorus content and biomass accumulation of C. oleifera. In conclusion, AMF and PSB interactively enhanced the mineralization of soil organic P, and therefore positively affected P uptake and plant growth.

AB  - Straws are commonly used padding materials in the ectopic fermentation system, but their effects on greenhouse gas emissions are not well understood. This study compared the effects of rape, rice and corn straws on the fermentation performance of the ectopic fermentation system. Compared with corn straw, the treatment groups with rape straw and rice straw significantly increased the alpha diversity of the fermentation system, and simultaneously mitigated the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O by up to 32.4% and 93.9%, respectively. The CO2 and N2O peak emission in the treatment group with corn straw reached 1.4 x 106 6 and 36.2 mg/m(2)/d, respectively. CH4 4 peak emission was one order of magnitude lower than that of N2O in the ectopic fermentation system. Redundancy analysis showed that Pseudoxanthomonas sp000510725 was the key specie that positively affect the fermentation temperature, CO2 and N2O emissions in the fermentation system. Nitrogen metabolism genes, such as nosZ, nirK, and nirS were more abundant in the surface layer of the fermentation system, indicating more active nitrogen metabolism in this region, and the core zone could be the primary source of N2O emissions. Those findings indicated that rape and rice straw can be potential padding materials for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in large-scale ectopic fermentation system.

AB  - The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs), and pathogens in animal food processing environments (FAPE) poses a significant risk to human health. However, knowledge of the contamination and risk profiles of a typical commercial pig slaughterhouse with periodic disinfectant applications is limited. By creating the overall metagenomics-based behavior and risk profiles of ARGs, DRGs, and microbiomes in a nine-section pig slaughterhouse, an important FAPE in China. A total of 454 ARGs and 84 DRGs were detected in the slaughterhouse with resistance genes for aminoglycosides and quaternary ammonium compounds, respectively. The entire slaughtering chain is a hotspot for pathogens, including 83 human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), with 47 core HPB. In addition, 68 high-risk ARGs were significantly correlated with 55 HPB, 30 of which were recognized as potential bacteria co-resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants, confirm a three-fold risk of ARGs, DRGs, and pathogens prevailing throughout the chain. Pre-slaughter pig house (PSPH) was the major risk source for ARGs, DRGs, and HPB. Moreover, 75 Escherichia coli and 47 Proteus mirabilis isolates showed sensitivity to potassium monopersulfate and sodium hypochlorite, suggesting that slaughterhouses should use such related disinfectants. By using whole genome multi-locus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses, genetically closely related bacteria were identified across distinct slaughter sections, suggesting bacterial transmission across the slaughter chain. Overall, this study underscores the critical role of the PSPH section as a major source of HPB, ARGs, and DRGs contamination in commercial pig slaughterhouses. Moreover, it highlights the importance of addressing clonal transmission and cross-contamination of antibioticand disinfectant-resistant bacteria within and between slaughter sections. These issues are primarily attributed to the microbial load carried by animals before slaughter, carcass handling, and content exposure during visceral treatment. Our findings provide valuable insights for One Health-oriented slaughterhouse management practices.

AB  - Rewetting drained peatlands for paludiculture purposes is a way to reduce peat oxidation (and thus CO2 emissions) while at the same time it could generate an income for landowners, who need to convert their traditional farming into wetland farming. The side effect of rewetting drained peatlands is that it potentially induces high methane (CH4) emission. Topsoil removal could reduce this emission due to the removal of easily degradable carbon and nutrients. Another way to limit CH4 emission is the choice in paludiculture species. In this study we conducted a field experiment in the coastal area of the Netherlands, in which a former non-intensively used drained peat grassland is rewetted to complete inundation (water table similar to+18 cm) after a topsoil removal of similar to 20 cm. Two emergent macrophytes with a high potential of internal gas transport (Typha latifolia and Typha angustifolia), and a free floating macrophyte (Azolla filiculoides) were introduced and intensive measurement campaigns were conducted to capture CO2 and CH4 fluxes, soil and surface water chemistry. Greenhouse gas fluxes were compared to a high-productive peat meadow as reference site.
   Topsoil removal reduced the amount of phosphorus and iron in the soil to a large extent. The total amount of soil carbon per volume stayed more or less the same. The salinity of the soil was in general high defining the system as brackish. Despite the topsoil removal and salinity, we found very high CH4 emission for T. latifolia (84.7 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)), compared to the much lower emissions from T. angustifolia (36.9 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) and Azolla (22.2 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). The high emission can be partly explained by the large input of dissolved organic carbon into the system, but it could also be caused by plant stress factors, like salinity level and herbivory. For the total CO2 flux (including C-export), the rewetting was effective, with a minor uptake of CO2 for Azolla (-0.13 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) and a larger uptake for the Typa species (-1.14 and -1.26 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) for T. angustifolia and T. latifolia, respectively) compared to the emission of 2.06 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) for the reference site.
   T. angustifolia and Azolla, followed by T. latifolia, seem to have the highest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions after rewetting to flooded conditions (- 1.4, 2.9, and 10.5 t CO2 eq . ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) compared with reference drained peatlands (20.6 t CO2 eq.ha(-1) yr(-1)). When considering the total greenhouse gas balance, other factors, such as biomass use and storage of topsoil after removal, should be considered. Especially the latter factor could cause substantial carbon losses if not kept in anoxic conditions. When calculating the radiative forcing over time for the different paludicrops, which includes the GHG fluxes and the carbon release from the removed topsoil, T. latifolia will start to be beneficial in reducing global warming after 93 years compared with the reference site. For both Azolla and T. angustifolia this will be after 43 years.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites may impose detrimental consequences on wildlife populations due to their capacity to cause mortality and reduce fitness. Additionally, wild animals play an important role in the transmission of zoonoses. Despite this importance, information on GI parasites of tropical wild mammals is critically lacking. The present study aimed to document GI parasites of six wild-dwelling large mammal taxa in Sri Lanka: Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), civet (Paradoxurus sp.), Leopard (Panthera pardus), Grey langur (Semnopithecus priam) and buffalo (Bubalus sp). Fresh faecal samples (n = 56) collected from the Wasgomuwa National Park, Sri Lanka were subjected to coprological examination using faecal smears, and the brine floatation technique followed by microscopic identification; quantitative data were accrued using the formol-ether method. The survey revealed a high prevalence of GI parasites, where 86% (48/56) of faecal samples screened positive for parasitic infections. Faecal samples of the civet, buffalo and Leopard recorded 100% prevalence, while the lowest (40%) was recorded for the Grey langur. Eight types of GI parasites were documented: protozoan cysts, platyhelminth ova (three types of digenean and a single cyclophillidean type), nematode ova (strongyle, strongyloid, ascarid, and trichuroid types) and rhabditiform larvae. The buffaloes and civets had a comparatively high number and diversity of GI parasites (buffalo: 7 types, H' = 1.02; civet: 6 types, H' = 1.52), whilst only a single type (digenean) was detected in the Grey langur. Likewise, parasite loads were also highly variable; highest in the bear (486 per g faeces) and lowest in the monkey (10 per g faeces). The outcome of this survey is important on two accounts; i) to fill the knowledge gap on GI parasites of tropical wild mammals, and ii) the revelation of many first-time parasite-host records for some of the threatened wild-dwelling large mammals in Sri Lanka.

AB  - The hippoboscid Lipoptena fortisetosa Maa, 1965 is a hematophagous ectoparasite of cervids that can bite humans. This fly is expanding its geographical range and is of concern for animal and human health since it can potentially harbour harmful microorganisms. This study was aimed at characterizing the bacterial communities of L. fortisetosa in its different life-cycle stages. Pupae and wingless adults were collected from cervids hunted in Tuscan-Emilian Apennines (central Italy) and pooled into groups of 10 by life stage (30 individual pupae; 1420 individual wingless adults). Winged flies were caught by sweep netting and separated into five pools of 10 insects. After DNA extraction, the bacterial content of each pool was analysed using 16 S metabarcoding. Results revealed that the composition and relative abundance of different taxa greatly differed in the three analysed groups. Wingless adults showed a high abundance of Bartonella (33.07%), which is almost absent in winged flies and pupae. Among the detected pathogens, four genera of concern for human health were found: Bartonella, Moraxella, Mycobacterium and Rickettsia. Interestingly reads similar to Bartonella bovis, Moraxella osloensis and Arsenophonus lipopteni Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTUs) were detected. These findings suggest the possible role of L. fortisetosa as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms, confirming the need for further investigation to ascertain its vectorial capacity.

AB  - Boar sperm are less resistant to drastic changes in the external environment during cryopreservation, mainly because their plasma membranes are rich in unsaturated fatty acids but lack cholesterol and are thus susceptible to lipid peroxidation caused by the attack of reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the effect of adding phosphocreatine to cryopreservation extenders on boar sperm quality and antioxidant capacity. Different concentrations (0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5 mmol/L) of phosphocreatine were added to the cryopreservation extender. After thawing, sperm were analysed for morphological parameters, kinetic parameters, acrosome integrity, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, DNA integrity and antioxidant enzyme activity. The results showed that 10.0 mmol/L phosphocreatine samples enhanced the boar sperm motility, viability, average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity and beat cross frequency after cryopreservation and reduced the malformation rate compared to the control group (p < .05). The acrosome integrity, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and DNA integrity of boar sperm were higher than those of the control group after adding 10.0 mmol/L phosphocreatine to the cryopreservation extender (p < .05). Extenders containing 10.0 mmol/L phosphocreatine maintained high total antioxidant capacity; elevated the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase; reduced malondialdehyde and H2O2 content (p < .05). Therefore, adding phosphocreatine to the extender is potentially beneficial for boar sperm cryopreservation at an optimal 10.0 mmol/L concentration.

AB  - Simple Summary In intensive sheep farming, the temperature is an important indicator of the healthy growth of sheep. The key to ensuring the healthy growth of sheep in a stress-free environment is to grasp the changing trend in the sheep-house temperature in time and adjust in advance. In order to solve this problem, we use machine learning technology to establish a combined prediction model to accurately predict the temperature of the sheep barn. The result shows that the combined prediction model has good stability and high accuracy. Additionally, it can be extended to the prediction research of other environmental parameters of other animal houses, such as pig houses and cow houses, in the future. Too high or too low temperature in the sheep house will directly threaten the healthy growth of sheep. Prediction and early warning of temperature changes is an important measure to ensure the healthy growth of sheep. Aiming at the randomness and empirical problem of parameter selection of the traditional single Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, this paper proposes an optimization method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Then, using the proposed PCA-PSO-XGBoost to predict the temperature in the sheep house. First, PCA is used to screen the key influencing factors of the sheep house temperature. The dimension of the input vector of the model is reduced; PSO-XGBoost is used to build a temperature prediction model, and the PSO optimization algorithm selects the main hyperparameters of XGBoost. We carried out a global search and determined the optimal hyperparameters of the XGBoost model through iterative calculation. Using the data of the Xinjiang Manas intensive sheep breeding base to conduct a simulation experiment, the results show that it is different from the existing ones. Compared with the temperature prediction model, the evaluation indicators of the PCA-PSO-XGBoost model proposed in this paper are root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE) , which are 0.0433, 0.0019, 0.9995, 0.0065, respectively. RMSE, MSE, and MAE are improved by 68, 90, and 94% compared with the traditional XGBoost model. The experimental results show that the model established in this paper has higher accuracy and better stability, can effectively provide guiding suggestions for monitoring and regulating temperature changes in intensive housing and can be extended to the prediction research of other environmental parameters of other animal houses such as pig houses and cow houses in the future.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in human-dominated landscapes faces increased challenges due to rising conflicts between humans and wildlife. We investigated the human and wildlife loss rates due to human-wildlife conflict between 2000 and 2020 in Nepal. We concentrated on Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis), tiger (Panthera tigirs), and leopard (Panthera pardus) mortality, as well as human mortality caused by these species. Over the 21-year period, we recorded 1139 cases of wildlife mortality and 887 cases of human mortality. Leopard mortality was the highest, followed by that of greater one-horned rhinos, tigers, and Asian elephants. Overall, the rate of wildlife mortality has been increasing over the years. Asian elephants were found to be more responsible for crop damage than greater one-horned rhinos, while leopards were found to be more responsible for livestock depredation than tigers. The generalized linear model indicated that the mortality of wildlife in the districts is best predicted by the additive effect of human mortality, the proportion of agricultural land, and the literacy rate of the districts. Retaliatory wildlife mortality was the most challenging issue for wildlife conservation, especially for the large mammals. Findings from this study are important for mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts, controlling retaliatory killing, and conserving these threatened large mammals.

AB  - Rhino rays (order Rhinopristiformes) are among the most threatened marine species. India is one of the world's top shark and ray fishing nations and harbours a high diversity of these species, but research on them has been limited. This study provides insights on rhino ray status, utilisation, and conservation across 5 large fishing harbours in India (Porbandar, Mumbai, Chennai, Ganjam, and Digha) by describing fishers' ecological knowledge of fisheries interactions, patterns of catches and utilisation, and perceptions and attitudes towards rhino ray conservation. Interviews (n = 161) revealed that rhino rays are considered bycatch (99.3% of respondents), with catch declines of up to 95% in the last decade (85%, n = 137) and unsustainable fishing noted as the leading cause of declines. Primary use was for local consumption (71%, n = 114), mostly as fresh meat. Large-bodied individuals (>1 m total length [TL]) could reportedly be sold for the fin trade or locally consumed. Small-bodied individuals (<1 m TL) were reportedly discarded at sea, consumed, or considered trash fish. Knowledge of products, prices, and trends in utilisation was mostly anecdotal, and it was evident that respondents' concern for rhino ray conservation was very low. The lack of ecological knowledge was assessed to be due to population declines. Overall, 78% of respondents (n = 126) had higher use-oriented attitudes towards rhino rays than conservation-oriented attitudes. Hence, conservation actions need to be complemented with policies to protect rhino ray species and critical habitats. Our findings demonstrate the urgency of immediate conservation actions for and recording ecological knowledge of these species.

AB  - Knowledge of bone pathologies in South American native ungulates is very scarce, which contrasts with other groups of megamammals such as xenarthrans and proboscideans. In this paper, based on morphological and histological analysis, we describe different bone pathologies in two specimens of Toxodon platensis Owen (Notoungulata), one of the most common taxa in the Late Pleistocene faunistic associations of northeastern Argentina. Subchondral erosions on the metacarpus and magnum, non-marginal syndesmophytes and enthesitis on the vertebral body, the neural column and the zygapophyseal joint of the lumbar vertebrae, as well as a particular periosteal reaction on the ribs, have been interpreted as manifestations of spondyloarthropathies in one of the analyzed individuals. In the same individual, a process of fusion and bone neoformation is observed in the caudal vertebrae, which seems to correspond both to the aforementioned spondyloarthropathy and to an infectious process. A lesion on the fourth metatarsus of a second individual with an evident cloaca is suggestive of osteomyelitis; this is the first report of this pathology in notoungulates. It seems possible that some of these pathologies may have been facilitated by factors such as body mass, mode of locomotion and/or environment. These findings provide insight into some aspects of the ecology of this particular group of extinct South American megamammals.

AB  - Animal breeding programs can be improved by genetic markers associated with production and reproduction traits. Reproduction traits are important for economic success of pig production and therefore development of genetic tools for selection is of high interest to pig breeding. In this study our objective was to identify genomic regions as-sociated with fertility traits in two Finnish pig breeds using large scale SNP genotyping and genome wide association analysis and characterization of copy number variations (CNV). Since CNVs are structural variations of the genome they potentially have a large effect on gene expression and protein function. We analyzed 1265 genotyped boars for nine different reproduction traits and identified 46 CNV regions encompassing 13 genes. 11 of the CNV regions were shared between the breeds, 20 were unique to the Finnish Yorkshire and 15 to the Finnish Landrace. The ge-nome wide association (GWAS) analysis identified zero to five reproduction associated genomic regions per trait. Furthermore, we identified 23 genomic regions with 20 candidate genes associated with fertility traits using GWAS analysis. The identified CNV regions were compared against GWAS regions to detect candidate regions with an ef-fect on reproduction traits. This study reports candidate genes and genomic regions within two Finnish pig breeds for reproduction traits, which can be utilized in breeding programs.

AB  - Many plant species with overlapping geographic ranges segregate at smaller spatial scales. This spatial segregation-zonation when it follows an abiotic gradient and habitat partitioning when it does not-has been experimentally investigated for over a century often using distantly related taxa, such as different genera of algae or barnacles. In those foundational studies, trade-offs between stress tolerance and competitive ability were found to be the major driving factors of habitat partitioning for both animals and plants. Yet, the evolutionary relationships among segregating species are usually not taken into account. Since close relatives are hypothesized to compete more intensely and are more likely to interact during mating compared to distant relatives, the mechanisms underlying habitat partitioning may differ depending on the relatedness of the species in question. Here, I propose an integration of ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to habitat partitioning in plants, specifically how the relative contributions of factors predictably change with relatedness of taxa. Interspecific reproductive interactions in particular are understudied, yet important drivers of habitat partitioning. In spatially segregated species, interspecific mating can reduce the fitness of rare immigrants, preventing their establishment and maintaining patterns of spatial segregation. In this synthesis, I review the literature on mechanisms of habitat partitioning in plants within an evolutionary framework, identifying knowledge gaps and detailing future directions for this rapidly growing field of study.

AB  - The vast volume of currently available unstructured text data, such as research papers, news, and technical report data, shows great potential for ecological research. However, manual processing of such data is labourintensive, posing a significant challenge. In this study, we aimed to assess the application of three state-ofthe-art prompt-based large language models (LLMs), GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2-70B, to automate the identification, interpretation, extraction, and structuring of relevant ecological information from unstructured textual sources. We focused on species distribution data from two sources: news outlets and research papers. We assessed the LLMs for four key tasks: classification of documents with species distribution data, identification of regions where species are recorded, generation of geographical coordinates for these regions, and supply of results in a structured format. GPT-4 consistently outperformed the other models, demonstrating a high capacity to interpret textual data and extract relevant information, with the percentage of correct outputs often exceeding 90% (average accuracy across tasks: 87-100%). Its performance also depended on the data source type and task, with better results achieved with news reports, in the identification of regions with species reports and presentation of structured output. Its predecessor, GPT-3.5, exhibited slightly lower accuracy across all tasks and data sources (average accuracy across tasks: 81-97%), whereas LLaMA-2-70B showed the worst performance (37-73%). These results demonstrate the potential benefit of integrating prompt-based LLMs into ecological data assimilation workflows as essential tools to efficiently process large volumes of textual data.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with traumatic stress experiences. This condition can be accompanied by learning and cognitive deficits. Studies have demonstrated that ketamine can rapidly and significantly alleviate symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. Nonetheless, the effects of ketamine on neurocognitive impairment and its mechanism of action in PTSD remain unclear.Methods: In this study, different concentrations of ketamine (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated in rat models of single prolonged stress and electrophonic shock (SPS&S). Expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus (HIP) and amygdala (AMG) were determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.Results: The data showed that rats subjected to SPS&S exhibited significant PTSD-like cognitive impairment. The effect of ketamine on SPS&S-induced neurocognitive function showed a U-shaped dose effect in rats. A single administration of ketamine at a dosage of 10-15 mg/kg resulted in significant changes in behavioral outcomes. These manifestations of improvement in cognitive function and molecular changes were reversed at high doses (15-20 mg/kg).Conclusion: Overall, ketamine reversed SPS&S-induced fear and spatial memory impairment and the downregulation of BDNF and BDNF-related PSD-95 signaling in the HIP and AMG. A dose equal to 15 mg/kg rapidly reversed the behavioral and molecular changes and promoted the amelioration of cognitive dysfunction. The enhanced association of BDNF signaling with PSD-95 effects could be involved in the therapeutic efficiency of ketamine for PTSD.

AB  - Removing selenium (Se) from mine effluent is a common challenge. A long-term, in situ experiment was conducted to bioremediate large volumes (up to 7500 m (c) d(-1)) of Se(VI)-contaminated water (mean 87 mu g L-1) by injecting the water into a saturated waste rock fill (SRF) at a coal mining operation in Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. To stimulate/maintain biofilm growth in the SRF, labile organic carbon (methanol) and nutrients were added to the water prior to its injection. A conservative tracer (Br-) was also added to track the migration of injected water across the SRF, identify wells with minimal dilution and used to quantify the extent of bioreduction. The evolution of the Se species through the SRF was monitored in time and space for 201 d. Selenium concentrations of <3.8 mu g L-1 were attained in monitoring wells located 38 m from the injection wells after 114 to 141 d of operation. Concentrations of Se species in water samples from complementary long-term (351-498 d) column experiments using influent Se(VI) concentrations of 1.0 mg L-1 were consistent with the results of the in situ experiment. Solid samples collected at the completion of the column experiments confirmed the presence of indigenous Se-reducing bacteria and that the sequestered Se was present as insoluble Se(0), likely in Se-S ring compounds. Based on the success of this ongoing bioremediation experiment, this technology is being applied at other mine sites.

AB  - Many insect herbivores engage in apparent competition whereby two species interact through shared natural enemies. Upon insect attack, plants release volatile blends that attract natural enemies, but whether these volatiles mediate apparent competition between herbivores is not yet known. We investigate the role of volatiles that are emitted by bean plants upon infestation by Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids on the population dynamics and fitness of Sitobion avenae aphids, and on wheat phloem sap metabolites. In a field experiment, the dynamics of S. avenae aphids on wheat were studied by crossing two treatments: exposure of aphid colonies to A. pisum-induced bean volatiles and exclusion of natural enemies. Glasshouse experiments and analyses of primary metabolites in wheat phloem exudates were performed to better understand the results from the field experiment. In the field, bean volatiles did not affect S. avenae dynamics or survival when aphids were exposed to natural enemies. When protected from them, however, volatiles led to larger aphid colonies. In agreement with this observation, in glasshouse experiments, aphid-induced bean volatiles increased the survival of S. avenae aphids on wheat plants, but not on an artificial diet. This suggests that volatiles may benefit S. avenae colonies via metabolic changes in wheat plants, although we did not find any effect on wheat phloem exudate composition. We report a potential case of associational susceptibility whereby plant volatiles weaken the defences of receiving plants, thus leading to increased herbivore performance.

AB  - The early gonads of mammals contain primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cell precursors that are essential for sex determination and gametogenesis. Although it is extensively documented in mice, the devel-opment of early gonads in non-rodents remains to be delineated. Because molecular differences between mouse and human gonadal cells have been reported, it warrants the study of the key markers and regulatory features that are conserved or divergent between non-rodent species and human. Here, we integrate single -cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis to identify regulatory signatures of PGCs and somatic cells in the early gonads of goats, pigs, macaques, and humans. We identify the evolutionarily conserved and species-specific events, including genes expression, signaling pathways, and cell-cell interactions. We also uncover potential cis -regulatory elements and key transcription factors in PGCs and somatic cells. Our data -sets provide important resources for better understanding the evolutionary programs of PGCs and gonadal somatic cell development in mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary A good relationship between humans (e.g., farmers, owners) and farm animals is vital for the well-being of both parties: on the one hand, people are satisfied with their work, which becomes less stressful and more profitable, and may receive social benefits in terms of education or animal-assisted therapy; on the other hand, animals are rewarded by the presence of humans and are not afraid of them. Goats have high cognitive and communicative abilities towards humans: recognising these abilities helps humans to work properly on the quality of this relationship that is built from the first hours of the goat kids' life, thanks to frequent and positive contacts (e.g., stroking, talking in a calm voice). Improving the quality of this relationship is an investment in the future of livestock farming and meets public demands for ethical and sustainable production. This review outlines the characteristics and predisposing factors for the establishment of a good human-goat relationship and for its evaluation. There is consensus that the quality of the human-animal relationship (HAR) is relevant to guarantee appropriate levels of animal welfare. Given the impact that HAR may have on both goats and human beings, the aim of the present review is to elucidate: (1) how humans and goats communicate; (2) which are the factors affecting human-goat interactions; (3) how we can measure the quality of this relationship. The systematic review led to the selection of 58 relevant articles. Effective human-goat communication takes place by means of visual, tactile and auditory stimuli and, to a less extent, via olfactory and gustative stimuli. Goats have well-developed socio-cognitive abilities and rely on humans to get relevant information. A deep knowledge of goats' communication means and socio-cognitive abilities may greatly help improving the human-goat relationship. Management practices (e.g., rearing methods, amount and quality of interactions), as well as genetic selection for suitable individual traits, may contribute to improving HAR. Several measures to assess the quality of HAR have been validated, including avoidance in the pen and at the feeding rack and latency to first contact. Finally, farmers' attitudes and empathy with goats, as well as their motivation to work with animals, should be improved through appropriate training.

AB  - Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying milk production traits contribute to improving the production potential of dairy animals. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is one of the rate-limiting enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis and was highly expressed in the buffalo mammary. The objectives of the present study were to detect the polymorphisms within SQLE in buffalo, the genetic effects of these mutations on milk production traits, and to understand the gene regulatory effects on buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). A total of five SNPs were identified by sequencing, g.18858G > A loci were significantly associated with fat yield, and g.22834C > T loci were significantly associated with peak milk yield, milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield. Notably, linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that 2 SNPs (g.18858G > A and g.22834C > T) formed one haplotype block, which was found to be significantly associated with milk fat yield, fat percentage, and protein yield. Furthermore, expression of SQLE was measured in different tissues of buffalo and was found to be higher in the mammary. Knockdown of SQLE gene expression significantly affected the growth of BuMECs, including proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis, and significantly downregulated the expression of related genes MYC, PCNA, and P21. In addition, knockdown of the SQLE gene significantly reduces triglyceride concentrations and the signal intensity of oil red O staining. In addition, silencing of SQLE was also found to regulate the synthesis and secretion of beta-casein and kappa-casein negatively. Furthermore, SQLE knockdown is accompanied by the downregulation of critical genes (RPS6KB1, JAK2, eIF4E, and SREBP1) related to milk fat and protein synthesis. The current study showed the potential of the SQLE gene as a candidate for buffalo milk production traits. It provides a new understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying buffalo milk production regulation.

AB  - The Dama dama dama population of the island of Rhodes has an important conservation significance because of its unique genetic characters. Currently, many are the factors that threaten its survival. Aim of this paper is to provide the first data on the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between the only free-ranging Greek population of common fallow deer and local domestic caprines. Kilometric abundance index (KAI) was derived from spotlight counts. The unattended domestic caprines appear to impact on fallow deer, in particular during fawning season. Livestock monitoring over time can act as a proxy indicator of the status of this deer population.

AB  - The ability of tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel to contain fission products is largely dictated by the quality of the manufacturing process, since most of the fission product release is expected to occur due to coating layer failure in a small number of particles containing defects. The Bison fuel performance code has capabilities to predict failure in individual particles, accounting for the presence of defects, and to apply statistical analysis methods to compute the probability of failure in a set of fuel particles. Bison has recently undergone significant development both to improve its physical representations of fuel particle behavior and to improve the efficiency of its statistical failure calculations. Physical model improvements include new capabilities to account for the pressure generated by fission gases on inner pyrolytic carbon (IPyC) crack surfaces and to use local material coordinate orientation to accurately incorporate the anisotropy in the material properties in aspherical particles. To improve statistical modeling efficency, a direct integration approach which involves directly integrating the failure probability function associated with statistically varying parameters has been developed. The direct integration approach is much more efficient than the Monte Carlo (MC) schemes commenly employed, and allows Bison to directly run high dimensional fuel performance models, which improves the accuracy of failure probability calculations. A set of benchmark problems is considered here to compare the MC and direct integration approaches, and a statistical failure analysis of compacts in the Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR)-2 experiments is performed using the direct integration approach.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Age can affect the outcomes of male-male contests, but its effects vary across species. In some species, winning probability increases with age due to increased investment in reproduction as a strategy of terminal investment, while in others, it decreases due to senescence. In the Japanese rhinoceros beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, males use their horns to compete for resources and mates. Previous research has shown that the horn and body size influence contest outcomes. We investigated the effect of age on winning probability in male-male contests. We also measured the daily changes in lifting and grasping forces as indicators of fighting ability. Both body size and age differences significantly affected contest outcomes, with larger or younger males being more likely to win. Fighting ability declined with age; specifically, males over 20 days of age exhibited decreased grasping and lifting forces. Given the short reproductive season and low survival rate of natural populations of this species, selection probably favors individuals that fight with full effort regardless of age. Consequently, contest outcomes are primarily determined by differences in physical abilities, and older males with reduced fighting performance are more likely to lose to younger males. This study emphasized the importance of morphological and physiological factors in determining competitive outcomes and highlighted the impact of life history on sexual selection dynamics.

AB  - Ants form mutualistic relationships with plants that offer extrafloral nectar (EFN) and with trophobiotic insects such as aphids, treehoppers or caterpillars that secrete energy-rich honeydew. Although these insects may negatively affect plants, their presence-along with EFN-increases ant activity, which enhances herbivore predation, reduces leaf damage and indirectly improves plant growth and reproductive success. However, the same ants attracted to these resources can also interfere with pollinators-by deterring or harming them-thereby potentially reducing pollination efficiency and negatively impacting plant reproductive success. While the roles of ants in plant defence and pollination have been extensively studied, the individual and combined effects of multiple ant-attractive resources, such as EFN and trophobionts, on these ecological services remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment manipulating the presence of EFN and trophobiotic insects (treehoppers or myrmecophilous caterpillars) in the tropical shrub Banisteriopsis malifolia and used a structural equation modelling approach to assess the direct and indirect effects of these ant food resources on leaf herbivory, pollinator activity and plant fitness. Our results show that ants reduced leaf herbivory on plants offering both EFN and trophobiotic insects. Although ants did not directly affect pollinator behaviour, leaf herbivory in plants hosting treehoppers indirectly influenced pollination by reducing both visit duration and frequency. Flower production in plants with EFN or treehoppers enhanced pollinator attraction, resulting in greater fruit production and fruit mass. However, neither pollinator visit duration nor visit frequency significantly influenced fruit yield across any ant resource treatments. Finally, we detected no indirect effects of ant resource availability on overall plant fitness through changes in herbivory or pollination. These findings suggest that while the presence of multiple ant food resources can enhance ant-mediated plant defence, their effects on pollination and overall plant fitness are more nuanced, highlighting the complex and context-dependent nature of multitrophic interactions in shaping ecological outcomes for plants.

AB  - Our knowledge about the acoustic behavior of Caviinae species drove us to investigate Kerodon rupestris's (Caviidae: Hydrochoerinae) repertoire. This species is endemic to Caatinga and states as vulnerable in the Brazilian list of endangered species. We recorded sounds uttered by individuals from Santa Luzia, State of Paraiba, Brazil. We promoted interactions among 13 animals during intra and intersexual pairing sessions, under undisturbed interactions in captivity, and in free-living conditions. We found a repertoire of 13 call types, most of them (all except three) shared with Cavia and only five possibly shared also with Hydrochoerus: (1) Close contact and cohesion: tonal and noisy contact calls, tweet, slow-whistle; (2) Social regulation (incitement, subordination or auto-defense): whine, peepy-squeak, yelp; (3) Offensive aggression and status display: roar, snort, and teeth chattering (4) Warning or intimidation: alarm-whistle, drrr, and drumming; (5) Courtship: purr and slow-whistle. The similarity of Kerodon signals to Hydrochoerinae species, despite the ecological differences, needs to be understood in comparative phylogenetic studies tracing back the origin of the courtship display in Caviidae. Thus, future research should focus on playback studies to test signals' biological function hypothesis.

AB  - Cloned and transgenic pigs are relevant human disease models and serve as potential donors for regenerative medicine and xenotransplantation. These technologies demand oocytes and embryos of good quality. However, the current protocols for in vitro production (IVP) of pig embryos give reduced blastocyst efficiency and embryo quality compared to in vivo controls. This is likely due to culture conditions jeopardizing embryonic homeostasis including the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) influence. In this study, the antioxidant melatonin (1 nM) in the maturation medium, fertilization medium, or both media was ineffective in enhancing fertilization or embryonic development parameters of in vitro fertilized oocytes. Supplementation of melatonin in the fertilization medium also had no effect on sperm function. In contrast, the addition of melatonin to the embryo culture medium accelerated the timing of embryonic development and increased the percentages of cleaved embryos and presumed zygotes that developed to the blastocyst stage. Furthermore, it increased the number of inner mass cells and the inner mass cell/total cell number ratio per blastocyst while increasing intracellular glutathione and reducing ROS and DNA damage levels in embryos. Contrarily, the addition of melatonin to the embryo culture medium had no evident effect on in vivo-derived embryos, including the developmental capacity and the quality of in vivo-derived 4-cell embryos or the percentage of genome-edited in vivo-derived zygotes achieving the blastocyst stage. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin in the embryo culture medium enhances the development and quality of in vitro-derived embryos but not in in vivo-derived embryos. Exogenous melatonin is thus recommended during embryo culture of oocytes matured and fertilized in vitro for improving porcine IVP efficiency.

AB  - Prior to transitioning to a coral diet, juvenile Acanthaster cf. solaris, the Crown-of-Thorns Seastar (COTS), feed on crustose coralline algae. Although a detailed understanding of juvenile ecology is crucial to predict and prevent outbreaks, the exact timing of the transition is unresolved. Two experiments were conducted to measure time and size of COTS at the transition, and investigate potential modulating effects of different coral species. COTS began early transitions at similar sizes (7.5-8.5 mm), and these first transitions were observed around 136-145 d. Between 175 and 191 d, a 50% transition in the presence of Acropora tenuis was measured. After 175d, the percentage of COTS cohorts that had transitioned was significantly lower in A. millepora (38%) and Stylophora pistillata (7%) compared to A. tenuis (51%). These data fill important knowledge gaps in juvenile ecology, and the influence of coral species on transition suggests an undescribed feedback mechanism between prey and predator.

AB  - Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has antidepressant and anesthetic properties. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine induces transient psychosis in humans, and is used to model psychosis in experimental animals. In rodents, subanesthetic doses of ketamine increase the power of high-frequency oscillations (HFO, > 100 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG), a frequency band linked to cognitive functions. However, to date, the effects of ketamine in carnivores and primates have been poorly investigated. Here, we examined in the cat, cortical HFO during wakefulness, sleep, and after administering a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine. Four cats were prepared with cortical electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recordings in head-restrained conditions. The cortical HFO power, connectivity, direction of the information flow using Granger Causality (GC) analysis, their relationships with respiratory activity, and the effect of auditory stimulation were analyzed. During wakefulness, but not during sleep, we found that HFO were coupled with the inspiratory phase of the respiration. After ketamine administration, HFO power was enhanced and remained associated with the inspiratory phase. GC analysis suggests that ketamine-enhanced HFO originate from the olfactory bulb (OB) and stream towards the prefrontal cortex (Pf). Accordingly, occluding the nostrils significantly reduced the power of the ketamineenhanced HFO in both the OB and Pf. Finally, auditory stimulation did not affect HFO. In conclusion, the HFO are associated with respiration during wakefulness, but not during sleep. The enhancement of this rhythm by ketamine may disrupt cortical information processing, which could contribute to some of the neuropsychiatric effects associated with ketamine.

AB  - Technological integration in conservation and management dramatically increases the range and quality of data collection in a short time and with high accuracy. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are effective in surveillance, mapping, and monitoring and, combined with conventional remote-sensing techniques, offer enhanced scope and overcome several technological and operational challenges in wildlife research and management. Especially in places like India, where the terrain complexity is high and has a low workforce for routine patrolling, UAV technology offers an alternate support system to manage the natural areas and key species. Pioneer effort was made in India for surveying critically endangered aquatic species using UAV in Ken River, Madhya Pradesh. A fixed wing V-TOL UAV was used for survey approximately 24.5 km of river stretch flowing through Ken Gharial Sanctuary and Panna Tiger Reserve to count population of a critically endangered aquatic species, i.e., crocodiles. Flight time of almost 4.5 h maintaining 100 m altitude with five pre-planned missions the UAV acquired 5193 images covering 1858.564 hectares area. 61 crocodile and 1 gharial was found in the search effort. Body length measurement was calculated for every single individual. Our pioneering efforts received wider attention and facilitated increased use of the technology. Other than population count, we also recorded and processed data for crocodile habitat, landscape terrain, 3D models and NDVI. There is a need for concerted efforts to upscale the use of this technology with enhanced capacity of the researchers and managers to leverage its optimal capacity while supporting ground-based conservation with improved vigor and success.

AB  - N-6-methyladenosine (m6A), an epigenetic modification on RNAs, plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. However, the involvement of m6A in goat uterus during early pregnancy remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that the total m6A level was increasing in goat uterus as early pregnancy progressed. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is a core catalytic subunit of the m6A methyltransferase. We thus determined the expression and regulation of METTL3 in goat uterus. METTL3 was highly expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelia from day 16 (D16) to D25 of pregnancy, and it could be up-regulated by estrogen and progesterone in goat uterus and primary endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). In EECs, knockdown or overexpression of METTL3 resulted in a significant decrease or increase of cell proliferation, respectively. METTL3 knockdown reduced the m6A level of not only total RNA but also connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA. Luciferase assay suggested that METTL3 might target the potential m6A sites in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of CTGF mRNA. Moreover, METTL3 positively regulated CTGF expression, and CTGF knockdown significantly counteracted the promoting effect of METTL3 overexpression on EEC proliferation. Collectively, METTL3 is dynamically expressed in goat uterus and can affect EEC proliferation by regulating CTGF in an m6A-dependent manner. Our results will lay a foundation for further studying the crucial mechanism of METTL3-mediated m6A modification in goat uterus during early pregnancy.

AB  - Simple Summary Inulin-type fructans (ITFs), one of the best studied and most well-established prebiotic carbohydrates, have been shown to exert many health benefits to the host, including improvement in cardiovascular function. Various mechanisms are known to be involved in these processes, such as reduction of blood lipid levels by altering hepatic de novo lipogenesis, enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity in muscle, increased intestinal short-chain fatty acid production, elevated fecal excretion of bile salts and cholesterol and increased production of nitric oxide, known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Therefore, our overall aim was to assess the impact of complementary feeding with 4% of dried chicory root or 2% of native inulin on the aortic protein and gene changes in healthy nursery pigs. Our data clearly indicate that dietary inulin-type fructans have the potential to influence several structural and physiological alterations that are reflected both in the mRNA and protein levels in porcine aorta. In this study, two different ITFs sources were incorporated into a cereal-based diet to evaluate possible aortic protein and gene changes in nursery pigs. The animals were fed two different experimental diets from the 10th day of life, supplemented with either 4% of dried chicory root (CR) or with 2% of native inulin (IN). After a 40-day dietary intervention trial, pigs were sacrificed at day 50 and the aortas were harvested. Our data indicate that dietary ITFs have the potential to influence several structural and physiological changes that are reflected both in the mRNA and protein levels in porcine aorta. In contrast to our hypothesis, we could not show any beneficial effects of a CR diet on vascular functions. The direction of changes of several proteins and genes may indicate disrupted ECM turnover (COL6A1 and COL6A2, MMP2, TIMP3, EFEMP1), increased inflammation and lipid accumulation (FFAR2), as well as decreased activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (TXNDC5, ORM1). On the other hand, the IN diet may counteract a highly pro-oxidant environment through the endothelin-NO axis (CALR, TCP1, HSP8, PDIA3, RCN2), fibrinolytic activity (ANXA2), anti-atherogenic (CAVIN-1) and anti-calcification (LMNA) properties, thus contributing to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine how different doses of phytase in diets with extruded soybean seeds and rapeseed meal affected pigs' growth performance, meat quality, bone mineralization, and fatty acid profiles. Sixty pigs were divided into three treatments by sex and body mass. Pigs were divided into starter (25 days), grower (36 days), and finisher (33 days) periods and fed with mash diets. No phytase was used in the control group diet, whereas in Phy1 and Phy2, 100 g and 400 g of phytase per ton of mixture were used, respectively. The feed conversion ratio and meat color were significantly correlated with phytase. Phytase supplementation had no effect on the growth of pigs, but total phosphorus was significantly increased in the bones and meat of the pigs. The enzyme additive reduced the C22:4 n-6 acid content in the meat, whereas other results were not significantly affected. The data suggest that the addition of phytase at a dosage of 100 g/ton to diets with extruded full-fat soya seeds and rapeseed meal can be valuable, as it reduces the FCR and increases the P content in the meat and bones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of enzymes produced by artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) flower cell suspension cultures elicited by melatonin (5 mu m) and salicylic acid (50 mu m) on the production and characteristics of miniature goat cheeses. In this study, five types of fresh miniature goat cheese were produced using whole artichoke flower extract, salicylic acid (50 mu m) or melatonin (5 mu m) treated artichoke suspension cell culture extracts, a culture extract without elicitor treatment (control) and rennin enzyme. RESULTS: The milk clotting activity values of the enzymes were measured in the range 0.52-0.74. The effect of the enzymes on the titratable acidity, water-soluble nitrogen, ripening index, alpha s-caseins and beta-caseins of goat cheese was significant (P < 0.05). The highest level of casein degradation was observed in the cheese produced with the enzyme containing melatonin, followed by the cheese produced with the enzyme containing salicylic acid. CONCLUSION: For the enzymes produced by the suspension cell culture method, the addition of melatonin and salicylic acid had a slightly positive effect on the proteolytic activity of the extracts. It was also found that the enzymes obtained from artichokes by the suspension cell culture method did not achieve successful cheese production in terms of chemical, textural and biochemical aspects compared to those obtained from animal enzymes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of semen volume, air contact inside semen dose tubes, daily agitation of semen doses and extender type on semen quality, thermo-resistance and bacteria growth in extended boar semen doses preserved over 7 days of liquid storage. Ejaculates from 4 proven terminal cross-bred boars were collected using the gloved-hand technique for 4 weeks and used in the 3 x 2 x 2 factorial study. The effects of treatment (CON: 80 ml doses sealed at the top of the tube; 40HIGH: 40 ml doses sealed at top of tube, and 40LOW: 40 ml doses sealed at top of the liquid), agitation (agitated versus not agitated) and extender type (long-term versus short-term) were investigated on semen quality, thermo-resistance and bacteria growth in boar semen doses. The results of the study revealed that motility (p = .031) and viability (p = .041) in 40HIGH were lower than CON. pH (p < .001) was higher in 40HIGH compared with CON and 40LOW. Agitation did not impact motility (p = .581), progressive motility (p = .870), viability (p = .509) or morphology (p = .970), while long-term extender maintained higher motility (p = .002), progressive motility (p = .036), viability (p < .001) and normal acrosome (p < .001) than a short-term extender. VAP (p = .039) of 40HIGH was lower than CON in a thermo-resistance test. Neither treatment (p > .798, .766) nor agitation (p > .396, .476) impacted bacterial growth in this study. In conclusion, air contact negatively impacts boar semen pH and consequently sperm motility. Semen doses prepared with 80 or 40 ml volumes of extended boar semen with minimal air contact in the tubes yield more desirable semen quality and agitating boar semen doses daily does not have negative or positive effects on boar semen quality.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boars. There is no medication available for ASF to date. The ability to mount antigen-specific responses to viral vectored CP312R makes it a crucial potential target for designing vaccines or drugs. This study determined the crystal structure of ASFV CP312R at 2.32 A and found it to be a monomer with a single-stranded DNA binding core domain with a clear five-strands b-barrel OB-fold architecture. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and size-exclusion chromatography characterization assay further confirmed the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding property of ASFV CP312R. This study revealed the structure and preliminary ssDNA interaction mechanisms of ASFV CP312R, providing new clues for developing new antiviral strategies. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Root pullout performance of plants is an important mechanical basis for soil reinforcement by plant roots in the semi-arid areas. Studies have shown that it is affected by plant factors (species, ages, root geometry, etc.) and soil factors (soil types, soil moisture, soil bulk densities, etc.). However, the effects of loading rates on root pullout performance are not well studied. To explore the mechanical interactions under different loading rates, we conducted pullout tests on Medicago sativa L. and Hippophae rhamnoides L. roots under five loading rates, i.e., 5, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm/min. In addition, tensile tests were conducted on the roots in diameters of 0.5-2.0 mm to compare the relationship between root tensile properties and root pullout properties. Results showed that two root failure modes, slippage and breakage, were observed during root pullout tests. All M. sativa roots were pulled out, while 72.2% of H. rhamnoides roots were broken. The maximum fracture diameter and fracture root length of H. rhamnoides were 1.22 mm and 7.44 cm under 100 mm/min loading rate, respectively. Root displacement values were 4.63% (+/- 0.43%) and 8.91% (+/- 0.52%) of the total root length for M. sativa and H. rhamnoides, respectively. The values of maximum pullout force were 14.6 (+/- 0.7) and 17.7 (+/- 1.8) N under 100 mm/min for M. sativa and H. rhamnoides, respectively. Values of the maximum pullout strength for M. sativa and H. rhamnoides were 38.38 (+/- 5.48) MPa under 150 mm/min and 12.47 (+/- 1.43) MPa under 100 mm/min, respectively. Root-soil friction coefficient under 100 mm/min was significantly larger than those under other loading rates for both the two species. Values of the maximum root pullout energy for M. sativa and H. rhamnoides were 87.83 (+/-;21.55) mm center dot N under 100 mm/min and 173.53 (+/- 38.53) mm center dot N under 200 mm/min, respectively. Root pullout force was significantly related to root diameter (P<0.01). Peak root pullout force was significantly affected by loading rates when the effect of root diameter was included (P<0.01), and vice versa. Except for the failure mode and peak pullout force, other pullout parameters, including root pullout strength, root displacement, root-soil friction coefficient, and root pullout energy were not significantly affected by loading rates (P>0.05). Root pullout strength was greater than root tensile strength for the two species. The results suggested that there was no need to deliberately control loading rate in root pullout tests in the semi-arid soil, and root pullout force and pullout strength could be better parameters for root reinforcement model compared with root tensile strength as root pullout force and pullout strength could more realistically reflect the working state of roots in the semi-arid soil.

AB  - Context. Due to considerable declines in African wildlife populations, most large African mammals are managed inside protected areas. Protected areas come in various sizes, and have different environmental features, climates and management strategies (i.e. "hands-on' or "hands-off') that can influence an animals' homeostasis. White rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) are found almost exclusively within protected areas where population sizes are driven by natural factors and poaching pressures. Aims. Our aim was to understand the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on the adrenocortical response of white rhinos within three protected areas. Specifically, we wanted to understand how poaching pressure, protected area size (< 500 km(2)), season (wet and dry) and rainfall patterns were responsible for driving adrenocortical activity in white rhino. Methods. To understand the relationship between rhino adrenocortical responses and different environmental and anthropogenic stressors, we quantified glucocorticoid metabolites in faecal samples (fGCM) collected from four populations within three protected areas (i.e. two small parks, one big park) during the wet and dry seasons. Key results. We found differences in seasonal fGCM concentrations, with a 42% increase during the dry season, and no differences in fGCM concentrations between the high and low poaching areas. Additionally, we found fGCM concentrations in samples from the small parks were respectively 38% and 42% higher than in samples from the large park during both the dry and wet seasons compared. Conclusions. Our results suggest that white rhinos may experience physiological stress in smaller parks, especially during the dry season when resources are limited. Implications. By mitigating stress associated with reduced access to resources and spatial constraints, managers may better promote the viability of large mammals in small protected areas.

AB  - Simple Summary: Dragon fruit peel polyphenolic extract is a potential ruminal modulator endorsed by consumers for its inherent safety and acceptability. This in vitro study demonstrated that dragon fruit peel polyphenolic extract increased the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen, reduced gas production, and enhanced the rumen bacterial abundances. These findings suggest that dragon fruit peel polyphenol extract has the potential to improve ruminal fermentation of sika deer and provides a theoretical basis for dragon fruit peel polyphenol extract to be used as a functional feed additive for Sika deer. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dragon fruit peel polyphenolic extract (DFPE) on gas production, rumen fermentation, and bacterial communities in sika deer using an in vitro technique. Three treatments with different DFPE levels (DFPE0, base diet; DFPE5, base diet + 5 mg/g DFPE; DFPE10, base diet + 10 mg/g DFPE, respectively; n = 6) were implemented. The phenolic composition of DFPE, gas production (GP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), volatile fatty acid (VFA), and bacteria communities was evaluated after 24 h of incubation. The results showed that GP and NH3-N were reduced by DFPE supplementation. Total VFA, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid were increased (p < 0.05) by the addition of DFPE. No changes (p > 0.05) were observed in pH, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and the ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid. Additionally, the alpha indexes, including Sobs, Shannon, and Ace, were increased by DFPE supplementation. Moreover, at the phylum level, DFPE supplementation increased (p = 0.01) Bacteroidota but reduced (p < 0.01) Firmicutes. At the genus level, compared to DFPE0, the DFPE10 had increased relative abundances of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (p < 0.01), norank_f_Muribaculaceae (p = 0.01), Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group (p < 0.01), Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (p < 0.01), and NK4A214_group (p < 0.01), decreased relative abundances of Streptococcus (p < 0.01), Oribacterium (p = 0.01), and Enterococcus (p < 0.01). Compared to DFPE0, DFPE5 had no change (p > 0.05) in all bacteria at the genus level except for decreased relative abundance of Enterococcus (p < 0.01). These results indicated that DFPE may be able to be used as a feed additive to enhance fermentation parameters and improve ruminal bacteria communities in Sika deer.

AB  - Context. Monitoring schemes provide vital data on the distribution and population dynamics of species. This information can be used to inform conservation management and, especially for legally protected species, ensure legislative compliance in development contexts. For bats, acoustic activity surveys are widely used and often involve (1) deployment of automated fixed-point detectors or (2) using bat detectors on walked or driven transects. Transect surveys are typically performed for 2 h, commencing approximately at sunset; automated fixed-point surveys record continually between sunset and sunrise, often over multiple consecutive nights.
   Aims. Despite both walked transects and fixed-point surveys being common methods used to survey bat activity in many parts of the world, often just one technique is used per site. We test the similarity of these two survey methods by comparing acoustic data encompassing 12 species of European bat to determine whether data from different surveys are directly comparable.
   Methods. In this study, we use acoustic data covering 2349 survey hours over a 3-year period to investigate the relative effectiveness of walked activity transects and automated fixed-point methods for 12 species of European bats.
   Key results. A greater number of bat species were recorded via the fixed-point method. Three species, namely, greater horseshoe (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Daubenton's (Myotis daubentonii), were recorded only by using automated detectors, possibly because the survey window encompassed the entire night rather than the period immediately after sunset. However, activity transects recorded a significantly higher mean species richness per hour than fixed-point surveys. When both methods were used at the same sites on the same nights, providing paired data for direct comparison, detection of brown long-eared (Plecotus auratus) and soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) bat activity was significantly higher for transect surveys.
   Conclusions and implications. This study demonstrated important differences in the data resulting from different bat survey methods and highlighted the potential for combining acoustic survey types to obtain rigorous and reliable monitoring data for bat populations.

AB  - The present study examined changes in the oxidative state and the concentrations of vitamin C, glucose, and cholesterol in the serum of ewes and goats fed on alfalfa hay-based diet (AHD) supplemented with 25% Moringa oleifera (MOD) or Moringa peregrine (MPD) leaves. Thirty ewes (2 years old and 50-60 kg BW) and 30 goats (2 years old and 35-40 kg BW) were randomly allocated to 3 experimental groups, consisting of 10 ewes and 10 goats each. The 3 experimental groups of either ewes or goats were fed on one of the experimental diets (AHD, MOD, or MPD) for 6 weeks. Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks throughout the experimental period. Vitamin C concentration and the total antioxidant capacity of serum increased by > 33% in animals fed on Moringa-supplemented diets. Dietary supplementation with Moringa enhanced serum catalase activity by > 9% as a function of feeding period. Animals fed on Moringa-supplemented diets also showed reduced serum concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) by > 45% compared with AHD-fed animals. Reductions in the serum concentrations of glucose by 14 to 41%, and that of cholesterol by 18 to 40% were observed in animals fed on Moringa-supplemented diets. It is worth mentioning that MOD supplementation showed the greatest positive effect on all tested blood parameters. The results of the present study indicate the importance of dietary supplementation of Moringa on the general animal health and immunity, which might be reflected in the improvement of shelf life of animal products (milk or meat).

AB  - The economy of Levantine societies in the first millennium BCE was based on animal husbandry and the use of animal life products. New data from Iron Age sites in Lebanon and Syria are analysed in this paper. The investigation of livestock management through the study of archaeological animal bones and their measurements reveals specialised zootechnies. Size variability is observed, especially among sheep and cattle. This heterogeneity suggests that management techniques were directed towards ensuring the necessary supply of animal types to provide the required secondary products in coastal and hinterland, small or large centres. This response to market demands was possible by using different husbandry (zootechnies) strategies and by large-scale trade activities in the region.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), as one of the most important cash crops in China, plays an important role in increasing farmers' incomes and guaranteeing a high quality of life. Tea production has been greatly influenced by both climate change and economic development in China. However, without a scientific understanding of the interaction mechanism of climate change and the impetus from rapid economic development on tea production practices in China, it is difficult to take adaptive actions to meet the climate change challenges for the tea industry. In this paper, we firstly assessed the potential impacts of climate change on tea climate suitability by empirical formula calculation using meteorological data; then, the effects from the additional climatic stress due to warming on tea production were detected with the annual statistical tea yield record on a municipal level. The contribution of socioeconomic development to the tea industry was evaluated with the comparison of the movement of China's national economy's and tea industry's gravity center during the period of 1987-2017. Finally, a conceptual adaptation framework was built to demonstrate the interaction mechanisms between climate change, tea production, and the economic development. The results showed that there was a negative impact of climate change on tea production in mainland China, with the percentage of high tea climate suitability (>0.9) areas dropping by 45% to 32%, while opportunities of enlarging the tea cultivating area emerged in the north tea production region where the tea climate suitability increased. We found that the tea planting area expanded northwards from 33 degrees N in 1987 to 35 degrees N in 2017 to take advantage of the favorable climatic resources due to warming, and tea planting decreased at an altitude of 100-400 m while increasing to higher altitude of 400-2000 m to avoid hot temperature damage and seek the optimum environment in high mountainous areas for tea production. In addition, the tea production moved westward along the longitude, decreasing obviously at 117-121 degrees E while increasing significantly at 98-104 degrees E and 107-110 degrees E. Meanwhile, the tea production gravity center showed a westward movement consistent with the national economic gravity center moving trend, which means that tea industry development was driven by multiple socioeconomic factors and climatic forcings. A conceptual framework was built in this paper, aiming to show a robust adaptation mechanism for the tea system to maximize the benefits and minimize the damages from the altered climatic resources under rapid economic development in mainland China. The results in this study would help deepen the understanding of the adaptation process and practices for tea production in mainland China.

AB  - The increasing development of industry, ports, tourism, and commerce along the coasts poses a severe threat to local forests due to elevated levels of pollutants. An effective way to assess the impact of this contamination is by evaluating living organisms' anatomical features and chemical composition. This research examined the potential of Clusia criuva Cambess leaves as a bioindicator model for screening sandy coastal plain forests (Restingas). The study collected samples from pristine (PA) and disturbed (DA) areas, confirmed through literature review and sediment concentration by guidelines analysis. Microscopy images of the leaves revealed that PA samples are thicker and have fewer druse crystals than DA. Mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis identified key compounds such as flavonoids, benzophenones, and phenolic acids (FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MS), which could be considered chemical markers from the genus. The chemical composition of extracts from PA and DA differed significantly, with a low similarity index (40%). Quinic acid derivatives are found only in plants from PA, which may be a response against intense herbivory agents. Instead, 7-epi-nemerosone, was detected only samples from DA, probably due to the need to defend against oxidative stressors. Besides, the similarity between each study area's three distinct sampling points was around 80%, indicating low chemical variability within the exact location. This study demonstrates an integrative methodology for assessing and supporting the environmental status of Restinga ecosystems, ensuring a comprehensive response that can promote conservation strategies.

AB  - There has been limited research on the degree to which rational inefficiency arises when environmental factors are considered. Thus, our goal is to contribute to the literature by applying the concept of rational inefficiency to pig farming and investigating the relationship between water use and farm technical efficiency levels. This research aims to provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between pig farming production, the natural environment, and economic performance. The stochastic frontier analysis is applied to a cross-section dataset of 523 Catalan farms specialized in pig production in 2018. The main findings of this study are as follows: First, Catalan pig farming exhibits high levels of technical efficiency with an average score of 0.94, which is consistent with the high intensity and concentration of Spanish pork production. Second, there is no compelling evidence to support the rational inefficiency hypothesis, particularly when comparing the rational efficient and multi-efficient groups.

AB  - Simple Summary Early life experiences such as contact with humans, maternal care and the physical environment can play a substantial role in shaping behavioural and physiological responses to stress. This experiment studied the effects of lactation housing systems and human interaction on stress in young pigs. We hypothesised that piglets handled in a positive manner and reared in loose farrowing and lactation pens with increased opportunity for interaction with their dam, greater space and more complexity in their physical environment have improved stress resilience than piglets reared in traditional farrowing crates with routine contact from stockpeople. In both housing systems, providing regular opportunities for positive human interaction reduced piglets' fear of humans and routine husbandry procedures imposed by humans, and reduced the number of injuries obtained after weaning. However, contrary to the expected findings, piglets from loose farrowing and lactation pens were more reactive to capture by a stockperson, more fearful of novel and human stimuli, had more injuries during the lactation period and were more likely to perform behaviours which may be indicative of reduced coping after weaning. Whether these effects are specific to the loose farrowing and lactation system studied in this experiment or are reflective of other loose systems requires further research. This experiment studied the effects of lactation housing systems and human interaction on piglets' responses to routine stressors. Forty litters of piglets were reared in either a standard farrowing crate (FC) or a loose farrowing and lactation pen (LP; PigSAFE pen) and received either routine contact with humans (C) or regular opportunities for positive human contact (+HC; 3 min of patting, stroking and scratching 5 times/week). Behavioural and physiological responses to routine husbandry procedures, weaning, novelty and humans were studied in addition to effects on piglet growth, injuries and survival. Compared to C piglets, +HC piglets vocalised for shorter durations (p = 0.018) during husbandry procedures and showed a lower intensity of escape behaviour during iron injection (p = 0.042) and oral vaccination (p = 0.026) at 3 d of age, capture at 2 wk of age (p < 0.001), and intramuscular vaccination (p = 0.005) at 3 wk of age. +HC piglets at 2 wk of age were faster than C piglets to approach (p = 0.048) and interact (p = 0.042) with a stationary unfamiliar human. Compared to LP piglets, FC piglets showed a lower intensity of escape behaviour during capture and iron administration by a stockperson at 3 d of age (p = 0.043). FC piglets at 2 wk of age were faster than LP piglets to approach (p = 0.005) and interact (p = 0.027) with a novel object and approach (p = 0.009) and interact (p = 0.008) with an unfamiliar human. FC piglets had fewer injuries than LP piglets at 2 wk of age (p = 0.004). +HC pigs had fewer injuries than C pigs after weaning (p = 0.003). After weaning there were more pigs from LP than FC observed to be upright (both stationary, p = 0.002 and walking, p = 0.024), vocalizing (p = 0.004), nosing another pig (p = 0.035) and nosing the pen floor (p = 0.038). There were no significant effects on neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios or plasma cortisol concentrations 1.5 h after weaning. However, 25 h after weaning +HC pigs had higher haptoglobin concentrations than C pigs (p = 0.002), and C/LP pigs had higher cortisol concentrations than +HC/LP and C/FC pigs (p = 0.012).
   There were no significant effects on piglet growth, the number of piglets born alive or the number stillborn, however there were more piglets weaned from FC than LP (p = 0.035). The results from this experiment raise questions that require further research on the ability of pigs reared in loose pens to cope with stressors such as exposure to humans, novelty, husbandry procedures and weaning. This experiment also provides evidence that regular positive human interaction reduces pigs' fear of humans and husbandry procedures imposed by stockpeople. More research is required to determine if any of these effects are sustained long-term.

AB  - Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) is a toxin commonly found in eutrophic waters worldwide, but its potential effects on amphibian brain toxicity and exposure mechanisms are unclear. In this study, Lithobates catesbeianus tadpoles were exposed to MC-LR for 30 days at realistic ambient concentrations (0, 0.5, and 2 mu g/L) to reveal its effects on brain health. The MC-LR bioaccumulation in the brain increased in dependence on the concentration of MC-LR exposure. Exposure to 0.5 and 2 mu g/L MC-LR resulted in a significant down-regulation of the expression of structural components of the blood-brain barrier (CLDN1), while the expression of genes associated with inflammation (NLRP3, TNF, IL-1 beta, and CXCL12) was significantly up-regulated with increased number of eosinophils. In the hippocampal and hypothalamic regions, the number of vacuolated neuropils increased with increasing MC-LR exposure concentration, while the expression of genes associated with neuronal development (LGALS1, CACNA2D2, and NLGN4X) and neurotransmitter transmission (SLC6A13 and AChE) was significantly down-regulated. Moreover, the levels of neurotransmitters (5-HT, glutamate, GABA, and ACh) were significantly reduced. These results provide strong evidence that MC-LR exposure at realistic ambient concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mu g/L can break the blood-brain barrier and raise the accumulation of MC-LR in the brain tissue, causing structural damage and functional disorder to brain neurons. Further, based on transcriptomic and biochemical analysis, it was revealed that MC-LR exposure induces DNA damage through oxidative stress and may be an important pathway causing brain structural damage and functional disorder. Overall, this study demonstrates the significant effects of MC-LR on the brain tissue of amphibians, highlighting the sensitivity of amphibians to MCLR.

AB  - The frequency of behaviors related to positive, neutral, or negative emotional valence in Odocoileus virgi-nianus in two zoos was compared, with below-ground-level (3 m) (BGe) or ground-level (Ge) exhibitor during days of no, low, and high influx of visitors. In BGe, 11 deer with visual barriers and 4 m from visitors were used and in Ge 18 deer without visual barriers and 2 m from visitors. The rest-relaxed, rest-alert, rest-on feet, and grooming were considered behaviors of positive valence. Trophic behaviors interaction, elimination, intake of feed, and intake of water as neutrals. The alarm-head posture, alarm-body posture, flight, and interruption as behaviors of negative valence. Scan sampling observations were performed in both zoos on alternate days, 6 days per week. During each week, a day of no, low, and high influx was used to determine the number of visitors and crowd noise (in decibels). The weekly observations were performed three times on each exhibitor 14 days apart. The medians of visitors' affluence were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the means of crowd noise with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey HSD. A one-way multivariate ANOVA was used to identify which of the observed behaviors were sensitive to the exhibitor type or influx. Post hoc median comparisons served to establish differences between sig-nificant behaviors. In addition, X2 tests served to compare the cumulative frequencies of positive, neutral, and negative behaviors between exhibitors for the same influx. A different number of visitors was con-firmed (P < 0.05) between low and high influx in both exhibitors but similar (P > 0.05) between exhibitors at the same influx. In BGe, the crowd was higher than in Ge only during no influx (P < 0.05), more visitors were not translated on significant higher crowd. On decrease order, the behavior displayed was posi-tives > neutral > negatives that confirm the good general conditions in both exhibitors. Flight, intake of feed and water, and rest of feet resulted affected by the exhibitor type. During the absence of visitors, a lower frequency of intake of feed was observed in BGe and lower frequency of rest-relaxed in both ex-hibitors, probably due to a silent environment that demands on prey animals, higher levels of alertness, but also habituation could be involved. Positive behaviors were more frequent during low and high influx in both exhibitors suggesting habituation, probably stronger on Ge. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cartilage maintains the structure and function of joints, with disturbances leading to potential osteoarthritis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 6 A), the most widespread post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes, plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes. While current research has indicated that m6A 6 A affects the progression of osteoarthritis, its function in the development and homeostasis of articular cartilage remains unclear. Here we report that Mettl3 deficiency in chondrocytes leads to mandibular condylar cartilage morphological alterations, early temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis, and diminished adaptive response to abnormal mechanical stimuli. Mechanistically, METTL3 modulates Lats1 mRNA methylation and facilitates its degradation in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent 6 A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, which subsequently influences the degradation and nuclear translocation of YAP1. Intervention with the Hippo pathway inhibitor XMU-MP-1 alleviates condylar abnormality caused by Mettl3 knockout. Our findings demonstrate the role of METTL3 in cartilage development and homeostasis, offering insights into potential treatment strategies for osteoarthritis.

AB  - BackgroundCellular metabolism is most invariant process, occurring in all living organisms, which involves mitochondrial proteins from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, protein-coding genes (mtPCGs) expression, and activity vary between various tissues to fulfill specific energy demands across the tissues.Methods and ResultsIn present study, we investigated the OXPHOS complexes and citrate synthase activity in isolated mitochondria from various tissues of freshly slaughtered buffaloes (n = 3). Further, the evaluation of tissue-specific diversity based on the quantification of mtDNA copy numbers was performed and also comprised an expression study of 13 mtPCGs. We found that the functional activity of individual OXPHOS complex I was significantly higher in the liver compared to muscle and brain. Additionally, OXPHOS complex III and V activities was observed significantly higher levels in liver compared to heart, ovary, and brain. Similarly, CS-specific activity differs between tissues, with the ovary, kidney, and liver having significantly greater. Furthermore, we revealed the mtDNA copy number was strictly tissue-specific, with muscle and brain tissues exhibiting the highest levels. Among 13 PCGs expression analyses, mRNA abundances in all genes were differentially expressed among the different tissue.ConclusionsOverall, our results indicate the existence of a tissue-specific variation in mitochondrial activity, bioenergetics, and mtPCGs expression among various types of buffalo tissues. This study serves as a critical first stage in gathering vital comparable data about the physiological function of mitochondria in energy metabolism in distinct tissues, laying the groundwork for future mitochondrial based diagnosis and research.

AB  - The low resistance of boar sperm to cryopreservation dictates that adding antioxidants and energetic substances to the diluent to improve sperm quality is necessary. This study is designed to assess the impact of various concentrations of safflower polysaccharides (SPSs; 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/L) on the quality of boar sperm following freezing and thawing. The results of the study showed that the supplementation of 1.5 g/L SPS significantly enhanced the motility, average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity, beat cross frequency, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, and DNA integrity compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, the supplementation of 1.5 g/L SPS significantly enhanced the total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, and catalase activity while significantly decreasing malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content (p < 0.05). Therefore, the supplement SPS has potentially positive implications for improving the quality of cryopreserved boar sperm, and the recommended concentration is 1.5 g/L SPS.

AB  - Reproductive phenology is a critical element of how animals persist in their environment and affects survival of young, especially in seasonal environments. We investigated the correlation between fetal eye diameter and birth timing to determine if birthdates could be predicted by a prenatal metric. We used ultrasonography to measure eye diameters of fetuses and vaginal implant transmitters to determine birthdates of Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) in Wyoming, United States, from 2019 to 2023. Fetal eye diameter strongly predicted days until birth (beta = -2.8; pseudo-R2 = 0.88). Effective prediction of birthdates via ultrasonography can yield opportunities for logistical planning in neonatal studies, monitoring changes in reproductive phenology, and evaluating questions of resource allocation relative to reproductive processes.
   We measured eye diameter of Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep fetuses using ultrasound technology to predict birthdates of lambs. This new method of predicting birthdates is highly accurate and can have many applications for ungulate research and population management.

AB  - Insects have evolved a spectrum of strategies that facilitate survival in the face of adverse environmental conditions and bottom-up or top-down pressures. The egg is the first stage in the life cycle of most insects. It is not only immobile but in many insects is the stage that survives unfavourable seasons when food resources are unavailable. Eggs are targeted by oophagous natural enemies and also are subject to abiotic stresses. In response to these diverse stresses, insects have developed various egg protection strategies. Females of many insects lay eggs in clusters and then use their own body resources to cover them to provide protection from harsh environments and biotic attack. Such egg protection strategies have allowed some herbivorous insects to thrive in new environments and become serious invasive pests. Females of many insects protect their eggs in other ways (e.g. laying eggs in concealed places, direct parental care) while others do not provide protection at all. Here, we review various egg protective strategies in insects. Our focus is on adaptive ecological mechanisms and temporal variation as well as the benefits and costs of egg coverings. We highlight several case studies on how these egg protective traits might impede biological control of globally important agricultural and forest pests and propose a framework for incorporating egg protective traits into biological control programs especially for invasive insect pests.

AB  - In this study, the protein profiles in the livers of Shannan Yorkshire pigs (SNY), Linzhi Yorkshire pigs (LZY), and Jiuzhaigou Yorkshire pigs (JZY) were comparatively analyzed using quantitative proteomics. A total of 6804 proteins were identified, of which 6471 were quantified and 774 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened. The higher level of energy metabolism in LZY livers was in response to the critical altitude environment compared to that in JZY, while the high-altitude environment suppressed energy output in SNY livers. Several key antioxidant enzymes were locally regulated in Yorkshire pig liver to balance antioxidant levels in a high-altitude, low-oxygen environment. In addition, ribosomal proteins were differentially expressed in Yorkshire pig livers in response to different altitudinal environments. These findings provide clues to the adaptation of the Yorkshire pig liver to the three altitudinal environments and the molecular links that exist between them.

AB  - As an omnivorous fish, wild tilapia feed on both animal and plant foods, depending on what is available. To understand the nutritional function of the gut microbiota of tilapia, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing, untargeted metabolomics analysis, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to study the metabolites and gut microbial communities in tilapia eating different diets (artemia nauplii in the carnivorous diet; plant-based pelleted feed [PBP] in the herbivorous diet; and a mixture of these two in the omnivorous diet). A total of 225 Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were cultured in nine 1500 L outdoor tanks, with three replicate tanks per diet and 25 fish per tank. beta-diversity analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in microbial structure between the three diets. However, significant differences were detected in gut metabolites. The abundance of the core bacteria in tilapia intestine (genus Cetobacterium) increased significantly when an omnivorous diet was fed. Cetobacterium abundance was significantly correlated to some differential metabolites including glucose and amino acids, and significantly correlated to pathways of carbohydrate and amino acids metabolism, identified by metagenome analysis. Metagenomic binning produced seven Cetobacterium MAGs with the completeness >50% and contamination <10%, in which genes related to the above metabolites and metabolism pathways were identified. All seven MAGs contained CAZymes that could act on distinct carbohydrates, providing highly diversified capabilities to this genus to cope with both animal and plant glycans. These tilapia fed with an omnivorous diet also showed increased growth. The differential intestinal metabolites aspartate, isoleucine, ornithine, proline, nicotinate, and NAD+ could be related to the increased growth. Our results expanded the understanding of how tilapia have adapted to an omnivorous diet and may provide knowledge for improving aquaculture management.

AB  - Infectious prions are resistant to degradation and remain infectious in the environment for several years. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected in cervids inhabiting North America, the Nordic countries, and South Korea. CWD-prion spread is partially attributed to carcass transport and disposal. We employed a forensic approach to investigate an illegal carcass dump site connected with a CWD-positive herd. We integrated anatomic, genetic, and prion amplification methods to discover CWD-positive remains from six white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and, using microsatellite markers, confirmed a portion originated from the CWD-infected herd. This approach provides a foundation for future studies of carcass prion transmission risk.

AB  - Volatile cues can induce and/or prime plant defences, but it is less well known if plants also respond by altering growth and reproduction-related parameters. Here, we evaluated whether plant volatile cues can elicit changes in growth, flower production, net photosynthesis rate and defences in receiver plants and whether those responses are similar to those elicited in response to direct herbivore-feeding. Our results demonstrate that exposure to volatiles emitted from damaged neighbours accelerated the time to first flowering, increased the number of flowers produced and the net photosynthesis rate, but did not alter the fresh harvested plant biomass and volatile defences, compared to non-exposed plants. Earlier flowering was also observed for plants exposed to volatiles from undamaged plants. These responses differed from those of plants exposed to actual herbivore-feeding for which feeding enhanced net photosynthesis rate but reduced growth and had no effect on reproduction and defence in response to subsequent herbivory. Synthesis. These findings document that plant airborne cues can influence floral traits of receiver plants. In particular, the flower phenology is modulated, and photosynthesis is enhanced, suggesting that carbon allocation could be directed toward reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Ascaris suum parasitises pigs all over the world causing a disease responsible for producing reductions in weight gains and damages to several organs of the infected animals that incur huge economic losses for the swine industry. While adult worms of this parasite are located in the small intestine of the host, their larval stages migrate through the bloodstream as an evolutionary advantageous strategy within a hostile environment that confronts host responses such as blood clots formation. The aim of this work is to study the ability of A. suum larvae to inhibit blood coagulation as a possible mechanism to control blood clots formation and facilitate their migration. The results showed that these larvae inhibited host blood coagulation and possessed molecules similar to those responsible for inhibiting blood coagulation in pigs. The anticoagulant effect of A. suum larvae could constitute a potential survival mechanism for the parasite. Therefore, developing new control strategies directed at this and similar processes could avoid A. suum larval migration and the establishment of adult worms in their definitive location, which is necessary to confront the damages and economic losses produced by this parasitosis.
   In order to evade the response of their hosts, helminth parasites have evolved precise and highly regulated mechanisms, including migration strategies of the larval stages. In regard to porcine ascariosis caused by Ascaris suum, its infective third-stage larvae (AsL3) undergo a complex migratory route through the bloodstream of their host before establishing in the small intestine to reach maturation. Despite the benefits attributed to this migration, blood clots formation could compromise larvae survival. The aim of this work was to study the interaction between the cuticle and excretory/secretory antigens of AsL3 and the host coagulation cascade. Larvae were obtained after incubating and hatching A. suum eggs, after which the antigenic extracts were produced. Their ability to disrupt the coagulation cascade was studied using anticoagulation and chromogenic assays, and techniques based on electrophoresis. The obtained results showed that both antigenic extracts possessed anticoagulant potential, being able to inhibit the intrinsic, extrinsic and/or common pathways of the blood coagulation cascade as well as the activated factor X. Moreover, three A. suum serpin proteins were identified as candidates to inhibit this host coagulation factor. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows, for the first time, the anticoagulant potential of the infective larvae of A. suum, which could be used by the parasite as a mechanism to facilitate its invasion and survival in the host.

AB  - As part of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes Phase 2 (RECCAP2) project, we developed a comprehensive African Greenhouse gases (GHG) budget covering 2000 to 2019 (RECCAP1 and RECCAP2 time periods), and assessed uncertainties and trends over time. We compared bottom-up process-based models, data-driven remotely sensed products, and national GHG inventories with top-down atmospheric inversions, accounting also for lateral fluxes. We incorporated emission estimates derived from novel methodologies for termites, herbivores, and fire, which are particularly important in Africa. We further constrained global woody biomass change products with high-quality regional observations. During the RECCAP2 period, Africa's carbon sink capacity is decreasing, with net ecosystem exchange switching from a small sink of -0.61 +/- 0.58 PgC yr-1 in RECCAP1 to a small source in RECCAP2 at 0.16 (-0.52/1.36) PgC yr-1. Net CO2 emissions estimated from bottom-up approaches were 1.6 (-0.9/5.8) PgCO2 yr-1, net CH4 were 77 (56.4/93.9) TgCH4 yr-1 and net N2O were 2.9 (1.4/4.9) TgN2O yr-1. Top-down atmospheric inversions showed similar trends. Land Use Change emissions increased, representing one of the largest contributions at 1.7 (0.8/2.7) PgCO2eq yr-1 to the African GHG budget and almost similar to emissions from fossil fuels at 1.74 (1.53/1.96) PgCO2eq yr-1, which also increased from RECCAP1. Additionally, wildfire emissions decreased, while fuelwood burning increased. For most component fluxes, uncertainty is large, highlighting the need for increased efforts to address Africa-specific data gaps. However, for RECCAP2, we improved our overall understanding of many of the important components of the African GHG budget that will assist to inform climate policy and action.
   We developed a comprehensive greenhouse gases (GHG) budget for Africa as part of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes Phase 2 (RECCAP2) project over the 2010-2019 period. We used global and local data sets and innovative methods to estimate the different components of the budget. Our estimates show that wildfire emissions decreased; termite emissions may be less than previously expected and emissions from large mammals are increasing. We also used data from new satellite technology to estimate carbon that is stored in above-ground biomass in Africa. With increasing land use change and fossil fuel usage in Africa, the net bottom-up GHG estimate shows that Africa is a source at 4.5 (-3.3/14.1) PgCO2eq yr-1, with the top-down atmospheric inversion estimate smaller at 3.98 (3.13/4.85) PgCO2eq yr-1. However, our estimates continue to have large uncertainties owing to the differences between data sets and methods. It is therefore essential to increase efforts to expand the availability of high quality local data.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is a sustainable option to adapt to climate change. Weed management is one of the most important challenges faced by CA. Information on CA in cropping systems involving elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson), an important tuber crop, is lacking. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effect of CA in elephant foot yam on crop-weed dynamics, nutrient uptake, and soil microclimate. Field experiments were conducted in randomized block design over two seasons at ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, in elephant foot yam (var. Gajendra) intercropped with banana (var. Robusta) with five treatments viz., conservation organic, conservation chemical, conventional chemical, existing conventional [package of practices (POP) as control], and existing organic package. The weed flora was dominated by broad-leaved weeds. By the fourth month, conservation chemical practice reduced the weed density by 58.8% and weed biomass by 55% over existing POP. The total biomass production and its partitioning to corms, uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), crop growth rate, corm bulking rate, and harvest index of elephant foot yam did not differ significantly under conservation or conventional practices but were higher in conservation chemical practice. The N, P, and K physiological efficiencies were higher in conventional chemical treatment. The soil microclimate was improved, with higher soil CO2 flux and soil moisture in conservation organic or organic plots. The study proved that conservation practices involving reduced tillage, residue retention, and use of herbicides was a viable alternative in banana + elephant foot yam system.

AB  - The first scientific description of the flora of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (Puszcza Bialowieska) was published in 1829 in Stanislaw Batys Gorski's paper "O roslinach Zubrom upodobanych, jakotez innych w puszczy Bialowiezkiey [About preferred plants of the European bison and other plants from the Bialowieza Primeval Forest]". This publication comprised the first critical evaluation of the plant species present in the forest based on several field surveys during 1822, 1823 and 1826 by Gorski, and it dismissed the popular hypothesis that the European bison (Bison bonasus) survived there because some of its preferred forage plants were exclusively found in the forest. To assess the importance of Gorski's contribution to studies on the flora of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, we critically evaluated all his materials on the topic, including manuscripts, plant specimens collected by Gorski now preserved in Vilnius University Herbarium and his published works, and also traced all mentions and references to Gorski's studies in later botanical works devoted to the Bialowieza Primeval Forest.

AB  - Scatter- and larder hoarding are the primary strategies of food-hoarding animals and have important implications for plant-animal interactions and plant recruitment. However, their origins and influencing factors have not been fully investigated across a wide range of taxa. Our systematic literature search amassed data for 183 seed-hoarding rodent species worldwide and tested relationships of seed-hoarding behaviours with phylogenetic signal, functional traits and environmental factors. We found that the evolution of hoarding strategies was not random in phylogeny, and scatter hoarding originated independently multiple times from larder hoarding. Rodents with higher encephalisation quotient (relative brain size), omnivorous diet (related to dependence on seeds) and inhabiting lower latitudes were disproportionately likely to scatter hoard. Despite body mass's potential relationship with competition through food defence, it was associated with food-hoarding strategy only in a few families. Our results show the need to study the community and ecological context of food-hoarding behaviours.

AB  - The effective combination of semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination has a positive effect on the conservation of germplasm resources, production and breeding, etc. However, during the process of semen cryopreservation, the sperm cells are very susceptible to different degrees of physical, chemical, and oxidative stress damage. Oxidative damage is the most important factor that reduces semen quality, which is affected by factors such as dilution equilibrium, change of osmotic pressure, cold shock, and enzyme action during the freezing-thawing process, which results in the aggregation of a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sperm cells and affects the quality of semen after thawing. Therefore, the method of adding antioxidants to semen cryoprotective diluent is usually used to improve the effect of semen cryopreservation. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of adding five antioxidants (GLP, Mito Q, NAC, SLS, and SDS) to semen cryoprotection diluent on the cryopreservation effect of semen from Saanen dairy goats. The optimal preservation concentrations were screened by detecting sperm viability, plasma membrane integrity, antioxidant capacity, and acrosomal enzyme activities after thawing, and the experimental results were as follows: the optimal concentrations of GLP, Mito Q, NAC, SLS, and SDS added to semen cryopreservation diluent at different concentrations were 0.8 mg/mL, 150 nmol/L, 0.6 mg/mL, 0.15 mg/ mL, 0.6 mg/mL, and 0.15 mg/mL. The optimal concentrations of the five antioxidants were added to the diluent and analyzed after 1 week of cryopreservation, and it was found that sperm viability, plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity were significantly enhanced after thawing compared with the control group (P < 0.05), and their antioxidant capacity was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05). Therefore, the addition of the above five antioxidants to goat sperm cryodilution solution had a better enhancement of sperm cryopreservation. This study provides a useful reference for exploring the improvement of goat semen cryoprotection effect.

AB  - There is a link between metabolism and reproduction as metabolic hormones affect hypothalamus-pituitary-testis (HPT) hormonal functions and vice versa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of negative energy balance on the reproductive system in male goldfish exposed to testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol (E-2). Following 7 days of food deprivation (FD), ANOVA models showed significant FD x sex steroid interactions on sperm quality and circulating sex steroid levels. When FD effects were investigated, 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) level and sperm motility and velocity decreased in food-deprived goldfish in the control group. In E-2-exposed goldfish, FD decreased sperm production in addition to sperm motility and velocity that coincided with an elevation of circulating E-2 level. However, FD did not significantly impact sex steroids and sperm quality in T-exposed goldfish. ANOVA models showed non-significant FD x sex steroid interactions for HSI, GSI, circulating luteinizing hormone (Lh) level, and metabolic (preproghrelin, goat and nucb2) and reproductive (kiss1, gpr54 and gnrh3) mRNAs. Furthermore, results showed that FD decreased HSI, and increased Lh levels and testicular preproghrelin and goat mRNAs, while sex steroids increased mid-brain nucb2, kiss1 and gpr54 mRNAs. Together, our results suggest that FD-induced inhibition of androgenesis resulted in diminished sperm quality associated with activation of the testicular ghrelinergic system, and negative feedback of 11-KT increased Lh level. The FD-induced testicular metabolic and hormonal system was impacted in goldfish exposed to sex steroids. However, the negative effects of FD on sperm quality were accelerated in E-2-exposed goldfish due to estrogenic activity. This study provides novel information to better understand metabolic-associated reproductive disorders in fish.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Efficient pork production relies on a predictable supply of market pigs. Seasonal infertility caused by heat stress decreases fertility in sows during the summer months, impacting breeding targets and decreasing the efficiency of pork production. The present study examined the effect of a seminal additive containing caffeine, oxytocin, and lecirelin on the fertility and prolificacy of Iberian sows during two consecutive years. The results confirmed that inclusion of the additive in semen prior to AI decreased the seasonality effect, increasing the percentage of pregnant Iberian sows throughout the year.<br>Suinfort(R), a commercial semen supplement demonstrated to increase fertility and litter size in commercial sows, was tested to improve reproductive performance in Iberian sows. A total of 1430 Iberian sows were artificially inseminated (AI) with semen from Duroc boars and assigned by parity to receive the seminal additive Suinfort(R) containing 2 IU oxytocin, 5 mu g lecirelin, and 2 mM caffeine (SF; n = 1713 AI), or to serve as non-supplemented controls (CON; n = 2625 AI). CON showed a lower fertility comparing to winter for spring (p = 0.001) and summer (p < 0.001); summer was lower than autumn (p = 0.012). SF removed this seasonal effect (p > 0.05). Fertility was significantly higher for SF sows during summer (p = 0.025) and autumn (p = 0.004). Total born, live-born, stillborn, and mummified piglets did not differ between CON and SF but were impacted by the season, with total and live-born decreasing in summer compared with autumn (p < 0.001) and winter (p = 0.005). In conclusion, seminal supplementation with Suinfort(R) improved the fertility of Iberian sows during periods of seasonal infertility.

AB  - Copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) are antioxidants and essential trace elements that have mutual interaction and are reported to have beneficial effects at supranutritional levels. The experiment was executed to evaluate the individual impact of supranutritional levels of targeted elements with the effect of their interactions in buffalo calves. Twenty male Murrah buffalo calves of about 8-9 months (bodyweight 112.1 +/- 7.69 kg) were distributed into four groups of five calves in each group and fed either a control (C) diet or supplemented with supranutritional levels of Cu (T-1), Se (T-2), or combination of both (T-3) for 120 days. Higher (P = 0.015) values of packed cell volume were observed in group T-2 at day 120; otherwise, all other hematological parameters remained comparable among groups. Over the period (day 120 vs. day 0), an enhancement in the percentage of lymphocytes (P = 0.006) with a reduction in neutrophils (P = 0 .028) and hemoglobin (P = 0.024) values was observed in the control group. An enhancement in the percentage of monocytes (P = 0.031), with a reduced percentage of neutrophils (P = 0.022), was reported in groups T-2 and T-3, respectively. Interaction of Cu and Se at supranutritional level (T-3) dramatically reduced plasma Cu (P = 0.008) level against the control values, with an improvement in Se markers (i.e., plasma Se, P = 0.041 and enzyme glutathione peroxidase, P = 0.057) over the values in calves fed supplemental Se alone (T-2). Additionally, Cu (T-1 and T-3) was forced to decline (P < 0.05) Zn level in the plasma of buffalo calves. Cu (T-1, P < 0.05) and Se (T-2 and T-3, P <= 0.01) supplementation was able to improve their respective plasma levels. The interaction of two trace elements at the supranutritional level further helped in reducing the lipid peroxidation (P = 0.01) values as well. Though antioxidant vitamins and cell-mediated immunity remained unaffected, humoral immunity against antigen P. multocida was high (P = 0.005) in the group T-2. The conclusion may be drawn that supranutritional Cu and Se were capable to influence certain blood parameters with an additional interaction effect due to simultaneous supplementation in buffalo calves.

AB  - Aspects of early-life movement, including dispersal and exploratory movement, are often poorly understood and are key to disease epidemiology. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a terminal prion disease impacting cervids, is expanding geographically and presents one of the most important challenges in wildlife disease management. Epidemiological models are often used to guide surveillance and assess management, but knowledge gaps in early-life movement may limit the reliability of model predictions. Filling this knowledge gap is a critical need for increasing understanding of an important life-history behaviour that can inform disease modelling and management.<br /> We investigated early-life movement of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) within a recently developed CWD zone in the Texas Panhandle. We identified excursive movements outside the natal range and categorized them as dispersal and exploratory movements. We examined whether mule deer altered path distances, movement rates and resource selection when on excursive movements.<br /> From April 2021 to mid-February 2022, we observed 121 excursive movements (6 dispersals, 114 exploratory movements and 1 unclassified) in 29 juvenile mule deer. Dispersal was only observed in males, but most (63%) exploratory movements were conducted by females. All individuals moved faster when traversing outside the natal range. Relative to their natal range, male movement rates increased while on a dispersal but were not significantly different from the natal range while on an exploratory movement. Cumulative distances of excursive movement paths ranged from 1.27 to 617.47 km.<br /> Resource selection differed between the sexes, and both sexes altered resource selection during excursions. Males exhibited strong selection for proximity to shrubland during excursions and when within their range. For females, selection increased for higher elevation, steeper slopes and greater distance to water during an excursion compared to within range.<br /> Practical implication. Our findings suggest that early-life movement varies greatly between individuals, with differing rates of excursive behaviour and resource selection. Furthermore, exploratory movements occurred 19 times more often than dispersal and occurred throughout all seasons. This study provides insight into the early-life movement ecology of mule deer that is likely important for many population processes and disease dynamics.

AB  - Predation risk can shape prey behavior and limit population density. The ultrasonic sound emitted by bats creates a soundscape of fear which can affect moth trait expression and population dynamics via non-consumptive effects. Bat echolocation calls can be categorized as constant frequency (CF), frequency modula-tion (FM), or some combination of both (FM-CF-FM or FM-CF). Different sound characteristics may encode different levels of predation risk for moths and thus result in variable non-consumptive effects. To investigate the non-consumptive effects on moths of different types of bats echolocation calls, we played back three types of calls with distinct characteristics to an agricultural pest species, the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, two CF calls from bats that prey on the moth, and one FM call from a bat that is sympatric with the moth and represents the echolocation sound typical of most insect-eating bats. Our results showed that the FM echolocation calls of the Oriental serotine bat, Eptesicus pachyomus, negatively affected the reproductive behavior of adult S. exigua, and altered larval energy metabolism and consumption. Calls of the big-eared horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus macrotis, with a dominant frequency of 58 kHz, only affected the reproductive behavior of adult S. exigua, whereas calls of the least horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus pusillus, with a dominant frequency of 110 kHz, had no measurable effects on S. exigua. The non-consumptive effects observed included reduced activity frequency, reduced food intake, and increased body weight of the moth in response to the soundscape of fear created by bats. Overall, FM calls with frequency within the moth's hearing range had greater effects on the moths. Our findings indicate that bat calls detectable by moths, whether or not the bats actually hunt them, create a soundscape of fear with negative impacts on moth behavior and life history, and likely make a valuable contribution to pest control.

AB  - Infant feeding is a critical neurological milestone in development defined by the coordination of muscles, peripheral nerves, and brainstem nuclei. In infants, milk flow rate is often limited to improve feeding performance without treating the underlying deficiencies in the sucking and swallowing processes. Modification of the neuromotor response via sensory information from the nipple during bottle feeding is an unexplored avenue for physiology-based interventions. In this study, we assessed how differences in nipple hole size and nipple stiffness affect sucking muscle activation and subsequent movement. We fabricated four bottle nipples of varying hole size and stiffness to determine how variation in nipple properties affects the sucking behavior of infant pigs. Our results demonstrate that sensory information from the nipple affects sucking motor output. Nipple hole sizes and stiffnesses with a larger milk flow rate resulted in greater muscle activity and kinematic movement. Additionally, our results suggest that sensorimotor interventions are better directed toward modulating tongue function rather than the mandible movements due to a greater response to sensory information. Understanding how sensory information influences infant feeding is instrumental in promoting effective infant feeding.

AB  - In social mammals, dominance status and tenure length are often important determinants of male reproductive success. Nevertheless, alternative strategies, such as extra-pair mating, and the active role of females in securing reproductive benefits can substantially modify patterns of paternity. To date, many studies have had short observation periods and small sample sizes, constraining understanding of how male social status, tenure length, and female mating strategies jointly affect male long-term reproductive success, especially in species with complex social systems. Using longitudinal demographic and genetic data from a free-ranging population of a golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) multilevel society in the Qinling Mountains, central China, we investigated how leader males' ranks and tenure lengths influence their reproductive success through within-unit and extra-unit paternities. We found that although high rank increases the likelihood of producing within-unit paternity offspring in the short term, tenure length is a stronger determinant of long-term reproductive success via both within-unit and extra-unit paternities. Females may gain direct benefits from producing extra-pair paternity offspring by reducing the risk of infanticide through mating with all-male band males and/or by selecting high-ranking leader males for better access to resources. Moreover, females may also accrue additional indirect benefits from producing extra-pair paternity offspring when more adult males are available in the breeding band. Our findings highlight extra-pair paternity as a reproductive strategy for both male and female golden snub-nosed monkeys to optimize reproductive success, which may also play a role in maintaining stability in this complex primate society.

AB  - Maedi-visna virus (MVV), a small ruminant lentivirus causing chronic multisystemic disease in sheep, poses significant economic burdens due to reduced productivity and a lack of effective treatments. Despite its worldwide prevalence, epidemiological data from Algeria remain absent. This first national seroprevalence study aimed to elucidate MVV distribution, risk factors, and transmission dynamics in Algerian sheep herds. A cross-sectional survey of 1400 sheep across four regions (East, Center, West, South) was conducted, with sera analyzed via indirect ELISA (IDvet). Risk factors (geography, age, sex, breed, farming system) were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V. Overall seroprevalence was 9.07% (95% CI: 7.57-10.57), with significant variation by sex (females: 20.44% vs. males: 3.68%; p < 0.05), age (1-5 years: 6.86% vs. <1 year: 0.29%; p = 0.01), and region (Central: 3.36% vs. Eastern: 0.86%; p < 0.05). Notably, no association was found with breed or farming system (p >= 0.08), contrasting prior studies and suggesting region-specific transmission dynamics. Females exhibited heightened seropositivity, implicating prolonged herd retention and vertical transmission risks. Geographic disparities highlighted industrialized farming in central Algeria as a potential transmission amplifier. Strikingly, seronegative animals in high-prevalence herds hinted at genetic resistance, warranting further investigation. This study provides foundational insights into MVV epidemiology in North Africa, underscoring the need for targeted surveillance, ewe-focused control measures, and genetic research to mitigate transmission. The absence of prior national data elevates its significance, offering actionable frameworks for resource-limited settings and enriching the global understanding of SRLV heterogeneity.

AB  - Plant defense against herbivores is multidimensional, and investment into different defense traits is intertwined due to genetic, physiological, and ecological costs. This relationship is expected to generate a trade-off between direct defense and tolerance that is underlain by resource availability, with increasing resources being associated with increased investment in tolerance and decreased investment in direct resistance. We tested these predictions across populations of the shrub Artemisia californica by growing plants sourced from a latitudinal aridity gradient within common gardens located at the southern (xeric) and northern (mesic) portions of its distribution. We measured plant growth rate, resistance via a damage survey, and tolerance to herbivory by experimentally simulating vertebrate herbivory. Plants from more northern (vs. southern) environments were less resistant (received higher percent damage by vertebrate herbivores) and tended to be more tolerant (marginally significant) with respect to change in biomass measured 12 months after simulated vertebrate herbivory. Also, putative growth and defense traits paralleled patterns of resistance and tolerance, such that leaves from northern populations contained lower concentrations of terpenes and increased N, specific leaf area, and % water. Last, plant growth rate did not demonstrate clear clinal patterns, as northern populations (vs. southern populations) grew more slowly in the southern (xeric) garden, but there was no clinal relationship detected in the northern (mesic) garden. Overall, our findings support the prediction of lower resistance and higher tolerance in plant populations adapted to more resource-rich, mesic environments, but this trade-off was not associated with concomitant trade-offs in growth rate. These findings ultimately suggest that plant adaptation to resource availability and herbivory can shape intraspecific variation in multivariate plant defenses.

AB  - Mating involves the transfer of sperm to females. Female reproductive investment is based on gamete numbers as well as gamete size. Females are more selective than males and this selection is based on numerous factors, like a male's age, sexual status and familiarity. Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an important natural enemy of many insect pests such as aphids, psyllids, whiteflies and mealybugs in many countries. We investigated female mate choice in Hippodamia variegate caging females with: (i) a young and a middle-aged male, (ii) a virgin and mated male and (iii) a novel and a familiar male. Time to and duration of copulation were recorded. Females preferred to mate with middle-aged and familiar males and did not differentiate between previously mated and virgin males. Females copulated quicker and for longer with young or familiar males.

AB  - Background: Maternal separation (MS) in rodents is a paradigm of early life events that affects neurological development in depression. Adolescence is a time of dramatic increases in psychological vulnerability, and being female is a depression risk factor. However, data on whether different MS scenarios affect behavioral deficits and the potential mechanisms in adolescent female mice are limited. Methods: C57BL/6 J female pups were exposed to different MS (no MS, NMS; MS for 15 min/day, MS15; or 180 min/day, MS180) from postnatal day (PND)1 to PND21 and subjected for behavioral tests during adolescence. Behavioural tests, specifically the open field test (OFT), novel object recognition test (NOR) test and tail suspension test (TST), were performed. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines, hippocampal neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota were also assessed. Results: The results showed that MS180 induced emotional behavioral deficits and object recognition memory impairment; however, MS15 promoted object recognition memory in adolescent females. MS180 decreased hippocampal neurogenesis of adolescent females, induced an increase in microgliosis, and increased certain inflammatory factors in the hippocampus, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Furthermore, different MS altered gut microbiota diversity, and alpha diversity in the Shannon index was negatively correlated with the peripheral inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Species difference analysis showed that the gut microbiota composition of the phyla Desulfobacterota and Proteobacteria was affected by the MS. Limitations: The sex differences in adolescent animal and causality of hippocampal neurogenesis and gut microbiota under different MS need to be further analyzed in depression. Conclusion: This study indicates different MS affect recognition memory and emotional behaviors in adolescent females, and gut microbiota-neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis may be a potential site of early neurodevelopmental impairment in depression.

AB  - Simple Summary: Olive oil is known worldwide for its beneficial effects on human health. However, during its extraction, a great quantity of by-products is produced. Their utilization as a replacer of forage in goats could minimize the costs related to their management and result in their sustainable utilization as dietary ingredients. As shown in the present experiment, milk fat and protein percentages were gradually increased with increasing ensiled olive cake (OC) inclusion rates in the diets, while the milk yield was not affected. The concentration of milk mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) was also enhanced, while OC dietary supplementation was associated with the increased expression of specific genes in the mammary and adipose tissues of goats. As can be concluded, OC inclusion of up to 20% (DM) in goats' diets as forage is recommended since milk protein, fat, and MUFA contents are increased without adversely affecting milk yield. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the dietary inclusion of ensiled OC on milk yield, composition, fatty acid (FA) profile, and the expression of selected genes involved in lipid metabolism in the udder and adipose tissue of goats. Seventy-two Damascus dairy goats in mid-lactation were assigned randomly to three iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic diets containing 0, 10, and 20% of ensiled OC as a replacement of forage (OC0, OC10, and OC20, respectively) for 42 days. During weeks 5 and 6 of the trial, dry matter intake, milk yield, milk composition, and FA profiles were recorded, while mammary and perirenal adipose tissue samples were also collected from six animals per treatment from the OC0 and OC20 groups for gene expression analysis. No significant differences were observed among groups concerning milk yield, 4% fat-corrected milk, fat, or protein yield (kg/d). In contrast, the milk fat percentage was gradually increased with increasing OC inclusion rates in the diets, while milk protein percentages were elevated in both OC groups but significantly only in the milk of the OC20 group. The content of FA between C4:0 to C16:0 was reduced, while mono-unsaturated FA (MUFA) concentration was enhanced in the goat milk of OC groups. The OC feeding treatment was associated with the increased mammary expression of SLC2A1 (p < 0.05), VLDLR (p < 0.01), FABP3 (p < 0.01), and elevated SLC2A1 (p < 0.05) and FASN (p < 0.01) gene expression in the adipose tissue of goats fed the OC20 diet. Overall, OC can be used in goats' diets as a forage replacement, at least in the inclusion rate of 20% DM, since this could increase the milk protein and fat percentage and enrich its content with beneficial for human health lipids without adversely affecting milk production traits.

AB  - Play fighting is a multifunctional behaviour allowing the development of both cooperative and competitive skills. During play fighting, animals perform 'competitive' actions that are typical of the agonistic context and/or 'cooperative' actions to avoid escalation into aggression. Several structural features of play fighting (asymmetry, duration, variability and repetition) provide information on whether a session is more, or less, competitive. In many mammalian species, the relaxed open mouth (ROM) is a metasignal that communicates that the interaction is playful. In the Felidae family, play fighting has been poorly investigated and it is challenging to tell whether play fights are cooperative or competitive. Here, we explored whether the ROM could provide information about the cooperative/ competitive nature of play fighting in felines. To do so, we videorecorded and analysed dyadic play- fighting interactions in kittens of domestic cats, Felis silvestris catus, and Asian leopard cats, Prionailurus bengalensis. For both species, we found that play-fighting sessions with ROM were more symmetric, lasted longer, were less variable and showed lower evenness and repetition than those without ROM. As a whole, our results suggest that in both species ROM may help manage unpredictable play-fighting sessions and therefore this signal can be used to increase cooperation during the playful interaction, thus prolonging it.

AB  - The epididymis is responsible for peripheral immune tolerance of maturing spermatozoa even though these have xeno-antigens foreign to the male and female immune system. The epididymis also produces factors required for fertilization and serves as a sperm repository until the time of ejaculation. These reproduction-relevant epididymal functions occur in the mesonephros-derived duct-system that is composed of absorptive and secretory epithelial cells with the capacity for merocrine and apocrine secretion of proteins, antioxidative- and electrolyte/pH-regulating enzymes and small, non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), many stored in epididymosomes for sperm adhesion and long-lasting modifications of sperm functions. This paper provides a review summary of current and new knowledge of how the boar epididymis affects the quality of spermatozoa in the ejaculate of breeding boars. There is a particular focus on sperm maturation, survival, function and the role of signaling to the female immune system in fertility modulation. Furthermore, aspects related to the ductus epithelial contributions regarding electrolyte control, protein production, release of epididymosomes that contain sncRNAs are emphasized as are novel associations with fertility of the male, sperm quiescence during storage in the cauda epididymis, and on changes occurring in sperm subsequent to ejaculation.

AB  - Recently, the prevalence of hypertension has become a global challenge. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to identify and purify antihypertensive peptides (AHTPs) from food-derived proteins to aid the discovery of new hypotensive drugs with fewer side effects. In this study, we performed high-throughput prediction of AHTPs based on multi-omics data, providing an overview of AHTPs in the lined seahorse proteins and suggesting their potential application as bioactive agents to lower blood pressure. We identified 14,695 AHTP-derived genes in the lined seahorse, and most of them were supported by transcriptomic evidence, whereas only 495 genes were further detected by proteome sequencing. Among these predicted AHTP-derived genes, the longest titin had the most hits with 104 AHTPs, some of which were clustered in exon 158, 194, and 204. Another AHTP-rich group was in the collagen family, and four AHTP-rich collagens exhibited much higher transcription in the pouch than in other examined tissues, including brain, testis, and embryos. Additionally, antihypertensive triplets, comprised of the permutations of Gly, Pro, and Lys, prevailed in all collagen sequences due to the representative XaaYaaGly repeat units. In summary, our present findings provide a solid basis for understanding the abundance of various AHTPs in the lined seahorse as well as shed light on the development of antihypertensive products and drugs using seahorses as an important resource.

However, to safely execute the application of carbon nanomaterials in human treatments, conducting safety assessments and establishing suitable evaluation criteria are necessary. In this study, lysine-carbonized nanogels (Lys-CNGs) that display antibacterial and antiviral abilities were employed in a comprehensive evaluation of their toxicity profiles through assessments in different animal models and growth stages. It was observed that zebrafish at the embryo and eleutheroembryo stages experienced significant toxic effects at a concentration of 15-fold the recommended dosage (0.5 ppm), whereas adult zebrafish following longterm consumption of fodder containing Lys-CNGs presented no adverse effects. Further microbiota analysis indicated that Lys-CNGs did not cause significant changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria. In contrast, in the toxicity assessments with mammalian animal models, the Lys-CNGs showed no adverse effects, such as weight loss, dermal irritation, and skin sensitization responses in rabbits and guinea pigs, even at a high dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight. Our study revealed that Lys-CNGs have different toxic effects on different growth stages of zebrafish. Researchers in this field should carefully consider the implications of these toxicity profiles during the development of therapeutic carbon-based nanomaterials and for comparison of studies.

AB  - Objective Increasing fragmentation from constructed barriers, increased water use, and climate change limits the resiliency of stream fish metapopulations by reducing colonization. Management actions such as stocking or translocating fish may help contribute to the resilience of isolated habitats and increase redundancy of populations in intermittent stream networks. Our objective was to determine whether translocating fish into prairie headwater refuges could reestablish or supplement isolated populations.Methods We examined apparent survival and probability of detection of four native, small-bodied fishes that were translocated in 2022 and 2023 to prairie headwater refuges that were affected by a severe drought and experienced slow recovery of their fish assemblages. All the fish were marked with passive integrated transponder tags, allowing us to use a mark-recapture framework to track the fate of these fish.Results Apparent survival was predicted by an interaction between time and translocation site, indicating an important consideration of environmental factors. Approximately one-quarter of the fish remained at site A through the summer of both years, whereas estimates were near zero at site B in both years and mixed across years at site C. The decreases in apparent survival probabilities following flow events suggest that fish may be emigrating during these periods of reconnection. During the lower flow year, more fish remained at the headwater sites and young-of-year fish were captured during long-term sampling, suggesting that the translocated fish reproduced.Conclusions The success of translocation projects will depend on a variety of factors, including management goals, habitat, and hydrology, but the initially high survival reported in this study is encouraging. Difficulties with examining the movement of small fish during hydrologic events limited our conclusions about the relative contributions of mortality and emigration to apparent survival estimates. Despite low yearly apparent survival, we found evidence of reproduction from translocated fish, suggesting that the reestablishment of a viable population is possible.
   Management actions can support fish populations that are facing reduced connectivity from infrastructure or drought. Translocating small-bodied fish could add resiliency in stream networks, as evidenced by high initial survival and context-dependent reproduction in prairie streams.

AB  - Training is a management practice that should be used to facilitate routine care and management of animals. If well planned, training promotes human-animal interactions and enables the completion of veterinary procedures required for effective health assessment with lower stress levels. Hence, it is indicated whenever ancillary tests are needed. A captive adult female capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) housed in a public research laboratory in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was used in this study. The animal expressed aversion to some keepers and escape behavior in the presence of strangers. The animal was trained before mating to enable pregnancy ultrasound examination with no need for restraint until delivery. Fourteen weeks of training using three techniques (Counterconditioning, Habituation, and Operant Conditioning using shaping with positive reinforcement) were needed to achieve project objectives. The training enabled appropriate ultrasound imaging. Unique images with high diagnostic value were obtained throughout pregnancy, with significant contributions to the reproductive management of the species. Training is also an essential element of good management practices.

AB  - The spatial extent of semi-arid hot regions is forecasted to grow through the twenty-first century, complicating restoration and reforestation plans. In arid and semi-arid climates, seedlings are more susceptible to transplant shock due to lower soil moisture throughout the year. Determining strategies to reduce seedling stress and improve survival post-planting will be paramount to continued reforestation efforts in a changing climate. We quantified seedling physiological, morphological, and field performance (mortality and growth) response for five species native to the semi-arid region of South Texas (Erythrina herbacea L., Celtis pallida Torr., Fraxinus berlandieriana DC, Malpighia glabra L., and Citharexylum berlandieri B.L Rob) to an antitranspirant (abscisic acid), drought, and elevated CO2. We examined post-treatment seedling gas exchange, non-structural carbohydrates, osmolality, root structure, and stomatal density and evaluated mortality and growth rate on a sample of the treatment population. For elevated CO2 and drought hardening treatments, seedling gas exchange, solute content, specific root length, and stomatal density varied by species, while abscisic acid strongly reduced transpiration and stomatal conductance in all species. However, these physiological and morphological differences did not translate to reduced mortality or improved growth rate due to high herbivory and above-normal precipitation after planting precluding seedlings from stress. We conclude that the simpler antitranspirant approach, rather than the more logistically challenging eCO(2), has the potential to reduce drought-related transplant shock but requires more widespread testing.

AB  - Reliable mapping of system-level individual differences is a critical first step toward precision medicine for complex disorders such as schizophrenia. Disrupted structural covariance indicates a system-level brain maturational disruption in schizophrenia. However, most studies examine structural covariance at the group level. This prevents subject-level inferences. Here, we introduce a Network Template Perturbation approach to construct individual differential structural covariance network (IDSCN) using regional gray-matter volume. IDSCN quantifies how structural covariance between two nodes in a patient deviates from the normative covariance in healthy subjects. We analyzed T1 images from 1287 subjects, including 107 first-episode (drug-naive) patients and 71 controls in the discovery datasets and established robustness in 213 first-episode (drug-naive), 294 chronic, 99 clinical high-risk patients, and 494 controls from the replication datasets. Patients with schizophrenia were highly variable in their altered structural covariance edges; the number of altered edges was related to severity of hallucinations. Despite this variability, a subset of covariance edges, including the left hippocampus-bilateral putamen/globus pallidus edges, clustered patients into two distinct subgroups with opposing changes in covariance compared to controls, and significant differences in their anxiety and depression scores. These subgroup differences were stable across all seven datasets with meaningful genetic associations and functional annotation for the affected edges. We conclude that the underlying physiology of affective symptoms in schizophrenia involves the hippocampus and putamen/pallidum, predates disease onset, and is sufficiently consistent to resolve morphological heterogeneity throughout the illness course. The two schizophrenia subgroups identified thus have implications for the nosology and clinical treatment.

AB  - Animal manure is widely used in farmland, and the acidification of animal slurry has been proven to be an effective method to reduce nitrogen (N) loss during storage. Although there is evidence that H2SO4 is a good acidifier of animal slurry, it is strictly controlled by the Chinese government. Hence, an alternative is required. The one-time acidification of pig slurry with hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), formic acid (CH2O2), and acetic acid (C2H4O2) to pH 5.0 with a storage period of 180 days is investigated in this study. The results demonstrated that a large amount of nitrogen (79.8%) in the pig slurry was lost during 180 days of storage and the value is related to untreated slurry. Acidification with all of the mentioned acidifiers reduced the N loss. The lowest N loss was obtained using H3PO4 (11.9%), the second lowest was H2SO4 (31.7%), the third lowest was HCl (40.6%), and HNO3 had the worst results (76.0%). After acidification, the microbial community number in the pig slurry declined by more than 10%, and more than a half of the microbial community changed. The relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae in the pig slurry acidified with formic acid was 15.9%, which was much higher than that acidified with H3PO4 (0.9%), leading to a more rapid nitrogen conversion rate and a higher N loss. Therefore, it is technically feasible to use H3PO4 as an alternative to H2SO4 for a reduction in N loss during pig slurry storage.

AB  - Purpose This study was conducted to characterize the extract collagen hydrolysate (CH) from low value buffalo skin using enzymes bromelain (B) and papain (P), including their bioactivities. Methods Optimum levels of the two enzymes were determined by Sodium dodecyl sulphate-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and degree of hydrolysis. Levels (30 and 50 units of B/g of skin and 20 and 30 units of P/g of skin) showing maximum degradation of collagen proteins were used to extract CH and the recovered CH were correspondingly referred as B20, B50, P20 and P30, respectively. Results The yield of CH from skin for P20, P30, B30 and B50 was 27.38, 26.32, 20.71 and 16.19%, respectively. SDS-PAGE image of the different CH samples showed complete degradation of alpha- and beta- chains of the collagen protein chains revealing only smear bands. 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability was highest (94.51%) for B50 sample followed by 90.59% for P30 at the concentration of 10 mg/ml. Amide I peaks of various CHs as revealed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed greater disruption in the triple helical structure of collagen chains in P30 and B50 than P20 and B30 samples. Antiarthritic study revealed that B30 and B50 samples had 71.07 and 99.47% inhibition, respectively at the concentration of 50 mu g/ml. Conclusion Thus, it could be concluded that 30 and 50 units of papain and bromelain per gram of skin, respectively, could be used to extract CH from buffalo skin and better utilize this high protein byproduct into high value food supplement.

AB  - Organic waste utilization stands as a pivotal approach to ecological and economic sustainability. This study aimed to assess the stability, maturity, and evolution of co-composts comprising various blends of green waste (GW) and sheep manure (SM). Employing a diverse array of physico-chemical and biological parameters, we investigated the co-composting process over 120 days. Three types of garden waste (mixture of green waste (MGW), fallen leaves (FL), and grass cutting (GC)) were utilized. The results revealed significant compost transformation, evident by odor and insect absence and a shift to dark brown coloration, indicating maturation. The compost C2, derived from FL, exhibited superior soil amendment potential. Significantly, it exhibited a pH level of 6.80, an EC of 2.45 mS/cm, and an OM content of 55%, along with a C/N ratio of 16.15. Analysis of the macronutrients revealed values of 1.98% for TN, 3.22% for TP, and 0.61% for K. Crucially, the compost showed no phytotoxic effects and boasted a high GI of 94.20% and a low respiration rate of 4.02 mg/50 g, indicating its stability and appropriateness for agricultural application. Our findings underscore compost's potential as an eco-friendly soil amendment, offering valuable insights for sustainable agricultural management and supporting the circular economy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of progressive pig slurry (PS) rates, applied over a 12-year period, on the molecular composition of soil organic matter in a calcareous soil. Annual organic matter rates of PS ranged from 1.0 to 4.8 Mg ha-1. Humic acids (HAs) were extracted from field plots treated with PS, including a control (no PS applied). These HAs were analysed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proportions of the 122 major compounds released from the soil HAs indicated that PS stimulated humification processes, with the degree of enhancement depending on the application rate. The applied PS contained a high proportion of aliphatic compounds, but only steroids and triterpenes accumulated in the HA soil fraction, and this was only observed at low PS rates. These results suggest that the application of PS leads to a dose-dependent increase in alkyl compounds, mainly alkanes and olefins. Aromatic compounds also showed a dose-dependent increase, but not in terms of the demethoxylated compounds typical of mature humic substances found in the original soil. Instead, the increase in aromatics was observed in the form of methoxyphenols, suggesting a recent incorporation of lignin derivatives from crop residues into the HA.

AB  - Tea cultivation and industries employ a large population in the tea-growing regions of north India. Tea has its climatic niche and gradual changes in the climatic conditions can have a profound impact on its yield and quality. Despite being important climatic regulators on the growth of tea bushes, the effects of solar radiation and soil temperature on tea yield remain unexplored. Here, we developed a garden-level panel dataset using data from the tea gardens of the Dooars region, a major tea-producing region in India over 10 years, and statistically estimated the effects of surface-net solar radiation and soil temperature at different depths on monthly tea yield. We found that surface-net solar radiation had a negative effect (1.01 kg/ha decrease in average tea yield for 1 MJ m(-2) day(-1) increase in surface-net solar radiation) on tea yield and this negative effect was primarily associated with the summer season. Soil temperature just below the surface (0-7 cm) facilitated tea yield (1.05 kg/ha increase in average tea yield for 1 degrees C temperature increase) in all seasons, whereas that at a depth of 100-289 cm had a negative effect (1.07 kg/ha decrease in average tea yield for 1 degrees C temperature increase). For east and northeast-directed gardens, the effects of surface solar radiation on tea yield were different from the overall trend. Finally, projection of future tea yield based on predictions of surface solar radiation from three GCMs (MIROC5, CCSM4, and CESM1 (CAM5)) indicated that summer and winter tea production will potentially reduce by 1-5% and 0.9-4.4% respectively in the future (2021-2079) under RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5.

AB  - : Biodiversity conservation is an essential but too-frequently overlooked dimension of environmental sustainability. Most endangered species live in developing countries. In these countries, sustainable development projects need to leverage efforts to protect biodiversity rather than being at crosspurposes with them. To these ends, this article describes a business plan that has a firm market a biodiversity offering that is profitable and supports a biodiversity project. This project, in-turn, enhances biodiversity. Customers are kept abreast of the project's biodiversity impacts by viewing an online biodiversity dashboard. This dashboard graphically portrays data on the project and the abundance of the targeted species. Remote sensing and other Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used to pipe this data to the dashboard. For purposes of illustration, this plan is hypothetically applied to preserving the South African rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). A set of agent submodels dynamically portrays firms in a business network that employs would-be rhino poachers. A general purpose tool for constructing these interacting submodels is detailed.

AB  - Building a comprehensive understanding of geo-ecological functions is viewed as a critical step in the quantification of carbonate and sediment budgets on coral reefs. Although parrotfishes are known to play key roles in such functions, the roles of surgeonfishes are less well understood. This is despite surgeonfishes being some of the largest and most abundant, nominally herbivorous fishes on reefs, with the potential to play a major role in sediment dynamics. Here, we quantified the role of four focal surgeonfish species across two functional groups (sediment suckers and brushers) in cross-habitat sediment dynamics by combining data on behavioural observations, fish abundance, gut content analysis, and published gut throughput rates. On average, these surgeonfish species together were estimated to rework and/or transport 71.4 +/- 12.7 kg 100 m(-2) year(-1) of sediment. A single 30-35 cm surgeonfish was estimated to rework similar to 36 kg individual(-1) year(-1), a value equivalent to that of large parrotfishes. However, the two functional groups of surgeonfishes contributed to sediment dynamics in fundamentally different ways. The brusher, Ctenochaetus striatus, was primarily involved in on-reef sediment reworking. In contrast, the three sediment suckers were primarily involved in off-reef sediment reworking and in driving a potential net flux of sediment onto the reef. These results highlight the importance of off-reef shallow sand habitats as key feeding grounds for some surgeonfishes, as well as the role of these surgeonfishes in connecting off-reef habitats to reefs via biological sediment fluxes.

AB  - The eastern ancient Silk Road (EASR)-an area critical in linking Central China with the pastoralist societies of the eastern Eurasian Steppe and Central Asia-was a key component to trans-Eurasian exchange since the Bronze Age. Despite the area's importance, not much is known regarding the spatio-temporal variation of human diets and the associated subsistence practices during the Bronze Age. This dearth of information is largely due to the absence of key evidence from the EASR during 3000-2200 years before present (yr B.P.). In this study, we report new carbon and nitrogen isotopic data, including radiocarbon dates of human and animal bones unearthed from the Shijia-Yucun (SJ-YC) site in the EASR, dated between similar to 2700 and 2500 yr B.P. During our target period of study, the humans, pigs and dogs living in SJ-YC mainly consumed C4 foods (millets and millet by-products), while herbivorous livestock consumed a mix of C3 and C4 plants. Combined with published isotopic and archaeobotanical data, we detected an asynchronous transformation of dietary patterns in different regions of the EASR during the Bronze Age. Between 3500 and 2200 yr B.P., staple foods for most western EASR humans shifted from C4 to mixed C3 and C4 foods. In the eastern EASR, C4 foods remained dominant in human diets throughout the Bronze Age. Patterns in dietary changes are not completely consistent with the various trajectory of crop cultivation. We propose that, in the context of Bronze Age trans-Eurasian exchanges, humans adopted different livelihoods throughout the EASR to deal with the survival pressures and social customs associated with variations in climate, population, and geopolitical factors. Our work provides vital evidence for dietary and subsistence variation in the EASR and explores the complicated relationship between Bronze Age humans and their environment.

AB  - Cryopreservation of sperm is a crucial tool for the long-term preservation of male genetic material, causing significant issues in motility, membrane, and acrosome integrity, among other parameters. Antioxidants have been used to cope with these detrimental effects. We tested 1. the toxicity of a wide range of water soluble beta-carotene (beta: 250-4000 mu M) and alpha-tocopherol (alpha: 31-496 mu M) concentrations on boar ejaculated sperm (n = 6) in parameters as motility, viability, acrosome reaction, apoptosis, oxidation, mitochondrial activation and membrane potential; 2. the effect of various beta-carotene (250-1000 mu M) and alpha-tocopherol (31-124 mu M) concentrations added to the cooling-freezing or thawing extenders (n = 30) before (0 min) and after 90 min incubation (37 C-degrees). Toxicity results showed a decrease in the proportion of live spermatozoa with non- reacted acrosome from 75.1 +/- 3.3 % using beta 250/alpha 31 to 60.1 +/- 5.7 % and 59.3 +/- 5.4 % in samples with beta 2000/alpha 248 and beta 4000/alpha 496 respectively (p < 0.05), suggesting a detrimental effect of the highest concentrations. Antioxidant supplementation in the cooling-freezing extender decreased the apoptotic and oxidized spermatozoa in beta 500/alpha 62 and beta 1000/alpha 124, relative to the control. In contrast, antioxidants addition to the thawing extender induced some detrimental effects in several sperm parameters analyzed. In conclusion, water-soluble beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol prevent acrosome reaction and oxidation during cooling-freezing on boar sperm. High concentrations of these antioxidants negatively impacted motility and mitochondrial function, suggesting cytotoxic effects and potential capacitation-like changes. The beta 1000/alpha 124 showed protective effects during cryopreservation, but post-thawing supplementation may stimulate oxidative stress rather than prevent it.

AB  - Secondary metabolites are central to understanding the evolution of plant-animal interactions. Direct effects on phytophagous animals are well-known, but how secondary consumers adjust their behavioural and physiological responses to the herbivore's diet remains more scarcely explored for some metabolites. Caffeine is a neuroactive compound that affects both the behaviour and physiology of several animal species, from humans to insects. It is an alkaloid present in nectar, leaves and even sap of numerous species of plants where it plays a role in chemical defences against herbivores and pathogens. Caffeine effects have been overlooked in generalist herbivores that are not specialized in coffee or tea plants. Using a host-parasitoid system, we show that caffeine intake at a relatively low dose affects longevity and fecundity of the primary consumer, but also indirectly of the secondary one, suggesting that this alkaloid and/or its effects can be transmitted through trophic levels and persist in the food chain. Parasitism success was lowered by approximate to 16% on hosts fed with caffeine, and parasitoids of the next generation that have developed in hosts fed on caffeine showed a reduced longevity, but no differences in mass and size were found. This study helps at better understanding how plant secondary metabolites, such as caffeine involved in plant-animal interactions, could affect primary consumers, could have knock-on effects on upper trophic levels over generations, and could modify interspecific interactions in multitrophic systems.

AB  - 1. Galls of some species of cynipid wasps produce a sugary secretion that attracts ants, which are thought to defend gall-inducers against natural enemies, although evidence in support of this hypothesis is mixed. Some discrepancies may be explained by the complexity of the multitrophic interactions, which involve multiple ant and parasitoid species, and which are influenced by gall size and aggregation. The gall exudate also affects these relationships, although secretion patterns and possible host plant impacts appear to be unstudied. 2. We studied Disholcaspis eldoradensis Beutenmuller (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae) galls on Quercus lobata Nee (Fagaceae) and its interactions with ants and parasitoids. We used exclusion experiments to test the defensive benefits of ants and timing of parasitoid oviposition, and we measured how gall size, aggregation, and ant visitation influence these interactions. In addition, we measured variation in sucrose secreted by galls during larval development. 3. Ants benefited gall inducers in 2018, but not 2019. Over 80% of visits observed were from invasive ants. Gall aggregation was not associated with parasitism, gall inducer success, or visitation by ants. During 2018, gall size was inversely correlated with the chance of parasitism and positively correlated with gall inducer biomass, whereas in 2019, parasitoid community composition varied with gall size. Sucrose secretion varied widely among galls and through time. 4. Facultative mutualisms between ants and sugar-secreting galls are complex and likely vary through time depending on local ecological circumstances. Gall secretions warrant increased attention and may impose a substantial burden on some host plant photosynthetic budgets.

AB  - High-resolution data for planktonic foraminifera and their groups of ecological interest, including Herbivores and Carnivores, combined with benthic foraminifera and a great variety of biogeochemical indices from the SE Aegean sediment core ST5, contribute to a detailed study concerning major and minor climatic episodes during Holocene. The ST5 sediment record, retrieved from the Tilos-Symi marine basin, evidences the impact of the nearby land, the local climate, and the Rhodes Gyre imprint on the eastern Mediterranean water circulation. Pronounced environmental changes are detected during a preconditioning period of similar to 400 years before the onset of sapropel S1 deposition and during the deposition phases S1a (10.0-8.4 ka BP) and S1b (8.0-6.1 ka BP). Major freshwater influx episodes (10.5 ka BP, 9.2-8.9 ka BP, 7.4 ka BP, 4.5-4.3 ka BP, and few additional during the Late-Holocene) are revealed, prominent oxygen deficiency time intervals (including a distinct brief anoxic period) as well as several drier, cooler and warmer climatic events. Herbivore planktonic foraminifera alternate their dominance with the Carnivores at the preconditioning period before the S1 onset and at the Late-Holocene (2.0-1.5 ka BP) when conditions of good seawater circulation, oxygenation, and productivity alternate with stratified low oxygenation waters and high freshwater influx from the land.

AB  - Simple Summary The inclusion of whole oilseeds in the diets of ruminants can be a useful strategy for reducing methane emissions and improving milk quality. This study evaluated the effects of the inclusion of whole hemp seeds or linseeds in the diet of dairy goats. The results showed that neither seed caused a reduction in methane emission or an increase in milk yield, but both seeds improved the milk quality in terms of fatty acid composition. The effect of whole linseeds or hemp seeds on milk production, energy and nitrogen balance, and methane emission was studied in 12 Alpine goats using respiration chambers. Diets tested were a control diet (C) and two diets supplemented with whole linseeds (L) or hemp seeds (H) at 9.3% on a dry matter (DM) basis. DM intake was similar among treatments, whereas DM and organic matter digestibility were lower for L compared to C. Milk yield (2.30 kg/d on average) and rumen fermentation profile were not affected by treatments. Treatment also did not affect the milk composition, with the exception of fat, which was higher in H and L compared to C (4.21, 3.94, and 3.20%, respectively). Oilseed supplementation caused a reduction in the concentration of de novo fatty acids (FA) (41.1, 48.8, and 64.1% of FA, for L, H, and C, respectively). Moreover, L and H diets reduced the sum of saturated FA, and increased monounsaturated FA, whereas only the L diet increased the concentration of polyunsaturated FA. Regarding methane production, and nitrogen and energy balances, no differences were registered among the diets. Our research indicates that including whole linseeds and hemp seeds in the dairy goat diet is an effective strategy for increasing milk fat content and positively modifying the milk FA composition, without a change in nitrogen and energy balances, but also without a reduction in enteric methane emission.

AB  - We investigated whether the recombinant leptin (1, 10, 100 ng/mL) influences the meiotic maturation of goat oocytes, whether the MAPK and JAK2/STAT3 pathways mediate the effects of leptin during in-vitro maturation, and whether leptin differently affects the abundance of mRNAs relevant to leptin signal transduction and apoptosis in oocytes and cumulus cells. The addition of leptin to the maturation medium positively affected the number of oocytes that completed nuclear maturation. Nuclear oocyte maturation stimulated by leptin was significantly impaired when we added the specific inhibitors of MAPK (U0126) and JAK2/STAT3 (AG490) to the maturation medium. The addition of leptin (10 ng/mL) during maturation did not affect the expression o AMPK alpha 1, PPAR alpha, Caspase 3, and BCL2 genes in oocytes or cumulus cells. The PPAR gamma and BAX mRNA abundances were significantly reduced in cumulus cells in the leptin group compared to the control group. Our results demonstrate that supplementation of the in-vitro maturation medium with leptin significantly improves nuclear maturation and reveal the important role of the MAPK and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in establishing the leptin-mediated nuclear maturation of goat oocytes. Moreover, leptin treatment affects PPAR gamma and BAX gene expression in cumulus cells.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three inclusion levels of Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage (OFM) to the lactose-egg yolk extender on the quality of frozen-thawed boar semen. Semen samples (n=22) were split into four OFM treatments: 0.0 (control), 3.3, 6.7, or 10.0% OFM. The semen was packaged in 0.5 mL straws and frozen using conventional methods. The sperm motility, viability, membrane integrity (HOST), and morphology (intact acrosome and normal sperm) characteristics were evaluated immediately postthaw. Additionally, sperm were incubated at 37 degrees C during 3.5 h and monitored hourly in a termoresistance test (TRT) to assess sperm motility, viability, and membrane integrity, The study showed that adding OFM to the freezing extender significantly improved (P < 0.05) sperm quality characteristics, without affecting (P > 0.05) acrosome integrity or sperm abnormalities. Furthermore, the OFM addition improved (P < 0.05) the sperm viability and membrane integrity for up to 3.5 h of incubation. Results indicate that OFM can be added to the extender at a 6.7% OFM inclusion level to improve the quality of cryopreserved boar sperm.

AB  - In recent years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. This progress has been significantly aided by the use of associative learning-based approaches in human subjects and preclinical animal models. Here, we first review experimental research focusing on the abnormal processing of absent stimuli using three different conditioning phenomena: conditioned hallucinations, mediated conditioning, and trace conditioning. We then review studies investigating the ability to reduce focal processing of physically present but informationally redundant stimuli using habituation, latent inhibition, and blocking. The results of these different lines of research are then summarized within the framework of Wagner's (1981) standard operating procedures model, an associative learning model with explicit reference to the internal representations of both present and absent stimuli. Within this framework, the central deficit associated with positive symptoms can be described as a failure to suppress the focal processing of both absent stimuli and present but irrelevant stimuli. This can explain the wide range of results obtained in different experimental settings. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of the hippocampus and its interaction with dopaminergic transmission in the emergence of such abnormal stimulus representations and learning. Overall, we hope that the theoretical framework and empirical findings offered by the associative learning approach will continue to facilitate and integrate analyses of schizophrenia conducted at the psychological and behavioral levels on the one hand, and at the neural and molecular levels on the other, by serving as a useful interface between them.

AB  - The importance of sheep as meat producing animals is increasing worldwide. However, the meat production traits or carcass traits are not studied well. In this study 8 months old, 120 healthier animals with 30 males from each Balochi, Rakhshani, Harnai and Bibrik sheep breeds were randomly selected from various sheep farms of Balochistan. They were divided into A, B, C and D groups including Balochi, Rakhshani, Harnai and Bibrik sheep breeds respectively, raised under the semi-intensive management system. The results for carcass traits including live body weight, carcass weight, dressing percentage and boneless weight significantly higher (P <= 0.0) in Balochi sheep breed followed by Bibrik, Rakhshani and Harnai sheep breed. The result for thoracolumbar vertebrae variation were 20, 18, 18 and 19, Balochi, Rakhshani, Harnai and Bibrik, respectively. It is concluded that Balochi sheep breed carcass traits are better expressed and produce more meat as compared with other sheep breeds whereas, thoracolumbar vertebrae number is positively associated with the carcass weight and carcass quality.

AB  - Transhumant herds graze across two different rangeland types according to the season. Winter rangelands differ from summer rangelands in the amount and quality of available fodder, with the former being the less productive. In cold areas, winter rangeland has low forage quality where goats may suffer severe nutritional restrictions during gestation which lead to significant reproductive losses in the form of abortions and perinatal losses. In Argentinian northern Patagonia, the transhumant Criollo goat is a dual-purpose breed, producing both meat and cashmere and grazing on winter rangelands where they complete their reproductive cycle. Our objective was to evaluate to what extent the winter rangelands of northern Argentine Patagonia satisfy the nutritional requirements needed by Criollo transhumant goats during late gestating. We evaluated a study between 2010 and 2012 where we analysed the body weight and body condition score of the goats reaching the winter rangelands and before kidding. We also analysed the botanical composition of their diet, the quality forage (metabolizable energy, crude protein and digestibility) contribution offered by the species and the proportions of the nutritional requirements of the goats during the last third of gestation. Significantly, we found a decrease in body weight and body condition score in late gestation. In 2010, the goats' diet showed a nutritional deficiency value of 0.6 Mcal/day metabolizable energy and 30.43 g/day crude protein; in 2011, a deficiency of 0.77 Mcal/day metabolizable energy and 65.48 g/day crude protein; and in 2012, a deficiency of 0.75 Mcal/day metabolizable energy and 55.41 g/day crude protein. Forage present 51, 52 and 48% digestibility in each year, respectively. We conclude that forage quality in winter rangelands in Argentinean Patagonia is not high enough to satisfy the nutritional requirements of Criollo transhumant goats during the last third of gestation. We recommend 550 g/day of an 80:20 mixture of corn:soy expeller supplementation during late gestation.

AB  - Background and aimsThis study assessed the impact of pH modification of pig slurry on the dynamics of slurry- and soil-derived phosphorus (P) after surface application, as a potential alternative to inorganic P fertilizers.MethodsMineral acidification (pH 5), bio-acidification (pH 5), and alkalinization (pH 9.5) were the strategies used to modify the pH of pig slurry using paper industry by-products and additive combinations. Maize seedlings were grown in rhizoboxes to monitor root and shoot traits over 23 days. The labile P pool in the sandy loam soil was labeled with 33P to distinguish between soil- and fertilizer-derived P. Post-harvest analyses included acid phosphatase activity and mycorrhizal root colonization.ResultsAll (bio)-acidified treatments significantly increased slurry water-extractable P by 70% but spent acid by-product reduced maize root growth and total P uptake. Alkalinized slurry did not affect root growth, P uptake, or soil enzymatic activity. Root branching and length were diminished in all acidified treatments, accompanied by a 59% reduction in enzymatic activity and mycorrhizal root colonization remaining below 10% across treatments.ConclusionWhile acidified slurry improved P solubility, gains in plant P uptake and biomass were limited, likely due to inhibitory effects on root development and symbiotic microbial functions, reflecting trade-offs between P availability and plant-soil biological interactions.

AB  - The Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) is an international air quality field study that took place at the US-Canada Border region in the ozone seasons of 2021 and 2022. MOOSE addressed binational air quality issues stemming from lake breeze phenomena and transboundary transport, as well as local emissions in southeast Michigan and southern Ontario. State-of-the-art scientific techniques applied during MOOSE included the use of multiple advanced mobile laboratories equipped with real-time instrumentation; high-resolution meteorological and air quality models at regional, urban, and neighborhood scales; daily real-time meteorological and air quality forecasts; ground-based and airborne remote sensing; instrumented Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); isotopic measurements of reactive nitrogen species; chemical fingerprinting; and fine-scale inverse modeling of emission sources. Major results include characterization of southeast Michigan as VOC-limited for local ozone formation; discovery of significant and unaccounted formaldehyde emissions from industrial sources; quantification of methane emissions from landfills and leaking natural gas pipelines; evaluation of solvent emission impacts on local and regional ozone; characterization of the sources of reactive nitrogen and PM2.5; and improvements to modeling practices for meteorological, receptor, and chemical transport models.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an evergreen woody plant with a high economic value. Guangxi Province is adjacent to the origin center of the tea plant in southern China. It has abundant germplasm resources and is a historically important tea-producing province. However, there is little information about the genetic diver-sity, genetic introgression, and fingerprints of the tea germplasms from Guangxi Province. Here, we con-structed a phylogenetic tree of 126 tea accessions from Guangxi Province using 20 SSR markers. This tree classified these tea accessions into three subgroups containing 19, 47, and 60 members, respectively. High genetic similarity was observed among the three subgroups, and the genetic diversity of the populations was ranked as follows: subgroup 3 > subgroup 2 > subgroup 1. Furthermore, we analyzed the genetic relationships among 168 tea accessions from Guangxi Province and neighboring provinces. The results of the population structure analysis were highly consistent with the clustering results, and genetic introgression was observed. We identified six SSRs as the core marker set, because they could sufficiently distinguish between all 126 tea accessions. The results provide a crucial theoretical basis for utilization and protection of tea germplasms from Province, and will the and of elite tea cultivars.

AB  - The function of biomineralization in plants has been widely discussed. Herbivore defense is generally considered an one important function. This has been demonstrated for, e.g., needle-shaped raphides in combination with toxic contents, widely found in families such as Araceae. For calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals and druses (crystal aggregates), which are abundant in leaves of many eudicotyledons, herbivore deterrence has been suggested in the literature, but there is little direct evidence. We used light microscopy and micro-computer-tomography to illustrate the biominerals in several temperate shrubs and trees and followed their path upon consumption by caterpillars. We show that a range of different caterpillars consume leaves full of crystals and druses without any apparent harm and that the CaOx druses pass through the animals virtually unchanged. Our observations document the ineffectiveness of CaOx for herbivore deterrence. At least specialized insects are capable of overcoming these obstacles.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are posing new threats to soil ecosystems. Organic fertilizers are considered as an emerging con-tributor to MPs accumulation in agricultural soils. However, few studies have focused on the MPs fate in soils under long-term organic fertilizer application. Based on an 11-year field test with wheat-maize cropping rotation, this study investigated the characteristics of MPs in pig manure and cow manure composts, and examined the impact of long-term compost application on soil MPs accumulation, surface morphology, and distribution. The MPs contents in pig manure and cow manure composts were 3547 and 4520 items kg-1, respectively. Microplastics abundances in soils under long-term use of these two composts were 144 to 287 and 140 to 316 items kg-1, respectively, which increased significantly with increasing compost application amount and was substantially higher than that in soils without compost. Accumulated soil MPs sourced from long-term compost application were 1.73 x 108 to 7.22 x 108 items ha-1, accounting for 43.0 %-75.9 % of the total, and the contribution value doubled as the compost appli-cation rate doubled. The proportion of MPs <1 mm in composts (31.0 %) was lower when compared with that in compost-amended soils (43.8 %), and size and abundance reduced with increasing soil depth. Microplastics shapes and polymer types in composts and compost-amended soils were similar and mostly included fragments of polyethyl-ene and polypropylene and fibers of polyethylene terephthalate. Microplastics in compost-amended soils showed com-plicated weathered surface morphologies, and soil mineral colloids were attached. These results demonstrate that compost-derived MPs in soils can be gradually weathered and degraded into smaller particles under long-term com-post application. These findings provide key insights into the pollution level of soil MPs with organic fertilizer appli-cation and serve as a scientific basis for developing MPs mitigation measures in agricultural soils.

AB  - The objectives of this study were: to evaluate the methane yield attainable by co -digestion of pig slurry with thermo-alkaline pre-treated giant reed; to assess the convenience of washing the pre-treated giant reed biomass before anaerobic digestion; to evaluate the composition of the digestate, in the prospect of its possible agronomic use. This study is the first to show a clear advantage in co-digesting potassium hydroxide pre-treated giant reed with pig slurry. In mono-digestion, the maximum methane production per reactor from pre-treated biomass was 263 mL g-1 volatile solids, which was 28% higher than untreated biomass. The co-digestion of pre-treated giant reed biomass with pig slurry increased the volatile solids content by 65% and doubled the methane production per reactor (533 mL); a synergistic effect was also observed (+10%). Washing the biomass after the pre-treatment had a detrimental effect on the overall methane production and also prolonged the anaerobic digestion time both in mono-digestion and in co-digestion. The digestate derived from the pre-treated and unwashed biomass co-digestion has a considerable content of plant nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) and carbon making it promising for agronomic utilization.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although classical biological control makes use of natural enemies from the native range of an invasive alien species, there are occurrences in which species in the invaded range expand their host range and form new associations with the invader. Bagous longulus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a South African native weevil hosted by the native water lilies Nymphaea nouchali Burm. f. and Nymphaea lotus L. (family Nymphaeaceae), and it has formed a new association with the invasive alien water lily Nymphaea mexicana Zuccarini. Host range expansions of more-specialist native herbivores on alien invasive plant species occur relatively infrequently; therefore, we investigated the potential of this weevil as another means of managing N. mexicana in South Africa through augmentative biological control. Field surveys were conducted in 2021 and 2022 to determine the distribution of the weevil, and host-specificity tests were conducted under greenhouse conditions to understand its preference for its natural host as compared with N. mexicana and an exotic Nymphaea hybrid. The weevil was widely distributed at 31 surveyed sites across the country but was found feeding and completing lifecycles on only Nymphaea species, including the native hosts and the alien invasive N. mexicana. Additionally, there were no major differences in feeding preference for its natural host when compared with N. mexicana, but the Nymphaea hybrid tested was less preferred. The narrow host range of this weevil, its presence and impact on N. mexicana at three invaded sites, and the fact that a classical biological control agent has not yet been approved, all suggest a potential for B. longulus to be released augmentatively to manage N. mexicana in South Africa. Even so, possible risks such as increased herbivory on native Nymphaea species with augmented populations of its natural enemy should be carefully considered and tested before implementation.

AB  - Ambient temperature is a main parameter that determines the thriving and propagation of ectothermic insects. It affects egg and larval development as well as adults' survival and successful overwintering. Pyrrhocoris apterus is a herbivorous bug species almost ubiquitous in Eurasia. Its distribution extends from the Atlantic Coast to Siberia, Northwest China and Mongolia. After introduction, it established successfully in the USA, Central America, India and Australia, which indicates a high invasive potential of this species. We determined the climatic conditions in Central Europe in a habitat where P. apterus has been continuously observed for decades. We conducted temperature measurements in the habitat and in the microhabitats where individuals could be found during the year and set them against freely available climate data commonly used to characterize habitat climate. Our temperature measurements were also compared to thermal limits (critical thermal minima and maxima). Although ambient temperatures outside the thermal boundaries of P. apterus can and do occur in the habitat, the bugs thrive and propagate. Microhabitat measurement in winter showed that individuals sought areas with favorable temperatures for hibernation. In particular, these areas are not (always) represented in large-scale climate tables, leading to possible misinterpretation of future patterns of spread of invasive species spread.

AB  - Emotional learning and memory are affected in numerous psychiatric disorders. At a systems level, however, the underlying neural circuitry is not well defined. Rodent fear conditioning (FC) provides a translational model to study the networks underlying associative memory retrieval. In the current study, functional connectivity among regions related to the cue associative fear network were investigated using functional ultrasound (fUS), a novel imaging technique with great potential for detecting neural activity through cerebral blood flow. Behavioral fear expression and fUS imaging were performed one and thirty-one days after FC to assess recent and remote memory recall. Cue-evoked increases in functional connectivity were detected throughout the amygdala, with the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei emerging as major hubs of connectivity, although CeA connectivity was reduced during remote recall. Hippocampal and sensory cortical regions displayed heightened connectivity with the LA during remote recall, whereas interconnectivity between the primary auditory cortex and temporal association areas was reduced. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited variable changes, where prelimbic connectivity with the amygdala was refined while specific connections between the infralimbic cortex and amygdalar subregions emerged during remote memory retrieval, a signature of extinction memory. Moreover, freezing behavior positively correlated with functional connectivity between hubs of the associative fear network, suggesting that emotional response intensity reflected the strength of the cue-evoked functional network. Overall, our data provide evidence of the functionality of fUS imaging to investigate the neural dynamics of memory retrieval, applicable in the development of innovative treatments for affective disorders.

AB  - The Myc family is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism, particularly in embryonic development and stem cell functions. However, the specific role of Myc in porcine early embryonic development is not fully understood. This study observed high Myc expression during the four-cell stage of porcine embryos. Inhibition of Myc using 10058-F4 impaired embryonic development, disrupted energy metabolism, and increased DNA methylation. Mechanistically, these effects were dependent on alpha-KG, a TCA cycle intermediate and cofactor for TET demethylation enzymes. Sequencing analysis of four-cell embryos post-Myc inhibition revealed downregulation of key metabolic enzymes related to alpha-KG, such as CS, IDH2, leading to reduced alpha-KG levels. Supplementation with alpha-Ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) mitigated the negative effects of Myc inhibition, including lower blastocyst rates, decreased ATP levels, and increased 5 mC levels. In conclusion, Myc regulates the expression of key metabolic enzymes during the four-cell stage, influencing early embryonic metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming.

   The aim of this study was to analyze the whole blood transcriptome of lactating goats fed a dietary supplementation with 10% olive leaves, one of the main by-products deriving from the olive oil chain supply. This evaluation was effective in identifying the differential regulation of the gene coding for apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 2 (APOBEC2), which showed downregulated in goats that received the dietary supplementation. Taking into account the strong association between plasma apoB and low-density lipoprotein, an evaluation was performed of both blood and milk cholesterol. The obtained data demonstrated a significant lower concentration of circulating cholesterol and cholesterol released into the milk through the mammary gland, demonstrating positive effects of olive leaves feeding on animal welfare and potential health benefits for consumers.
   Agro-industrial by-products represent an important source of compounds credited with high biotechnological potential. In the last decade, considerable interest has developed toward the use of these matrices as dietary supplements in the zootechnical field, paying particular attention to the qualitative aspects associated with animal products. However, less is known about the effect of these matrices on gene expression and thus on animal metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the whole blood transcriptome of lactating goats fed a dietary supplementation with 10% olive leaves (OL), one of the main by-products deriving from the olive oil chain supply. By applying a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a Log2 Fold change (Log2Fc) lower than -0.5 or higher than +0.5, it was possible to identify the differential regulation of gene coding for the apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 2 (APOBEC2), which showed downregulation in goats that received the dietary supplementation. An evaluation of both blood and milk cholesterol was performed, taking into account the strong association between plasma apoB and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Results showed significantly lower concentrations of circulating cholesterol and cholesterol released into the milk through the mammary gland, demonstrating positive effects of OL feeding on animal welfare and potential health benefits for consumers.

AB  - The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. In order to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced as soon as possible. By signing the Paris Agreement in 2021, Turkiye has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 41% by 2030. The livestock sector, which is an important economic resource, also has a significant share in greenhouse gas emissions in Turkiye. In this study, it was analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from livestock in Izmir, the 3rd largest city of Turkiye. For this purpose, greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint resulting from livestock farming in Izmir were calculated according to the IPCC 2019 Guidelines and Tier 1 methodology. The total carbon footprint of livestock in Izmir was determined as 2826.5 thousand tons CO2eq (ttonCO2eq). These total emissions were calculated as 1492 ttonCO2eq (53%) from enteric fermentation, 1120.5 ttonCO2eq (39%) from CH4 in manure management, and 214 ttonCO2eq (8%) from N2O in manure management. Sustainable method suggestions were also studied in order to achieve Turkiye's greenhouse gas reduction commitment. The results show that a sustainable change in manure management method, such as biogas production from manure, can reduce the carbon footprint by 30%. As a result, sustainable manure management methods, nutrition, and animal welfare should be included in agricultural policies as methods that help reduce Turkiye's greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Thermal homeostasis is one of the principal indexes of animal welfare; the circadian rhythm of body temperature is well established and its disruption or alteration are signals of stress. The present study investigated the daily rhythm of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and clock gene Per2 in Capra hircus to improve the knowledge in this field. Camosciata delle Alpi goats (7 female, 2 years old, 67 +/- 2 kg, clinically healthy), were housed in a stable under natural environmental conditions. Blood sample collections were performed every 4 h for a 48-h period. Serum concentrations of T3, T4, UCP1, and clock gene Per2 were determined. Before the blood sample collection rectal temperature was recorded at all data points. Two-way for repeated measure analysis of variance showed a statistically significant effect of time of day on all studied parameters. T3, T4, Per2, and rectal temperature showed a robust daily rhythm. The acrophases observed in the investigated parameters were statistically different. In particular, T3 acrophase was observed between 20:15 and 21:45; T4 acrophase was between 02:41 and 03:35; Per 2 acrophase was between 7:18 and 08:11; RT acrophase was between 17:45 and 19:55. Per2 expression was correlated with T3 and T4 serum levels, and the rectal temperature values were correlated with T3 and T4 serum levels and Per2 In conclusion, in goats housed in boxes, the rectal temperature daily rhythm was linked to the daily rhythm of thyroid hormones and Per2 clock gene expression in the peripheral blood. In goats not subjected to thermal stress UCP1 did not show a daily fluctuation.

AB  - Simple Summary Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) have gradually become a highly recommended aquaculture mode due to their environmental friendliness. However, due to their high factory and equipment investments and high electricity consumption, they usually require the farming objects to have high economic value in order to cover their high running costs. Seahorses have high economic value and may be suitable for RASs. Currently, there are almost no reports on the large-scale farming of seahorses using RASs. To provide a new farming object for RASs, in the present study, the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) was employed to determine a suitable stocking density in RASs. As is well known, optimizing the stocking density of farmed objects is a prerequisite for their commercial aquaculture. The present study determined suitable stocking densities for lined seahorse juveniles at different growth stages, which will contribute to the development of recirculating aquaculture for the lined seahorse.Abstract Seahorses are increasingly regarded as a promising farming object suitable for recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) due to their high economic value. However, reports on the large-scale farming of seahorses in RASs are rare, and some key parameters, such as stocking densities, are still unclear. In the present study, we employed the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), for which large-scale farming has been achieved, to determine the suitable stocking density for three different-sized juveniles in RASs. The three different-sized juveniles had body heights of 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0 cm, and their test density gradients were 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 inds/L; 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 inds/L; and 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 inds/L, respectively. The juveniles were cultivated for one month, and then their survival, growth, and plasma cortisol and brain serotonin contents (two stress-related indicators) were analyzed. The results show that, regardless of the size of the juveniles, a high density can inhibit growth and trigger stress responses. In addition, for small- (4.0 cm) and medium-sized (7.0 cm) juveniles, a high density can also exacerbate size heterogeneity and cause death. Taking into account the welfare and yield of farmed seahorses, the present study suggests that the suitable stocking densities for 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0 cm juveniles in RASs are 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 inds/L, respectively.

AB  - Stable isotopes of mammoths and mastodons have the potential to illuminate ecological changes in late Pleistocene landscapes and megafaunal populations as these species approached extinction. The ecological factors at play in this extinction remain unresolved, but isotopes of bone collagen (delta C-13, delta N-15) and tooth enamel (delta C-13, delta O-18, Sr-87/Sr-86) from midwestern North America are leveraged to examine ecological and behavioral changes that occurred during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. Both species had significant C3 contributions to their diets and experienced increasing levels of niche overlap as they approached extinction. A subset of mastodons after the last glacial maximum exhibit low delta N-15 values that may represent expansion into a novel ecological niche, perhaps densely occupied by other herbivores. Stable isotopes from serial and microsampled enamel show increasing seasonality and decreasing temperatures as mammoths transitioned from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e to glacial conditions (MIS 4, MIS 3, MIS 2). Isotopic variability in enamel suggests mobility patterns and life histories have potentially large impacts on the interpretation of their stable isotope ecology. This study further refines the ecology of midwestern mammoths and mastodons demonstrating increasing seasonality and niche overlap as they responded to landscape changes in the final millennia before extinction.

AB  - The economic and public health implications of Q fever are significant concerns in developing countries. This disease leads to a notable loss of animal protein and poses health risks to humans. To better understand the complex transmission pathways and develop effective strategies to prevent and control the recent surge in Q fever outbreaks in Ghana's Tropical Grassland zone, we have proposed a mathematical model. This model is based on fundamental biological properties to ensure it accurately reflects the behavior and constraints of the system. Additionally, we have created a 3-D plot to illustrate how sensitive parameters affect the basic reproduction number, R0\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R_0$$\end{document}, providing insights into the epidemiological implications. We identify the conditions needed for both local and global stability of the disease-free and endemic states. The model was expanded to provide optimal control utilizing education/sensitization of susceptible humans, treatment of the infected humans, and treatment of infected livestock. Our simulation results highlight that education/sensitization alone, as an optimal strategy, has the long-term potential to mitigate disease transmission effectively. A significant reduction in human infections was observed when education/sensitization was combined with human treatment. Additionally, the combination of education/sensitization and the treatment of infected livestock resulted in one of the most effective reductions in infection levels across humans and livestock. These findings reinforce the importance of integrating education, treatment, and livestock management to effectively control Q fever transmission.

AB  - Classical biological control of water hyacinth in South Africa has been constrained by cool winter temperatures that limit population growth of the biological control agents, and highly eutrophic waters which enhance plant growth. However, inundative releases of the control agent, Megamelus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), at the Hartbeespoort Dam, South Africa, suggest that water hyacinth can be managed successfully using biological control as a standalone intervention for the first time in the absence of herbicide operations, despite eutrophication and a temperate climate. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to measure the reduction in water hyacinth cover from over 37% to less than 6% over two consecutive years since M. scutellaris was first released on the dam in 2018, while site surveys confirmed a corresponding increase in M. scutellaris population density from fewer than 500 insects/m(2) in October 2019, to more than 6000 insects/m(2) by March 2020. Inundative release strategies are recommended for the control of water hyacinth in South Africa at key stages of its invasion, particularly after winter, and flooding events.

AB  - We studied individual growth, condition factor and relative condition of the shrimp Tozeuma carolinense during dry and rainy season from three seagrass-covered locations at the southern region of Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Biological material was obtained by sieving a superficial sample equivalent to 1.5 m(2). Total length and weight for each individual were measured. The analyzed parameters to compare the population condition were examined by season, pooled data and sex, through the length-weight relationship (W = a*L-b), which was defined by the b slope value and tested for significance with a t-student test (p < 0.05). A total of 412 specimens were identified and arranged within 4 groups: pooled data (DA), males (M), non-ovigerous females (HNO) and ovigerous females (HOV), of which 307 were collected in the rainy season and 105 in the dry season. Most of the analyzed groups of T. carolinense specimens showed allometric growth at both seasons, except for DA during dry season and HNO in the rainy period, which presented isometry. The highest values of condition factor were for HOV (0.628). Relative condition ranged from 0.893 for M in the dry period to 1.26 for HOV during the rainy season.

AB  - Background Sexual selection has driven sexual dimorphism in agonistic behaviour in many species. Agonistic behaviour is fundamentally altered by domestication and captivity, but it is unclear whether ancestral sex differences remain. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sex on agonistic behaviour, fighting ability and contest costs. We studied this in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) where aggression compromises welfare, and sexual dimorphism in aggression has been inconclusively demonstrated. Behaviour and physiology of 827 male and female juvenile pigs were studied during resident-intruder tests and dyadic contests at various ages, while accounting for the relative body weight difference between the opponents. Results Males won in 79% of contests against females, even when at a large weight disadvantage. The effect of sex increased with age, with males having a 138 times higher likelihood of winning than females when 13 weeks old. In dyadic contests, males invested more time in non-damaging agonistic display behaviour and took longer before escalating into damaging aggression. Males showed ritualized display that included foaming from the mouth and piloerection of the neck hair, which was nearly always absent in females. Contest costs in terms of contest duration, blood lactate and skin lesions where higher for males, especially when fighting another male. Conclusions Profound sex differences were present for agonistic behaviour, fighting ability and contest costs, and became more pronounced as animals got older. Males invested more in ritualized display before escalating into costly fights, whereas females attacked sooner but also terminated contests more rapidly and with fewer costs. The sexual dimorphism in agonistic behaviour in juvenile domestic pigs is in line with the evolutionary relevance for females' maternal defence and males' competition for females.

AB  - Fractures related to long bones in female Beetal goats fail to heal or show delayed healing that leads to intensified morbidity. Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) has been suggested as an efficient biological adjuvant for healing long bone fractures. BMA comprises bone mesenchymal stem cells. This study aims to assess the potential of autologous BMA on metacarpal and metatarsal fracture of Beetal goats presented at the surgery clinic of the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan. Beetal goats were selected (n=20), and divided into four different groups. The first group was designated as bone plating with bone marrow aspirate (BPMA) in which fracture was reduced by using the bone plates along with the application of multiple BMA on days: 0, 14, 28, and 45. Furthermore, the second group was designated as bone plating with normal saline (BPNS) in which fracture was reduced by using the bone plates along with the application of normal saline. Additionally, the third group was designated as bone wiring with bone marrow aspirate (BWBM), and the fourth group, was bone wiring with normal saline (BWNS). Both third and fourth groups were treated with bone wiring along with BMA and bone wiring along with NS respectively. The rate of healing post-treatment was assessed by radiographic union score (RUS), weightbearing score (WBS), and serobiochemical evaluations on days: 0, 7, 14, 28, and 45. Our data showed a significant difference in the healing of fractures treated with BMA as compared to NS on days; 7 and 14. Moreover, the RUS, WBS, and serobiochemical profiles of goats treated with BMA showed improved healing of fractures as compared to the goats treated with NS. In summary, we observed that the healing process of the metacarpal and metatarsal fractured bones was reduced by bone plating, and bone wiring was ameliorated with the application of multiple BMA. We proposed further studies on larger cohorts. BMA may be used as supportive therapy to enhance the healing process of fractures in goats.

AB  - As the hybrid between cattle and yak, cattleyak is a typical male sterile mammal, and the underlying mechanism for its spermatogenic arrest is still unclear. In this study, the coding region of cattleyak TAF4B gene was cloned by RT-PCR and analysed by bioinformatics. To investigate the effects of TAF4B on cellular proliferation and differentiation, an expression vector was generated and introduced into undifferentiated spermatogonia (UDSPG) of cattleyak. The results showed that the protein encoded by TAF4B did not contain the signal peptide sequence. The expression level of TAF4B in UDSPG of cattleyak was lower than that in yak, while the overexpression of TAF4B in cattleyak promoted the proliferation activity of cattleyak UDSPG. Meanwhile, the expression of proliferation and meiosis-related genes was increased but the differentiation-related genes were decreased. Therefore, the aberrant expression of TAF4B in cattleyak UDSPG possibly impaired its proliferation and differentiation equilibrium and decreased its growth potentiality, thereby reducing the quantity of UDSPG and affecting spermatogenesis. This study provided a potential approach for further elucidation of the mechanism of spermatogenesis arrest and provided a new idea for solving the problem of male infertility in cattleyak.

AB  - The interference of background noise leads to the extremely high spatial complexity of hyperspectral data. Sensitive band selecting is an important task to minimize or eliminate the influence of non-target elements. In this study, Taylor expansion is innovatively used to identify core wavelengths/bands of hyperspectral data. Unlike other traditional methods, this proposed Taylor-CC method considers more local and global information of spectral function to estimate the linear/nonlinear correlation between two wavelengths. Using samples of hyperspectral data with a wavelength range of 350-2500 nm and SPAD for Camellia oleifera, this Taylor-CC method is compared with the traditional PCC method derived from the Pearson correlation coefficient. Using the 240 samples with their different 57 core wavelengths identified by the Taylor-CC method and PCC method, three machine models (i.e., random forest-RF, linear regression-LR, and artificial neural network-ANN) are trained to compare their performances. Their results show that the correlation matrix from the Taylor-CC method represents a clear diagonal pattern with near zero values at most locations away from the diagonal, and all three models confirm that the Taylor-CC method is superior to the PCC method. Moreover, the SPAD spectral response relationship based on machine learning algorithms is constructed, and ANN is the best prediction performance among the three models when using the core wavelengths identified by the Taylor-CC method. The Taylor-CC method proposed in this study not only lays a mathematical foundation for the next analysis of the response mechanism between spectral characteristics and nutrient content of Camellia leaf, but also provides a new idea for the correlation analysis of adjacent spectral bands for hyperspectral signals in many applications.

AB  - Accurate estimation of sheep feed intake is essential for optimal pasture management and understanding the patterns of grass-livestock ecosystems. Although many studies have been reported, fewer studies have comprehensively considered animal body weight, grass species, and grass moisture content. This study designed a 29test experiment with three classes of sheep weight, two grass species, and three levels of grass moisture content combinations. Segment samples were constructed from each test, and many explanatory variables (44 in total) associated with chewing were extracted from each segment sample. Correlations between each explanatory variable and intake were examined under every test, and the slopes of their regression lines were also recorded. A statistical analysis was then used to reveal the effects of sheep bodyweight class, grass species, and grass moisture content class on the slopes of the explanatory variables. On the test sample set (one test sample corresponding to one test), intake was predicted using a single explanatory variable, all explanatory variables, all explanatory variables and factor variables (sheep weight, grass moisture content, grass NDF content, grass ADF content). The results showed that the chew_ZCTOverLegth variable (number of chewing waveforms over the mean divided by waveform length and then accumulated over all chews) and intake had the strongest correlation with a mean R2 score of 0.8796. The influence of grass moisture content class on the slope of the variable was approximately equal to that of the sheep weight class and less than that of the differences in individual sheep. In the test sample set, the LogMel_power variable (sum of squares of waveform log-Mel) was the best single explanatory variable for predicting intake (when the type of intake is fresh grass matter). Adding factor variables significantly increased the R2 score of the model and reduced the number of variables used. Introducing sheep bodyweight to intake further increased the R2 score of the model and reduced the number of variables used. When the type of intake was FMI_W (fresh matter multiplied by the square of the sheep bodyweight value), intake was accurately estimated using all explanatory and factor variables with an R2 score of 0.9734. This result demonstrates that chewing-derived acoustic variables acoustically can accurately estimate intake despite the complexity of the experimental conditions. This study will make an outstanding contribution to the development of general and accurate models for estimating intake.

AB  - The SPE-HPLC-MS/MS method was used to investigate the concentration distribution of nine types of estrogens in 18 locations of pollution source along the Jiuzhou River belonging to river systems in Guangdong province and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region in China, and the estrogenic activity and potential ecological risks were evaluated by calculating the estradiol equivalency (EEQ). The results showed that the calculated estradiol equivalents (cEEQs) of wastewater treatment plants from 17 locations were all higher than 1 ng/L. To further study the removal effect of the treatment process on the estrogens, the pig breeding wastewater from P4 and the municipal wastewater from P13 as well as the black-odorous water were sampled and surveyed during the entire process. It turned out that estrogens were effectively removed after nitrification activated sludge treatment. Meanwhile, there was a positive correlation between the removal of NH3-N, TN and TP and the removal of EDCs. It is showed in the study the secondary treatment process has achieved a significant effect on the removal of estrogen in both the wet and dry periods and that there has been a positive correlation between the activities of total phosphorus compounds, nitrogen-based compounds and the removal of EDCs.

AB  - The burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming. Using renewable energy sources such as elephant grass biomass mitigates anthropogenic impact on nature. The genetic selection of high-yield elephant grass genotypes is important to increase the use of this forage for energy generation. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been used for data collection and optimization of the selection of genotypes. However, statistical tests should be conducted to study the suitability of vegetation indices for predicting morphological traits. In addition, spatial sources of variation, such as soil structure heterogeneity, can disturb the selection process. This study compared the cor-relation between morphological traits and vegetation indices of elephant grass clones using basic linear mixed and spatial linear mixed models. In addition, we evaluated the magnitude and contribution of each index to explain the variations in traits and identify the best index for this forage. There was significant genetic variability in some morphological traits that enabled selection. Spatial models (autoregressive correlation among rows and columns) were more suitable for modeling some of the evaluated traits. There were changes in the magnitude of the correlation between traits when we considered the best-fit model instead of the non-spatial model. The in-crease in efficiency using the best-fitted model instead of the non-spatial model was 15.39% for heritability and 9.54% for accuracy. The total dry biomass was the only morphological trait significantly correlated with some vegetation indices, allowing for indirect selection. The coincidence index, heritability, and gains from indirect selection indicated that the normalized difference red-edge index was the best for selecting superior elephant grass high-yielding genotypes. The spatial modeling leveraged the genetic selection of high yield elephant grass genotypes for bioenergetic purposes.

AB  - Municipal solid waste landfills are significant sources of atmospheric methane, the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Large emissions of methane from landfills contribute not only to global climate change, but also to local ozone formation due to the enhancement of radical chain lengths in atmospheric reactions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Several advanced techniques were deployed to measure methane emissions from two landfills in the Southeast Michigan ozone nonattainment area during the Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE). These techniques included mobile infrared cavity ringdown spectrometry, drone-mounted meteorological sensors and tunable diode laser spectrometry, estimation of total landfill emissions of methane based on flux plane measurements, and Gaussian plume inverse modeling of distributed methane emissions in the presence of complex landfill terrain. The total methane emissions measured at the two landfills were of the order of 500 kg/h, with an uncertainty of around 50%. The results indicate that both landfill active faces and leaking gas collection systems are important sources of methane emissions.

AB  - Although frogs are predominately opportunistic carnivores, numerous studies report large amounts of plant material in anuran stomachs, citing accidental ingestion as the likely cause. Herein, we present evidence suggesting deliberate plant uptake in the Sabre-toothed Frog (Odontobatrachus ziama) and propose that this trait is specific to the entire family Odontobatrachidae. We performed stomach-flushing on 814 frogs, resulting in 665 dietary samples comprising all 5 Odontobatrachus species and two similar-sized, syntopic frogs, Astylosternus occidentalis and Conraua alleni. We collected dietary samples across the entire range of Odontobatrachus, in both wet and dry season. Additionally, we collected stomach contents of an O. ziama population during a 12-d capture-mark-recapture study in three different river habitats and compared the consumed and available plant material. We found that all Odontobatrachus spp. ingested the pinnate leaf of the riparian tree Parkia bicolor. These leaves were the most abundant food items in the stomachs of three out of the five Odontobatrachus species. Although mean proportional uptake of the leaflets did not differ seasonally, the maximum amount of leaflets was greater during the dry season, coinciding with peak leaflet availability. We found up to 100 single leaflets in stomachs of Odontobatrachus arndti, but syntopic Astylosternus and Conraua had ingested considerably smaller quantities of Parkia leaflets. Lastly, we found a greater prevalence of Parkia leaflets in females, with significant variation in leaflet uptake between stream microhabitats that could not be explained by the availability of the plant material. Consequently, we analyzed the dietary items for co-occurrences of plant material and preyed-upon animals that would support the hypothesis of an accidental uptake. However, we could not find biologically meaningful co-occurrences. Based on the combined results of stomach-flushing, availability of food items, absence of meaningful co-occurrences of plant with animal matter and feeding experiment, we concluded that leaflets were likely swallowed deliberately, but not eaten for energy demands. The reason for the deliberate ingestion of plant material across the genus Odontobatrachus so far remains unresolved.

AB  - Bats are reservoirs for multiple coronaviruses (CoVs). However, the phylogenetic diversity and transmission of global bat-borne CoVs remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis based on 3,594 bat CoV RdRp gene sequences to study the phylogenetic diversity and transmission of bat-borne CoVs and the underlying driving factors. We found that host-switching events occurred more frequently for alpha-CoVs than for beta-CoVs, and the latter was highly constrained by bat phylogeny. Bat species in the families Molossidae, Rhinolophidae, Miniopteridae, and Vespertilionidae had larger contributions to the cross-species transmission of bat CoVs. Regions of eastern and southern Africa, southern South America, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia were more frequently involved in cross-region transmission events of bat CoVs than other regions. Phylogenetic and geographic distances were the most important factors limiting CoV transmission. Bat taxa and global geographic hotspots associated with bat CoV phylogenetic diversity were identified, and bat species richness, mean annual temperature, global agricultural cropland, and human population density were strongly correlated with the phylogenetic diversity of bat CoVs. These findings provide insight into bat CoV evolution and ecological transmission among bat taxa. The identified hotspots of bat CoV evolution and transmission will guide early warnings of bat-borne CoV zoonotic diseases.

AB  - We studied the interactions involving oak acorns and associated arthropods focusing on the role of the introduced Quercus rubra in Italy. We conducted our study in areas where native oaks coexist with Q. rubra. We carried out a survey on the arthropods inhabiting fallen acorns and a colonisation experiment. Furthermore, we conducted laboratory experiments documenting the interactions among the most abundant arthropod species on Q. rubra. Acorns were colonised by ant species and carpophagous insects showing different preferences concerning acorns' position within the leaf litter and oak species. Acorns of Q. rubra were colonised frequently by ants (mostly Temnothorax nylanderi) and Cydia fagiglandana. Cydia splendana preferred native acorns, while Curculio beetles were ubiquitous. Our data suggest that ants occupy exclusively acorns previously attacked by Cydia, killing or displacing their caterpillars if still developing inside the acorns. Vertebrates may prefer to feed on Q. rubra acorns over native species. Quercus rubra has a meaningful influence on native arthropods associated with oak acorns. The ecological consequences of this interaction are still not fully clear, yet our data suggest an increase in acorn-consuming insects, partly affecting the acorns of neighbouring native oaks, but also an increase of predatory ants.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding pregnant sows with diet supplemented with dried grape pomace on hematological parameters of sows and new-born piglets. Sixteen pregnant crossbred sows Large white x Landrace mated with a Duroc boar, were randomly divided to two groups, control (C) and dried grape pomace (DGP) group. During last seven days of pregnancy the sow's diet in DGP group contained 1% of DGP powder. Sows blood samples were taken before intake of diet containing DGP and during first day post partum. Blood of new-born piglets was taken immediately after birth before colostrum intake. All blood samples were analyzed on hematological parameters. After 7 days of treatment with DGP, sows blood showed significant changes in parameters such as total white blood cell count, lymphocytes count, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, but within the reference interval for pigs. Feeding pregnant sows with DGP affected the hematological parameters of the new-born piglets in a negative way. Compared to the C group, the new-born piglets in the DGP group had significantly lower lymphocyte counts, red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin values. Parameters of white and red blood cells are crucial for new-born piglets from an immunological and anemia point of view. Therefore, the addition of DGP during the last week of pregnancy to the sows' diet cannot be recommended.

AB  - IntroductionEpidemiological data show that transgender women are disproportionately affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Data in South Africa on the HIV vulnerabilities of transgender women are sparse. This paper qualitatively explores the structural, personal, and economic factors that contribute to making South African transgender women vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).MethodsWe conducted a rapid qualitative assessment in the Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Buffalo City metropolitan municipalities to frame the HIV risk vulnerabilities of transgender women. Purposive sampling was used to recruit study participants. We conducted 25 key informant interviews, five focus group discussions, and 26 in-depth interviews with transgender women. Atlas.ti.8 was used to facilitate qualitative data analysis.Study findingsThese data illustrate a pervasive theme of social rejection, discrimination, and everyday victimization among transgender women. The ubiquitous presence of stigma and rejection leads to internalized stigmatization, which affects the social and mental well-being of transgender women, who often turn to alcohol and illicit drug use to alleviate negative emotions. We found that transgender women may engage in high-risk sexual activities like sex work where they can express and affirm their gender identity. In this context, transgender women engaging in high-risk sexual activities found it challenging to access pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Stigma also leads to reluctance to use public healthcare services. Despite experiencing stigma and discrimination, qualitative data highlights the resilience of transgender women in the study.ConclusionsQualitative data demonstrate that HIV risk for transgender women is complex. Multi-level community-led interventions grounded in empowerment are also required to address interpersonal, biological, structural, and community risk. Successful interventions should address stigma and draw upon the resilience of transgender women. Peer-driven interventions may motivate personal responsibility to use high-impact HIV prevention and treatment services.

AB  - Children born preterm have an increased likelihood of developing neurobehavioral disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. These disorders have a sex bias, with males having a higher incidence of ADHD, whereas anxiety disorder tends to be more prevalent in females. Both disorders are underpinned by imbalances to key neurotransmitter systems, with dopamine and noradrenaline in particular having major roles in attention regulation and stress modulation. Preterm birth disturbances to neurodevelopment may affect this neurotransmission in a sexually dimorphic manner. Time-mated guinea pig dams were allocated to deliver by preterm induction of labor (gestational age 62 [GA62]) or spontaneously at term (GA69). The resultant offspring were randomized to endpoints as neonates (24 h after term-equivalence age) or juveniles (corrected postnatal day 40, childhood equivalence). Relative mRNA expressions of key dopamine and noradrenaline pathway genes were examined in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and quantified with real-time PCR. Myelin basic protein and neuronal nuclei immunostaining were performed to characterize the impact of preterm birth. Within the frontal cortex, there were persisting reductions in the expression of dopaminergic pathway components that occurred in preterm males only. Conversely, preterm-born females had increased expression of key noradrenergic receptors and a reduction of the noradrenergic transporter within the hippocampus. This study demonstrated that preterm birth results in major changes in dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptor, transporter, and synthesis enzyme gene expression in a sex- and region-based manner that may contribute to the sex differences in susceptibility to neurobehavioral disorders. These findings highlight the need for the development of sex-based treatments for improving these conditions.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have aggregated primary research using meta-analytic methods to understand ecological and evolutionary phenomena. Meta-analyses can resolve long-standing disputes, dispel spurious claims, and generate new research questions. At their worst, however, meta-analysis publications are wolves in sheep's clothing: subjective with biased conclusions, hidden under coats of objective authority. Conclusions can be rendered unreliable by inappropriate statistical methods, problems with the methods used to select primary research, or problems within the primary research itself. Because of these risks, meta-analyses are increasingly conducted as part of systematic reviews, which use structured, transparent, and reproducible methods to collate and summarise evidence. For readers to determine whether the conclusions from a systematic review or meta-analysis should be trusted - and to be able to build upon the review - authors need to report what they did, why they did it, and what they found. Complete, transparent, and reproducible reporting is measured by 'reporting quality'. To assess perceptions and standards of reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in ecology and evolutionary biology, we surveyed 208 researchers with relevant experience (as authors, reviewers, or editors), and conducted detailed evaluations of 102 systematic review and meta-analysis papers published between 2010 and 2019. Reporting quality was far below optimal and approximately normally distributed. Measured reporting quality was lower than what the community perceived, particularly for the systematic review methods required to measure trustworthiness. The minority of assessed papers that referenced a guideline (similar to 16%) showed substantially higher reporting quality than average, and surveyed researchers showed interest in using a reporting guideline to improve reporting quality. The leading guideline for improving reporting quality of systematic reviews is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here we unveil an extension of PRISMA to serve the meta-analysis community in ecology and evolutionary biology: PRISMA-EcoEvo (version 1.0). PRISMA-EcoEvo is a checklist of 27 main items that, when applicable, should be reported in systematic review and meta-analysis publications summarising primary research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In this explanation and elaboration document, we provide guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, with explanations for each item on the checklist, including supplementary examples from published papers. Authors can consult this PRISMA-EcoEvo guideline both in the planning and writing stages of a systematic review and meta-analysis, to increase reporting quality of submitted manuscripts. Reviewers and editors can use the checklist to assess reporting quality in the manuscripts they review. Overall, PRISMA-EcoEvo is a resource for the ecology and evolutionary biology community to facilitate transparent and comprehensively reported systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

AB  - Introduction: The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is a typical sap-feeding insect and an important worldwide pest. There is a primary symbiont-Buchnera aphidicola, which can synthesize and provide some essential nutrients for its host. At the same time, the hosts also can actively adjust the density of bacterial symbiosis to cope with the changes in environmental and physiological factors. However, it is still unclear how symbionts mediate the interaction between herbivorous insects' nutrient metabolism and host plants.Methods: The current study has studied the effects of different host plants on the biological characteristics, Buchnera titer, and nutritional metabolism of pea aphids. This study investigated the influence of different host plants on biological characteristics, Buchnera titer, and nutritional metabolism of pea aphids.Results and discussion: The titer of Buchnera was significantly higher on T. Pretense and M. officinalis, and the relative expression levels were 1.966 +/- 0.104 and 1.621 +/- 0.167, respectively. The content of soluble sugar (53.46 +/- 1.97 mu g/mg), glycogen (1.12 +/- 0.07 mu g/mg) and total energy (1341.51 +/- 39.37 mu g/mg) of the pea aphid on V. faba were significantly higher and showed high fecundity (143.86 +/- 11.31) and weight (10.46 +/- 0.77 mu g/mg). The content of total lipids was higher on P. sativum and T. pretense, which were 2.82 +/- 0.03 mu g/mg and 2.92 +/- 0.07 mu g/mg, respectively. Correlation analysis found that the difference in Buchnera titer was positively correlated with the protein content in M. officinalis and the content of total energy in T. pratense (P < 0.05). This study confirmed that host plants not only affected the biological characteristics and nutritional metabolism of pea aphids but also regulated the symbiotic density, thus interfering with the nutritional function of Buchnera. The results can provide a theoretical basis for further studies on the influence of different host plants on the development of pea aphids and other insects.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of inoculating thermophilic and mature composts on maturity, gaseous emissions, and bacterial communities during the co-composting of kitchen waste and pig manure. Results showed that the temperature peaked on day 4 of the inoculation compost amendment, which was earlier than the control treatment on day 8. In particular, the GI of the inoculated thermophilic compost was higher (88.65%) than that of other treatments (GI <= 61%) on day 35. The addition of the thermophilic compost promoted the enrichment of Bacillus and Planifilum, accelerated organic matter degradation, and enhanced maturity. Inoculation with mature compost reduced CH4 emissions by 50.66%, owing to the enrichment of methaneoxidizing bacteria (norank_f_Methylococcaceae). Furthermore, the mature compost decreased NH3 emissions by 36.16% through physical absorption and microbial activity (reducing NH4+ production). Inoculation with compost amendment increased N2O emissions owing to the enhanced denitrification of the nitrate reduction function. Overall, thermophilic compost addition enhanced the composting process and improved maturity, whereas mature compost addition was more effective in reducing gaseous emissions during the co-composting of kitchen waste and pig manure.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems experience abrupt abiotic changes that represent environmental filters for many organisms, shaping their phenotypic expressions. However, little is known about the morphological and symmetric adjustments of native bees along altitudinal gradients. We evaluated the changes on wing morphology, wing size, and vein fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier (Apidae: Euglossini) associated with climatic variables along an altitudinal gradient in the rupestrian grassland (known also as campo rupestre or rupestrian field) of Serra do Cipo, Brazil. Seven sampling points along the altitudinal gradient were selected and distributed among 800 and 1400 m.a.s.l., and then, 40 individuals of E. nigrita were collected per each altitudinal point to determine the FA levels and the morphological changes using geometric morphometric techniques. We found that the wing size of E. nigrita decreased with increasing altitude. At the highest altitudes, the levels of FA of the wing veins were greater compared to bees from lower altitudes. We detected significant changes in wing morphology along the altitudinal gradient; bees of lower altitudes showed longer and wider wings than bees of higher altitudes, which had narrower and less elongated wings. Our results show a set of morphological adjustments and phenotypic expressions in E. nigrita associated with the variation in environmental conditions along the altitudinal gradient. We highlight the importance of environmental variables as insect-stressor factors, and that FA and geometric morphometric can be excellent tools for monitoring and evaluating environmental stresses.

AB  - High-altitude environments dramatically influenced the genetic evolution of vertebrates. However, little is known about the role of RNA editing on high-altitude adaptation in non-model species. Here, we profiled the RNA editing sites (RESs) of heart, lung, kidney, and longissimus dorsi muscle from Tibetan cashmere goats (TBG, 4500 m) and Inner Mongolia cashmere goats (IMG, 1200 m) to reveal RNA editing-related functions of high-altitude adaptation in goats. We identified 84,132 high-quality RESs that were unevenly distributed across the autosomes in TBG and IMG, and more than half of the 10,842 non-redundant editing sites were clustered. The majority (62.61%) were adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) sites, followed by cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) sites (19.26%), and 32.5% of them had a significant correlation with the expression of catalytic genes. Moreover, A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing sites had different flanking sequences, amino acid mutations, and alternative splicing activity. TBG had higher editing levels of A-to-I and C-to-U than IMG in the kidney, whereas a lower level was found in the longissimus dorsi muscle. Furthermore, we identified 29 IMG and 41 TBG population-specific editing sites (pSESs) and 53 population-differential editing sites (pDESs) that were functionally involved in altering RNA splicing or recoding protein products. It is worth noting that 73.3% population-differential, 73.2% TBG-specific, and 80% IMG-specific A-to-I sites were nonsynonymous sites. Moreover, the pSESs and pDESs editing-related genes play critical functions in energy metabolisms such as ATP binding molecular function, translation, and adaptive immune response, which may be linked to goat high-altitude adaptation. Our results provide valuable information for understanding the adaptive evolution of goats and studying plateau-related diseases.

AB  - In 1983, a five-page article was published in The Florida Anthropologist which reported on a submerged mammoth kill site in the Silver River near Ocala, Florida. This claim was supported by evidence consisting of a projectile point, six direct percussion flakes, and "numerous" pressure flakes found in situ with the remains of three Columbian Mammoths. In addition, three of the mammoth bones exhibited what were interpreted as cut-marks. The Guest Mammoth site was the first professional archaeological investigation on an underwater precontact site in the Americas. At the time of discovery, no locality east of the Mississippi River had yielded convincing evidence of human and megafauna interaction. For these reasons and others, the Guest Mammoth site fell into archaeological limbo. The author directed geoarchaeological investigations at the Guest Mammoth site from 2014 to 2019 to assess the standing hypothesis that the site is an intact Late Pleistocene archaeological locality. This paper evaluates the results of the original site excavations and contributes new geoarchaeological data to determine the Guest Mammoth's place in the North American archaeological record. The data presented here do not support the conclusion that the Guest Mammoth site is an unequivocal Late Pleistocene archaeological locality because the mammoth bone and artifact bearing component is not stratigraphically secure and has limited chronological control. However, the presence of datable Late Pleistocene strata and faunal material along with non-diagnostic artifacts indicate that the Silver River is worthy of further geoarchaeological inquiry for Late Pleistocene archaeological sites.

AB  - The presented trial carried out at the District Baqubah, Diyala Governorate, Iraq, assessed the effects of three planting dates (15 October, 05, and 25 November 2018) and four levels of organic fertilizer (0, 150, 250, and 350 kg ha-1) on the seed yield and chemical composition of the goat pea (Securigera securidaca L.). The experiment in a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement had three replications. The results showed that the 15 October planting was significantly superior in the percentage and yield of oil and the total content of phenols and glycosides, which amounted to 3.86%, 14.17 kg ha-1, 1.23 mg g-1, and 29.44 mg g-1, respectively. The organic fertilizer treatment, 350 kg ha-1, proved superior and provided the highest oil yield (14.48 kg ha-1), while organic fertilizer, 250 kg ha-1, was higher in the oil content (3.90%) and phenols (1.21 mg g-1). The interaction between 15 October planting and organic fertilizer, 250 kg ha-1, revealed a significant increase in oil percentage and the total content of phenols and glycosides, which amounted to 4.01%, 1.24 mg g-1, and 29.68 mg g-1, respectively. However, the interaction of the 15 October planting with organic fertilizer, 350 kg ha-1, was superior in the oil yield (15.23 kg ha-1).

AB  - Plants are important ecological factors and food resources, which can significantly affect the occurrence and distribution of insects. The metabolites in host plants can affect the feeding, spawning, and avoidance behaviors of herbivorous insects. Galeruca daurica (Joannis) is a phytophagous pest that has seriously occurred in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia in recent years, only infesting the leaves of Allium plants. In order to clarify the effects of plant metabolites on the gene expression in G. daurica larvae at the transcriptome level, we fed the larvae of G. daurica with Allium tuberosum leaves soaked in 10% DMSO solutions containing d-galactose, beta-d-glucopyranose, l-rhamnose, isoquercitrin, isoflavone, and rutin, respectively, used the larvae fed on A. tuberosum leaves soaked in a 10% DMSO solution as the control, and screened out the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by performing high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that a total of 291 DEGs were identified compared to the solvent control (DMSO), including 130, 34, 29, 21, 72, and 97 in the isoquercitrin, isoflavone, rutin, d-galactose, beta-d-glucopyranose, and l-rhamnose treatment groups, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that most DEGs were enriched in various metabolic pathways, implying that these six main primary and secondary metabolites in Allium plants may affect various metabolic processes in the larvae of G. daurica.

AB  - Although diurnality is widespread across Lepidoptera and has evolved many times independently, its causes and ecological implications are yet poorly understood. The "Salient Aroma Hypothesis" (SAH) postulates that diurnal insect herbivores are overall more specialized in dietary breadth than species active at night. It is furthermore assumed that diurnality evolved more frequently in species that live in cooler environments. Using European geometrid moths as a model group, we tested whether diurnal activity in adults is associated with an increased larval dietary breadth as predicted by the SAH. We further investigated whether species that exclusively occur in colder regions or whose flight period is restricted to cool seasons are more likely to exhibit a diurnal flight activity. Contrary to expectation, we found no consistent differences in larval dietary breadth between diurnal and nocturnal species, and thus no support for the SAH. Diurnal activity occurred more frequently in species restricted to cold regions but not in species restricted to cool seasons. We conclude that diurnality could serve as an advantageous adaptation in cold environments, depending on further factors such as resource availability or predation pressure, but has no immediate consequences for larval dietary breadth.

AB  - Comprehension of the benefits involved in mutualisms is crucial to disentangle the role of interactions in the structure and functioning of populations, communities and ecosystems. In ant-plant mutualisms, benefits provided by plants to ants are immediately recognizable, but reverse benefits are less obvious, conditional and accumulate over longer time spans. Here we tested the hypothesis that the ant Azteca muelleri simultaneously provides multiple benefits to its host plant (Cecropia glazio-vii), ultimately increasing plant performance. We planted seedlings and experimentally prevented ant colonization for half of them. Over 4.5 years we quantified the effects of ant presence or absence on plant growth, herbivory levels, fungal infection, fertilization via ant debris and changes in defense strategies. Ant colonization increased plant height by 125% compared to ant-free plants. Such an improvement in plant performance can be explained because plants with ants faced less herbivory, lower prevalence of pathogenic fungi, invested less in foliar trichomes and had more foliar nitrogen. We thus confirmed that ant mutu-alists provide cumulative benefits including nutritional benefits, effective defense and lower investment into other defenses -which result in increased plant growth. We highlight the importance of long-term experiments that simultaneously evaluate a multiplicity of potential ant effects to better understand their relative contribution to the performance of the mutualistic partner.

AB  - Large industrial pig farms are a source of biological contamination of arable lands located in the immediate vicinity of these enterprises, as a result of the introduction of large volumes of liquid fraction of manure effluents. Utilization of these biogenic wastes is a serious economic and environmental problem for the agro-industrial complex. The work is devoted to the study of the influence of the liquid fraction of pig farm manure effluents on the sanitary condition of arable land according to agrochemical and microbiological studies of soil samples. The study revealed that the regular introduction of pig manure into arable land (for 5 years) led to a significant increase in the content of mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium; there was a pronounced tendency to the accumulation of copper and zinc in the arable horizon of the soil, in addition, high values of the total microbial number, the index of bacteria of the group Escherichia coli, Enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella, including pathogenic and thermophilic bacteria, were found in significant quantities. In addition, pig manure effluents are potential sources of ingress into the soil of agricultural land, as well as adjacent territories with saprophytic microorganisms, as well as bacteria of the group E. coli, C. perfringens, Proteus spp., Clostridium spp., Salmonella enteritidis, fungi Alternaria alternate, Botrytia cinerea, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Insufficient attention to environmental monitoring of territories adjacent to livestock enterprises can lead to chemical and biological pollution of the environment by a wide range of pollutants present in manure runoff, and the intensification of the development of the industrial pig industry will accelerate this process.

AB  - Triatomines of the species Triatoma sherlocki are considered sylvatic; however, household invasion appears imminent, potentially carrying Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to report the first occurrence of a colony of T. sherlocki infected by T. cruzi in a subsistence pig farm. Triatomines collected underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for T. cruzi detection and determination of blood meal source. The 19 triatomines collected in the pig farm were of the species T. sherlocki, comprising 26.3% nymphs (5/19), 52.6% males (10/19) and 21.1% females (4/19). PCR showed that 15.8% (3/19) of triatomines were infected by T. cruzi. The only detected blood meal source in triatomines (n = 11) was the domestic mammal Sus scrofa, commonly known as domestic pig, indicating that T. sherlocki is an opportunist, feeding on available vertebrates in the environment, including domestic animals such as pigs. These results highlight the possibility of domiciliation of the species T. sherlocki and its potential role in bridging the transmission of T. cruzi between sylvatic and domestic environments.

AB  - During container nursery production of Purshia tridentata (antelope bitterbrush), we found that three fall fertilization applications successfully loaded plants with nitrogen (N) with little effect on plant biomass. Using N-15-labeled fertilizer to track N movements, we observed that N-loaded seedlings attained luxury consumption and ultimately translocated more N toward roots. In trees, such N-loading efforts have been reported to increase seedling survival and growth after outplanting by improving initial root growth. This leads to enhanced access to water and nutrients that increases overall plant competitiveness and performance. Our results add, in general, to the paucity of information concerning fall fertilization of shrubs, and specifically that this technique offers promise to enhance the quality of antelope bitterbrush seedlings. This could improve overall planting success of this important shrub native to western United States rangelands. Increasing the effectiveness of planting antelope bitterbrush, which can often improve restoration trajectories more than direct seeding or reliance on natural regeneration of this species, could accelerate the pace and scope of critical habitat restoration. Restoration is needed as antelope bitterbrush abundance has been reduced across the landscape because of conversion to agriculture, invasion by nonnative annual grasses, and an increase in fire frequency and intensity, among other reasons. In addition, this species provides browse for ungulates and critical habitat for at-risk species, such as Centrocercus urophasianus (greater sage-grouse). Although N loading antelope bitterbrush has potential to improve outplanting performance, the resulting higher nutrient status of this preferred browse species may lead to elevated browsing during seedling establishment.

The findings revealed that all three antimicrobial peptides markedly inhibited the spore germination and mycelial growth of P. digitatum, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 3.12 mu M for BP15, HBP15, and LBP15. The peptides induced morphological alterations in hyphae and elevated intracellular Sytox Green (SG) fluorescence signals, which is indicative of increased cell membrane permeability and disruption. This membrane damage was further supported by the heightened extracellular conductivity and the release of intracellular nucleic acid and protein. A gel retardation assay demonstrated that the peptides showed significant DNA binding and retardation effects. Furthermore, the peptides exhibited significantly lower hemolytic activity (p < 0.05) compared to commercial prochloraz in normal mammalian erythrocytes (sheep erythrocytes) at the tested concentrations. Therefore, BP15 and its lipopeptides, HBP15 and LBP15, show potential as effective agents for preventing green mold in citrus fruits.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology is an emerging technology for the disposal of manure-based wet wastes. However, the effects of manure-derived hydrochar inputs to agricultural soils on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) morphology and conversion in soil-water systems remain largely unexplored. In this study, pig and cattle manure (PM and CM), and their derived hydrochar (PCs and CCs) were applied to agricultural soils, with changes in nutrient morphology and enzyme activities related to N and P transformation in the soil-water systems observed through flooded incubation experiments. The results showed that floodwater ammonia N concentrations were reduced by 12.9-29.6% for PCs relative to PM, and 21.6-36.9% for CCs relative to CM, respectively. Moreover, floodwater total P concentrations of PCs and CCs were reduced by 11.7-20.7% relative to PM and CM. Soil enzyme activities closely related to N and P transformations in the soil-water system responded differently to manure and manure-derived hydrochar application. Compared to manure, the application of manure-derived hydrochar inhibited soil urease and acid phosphatase activity by up to 59.4% and 20.3%, respectively, whereas it had significant promotion effects on soil nitrate reductase (-69.7%) and soil nitrite reductase (-64.0%). The products of manure after HTC treatments have the characteristics of organic fertilizers, and the fertilization effects of PCs are more prominent than CCs, which are subject to further verification in field trials. Our findings improve the current understanding of manure-derived organic matter affecting N and P conversions in soil-water systems and the risk for non-point source pollution.

AB  - Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were sampled from three sites within the Lake Erie drainage (Elk Creek, Twentymile Creek, and Misery Bay, an embayment in Presque Isle Bay). Plasma, tissues for histopathological analyses, and liver and testes preserved in RNALater (R) were sampled from 30 smallmouth bass (of both sexes) at each site. Liver and testes samples were analyzed for transcript abundance with Nanostring nCounter (R) technology. Evidence of estrogenic endocrine disruption was assessed by the presence and severity of intersex (testicular oocytes; TO) and concentrations of plasma vitellogenin in male fish. Abundance of 17 liver transcripts associated with reproductive function, endocrine activity, and contaminant detoxification pathways and 40 testes transcripts associated with male and female reproductive function, germ cell development, and steroid biosynthesis were also measured. Males with a high rate of TO (87-100%) and plasma vitellogenin were noted at all sites; however, TO severity was greatest at the site with the highest agricultural land cover. Numerous transcripts were differentially regulated among the sites and patterns of transcript abundance were used to better understand potential risk factors for estrogenic endocrine disruption. The results of this study suggest endocrine disruption is prevalent in this region and further research would benefit to identify the types of contaminants that may be associated with the observed biological effects.

AB  - The functions of non-agricultural crops unearthed from archaeological sites mainly pertain to their usage as livestock feed. However, the studies of livestock feed have predominantly relied on qualitative analysis, which often lacks descriptive objectivity and relies heavily on subjective feelings and experiences. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by focusing on quantitative analysis, utilizing macro-plant remains from the data of seventy-five archaeological settlements and one archaeological investigation in northern China spanning the Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, as well as stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen. This research delves into various aspects, including the exploration of the plant resources and livestock farming and the categorization of feed types for cattle and pigs in captivity. By employing quantitative analysis, we can gain a more comprehensive and objective understanding of these subjects. This approach aligns with studies on ancient livestock management and feed diversity. In essence, the discussion of civilization development and social changes during the Pre-Qin period holds significant value when considering forage analysis, just as crop analysis has proven insightful. By focusing on the quantitative analysis of non-agricultural crops and their role as livestock feed, we can shed light on important aspects of ancient societies and their agricultural practices.

AB  - Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is an emerging disease responsible for high production losses in the dairy animals. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of BoHV-1 in and associated risk factors with disease prevalence in various agro-ecological zones of Pakistan focusing on the Punjab Province. A total of 400 samples were randomly collected from cattle and buffalo of wheat rice Punjab, mixed Punjab, cotton/wheat Punjab, Low intensity Punjab and Rain-fed Punjab zones. The study revealed individual seroprevalence of BoHV-1 49.5% in cattle and 51.5% in buffalo. Over all prevalence in five zones of Punjab was observed as 25% in mixed Punjab to 71.25% in Rain-fed Punjab. The BoHV-1 seropositivity ranged from 30 -60% in cattle and 20-75% in buffaloes. Age, breeds of animals and milking status were not found to be potential risk factors for the disease. Logistic regression demonstrated that herd size (>thirty), parity (>2) and abortion history are potential risk factors associated with seroconversion of BoHV-1.

AB  - The frequent occurrence of pig aggressive behaviors in intensive group-housed environment seriously affects pig health, welfare and farms economy. Accurate detection of the occurring and temporal interval of aggressive behaviors is important for pig farming. The study aimed to develop an automatic temporal aggressive behavior detection method based on deep neural network. This network mainly consists of three modules, i.e., aggression feature extraction, adaptive dual-modality fusion and aggression temporal proposal generation. First, RGB data and optical flow data was used to extract the spatial and motion information of pig aggressive behaviors. Second, a modality attention and a temporal attention were specifically designed to adaptively fuse features of different modalities. Third, an anchor-free aggression temporal proposal generation strategy was applied to generate aggression proposals, which indicate the start and end times of aggressive behavior. To evaluate the proposed method, a behavior dataset containing 216 videos and 642 annotations was constructed. On the test set, this method achieves an AP value of 68.0 %, an AR value of 77.8 % in average number of proposals at 100. To test this method in practical application, our method was conducted on an additional 90 min untrimmed surveillance video and effectively predicted the real aggression instances. The results demonstrated that it can meet the practical needs of intelligent monitoring in pig farming and analysis in animal behavior research. We shared our temporal aggressive behavior detection dataset at https://github.com/IPCLab-NEAU/Temporal-Aggressive-Beh avior-Detection for precision livestock farming research community.

AB  - The life histories of insect herbivores are affected by variation in host plant quality, with poor quality typically being associated with reduced herbivore fecundity, size and longevity. Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in nature and can alter host plant quality as experienced by insect herbivores. We asked how host plant infection by the widespread and economically important fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea affected the life history traits of two aphid species. We found that the life history traits of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae were negatively affected by being reared on infected host plants, showing reduced fecundity, population growth rate, size, off-plant survival time and development rate. In contrast, we found that pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum benefitted from being reared on infected plants, and that the degree of benefit varied between pea aphid clonal lines. This work suggests that the ecological and economic consequences of plant pathogen infection on the dynamics of aphid pests could be difficult to predict.

AB  - The environmentally friendly and competitive mining practices for refining nickel sulfate hexahydrate are paramount to the energy transition. This research leverages a process-based life cycle assessment tool to investigate the carbon footprint of manufacturing battery-grade nickel sulfate hexahydrate from six pathways: hydrometallurgical (i) intermediate mixed sulfide precipitate in Brazil, (ii) mixed hydroxide precipitate in Australia, (iii) direct nickel process in Australia, pyrometallurgical (iv) nickel pig iron in Indonesia, (v) pure class 1 nickel metal in Canada, and (vi) the caron method for producing basic nickel carbonate in Cuba. The results indicate that the lowest carbon footprint was from the Canada-Norway mining and pyrometallurgical pathway, which produced 6.72 kg CO2eq per kg of nickel sulfate hexahydrate. Notably, the Direct Nickel process in Australia generated 5.01 kg CO2eq. per kg of the product without considering process electricity. Consequently, the study employs network analysis metrics from inventories' CO2-eq emissions to highlight process materials vulnerabilities. Significant reductions in climate change, acidification, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, and ozone depletion are achievable by adopting renewable energy sources for processing and refining, aligning with low- carbon, responsible production, and clean energy development goals. Our hotspot analysis identifies energy consumption in Indonesia's Rotary Kiln-Electric-Furnace nickel pig iron and nickel sulfate production process as a critical factor, with electricity from coal significantly contributing to GWP. This study suggests that transitioning to 50 % hydropower energy could reduce GWP from 86.4 to 45 kg CO2eq per kg of nickel sulfate product, leading to decarbonization.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems are intensifying, highlighting the need to bridge knowledge gaps for species at risk. Data deficiencies, particularly for species recovering from historic declines, such as marine megafauna like whales, hinder effective management. Understanding long-term population viability and identifying any sex-biased threats is important for cetacean conservation. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are well-studied in the Northeast Pacific, making them ideal for optimizing noninvasive environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques for sex determination. We collected eDNA flukeprint samples from killer whales (n = 67) and humpback whales (n = 18), analyzing ZFX/ZFY gene amplification using conventional PCR to compare results against known sexes. Samples from killer whales exhibited higher ZFX/ZFY PCR amplification success (53%) compared with humpback whales (44%). However, the close social structure of this species likely contributed to only 54% of samples matching the known sex of whales sampled. Conversely, humpback whale samples accurately matched the known sexes of individuals (100%). These findings demonstrate eDNA's potential to replace more invasive biopsies for sex determination but highlight the need for further optimization regarding sampling protocols and species-specific ZFX/ZFY amplification approaches. Additionally, eDNA flukeprint sampling also shows promise for other solitary cetaceans such as large rorquals (Balaenoptera spp.), which remain among the most data-deficient species.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM2.5) in pig houses and the microorganisms in PM2.5 restrict the sustainable development of the pig industry and have a negative influence on environmental sustainability. This study aimed to investigate the morphological characteristics and diel microbial composition of PM2.5 in fattening pig sheds and explore how changes in the diel microbial composition of PM2.5 correlate with environmental factors and sources. To this end, environmental data from a fattening pig house were monitored, and PM2.5, feed, and faecal particles were examined using electron microscopy. Additionally, the bacterial and fungal assemblages contained in PM2.5 were analysed using 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. The results showed that NH3, CO2, temperature, and relative humidity were significantly higher at night than during the day. PM2.5 particles from the fattening pig house exhibited different morphologies such as spherical, flocculent, and chain structures. The microbial diversity and bacterial assemblage showed significant variations, which were related to diel environmental factors in the fattening house. In addition, faeces may be the main source of airborne bacteria and feed may be the main source of airborne fungi in fattening houses. These findings provide a scientific basis for exploring the potential risks of the morphological characteristics of PM2.5 and its microbial composition to human and animal health. Additionally, they contribute to the sustainable development of the pig industry and the protection of the environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Supplementation of exogenous enzymes in a diet, particularly protease as a part of an enzyme mixture, is widely used with the expectation that it will enhance the efficiency of nutrient utilization by neutralizing anti-nutritional factors and increasing nutrient digestibility and, thereby, improving growth performance. In our study, dietary supplementation of exogenous enzymes derived from invertebrate symbiotic bacteria affected the growth performance, meat quality, and gut microbiota of pigs. The results of this study suggest that applying exogenous enzymes derived from invertebrate symbiotic bacteria enhances animal performance and can be used as a theoretical basis for further studies. The supplementation of pig diets with exogenous enzymes is widely used with the expectation that it will improve the efficiency of nutrient utilization, thereby, improving growth performance. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a 0.1% (v/v) multi-enzyme (a mixture of arazyme (2,500,000 Unit/kg), xylanase (200,000 Unit/kg) and mannanase (200,000 Unit/kg)) supplementation derived from invertebrate symbiotic bacteria on pig performance. Here, 256 growing pigs were assigned to control and treatment groups, respectively. The treatment group exhibited a significantly reduced average slaughter age; the final body weight and average daily gain increased compared with that of the control group. In the treatment group, the longissimus muscle showed a remarkable decrease in cooking loss, shear force, and color values with increased essential and non-essential amino acid concentrations. Furthermore, the concentrations of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment group increased. Feed additive supplementation increased the family of Ruminococcaceae and genera Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Turicibacter, and Oscillibacter, which play a positive role in the host physiology and health. Predicted metabolic pathway analysis confirmed that operational taxonomic units and predicted amino acid biosynthesis pathways were strongly associated. The results suggest that applying exogenous enzymes derived from invertebrate symbiotic bacteria enhances animal performance.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of intramammary infection (IMI) on N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) enzyme values and to study its predictive capacity using different algorithms. To do this, 26 sheep free of intramammary infection were selected, and their somatic cell count (SCC), NAGase and bacteriological culture were monitored for 2 weeks. They were then subjected to a series of unhealthy situations (UHS) for the mammary gland, and these variables were monitored for a further 4 weeks. IMI was established in 12 of the 26 sheep. In the 4 days following infection, a very marked increase in enzyme values was observed in the infected glands. The algorithm that obtained the best result was the one that detected, in at least two of the first four days after infection, an increase in NAGase values greater than 30% compared to the average of the 3 days prior to infection, obtaining an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, an accuracy of 89.8%, a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 85.7%.

AB  - Understanding the impact of vaccination in a host population is essential to control infectious diseases. However, the impact of bait vaccination against wildlife diseases is difficult to evaluate. The vaccination history of host animals is generally not observable in wildlife, and it is difficult to distinguish immunity by vaccination from that caused by disease infection. For these reasons, the impact of bait vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar inhabiting Japan has not been evaluated accurately. In this study, we aimed to estimate the impact of the bait vaccination campaign by modelling the dynamics of CSF and the vaccination process among a Japanese wild boar population. The model was designed to estimate the impact of bait vaccination despite lack of data regarding the demography and movement of wild boar. Using our model, we solved the theoretical relationship between the impact of vaccination, the time-series change in the proportion of infected wild boar, and that of immunised wild boar. Using this derived relationship, the increase in antibody prevalence against CSF because of vaccine campaigns in 2019 was estimated to be 12.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 7.8-16.5). Referring to previous reports on the basic reproduction number (R-0) of CSF in wild boar living outside Japan, the amount of vaccine distribution required for CSF elimination by reducing the effective reproduction number under unity was also estimated. An approximate 1.6 (when R-0 = 1.5, target vaccination coverage is 33.3% of total population) to 2.9 (when R-0 = 2.5, target vaccination coverage is 60.0% of total population) times larger amount of vaccine distribution would be required than the total amount of vaccine distribution in four vaccination campaigns in 2019.
   Author summary
   Vaccination of wildlife is important to control infectious diseases in animals. However, the impact of common vaccination of wildlife, bait vaccination, is difficult to evaluate owing to difficulty in obtaining the vaccination history at the individual level. Mathematical modelling can estimate the impact of vaccination; however, the demography and movement of hosts are required to describe disease dynamics. In this study, we aimed to estimate the impact of bait vaccination by modelling the dynamics of classical swine fever (CSF) and the vaccination among Japanese wild boar. The model was designed to estimate the impact of bait vaccination despite lack of data regarding the demography and movement of wild boar. Using our model, the increase in antibody prevalence because of vaccination in 2019 was estimated to be 12 percentage points. Furthermore, we estimated the amount of vaccine distribution required for CSF elimination by reducing the effective reproduction number under unity. Referring to previous reports on the basic reproduction number of CSF in wild boar living outside Japan, it was estimated that an approximate 1.6 to 2.9 times larger amount of vaccine distribution would be required than the total amount of vaccine distribution in four vaccination campaigns in 2019.

AB  - Environmental stress can induce changes in organismal traits and in resulting intraspecific variation. The nature of such effects will depend on the plasticity of trait expression and on any ecological constraints to such expression. Plants can mitigate abiotic stress, like drought, by changing their chemistry, but the ability to induce costly metabolites may be under strong local selection and ecologically constrained. Here, we asked whether climate at the seed source predicts plant chemical plasticity in response to water stress and what the consequences are for intraspecific variation in phytochemical traits. To this end, we used common gardens of two widespread species of western milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis and Asclepias speciosa) that had been collected from sites across an aridity gradient. Both species produce high concentrations of leaf flavonols, which are hypothesized to mitigate water stress by functioning as antioxidants. These compounds were found in higher constitutive concentrations in plants sourced from drier sites, and both species responded to water stress in the common garden by increasing leaf flavonol concentrations. Interestingly, flavonol plasticity was higher in plants sourced from wetter sites in A. fascicularis, with similar, but weaker, patterns in A. speciosa. These opposing patterns in constitutive and induced flavonol expression reduced the variation between populations in leaf flavonol concentrations under water stress. These results suggest that local adaptation in plants can shape phytochemical strategies for water limitation but that the cost of metabolite production may ultimately limit the range of phytochemical variation.

AB  - The ruminant alimentary tract and its effects on blood homeostasis complicate prolonged terminal studies conducted under general anesthesia in sheep. We therefore studied 15 healthy female white alpine sheep that were undergoing pro-longed anesthesia (> 30 h) for an unrelated terminal study. In the current study, all sheep developed a decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration after induction of anesthesia, which fell further, along with a significant decrease in white blood cell count, over the course of anesthesia. Sheep also showed an initial hyponatremia, a persistent hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and a progressive hyperchloremia. A significant drop in blood pH developed over time despite normal values of blood lactate and a marked decline in partial pressure of carbon dioxide over the course of the experiment. The latter consequently reduced the efficacy of mechanical ventilation, as reflected in a reduced oxygen partial pressure. A significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase was observed. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased over time, but remained within normotensive and normocardic limits. Central venous pressure rose significantly over the course of anesthesia. In conclusion, prolonged anesthesia in sheep is associated with a wide range of complex physiologic changes. An in-depth understanding of all metabolic compensatory mechanisms and their underlying cause during prolonged anesthesia is necessary for interpreting data from the primary study, with special considerations to account for ruminant-specific physiology.

AB  - Simple Summary: Tail injuries in pigs are a significant welfare concern in global pig husbandry. These injuries, often caused by tail biting, are influenced by several factors including feeder design, space allowances, and overall husbandry. Reducing tail-in-mouth behaviour from an early age is therefore essential. Inadequate housing conditions can lead to stress and abnormal behaviour, increasing the risk of tail injuries. This issue is particularly challenging when rearing pigs with intact tails, which requires higher welfare standards. This study showed that the welfare and/or performance of nursery pigs can be improved by ensuring proper feeder access and adequate space, thereby reducing the risk of tail injuries. The effects of stocking density (SD) and feeder access (FA) on the performance and damaging behaviour of weaned piglets are not well understood. Three experiments (Ts) were conducted. T1 compared low SD (LSD) (0.55 m(2)/piglet) and moderate SD (MSD) (0.37 m(2)/piglet), T2 compared low FA (LFA1) (1.33 piglets/feeder; partially slatted floor) and high FA (HFA1) (0.66 piglets/feeder; fully slatted floor), and T3 compared LFA2 (2.33 piglets/feeder) and HFA2 (1.00 piglets/feeder). T1 included 24 replicates, while T2 and T3 each had 12 replicates. In total, 576 piglets were weighed at days (d) 0, 14, and 35 post-weaning (PW). Faecal consistency (FC) was recorded multiple times per week. Tail and ear injuries were scored at d35 PW. Piglets housed under LSD grew faster throughout the experiment (p < 0.05) and had a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) between d0 and 14 PW (p = 0.02) than those in MSD. Tail injuries were not significantly affected (p = 0.14). HFA1 piglets had higher FC between d0 and 14 PW (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02), but fewer intact tails at d35 PW (p = 0.01) compared with LFA1. In T3, LFA2 piglets had a lower average daily gain (p = 0.03), higher FCR between d14 and 35 PW (p = 0.04), and fewer intact tails (p <0.01) than HFA2 piglets. These results suggest that both FA and SD can influence piglet performance, FC, and damaging behaviour.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of the Peste des Petits Ruminant (PPR) virus (PPRV) in sheep populations and to determine the potential epidemiological risk factors asso-ciated with this infection. Between October 2014 and March 2017, 2420 sheep serum samples were col-lected from ten selected PPR outbreak-prone districts in Bangladesh. The collected sera were analysed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) test to detect antibodies against PPR. A pre-viously designed disease report form was used to gather data on important epidemiological risk factors, and a risk analysis was performed to ascertain their association with PPRV infection. By cELISA, 44.3 % (95 % confidence interval:42.4-46.4 %) of sheep sera were positive for PPRV antibodies against PPR. In univariate analysis, the Bagerhat district had significantly higher seropositivity (54.1 %, 156/288) than other districts. Moreover, significantly higher (p < 0.05) seropositivity was found in the Jamuna River Basin (49.1 %, 217/442) compared to other ecological zones, in crossbreeds (60 %; 600/1000) related to native sheep, in males (69.8 %, 289/414) associated with females, in imported sheep (74.3 %, 223/300) compared to other sources, and in winter (57.2 %, 527/920) than in other seasons. In the multivariate logistic regression model, six possible risk factors were identified: study location, ecological zone, breed, sex, source, and season. The high seroprevalence of PPRV is significantly associated with several risk fac-tors, suggesting that PPR is epizootic throughout the country. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Simple Summary Licha black pig is a Chinese breed known for their large body length and appropriate fat deposition. Body length is an important production trait, while fat deposition is known to affect meat quality. However, their genetic characteristics of Licha black pigs have not been well studied. We analyzed the genomic information of 891 individuals of LI pigs, commercial pigs, and other Chinese indigenous pigs, identifying breed characteristics using runs of homozygosity, haplotype, and F-ST selection signatures, which further annotated using protein-protein interaction networks and RNA expression data from FarmGTEx. Our study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms that impact pig body length and fat deposition, which can be applied in breeding to improve meat quality and commercial profitability. Licha black (LI) pig has the specific characteristics of larger body length and appropriate fat deposition among Chinese indigenous pigs. Body length is one of the external traits that affect production performance, and fat deposition influences meat quality. However, the genetic characteristics of LI pigs have not yet been systematically uncovered. Here, the genomic information from 891 individuals of LI pigs, commercial pigs, and other Chinese indigenous pigs was used to analyze the breed characteristics of the LI pig with runs of homozygosity, haplotype, and F-ST selection signatures. The results showed the growth traits-related genes (i.e., NR6A1 and PAPPA2) and the fatness traits-related gene (i.e., PIK3C2B) were the promising candidate genes that closely related to the characteristics of LI pigs. In addition, the protein-protein interaction network revealed the potential interactions between the promising candidate genes and the FASN gene. The RNA expression data from FarmGTEx indicated that the RNA expression levels of NR6A1, PAPPA2, PIK3C2B, and FASN were highly correlated in the ileum. This study provides valuable molecular insights into the mechanisms that affect pig body length and fat deposition, which can be used in the further breeding process to improve meat quality and commercial profitability.

AB  - The global decline of large carnivore populations warrants scientific insights into intraguild relationships. Patterns of co-occurrence among sympatric predators are governed by their density, distribution, diet, activity overlaps, and behavioural strategies. Tigers are sympatric with leopards across their distribution range, overlap substantially in their diet, and are both nocturnal. The subdominant leopard is believed to coexist with tigers via several mechanisms like spatial segregation, temporal avoidance, and differential prey selection. Investigation of spatio-temporal patterns of co-occurrence of tigers and leopards can provide insights on mechanisms that permit coexistence. We used camera trap-based photo captures of tigers and leopards in prey-rich (58.15 +/- 10.61 ungulates per km(2)) Pench Tiger Reserve to determine their spatio-temporal patterns of co-occurrence. Spatially explicit density estimates of tigers were approximately 5 per 100 km(2) and leopards were approximately 4.5 per 100 km(2 )and remained stable over the years. This implies that both these co-predators are likely to attain carrying capacity within the study area. Areas with high tiger density had lower leopard density. Quantile regression analysis between tiger and leopard density at 2 x 2 km grid showed that leopard density had a parabolic relationship with tiger density, initially increasing with tigers (beta = 0.393; p = 0.001), stable at medium tiger density (beta= 0.13 and p = 0.15), and declining at high tiger densities (beta = -0.37 and p < 0.001). Both tigers and leopards were crepuscular in nature with no temporal segregation (delta = 89 %). Time lag of consecutive leopard photograph after a tiger capture ranged between 0.002 to 36.29 d. Leopard use of trails was not related to use by tigers. Our results suggest that leopards adjust their usage of space at fine scales to avoid confrontations with tigers. We also observed high temporal overlap and no spatio-temporal segregation between tigers and leopards, despite the two predators being nocturnal and having similar prey choices. The availability of ample prey within the study area is likely to be the driving factor of the co-occurrence of tigers and leopards within this dry deciduous habitat of central India.

AB  - The enemy release and pre-adaptation of alien species often drive their contemporary evolution across latitudinal gradients within its invasive and native ranges. Leaf functional traits constitute an important part of plant functional traits, reflecting their resource acquisition and usage. Thus, comparing the leaf functional traits (growth and defense traits) and latitude patterns of invasive and native plants could provide leading indicators of contemporary evolutionary and adaptative abilities that explain the success of invasive plants. Spartina alterniflora, a coastal wetland invasive plant native to the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico, has invaded China along the coast wetland (19-40 degrees N), similar to the United States (27-43 degrees N). To understand the leaf trait differences and variation across latitudes among continents of S. alterniflora within its invasive and native ranges and determine which factors drive leaf trait variation across latitudes, we investigated the relationship between leaf traits, related to growth (leaf area and specific leaf area), and defensive traits (leaf thickness and leaf toughness) at 10 invaded locations and 15 native locations. We identified correlations between leaf traits and abiotic conditions such as annual mean temperature, tide range, and soil salinity. Compared with native S. alterniflora, Chinese costal S. alterniflora has a larger leaf area and specific leaf area, less leaf thickness, and lower leaf toughness, suggesting that biosynthetic resources are transferred from defense to competitive traits, and indirectly supporting the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis. The leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, and toughness of S. alterniflora from both ranges had similar quadratic latitudinal relationships. Some of these relationships were stronger in the invasive range than the native range, indicating that the leaf traits of invasive S. alterniflora experienced pre-adaptation and had high phenotypic plasticity. Tide range, soil salinity, and especially temperature formed latitudinal gradients in different geographic regions. By analyzing indicators of leaf functional traits across geographical ranges, this study shows that the escape from natural enemies plays an important role in the successful invasion of S. alterniflora, while pre-adaptation and high phenotypic plasticity promote its rapid expansion along the latitudinal gradients.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau's distinctive high-altitude environment, marked by extreme cold and reduced oxygen levels, presents considerable survival challenges for both humans and mammals. Natural selection has led to the accumulation of adaptive mutations in Tibetan pigs, enabling them to develop distinctive adaptive phenotypes. Here, we aim to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to high-altitude hypoxia. Therefore, we conducted a systematic analysis of 140 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data points from different representing pig populations. Our analysis identified a total of 27,614,561 mutations, including 22,386,319 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 5,228,242 insertions/deletions (INDELs, size < 50 bp). A total of 11% (2,678,569) of the SNVs were newly identified in our project, significantly expanding the dataset of genetic variants in Tibetan pigs. Compared to other pig breeds, Tibetan pigs are uniquely adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting the highest genetic diversity and the lowest inbreeding coefficient. Employing the composite of multiple signals (CMS) method, we scanned the genome-wide Darwinian positive selection signals and identified 32,499 Tibetan pig positively selected SNVs (TBPSSs) and 129 selected genes (TBPSGs), including 213 newly discovered genes. Notably, we identified eight genes (PHACTR1, SFI1, EPM2A, SLC30A7, NKAIN2, TNNI3K, and PLIN2) with strong nature selection signals. They are likely to improve cardiorespiratory function and fat metabolism to help Tibetan pigs become adapted to the high-altitude environment. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation and the adaptive phenotypes of Tibetan pigs.

AB  - BackgroundPopulation growth and management in cervid species is dependent on reproductive ecology and factors influencing juvenile survival. Aspects of the female's movement behavior likely affect juvenile survival and movement patterns of pregnant and lactating females differ from non-pregnant or non-lactating females. Explanations for these differing movement patterns include change in nutritional demands for the female, isolation during parturition, and predator avoidance. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are an important managed cervid and a better understanding of their reproductive ecology, including the relationships between resources, movement, and juvenile survival, can better inform management.MethodsOur objective was to determine if biological factors, such as female age, fawn age, number of fawns, as well as characteristics of prepartum range affected the female's postpartum daily movement or overlap of space used pre- and postpartum in Sussex County, Delaware, USA (2,420 km2). We collected GPS locations 2 weeks pre- and postpartum on 22 individual females from 2016 to 2017. In total, we recorded data from 263 days of postpartum movement for an average of 12 days/individual. We used a hierarchical modeling process to test biological factors and prepartum home range characteristics on two aspects of postpartum movement behavior, mean hourly displacements and daily use of prepartum home range.ResultsMean hourly displacement decreased with increased female age and increased with number of known fawns alive and the female's home range size prior to parturition. We found that as fawns aged the doe increased use of the prepartum home range.ConclusionsOur results indicate that younger females are moving more than older females during lactation potentially to access higher quality habitat. This increased movement increases nutritional demand and may play a role in fawn survival. Females are more likely to use more of their prepartum home range as fawns age, a finding congruent with previous research. This differentiation in metric response (movement rate vs. space use) emphasizes the complexities of movement ecology and the importance of considering multiple dependent variables for complex behavior.

AB  - Hunting dogs are exposed to the risk of injury in driven hunts, an often-used method for managing growing wild boar numbers. This study investigated the impact of increased hunting pressure-both across the hunting season and within individual hunting events-on the risk of wild boar attacks on hunting dogs, i.e., the length of the hunting season (2.68 +/- 0.76 months, mean +/- standard deviation), the number of driven hunts per season (3.99 +/- 0.43), the intervals between hunts (17.85 +/- 4.83 days), the number of wild boars harvested per season (14.46 +/- 13.10), and the number of participants (23.8 +/- 10.69) and dogs (4.56 +/- 2.66) involved per hunt. The data were collected via a retrospective questionnaire survey. The information-theoretic approach (IT-AIC) and GLMM were employed to estimate the factors' effects on the number of wild boar attacks on dogs reported in 40 hunting grounds in five consecutive hunting seasons (2.60 +/- 5.07 attacks per hunting season in a hunting ground). The number of attacks only increased with the length of the hunting season. The best model did not include other factors, such as shorter intervals between hunts, a higher number of driven hunts, wild boars harvested, or participants. The respondents reported 150 injuries by wild boars during 797 driven hunts. Most injuries were mild (73.8%), with fewer severe (18.8%) and fatal (7.4%) cases. Further investigation into wild boar and hunting dog interactions is necessary for constructing strategies to improve hunting practices and reduce dog injury risks.

AB  - The origin of amniotes 320 million years ago signalled independence from water in vertebrates and was closely followed by divergences within the mammal and reptile stem lineages (Synapsida and Reptilia). Early members of both groups had highly similar morphologies, being superficially 'lizard-like' forms with many plesiomorphies. However, the extent to which they might have exhibited divergent patterns of evolutionary change, with potential to explain the large biological differences between their living members, is unresolved. We use a new, comprehensive phylogenetic dataset to quantify variation in rates and constraints of morphological evolution among Carboniferous-early Permian amniotes. We find evidence for an early burst of evolutionary rates, resulting in the early origins of morphologically distinctive subgroups that mostly persisted through the Cisuralian. Rates declined substantially through time, especially in reptiles. Early reptile evolution was also more constrained compared to early synapsids, exploring a more limited character state space. Postcranial innovation in particular was important in early synapsids, potentially related to their early origins of large body size. In contrast, early reptiles predominantly varied the temporal region, suggesting disparity in skull and jaw kinematics, and foreshadowing the variability of cranial biomechanics seen in reptiles today. Our results demonstrate that synapsids and reptiles underwent an early divergence of macroevolutionary patterns. This laid the foundation for subsequent evolutionary events and may be critical in understanding the substantial differences between mammals and reptiles today. Potential explanations include an early divergence of developmental processes or of ecological factors, warranting cross-disciplinary investigation.

AB  - Ternstroemia is a genus with ca. 141 species from the humid tropics worldwide, with one species reaching Korea and Japan. A conjunction of hygrophilous ecosystems and mountain ranges with high diversity and complementary geological histories, makes Venezuela the country with the highest number of species globally, with a top density of taxa per area (ca. 2.8 x 10-5 spp./km2) and a high degree of endemism (32%). Twenty-eight species are recognized, one of them as new ( Tern- stroemia igapicola sp. nov.). Six new synonyms ( T. brevipes var. blanchetii, Ternstroemia camelliifolia var. minor, T. grandiosa, T. laevigata [previously synonymized, but under a different species concept], T. steyermarkii var. submontana, and T. unilocularis), six new lectotypes ( T. andina, T. brevipes, T. camelliifolia, T. meridionalis, T. meridionalis var. nigricans Choisy, and T. schomburgkiana), and seven new records per country ( T. klugiana, T. prancei, and T. schomburgkiana for Venezuela, T. discoidea and T. klugiana for Brasil, T. crassifolia for Colombia, and T. distyla for Peru), are presented. Ternstroemia gleasoniana is confirmed for Venezuela, while T. brasiliensis and T. punctata, previously reported for Venezuela, are excluded. A key, four illustrations, three maps and one table allow the differentiation of the accepted species.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the physiological response of gestating and lactating sows to naturally-occurring environmental conditions, and to identify factors that may contribute to or prevent heat stress, while being kept outdoors in Quebec, Canada during the summer. Six groups of 4 Yorkshire-Landrace sows lived in outdoor pens equipped with a wallow, shade structure, farrowing huts and access to a pasture from July to September 2018. Between week 15 of gestation and week 3 of lactation (inclusive), we recorded the location of each sow 5 days/week during 5 daily 15-min observation periods, and additionally measured the sow's respiratory rate and mud cover at the end of each observation period. Simultaneously, we collected sow body temperature data with vaginal temperature loggers 24 h/d on week 15 of gestation and week 2 of lactation, and monitored environmental conditions with temperature and humidity loggers to calculate the temperature humidity index (THI). Sows had significantly higher and more variable body temperatures during lactation compared to gestation (P <= 0.0001), and when THI was analysed as a continuous variable, it was positively associated with sow body temperature during the night in lactation. During gestation, neither respiratory rate nor body temperature were associated with high or low levels of THI (P = 0.15 and 0.79, respectively) or mud cover (P = 0.29 and 0.94, respectively). However, in lactation, respiratory rate was higher when, simultaneously, THI exceeded 74 and mud cover was low (P = 0.006), while a THI higher than 74 and a low mud cover had independent effects on body temperature (P = 0.012 and 0.004, respectively). In lactation, sows that spent an entire observation period in the farrowing hut also had a higher respiratory rate than sows that left the hut at least once (P = 0.009). In summary, lactating sows were more likely to show increases in respiratory rate and body temperature in warmer conditions than gestating sows, and our findings also suggest that time in the farrowing hut may be a risk factor for heat stress. However, mud cover may limit these physiological consequences when sows have access to a wallow.

AB  - Background and aims Addition of nitrification inhibitor (NI) to nitrogen fertilizer is an effective way to mitigate N2O emission. However, the impacts of applying NI with pig manure and inorganic fertilizer on soil CO2 emissions in Northeast China are poorly documented. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of NI with pig manure and inorganic fertilizer on soil CO2 emissions for four consecutive years (2012-2015), in an acidic luvisol of a maize cropping system in Northeast China.
   Methods The experiment included three treatments: (1) inorganic fertilizer (NPK), (2) NPK plus pig manure (NPKM), (3) NPKM plus nitrification inhibitor 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (NPKMI). Soil CO2 fluxes were measured using static closed chamber method.
   Results The maize yield in NPKM was significantly increased (p<0.05) in 2015 compared with NPK. NPKM significantly increased soil CO2 emission by 23.5% (p<0.05) in 2015/2016 compared with NPK, while NPKMI has little effect on soil CO2 emission compared with NPKM. NPKM and NPKMI showed no significant effects (p>0.05) on bacterial abundance compared to NPK, respectively. Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q(10)) was significantly enhanced by 7.6% (p<0.05) after manure application. Soil depth of 15 cm was more appropriate for calculating Q(10) of CO2 emission than that in the 0 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm.
   Conclusions The integrated application of manure and inorganic fertilizer may increase the soil C loss through CO2 emissions over time, while additional application of DMPP has little impact on soil CO2 emissions.

AB  - Follicular fluid exosomes (FFEs) play a crucial role in follicular growth and maturation. As the fundamental component of the ovarian follicle, granulosa cells (GCs) are instrumental in the development of follicles and oocytes. This study explored the effects of FFEs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and antioxidant activity of yak GCs. An in vitro oxidative stress damage model was established by treating GCs treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and tested their response to exosomes. The results showed that exosomes pretreatment markedly inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and GSH, and up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant stressrelated genes, including SOD2, NFE2L2, GPX4, and CAT. In addition, exosome pretreatment increased the mRNA and protein levels of proliferation-related genes, PCNA, CDK4, CCND1, and CCNB1, and down-regulated the apoptosis-related genes, BAX, CASP3, and CASP8, in GCs. Our findings support the hypothesis that exosomes derived from follicular fluid can notably reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in yak GCs. This study provides basic data for elucidating the molecular mechanism of exosomes action, proposes a novel avenue for regulating follicular development and atresia, and paves the way for future research into ways to improve yak breeding.

AB  - Farmers need to know the actual nutrient concentrations in organic manures in order to enable optimal crop nutrition and to avoid nutrient losses into the environment. Physicochemical quick tests offer a way to estimate nutrient concentrations on a farm but require statistical calculation models to be applied by the farmer. A total of 391 pig slurries, were sampled from practical farms in northwest Germany and ammonium nitrogen (AN), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK) concentrations, and dry matter were analysed in a laboratory. Furthermore, on-farm quick tests were used to determine electrical conductivity and specific density (SG) and the ammonium concentration with a Quantofix-N-Volumeter. Simple and multiple linear regression models for all lab analysed nutrients and on-farm determined parameters were calculated. The best regression models for all slurries were found for AN based on Quantofix-N-Volumeter (R-2 = 0.92), TN based on Quantofix-N-Volumeter, and dry matter (R-2 = 0.95), TP based on dry matter (R-2 = 0.88), and TK based on Quantofix-N-Volumeter (R-2 = 0.70). An application for mobile devices is being developed that will allow farmers to use these statistical models in a user-friendly way. Future regression models from other studies might be integrated into the app database so that farmers can calculate nutrient concentrations in pig slurries based on regionalised data.

AB  - We simulate dynamic mechanical analysis experiments for the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system. For this, the SLLOD algorithm with time-dependent strain rates is applied to give a sinusoidally varying strain at different densities and temperatures. The starting point is a temperature scan at a fixed reference density. Isomorph theory predicts that for other densities, corresponding temperatures can be identified at which the mechanical properties are unchanged when scaled appropriately. We determine the isomorphically equivalent temperatures by analyzing how particle forces change upon scaling configurations to the new density. Loss moduli expressed in suitable reduced units are compared for isomorphic state points. When plotted against the unscaled temperatures, these reduced loss curves are observed to collapse indicating the validity of isomorph theory for dynamic mechanical analysis experiments. Two different methods to determine isomorphic temperatures are considered. While one of them breaks down for the largest density rescalings considered in this paper, the other one is still applicable in this region. The decorrelation of force vectors upon rescaling is investigated as a possible origin of this effect. Our results demonstrate that the simplification of the phase diagram entailed by isomorph theory for a wide class of systems is relevant also for the mechanical properties of glasses.

AB  - The present communication reports the spatiotemporal variation in the population dynamics of three prominent Ophiuroidea species: Amphipholis squamata, Ophiactis savignyi and Ophiocomella sexradia at the rocky intertidal zone at Veraval (21 & DEG;35' N, 69 & DEG;36' E) Gujarat, off the Arabian Sea. The two sampling areas with different substratum and community structures were investigated from April 2019 to March 2020. Brittle stars were found inhabited in the coralline bed, zoanthid bed, algal holdfast, rock pool crevices and underneath rocks in the studied coastal areas. A. squamata was the most abundant species followed by O. savignyi and O. sexradia at the Veraval coast. The current study described a few remarkable revelations between the patches of coralline algae and Ophiuroidea abundance. Brittle star population revealed major spatial variations between both sampling sites. Cluster analysis and nMDS support population abundance in a seasonal pattern distribution.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The FIBRILLIN11 (FBN11) of Arabidopsis has a lipid-binding FBN domain and a kinase domain. FBN11 is present in chloroplasts and is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses during seed germination. In mannitol, the seed germination rate of the fbn11 mutants significantly reduced compared to that of the wild type. The ABA-dependent and -independent stress response regulating genes were differentially expressed in fbn11 mutants and wild-type when grown in mannitol supplemented medium. These results suggest that chloroplast localized FBN11 is involved in mediating osmotic stress tolerance through the signaling pathway that regulates the stress response in the nucleus.
   Plants live in ever-changing environments, facing adverse environmental conditions including pathogen infection, herbivore attack, drought, high temperature, low temperature, nutrient deficiency, toxic metal soil contamination, high salt, and osmotic imbalance that inhibit overall plant growth and development. Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with these stresses. In this study, we found that the FIBRILLIN11 (FBN11) gene in Arabidopsis, which has a lipid-binding FBN domain and a kinase domain, is involved in the plant's response to abiotic stressors, including salt and osmotic stresses. FBN11 protein localizes to the chloroplast. FBN11 gene expression significantly changed when plants were exposed to the abiotic stress response mediators such as abscisic acid (ABA), sodium chloride (NaCl), and mannitol. The seed germination rates of fbn11 homozygous mutants in different concentrations of mannitol and NaCl were significantly reduced compared to wild type. ABA-dependent and -independent stress response regulatory genes were differentially expressed in the fbn11 mutant compared with wild type when grown in mannitol medium. These results suggest a clear role for chloroplast-localized FBN11 in mediating osmotic stress tolerance via the stress response regulatory signaling pathway in the nucleus.

AB  - A pot experiment was conducted to assess the Sb phytoavailability and its accumulation in the wheat before and after remediation, using the composted manure of poultry and sheep, and a chemical amendment (limestone). The present study evaluates the effects of amendments on Sb bioavailability in different soils and investigates the relationship between bioaccumulated Sb and its availability in spiked soils using two different single extraction methods. Furthermore, a sequential extraction procedure was used to measure different fractions of Sb in soil, in order to assess the effect of remediation. The results revealed that bioavailability of Sb were highly affected by the three soil amendments on plant height, uptake of Sb by wheat. Poultry compost (Pc) and Sheep compost (Sc) increased the residual fraction of Sb in soils, and decreased the Sb uptake by wheat, enhanced the height, biomass and dry yield of the wheat crop. While the residual fraction of Sb in soils didn't obviously increased by adding Chemical (limestone) in the four soils. It is concluded that uptake of Sb in the soils significantly decreased with the addition of amended materials in the Sb spiked soils, and poultry compost is the most effective. In the lower level of Sb contaminated soils remediated by poultry compost (Pc), the uptake of Sb in wheat decreased 63.1-74.4 %, 68.7-79.0 %, 68.9-76.9 % and 66.3-82.6 % in S1, S2, S3, S4, compared to the contaminated soils without amendments, respectively.

AB  - Natural estrogens are present in high concentrations in livestock slurries, which are often applied to agricultural fields in large quantities. As such, the export of slurry-derived natural estrogens from tile-drained fields is a potential source for estrogenic pollution in surface waters. Yet despite the abundance of tile-drained fields in Central Europe, export of natural estrogens from agricultural fields receiving livestock slurries is rarely studied in this region. In an effort to fill this knowledge gap, here we applied natural estrogens to Swiss experimental fields in the form of cattle slurry, pig slurry or dissolved in water, and quantified them in flow-proportionally collected drainage water over 18 months. After pig and cattle slurry applications, concentration maxima in drainage water of 73, 8, 37, and 60 ng L-1 for 17 alpha-estradiol (E2 alpha), 17 beta-estradiol (E2 beta), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3), respectively, were observed shortly after rain events. The exported fractions of individual natural estrogens to tile drains were on average 0.26% (ranging from 0.08 to 0.41%) after cattle, and 0.18% (0.03-0.40%) after pig slurry applications. Such numbers were higher than expected from the leaching potential based on substance properties, and comparable to those of more mobile micropollutants previously studied on the same fields. Natural estrogens were mainly exported to tile drains through preferential flow. Exported fractions were lower when applied in aqueous solution than when applied in slurry, pointing to particle-facilitated transport to tile drains when applied in slurry. In Switzerland, the estimated 6.3, 0.6, 7.4, and 7.7 g of E2 alpha, E2 beta, E1, and E3, respectively, exported through the tile-drained agricultural area per year contribute little to the total natural estrogen load received by surface waters. However, after slurry applications in highly drained catchments, natural estrogen emissions to tile drains can cause short term (i.e. less than 1 week) estrogenic exposure in nearby streams.

AB  - Takifugu fasciatus is an anadromous fish widely distributed in East Asia and often experiences fluctuations in temperature and salinity. This study investigated the effects of the interactions between temperature and salinity on apoptosis, antioxidant enzymes, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in the liver of T. fasciatus. The temperature (25, 21, 17, and 13 degrees C) and salinity (0, 10, and 20 ppt salinity) were conducted with three replicates for each treatment. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (Tunel) assays were used to detect mRNA expression, protein levels, and apoptosis levels. The expressions of caspase 3, 7, 9, and the apoptosis index increased in T. fasciatus as the temperature decreased, while the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) decreased. The correlation results in this study showed that after the exposure to 10 ppt salinity at 13 and 17 degrees C, the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, caspase3, 7, and 9 expressions, and apoptosis index were decreased as compared with those in the control. In addition, there were no deaths and no significant change in apoptosis in the group at 21 degrees C, and there were a small number of deaths in the 20 ppt, 25 degrees C groups. Corre-spondingly, MDA concentration and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, caspase7 and 9 expressions, and apoptosis index in the liver were significantly higher in the 20 ppt, 25 degrees C groups than in the 0 ppt, 25 degrees C, and 10 ppt, 25 degrees C groups. In addition, salinity had no significant influence on the expression of p-p38 MAPK and its phosphorylation ratio (p-p38/p38) at low temperatures but significantly affected its downstream transcription factors (ATF2, ElK-1, MEF2, and P53). Our study provides a reference for healthy cultures of T. fasciatus.

AB  - Pig skin is commonly used in the medical industry as an injection model due to its compelling physiological affinity to human skin. However, the pig neck skin microflora remains largely uncharacterized, which may have undesirable implications for the translatability of results to humans. This study aimed to characterize pig neck skin microbiome with direct comparison with human skin microflora at emblematic injection sites to appraise its suitability as an injection model. Ten minipigs were sampled with tape strips and swabs and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and 16S/ITS high throughput sequencing and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results were directly compared with previous investigations of human injection sites. Pig skin was dominated by phyla 94.8% Firmicutes, 3% Proteobacteria, and 2.2% Actinobacteria. Staphylococcus spp. prevailed (44.4%) at the genus level with S. capitis and S. chromogenes present in all samples. Pig skin revealed populations in the 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(2) range with 3% identified as Gram-negative and increased alpha diversity (compared with 10(2) CFU/cm(2) and 10% in humans). While notable taxonomical differences on species levels were seen, pig skin encompassed 97.1% of genera found in human samples. The increased population and variation found support the pig neck as an imperfect but fidelitous subcutaneous injection model that can adequately challenge devices from a microbial standpoint.

AB  - Simple Summary Transportation is one of the most stressful situations in pig production. The maximum duration of a journey should be determined considering the pigs' coping capacity. The effect of a typical journey (200 km in Argentina) on pig physiological stress response was assessed using animal-friendly techniques. Fattening pigs (n = 18) were transported for three hours; 10 received a dexamethasone injection 7 h after the end of the journey. A control group (n = 18) was not transported, and 10 individuals received dexamethasone. The levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites and hair cortisol and cortisone were measured. The transported pigs had higher levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites after transportation than the control group. The level of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites returned to normal values faster in transported pigs treated with dexamethasone than in the control group. The amount of glucocorticoids in their hair was not related to the stressful stimuli; in contrast, the cortisone/cortisol ratio yielded better results. Since glucocorticoid measurements in hair are still a questionable stress biomarker in pigs, further studies are needed to develop animal-based transport protocols. The results showed that pigs were able to cope with a 3 h road trip. In the near future, a non-invasive glucocorticoid analysis could be used to characterize pigs' coping capacity on a farm.Abstract Pig homeostasis is challenged by stressful production practices, like road transportation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are mediators of reactive homeostasis, and their concentrations are frequently used as a stress indicator. The adrenocortical activity of fattening female and castrated male pigs was monitored over a 5-day longitudinal study. A bi-factorial experimental design was applied on day 2; 18 pigs in pen 1 were transported for 3 h (T; 1.2 m2/pig), and 18 pigs were kept in pen 2 (NT). Ten pigs from each pen were treated with dexamethasone (T-D or NT-D), and eight with saline solution (T-SS or NT-SS). Adrenocortical activity was assessed by measuring the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) and hair cortisol and cortisone. In T-SS pigs, the level of FGMs was higher after transportation than in NT-SS pigs. The level of FGMs of T-D pigs initially increased but then reached similar levels to those of NT-SS sooner than T-SS. In contrast, hair cortisol and cortisone did not respond to the treatments. Nevertheless, the hair cortisone/cortisol ratio increased due to transport and decreased after dexamethasone administration. Daily faecal sampling proved still more reliable than 60-day hair sampling for assessing adrenocortical activity. Transported pigs recovered their adrenocortical baseline levels within 24 h. Dexamethasone attenuated the response to transport.

AB  - One of the reasons hindering the growth of the goat population is the low feed base for the year-round provision of animals with adequate feed, and in the Akmola region (Kazakhstan), this is also caused by severe soil and climatic conditions with a lack of heat and moisture during the growing season of forage crops. Therefore, to solve this problem, it is necessary to create raw material conveyors for goat farms based on the rational management of natural feed resources, taking into account the peculiarities of soil and climatic zones of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the yield and nutritional value of the types of annual and perennial feed crops used in the raw material conveyor system for the year-round provision of complete feed for dairy goats with a productivity of 3-4 kg of milk per day. The studies were conducted in the Tselinograd district (51 degrees 09'08.8 '' N 71 degrees 10'10.5 '' E) of the Akmola region (2020-2021), which is located in the northern part of Kazakhstan. The need for feed types was calculated taking into account the daily feeding rations of animals, and the types, varieties, and hybrids of forage crops were selected taking into account the bioclimatic potential of forage crops and the socioeconomic conditions of the goat farm. The scheme of the raw material conveyor with the selection of sites has been developed, and the chemical composition and nutritional value of annual and perennial forage crops have been studied. The results of the study show the need to create raw material conveyors with the selection of species and varieties from perennial and annual forage crops in pure form and grass mixtures, providing an output from a unit area of coarse feed from 0.95 to 3.8 tons with a nutritional value on average from 7.05 to 10.9 MJ/kg of exchange energy and from 0.53 to 0.96 feed units.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper is in attempt to assess the impact of the production system Montanera and intensive, and the age at slaughter in each of them, on the muscle fibres of Longissimus thoracis (LT) and meat quality of fresh loins from Iberian pigs. The age at slaughter affected the fibre size of Montanera LT muscles, while the production system influenced the fibre type I population and type IIB fibre size. The age at slaughter affected the fresh loin quality trait depending on the production system; Montanera and intensive fresh loins from older animals yielded higher myoglobin and redness values. Additionally, intensive fresh loins derived from older animals yielded the lowest intramuscular fat and the highest cook loss and shear force in the Warner-Braztler shear force test. These above-mentioned parameters differed due to production systems, Montanera fresh loins less fat-infiltrated and tough but with higher redness values. The results of the present study contribute to shedding light regarding how the production-related factor animal slaughter age may influence the muscle fibre population, size and quality traits of fresh meat. Two production systems and several ages at slaughter were used: 12, 14 and 16 months for outdoor rearing (with the final finishing phase in the Montanera system, in which fed was based on natural resources, mainly acorns and grass) and 8, 10 and 12 months for animals reared indoors (intensive system: with feed based on commercial fodder) to evaluate their effect on the muscle fibre population and size of the Longissimus thoracis, (LT) muscle, as well as fresh loin quality traits. Animals that were older at slaughter revealed increased fibre sizes of the LT muscles in the pigs reared in the Montanera system. The LT muscles of the animals reared in intensive systems had a lower percentage of type I fibres and higher size of type IIB than those reared in the Montanera system. The approximate composition and instrumental colour of Montanera fresh loins were affected by the animal slaughter age. In the case of the intensive system, the effect of animal slaughter age had an impact on the approximate composition, instrumental colour, water loss and textural properties. Therefore, different ages at slaughter of Iberian pigs showed variations in some quality parameters in the fresh loins in both the Montanera and Intensive systems, thus proving to be a factor of variability and homogeneity of the Iberian products. The meat from Iberian pigs reared in an intensive system and slaughtered at a younger age proved to be more tender. The production system affected all the above quality traits, with the exception of water loss.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Brucellosis and toxoplasmosis cause economic losses in small ruminants, notably through abortions. Both Brucella melitensis and Toxoplasma gondii are important zoonotic agents with infection of the former arising from contact with infected small ruminants or their products and the latter through ingestion of tissue cysts in undercooked/raw meat products of livestock or from oocysts from cats. In Iraq, factors which influence reproductive failure in small ruminants are mostly unknown; however, of the many endemic diseases present, brucellosis and toxoplasmosis are considered important in reducing reproductive output and productivity. This study is part of an integrated research project aiming at understanding the epidemiology of reproductive diseases in small ruminants in northern Iraq. We present in this work a prospective cohort study aiming to determine the incidence risk of seroconversion to Brucella and Toxoplasma and the association of seroconversion with the reproductive outcome in pregnant sheep and goats in Dohuk, northern Iraq.
   In this study, sera from 240 small ruminants (192 sheep and 48 goats) belonging to 12 farms in Dohuk Province, northern Iraq, were collected on two occasions to investigate the incidence risk of seroconversion to Brucella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. All selected animals were confirmed pregnant (approximately 2 months pregnant) by ultrasound examination at the time of the first blood collection. A second ultrasound examination and blood sampling were undertaken two months after the initial scanning/sampling. Antibodies to Brucella were tested using the Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA), and the results were interpreted in series. The Latex Agglutination Test (LAT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) were also used in series to confirm the presence of antibodies to T. gondii. The seroprevalence for Brucella and Toxoplasma increased significantly between the two sampling times (p = 0.0003 and 0.03 in first and second sampling, respectively). The incidence risk of seroconversion to Brucella over the two months was 10.6% (95% CI: 6.9-15.3) and 7.3% (95% CI: 4.3-11.6) for Toxoplasma. Animals that seroconverted to Brucella were 2.9 times more likely to lose their pregnancy (95% CI: 1.6-5.5) than animals that remained seronegative; however, seroconversion to Toxoplasma had no significant impact on loss of pregnancy. This study is the first reported investigation on the association of seroconversion to Brucella and Toxoplasma with the reproductive outcome of pregnant sheep and goats in northern Iraq. Brucellosis and toxoplasmosis continue to negatively impact small ruminants' reproductive performance and compromising food security in Iraq. It is hoped that this study will assist the development of a better-informed economic model to estimate Brucella and Toxoplasma burden in small animals in northern Iraq, and such a model could be used to validate the impact of various potential intervention programs in.

AB  - The natural stratification and interlocking "organization" of armored sediments in heterogeneous, coarse-grained, beaches provides protection and enhances habitat for burrowing sedentary megafauna and macrofauna such as hard-shelled clams. Here, we develop a novel metric for quantifying sediment organization of large surficial beach clasts through sedimentologic and photogrammetric analyses of 37 lower intertidal heterogeneous gravel beaches in western Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Grain size, photogrammetric, and Wolman Pebble Count clast-size data from 64, similar to 1-m(2) study plots are combined into a clast-size-independent "Organization Metric" to quantify the degree of organization in the meshed arrangement of larger surficial sediments. This metric was validated through field manipulation experiments and comparisons of adjacent plots characterized by different clast sizes. Application of this metric to subsets of Prince William Sound beaches that underwent differential treatment following the Exxon Valdez oil spill reveals persistent physical effects of artificial beach disturbance even 21 years after the cleanup. This has important implications for beach management (e.g., cleaning or dredging) and for the diverse and productive sedentary megafaunal assemblages that live within these sediments. Overall, this study provides a new approach for quantifying organization of heterogenous coarse sediments in diverse natural settings; in particular, heterogenous gravel beaches.

AB  - The Broad-Complex (Br-C) is a pivotal transcription factor in arthropod development and metamorphosis, but its functional roles in crustaceans remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified and characterized a Br-C homolog (PvBr-C) in Penaeus vannamei through molecular cloning, phylogenetic analysis, and functional investigation. The 2343-bp cDNA encoded a 781-amino-acid protein containing conserved BTB_POZ and zinc finger domains, exhibiting high homology with the analogous sequences in decapod crustaceans. Tissue-specific expression profiling revealed predominant PvBr-C expression in the hemocytes, suggesting an immune-related role. RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that pvbr-c transcription was regulated by pvhpo, linking it to immunity regulation. Knockdown of pvbr-c significantly suppressed WSSV replication, as indicated by reduced expression of viral immediate-early (ie1) and late (vp28) genes. Transcriptome analysis of pvbr-c-silenced shrimp revealed differential regulation of immune effectors (e.g., AMPs, proPO system components, and hematopoietic factors) and developmental genes (e. g., ecdysone signaling components, forkhead box protein, and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone). Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that PvBr-C activated the promoters of wsv249 and wsv465, indicating its co-option by WSSV to facilitate replication. These findings establish PvBr-C as a dual-function regulator in P. vannamei, orchestrating both developmental processes via ecdysone signaling and antiviral immunity, while serving as a proviral factor that can be hijacked by WSSV. This study provides novel insights into the interplay between crustacean molting pathways and host-virus interactions, with implications for managing WSSV outbreaks in aquaculture.

AB  - Caves have been acting as natural traps for numerous groups of animals and, due to their relatively stable environmental conditions, preservation of faunal remains is usually good. In the Holocene, the nature of the depositional system of the Cuvieri Cave allowed the preservation of osteological material that was seldom altered or remobilised, resulting in an important record of environmental events and changes in faunal composition. Deer represents the most abundant family of macrovertebrates that have been found at the Cuvieri Cave, including two species: Mazama americana and Mazama cf. gouazoubira. The Tayassuidae are represented by two species Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu, the first occurring only in deposits attributed to the beginning of the Holocene, while P. tajacu also occurs in the Middle and Late Holocene. The presence of human groups in the region occurred in two periods, and while it was present there was the presence of Mazama americana, typical of forest environments. However, the species Pecari tajacu was recorded during the period that the region was not inhabited.

AB  - Plants exposed to volatiles emitted from artificially damaged conspecific or heterospecific plants exhibit increased resistance to herbivorous insects. Here, we examined whether volatiles from artificially damaged weeds affect maize growth and reproduction. Seven days after germination, maize seedlings were exposed to volatiles emitted by artificially damaged mugwort (Artemisia indica var. maximowiczii) or tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) plants either separately, or as a mixture of the two, for seven days. Unexposed seedlings were used as controls. Treated and control seedlings were cultivated in an experimental field without any insecticides applied. Plants exposed to either of the three volatile treatments sustained significantly less damage than controls. Additionally, seedlings exposed to either goldenrod or mixed volatiles produced more leaves and tillers than control plants. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of ears was observed in plants exposed to the volatile mixture. In all treated plants, ear sugar content was significantly higher than that in the controls. Further, we cultivated seedlings that were either exposed to the volatile mixture or unexposed, under the conventional farming method using pesticides. Similar significant differences were observed for sugar content, number of tillers, leaves, damaged leaves, and ears. Laboratory experiments were conducted to further evaluate the mechanisms involved in the improved performance of volatile-treated plants. A significant reduction in the growth of common armyworm (Mythimna separata) larvae was observed when maize plants were exposed to the volatile mixture. This treatment did not affect the amount of jasmonic acid in the seedlings, whereas salicylic acid content increased upon exposure. The characteristic differences in chemical composition of mugwort and goldenrod volatiles were confirmed and, in turn, the volatile mixture differed significantly from the volatiles of either species.

AB  - Species typically occupy fewer sites, and average population densities decline from the centre to the edge of a species' range when the range contracts. The poaching of rhinoceroses (rhinos) for their horn has degraded the black and white rhino populations in Kruger National Park (Kruger). Rhino populations have declined, and their distributions have contracted since 2010. We surveyed the black and white rhino populations in the Kruger during 2021 and 2022. We also identified core areas where rhino densities are greater and defined these as priority conservation zones. We then tested the prediction that population growth within priority conservation zones will exceed population growth beyond these zones for both black and white rhino. The results highlighted the continued decline of the white rhino population, while the black rhino population has stabilised since 2020. Growth rates were negative for white rhinos within priority conservation zones, but higher than those beyond these zones. For black rhinos, growth in priority conservation zones was positive and higher than those beyond zones. Priority conservation zones offer an opportunity to combat rhino poaching in a more tactical manner, concentrating resources on key areas for rhino survival. Conservation implications: We highlight complementary approaches to the existing anti- poaching tactics that focus on exploiting easier access control, situational awareness, integrity and individual-based rhino monitoring when targeting priority conservation zones within Kruger.

AB  - Hydatidosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus larvae, which affects sheep worldwide, especially in rural communities. This study aims to determine the prevalence and structure of hydatid cyst in sheep. A total number of 1,198 sheep in different age groups G1 ( 1 year), G2 (1-2 years) and G3 ( 2 years) were slaughtered at Taif abattoirs, then examined for the presence of hydatid cysts in lung, liver, and mesentery. Prevalence of hydatid cyst infection in imported sheep (13.0%) was higher than of local sheep (10.2%). Particularly, as per gender, prevalence of imported females (71.9%) was higher than those of local females (28.1%), while that of imported males (66.3%) was higher than those of local males (33.7%). Large sizes of hydatid cysts and fertility recorded in G3 were higher in both local and imported sheep than those of G1 and G2. Morphometric analysis of pathological lesions in liver of all infected sheep showed a significant increase compared to non-infected healthy sheep (have no lesions) (P < 0.001). In addition, for all infected sheep, histochemical investigation with Masson's trichrome stain showed collagen fibers inside the hydatid cyst capsules and in pericystic region. The collagen fibers content and the cellular laminated membranes took the green color, while immunohistochemical evaluation detected a positive reaction for CD3. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Improving pig growth performance, nutrient digestibility and pork quality is a main goal of pig breeding. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of Larix sibirica dihydroquercetin (DHQ) or dry distilled rose (Rosa damascena) petals (DDRP) on growth performance, carcass composition, meat quality, blood parameters and histological changes in ovaries and liver in native Danube White fattening pigs. A total of 120 pigs were used in the experiment lasting 45 days prior to harvest. The pigs were divided into five groups. The control group (C) was fed a basal diet. The other four experimental groups were fed the same diets containing either 3.5 and 7.5 mg DHQ/kg/d or 0.255 and 0.545 g DDRP/kg/d. The supplementations with DHQ or DDRP increased the average body weight by 7.74 - 9.05%, the average daily gain by 27.06 - 30.13%, and feed to gain ratio by 12.53 - 15.99%, while decreasing the feed intake by 5.24 - 13.84% and the average liver weight by 10.53 - 21.12% compared to the control group. Both supplementations did not cause pathological changes in the histological structure of pigs' liver and ovaries; and had no influence on pH values and proximate composition of m. Longissimus thoracis and m. Semimembranosus. No pH determined stress-induced muscle damage was found and the pork carcasses were classified in classes E and U. The two used supplementations reduced the blood LDL cholesterol by 13.27 - 14.29 % and increased the erythrocytes, platelets, hematocrit, mean red blood cell count, mean hemoglobin concentration in erythrocytes, triglycerides and total cholesterol as well. The addition of 3.5 mg DHQ/kg/d or 0.545 g DDRP/kg/d to pigs 'diet can be used as growth promoters of natural origin with a favorable effect on blood metabolites and meat quality, due to their bioactive properties.

AB  - Long-term mining activities in the mercury-thallium mining area of Lanmuchang, southwestern China, resulting in contamination of surrounding soils with complex toxic elements such as Tl, As, Sb, Hg, and Cd. While manure aids in pollution control and soil fertilization, its impact on Tl bioavailability in soil remains incompletely understood. This study explored the physiological changes and Tl accumulation in Capsicum annuum under combined pollution stress and application of livestock and poultry manure near the Lanmuchang mining area. The results showed that chicken manure promoted Tl accumulation in Capsicum annuum, whereas pig and cattle manure inhibited it, with pig manure exhibiting the strongest inhibitory effect. Both pig and cattle manure reduced the transpiration rate of Capsicum annuum, which decreased the driving force for Tl transport to the plant's upper parts. Additionally, manure increased organic acid secretion in Capsicum annuum roots and decreased soil Eh. This led to a reduction in Tl3+ to the more stable Tl+, which decreased the content of exchangeable Tl form and its activity. Pig manure significantly reduced Tl content in stems, leaves, and fruits by increasing the area of the Casparian bands in Capsicum annuum roots, which hindered Tl accumulation. In contrast, chicken manure had the opposite effect. The findings of this study provide important theoretical support for scientifically guiding agricultural production safety in areas contaminated with the heavy metal Tl.

AB  - Background Management of most herbivorous small mammal species considered to be pests in Africa is still challenging partly because of the paucity of information on their biological traits that would help to manage their destructive impacts. This gap also precludes the potential for tapping species with potential food-value to improving the economy of rural communities through, for example, sustainable game farming programs in Africa. This study investigates the genetic diversity and population demography of the African Greater Cane rat (AGC), a rodent pest of crops and game species inhabiting two isolated blocks of the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAMs), Tanzania to contribute to the species management and conservation. Methodology and results We used non-invasive sampling techniques and DNA sequencing of the D-loop region of MtDNA (515bp) from 46 cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus) samples to characterize the genetic diversity and structure of the species and potential population threats faced in natural habitats. We found 25 haplotypes:15 from Uluguru and 9 from Udzungwa mountains populations, containing 49 polymorphic regions (32 parsimoniously informative and 17 singleton sites). Haplotype diversity (range: 0.849-0.995) did not differ substantially across populations but the median haplotype diversity for Udzungwa South was overall lower than for other populations. Nucleotide diversity averaged 0.00641, 0.01528, 0.0111 and 0.01313, respectively for Udzungwa South, Udzungwa North, Uluguru Rural and Uluguru Urban, suggesting high genetic diversity within the four populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated significantly high genetic differences between the four populations (FST = 0.16, p = 0.00098) whereas neutrality test (FU's Fs) values were negative, indicating historical population expansion. Similarly, the Bayesian skyline analysis indicated a recent demographic expansion suggesting limited bottlenecks in the recent past in this population. Conclusions Our results show the AGC population in EAMs consists of four distinct populations which have experienced a recent population expansion, especially among the urban population due perhaps to influence of urbanization process that may have favored assisted species movements across the rural-urban landscapes. Future research should focus on understanding impact of geographical isolation on the genetic structure and diversity of this species.

AB  - Two species of wild sheep inhabit Iran: Asiatic mouflon (Ovis gmelini) and urial (O. vignei). Phylogenetic relationships between populations distributed in this country are complex and still remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify, by genetic assessment, the phylogenetic status of Kerman wild sheep, considered to be a hybrid of the two species. For this purpose, we created a dataset that included specimens of O. gmelini, O. vignei, and Kerman sheep. We applied genome-wide SNP genotyping technology to analyze population structure and genetic diversity of these groups. Using Neighbor-Net and PCA plots, it was demonstrated that Kerman sheep were differentiated from other groups and occupy an intermediate position between O. gmelini and O. vignei. Using Admixture analysis, two ancestral components were identified in this population; however, admixed ancestry was not confirmed by f3 statistics. Genetic diversity in Kerman wild sheep was significantly higher than in any group of O. vignei, but lower than in O. gmelini. Additionally, we examined complete mitochondrial genomes and it was demonstrated that the matrilineal ancestor of Kerman sheep belonged to O. vignei. Our results lead to the conclusion that Kerman wild sheep can be recognized as a separate subspecies of O. vignei.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of different farming systems and lactation stages on the physicochemical characteristics, somatic cell count (SCC), and total bacterial count (TBC) of milk from Skopelos goats. This study was conducted over two consecutive lactation periods on two commercial farms in Greece, an extensive system on Skopelos Island and an intensive system in the Attica region, involving 237 goats of shared genetic background, thereby minimizing genetic variability and strengthening the validity of the comparisons between the production systems. Higher milk yields were observed in the extensive system (0.98 vs. 0.85 kg/day), while milk from this system also had a higher protein (3.57% vs. 3.47%; p < 0.001) and casein content (2.72% vs. 2.57%; p < 0.001), which are traits favorable for cheese production. Fat content peaked during mid-lactation (4.83%; p < 0.05) and remained unaffected by the farming system. Lactose declined from early (4.74%) to late lactation (4.42%; p < 0.001). Both SCC and TBC were significantly elevated in the extensive system (p < 0.001), possibly due to hand milking, environmental exposure, and less-controlled hygiene conditions. These findings highlight a trade-off between the nutritional advantages of extensive systems and challenges related to milk hygiene. A balanced approach, optimizing both quality and sustainability, is recommended.

AB  - Six new species of Amblypsilopus Bigot, 1888 from the Afrotropical region are described and illustrated: A. gabonensis sp. nov. from Gabon, A. martini sp. nov., A. mufindiensis sp. nov. and A. udzungwensis sp. nov. from Tanzania, A. milleri sp. nov. from South Africa, and A. spiniscapus sp. nov. from Ivory Coast. Amblypsilopus gabonensis sp. nov. and A. spiniscapus sp. nov. are remarkable in having a setose antennal scape. Amblypsilopus martini sp. nov. and A. mufindiensis sp. nov. are peculiar in bearing very long setae on the antennal pedicel, mesonotum and scutellum. Amblypsilopus milleri sp. nov. is considered a member of the South African A. .fasciatus species group despite its unmodified wing venation. The new species differ also from other similar representatives of the genus in the morphology of the male cercus and the male secondary sexual characters on the legs. The male of A. bevisi (Curran, 1927) is described for the first time. The following species described from females are considered doubtful (nomina dubia): A. flavicollis (Becker, 1923), A. rectangularis (Parent, 1937), A. sudanensis (Parent, 1939) and A. tropicalis (Parent, 1933). Amblypsilopus subfascipennis (Curran, 1926) has a strongly sinuate wing vein dm-m and is transferred to Chrysosoma Guerin-Meneville, 1831 (comb. nov.). Chrysosoma ungulatum Parent, 1941 from Principe with an almost straight vein dm-m is transferred to Amblypsilopus (comb. nov.). Chrysosoma centrale Becker, 1923 from Tanzania also has a straight wing vein dm-m and modified fore tarsus, being very close in habitus to A. steelei Grichanov, 1996, and is also transferred to Amblypsilopus (comb. nov.). Chrysosoma asperum Parent, 1933 from South Africa has the same characters, is almost identical to South African A. bevisi and is also transferred here to Amblypsilopus (comb. nov.) and newly synonymized with A. bevisi (syn. nov.). Presently, 66 reliable species of Amblypsilopus are known from the Afrotropical region, including 37 from the Afrotropical mainland. A revised identification key to males of species of the Afrotropical mainland is provided. New records are given for some known species. The species diversity of the Afrotropical fauna and variability of morphological characters in the genus Amblypsilopus are briefly discussed.

AB  - Stillbirth (SB) is a threshold character that has been detected as the most important factor affecting the future reproductive life of an animal. In buffaloes, stillbirth accounts for approximately 42% of all reproductive disorders being considered as the main reproductive disorder in buffalo calves. The present study aimed to estimate the heritability values and to determine the genetic and phenotypic correlation between stillbirth rate and birth weight (BW) using a Bayesian approach via Gibbs sampling method in a river buffalo population. A stochastic simulation was used to create a population in which random mating was used for 15 discrete generations. A bivariate animal model including maternal effects was used. Maternal effects were significant (p < .05) for both BW and SB. The results showed that when the SB rate increased from 1% to 50%, the estimated direct heritability of SB increased. Yet, by increasing the SB rate from 50% to 99%, a decrease of the SB estimated direct heritability was observed. The genetic correlation between BW and SB was decreased by increasing the level of occurrence of SB in the population from 1% to 99%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of heritability was increased from 40% to 70% level of occurrence of SB. Based on findings, it can be concluded that to reduce stillbirth rate in the population, it is possible to use genetic improvement program and birth weight could be one of the main components of a selection goal.

AB  - Species is the fundamental taxonomic unit in biology and its delimitation has implications for conservation. In giraffe (Giraffa spp.), multiple taxonomic classifications have been proposed since the early 1900s.(1) However, one species with nine subspecies has been generally accepted,(2) likely due to limited in-depth assessments, subspecies hybridizing in captivity,(3,4) and anecdotal reports of hybrids in the wild.(5) Giraffe taxonomy received new attention after population genetic studies using traditional genetic markers suggested at least four species.(6,7) This view has been met with controversy,(8) setting the stage for debate.(9,10) Genomics is significantly enhancing our understanding of biodiversity and speciation relative to traditional genetic approaches and thus has important implications for species delineation and conservation.(11) We present a high-quality de novo genome assembly of the critically endangered Kordofan giraffe (G. camelopardalis antiquorum)(12) and a comprehensive whole-genome analysis of 50 giraffe representing all traditionally recognized subspecies. Population structure and phylogenomic analyses support four separately evolving giraffe lineages, which diverged 230-370 ka ago. These lineages underwent distinct demographic histories and show different levels of heterozygosity and inbreeding. Our results strengthen previous findings of limited gene flow and admixture among putative giraffe species(6,7,9) and establish a genomic foundation for recognizing four species and seven subspecies, the latter of which should be considered as evolutionary significant units. Achieving a consensus over the number of species and subspecies in giraffe is essential for adequately assessing their threat level and will improve conservation efforts for these iconic taxa.

AB  - There are clues that calcium (Ca) isotope composition of vertebrate bioapatite is influenced by diet and trophic level. These clues however conflict with several cases of mammal species exhibiting Ca-44 isotope compositions which are inconsistent with their trophic levels. These observations support that diet may not be the only factor driving the Ca isotope composition in mammalian enamel and bone. To investigate this question, we selected a modern Cervus elaphus population (Bauges Natural Regional Park, Alps, France) to serve as a model for Ca isotope physiology of cervids and other mammals. Subsequently, we reinvestigated the case of the fossil Rangifer tarandus population from Jaurens (Late Pleistocene locality, 32.6 to 29.7 kyr BP, France), a population for which abnormal "Ca-depleted isotope compositions (regarding the low trophic level of reindeers) have been previously documented. By combining bone samplings and serial enamel micro-samplings, we discuss the main potential sources of Ca isotopic variability in bioapatite of young and adult individuals. This includes the effects of gestation, lactation, antlerogenesis, browser-grazer ecologies, osteophagia and natural mineral licks. Our results suggest an important effect of lactation on bone Ca isotope composition (delta Ca-44/42 = +0.19 + 0.09 parts per thousand; 95% confidence interval), whereas other factors such as gestation or antlerogenesis seem more secondary. Our enamel micro sampling method allowed to detect when enamel Ca isotope composition could be affected by milk consumption or mineral supplementation. Thanks to these advances, we collected new data from the Pleistocene reindeers of Jaurens, which are now consistent with their known low trophic level and plant-based diet. This demonstrates that disentangling ecological and physiological signals within enamel Ca isotope compositions is possible by using serial micro-sampling. This approach allows retrieving accurate trophic information from this proxy and truly pushes forward the limits of Ca isotope applications regarding paleoecology, physiology and ethology.

AB  - South American camelids inhabit high-altitude environments characterized by hypoxia, influencing embryonic, fetal, and placental development. This study examined the term placenta morphology of alpacas (Vicugna pacos, N = 12) and the immunoexpression of antioxidant selenoproteins (SP). We hypothesize that the placenta of alpacas, adapted to high altitudes, has characteristics with other species also adapted to altitude. Placentas were paraffin-embedded, sectioned (3-5 mu m), stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome, and picrosirius red, and analyzed via light and polarized light microscopy. The chorion showed simple cuboidal epithelium with binucleated cells, a subepithelial mesenchyme rich in blood capillaries (area: 124.90 +/- 9.82 mu m2), and type III collagen fibers. The chorionic villi measured 2740.22 +/- 132.75 mu m. The allantois contained a simple columnar epithelium and mesenchyme with type I collagen fibers. Immunohistochemistry localized SP-N, SP-P, Dio-3, and GPx-3 in the blood capillaries and mesenchymal tissue of the chorion but not in the allantois. These findings were compared to human and sheep placentas from different altitudes due to a lack of camelid data at low levels. The morphological features resembled adaptations to hypoxia observed in other species. This preliminary study suggests a potential role for selenoproteins in hypoxia adaptation, providing a basis for future functional studies.

AB  - The key to ensuring the stable operation of deep-sea mining systems lies in the ability of deep-sea mining vehicles to traverse deep-sea sediment consistently. Deep-sea sediment exhibits low shear strength and a minimal internal friction angle, resulting in limited traction force available to the mining vehicles. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the shear interaction between grousers and the sediment, as well as to design grousers that provide enhanced traction to facilitate the stable movement of the mining vehicles. In this paper, we established a numerical model of track plate-sediment interaction using the discrete element method. The particle contact parameters were determined based on the in-situ shear strength of deep-sea sediment. The influence of various parameters on the shear effects of straight grousers was investigated, and the numerical results were compared with indoor tests and theoretical analyses. Since buffalo hooves can provide significant bearing capacity in soft soil, three types of bionic grousers were designed. By comparing the numerical results of the bionic grousers with straight grousers, we observed that bionic grousers exhibited distinct characteristics, including an increase in shear force and a reduction in adhesion force, and we elucidated the mechanisms of these characteristics.

AB  - At present, the monitoring technology of the growth status of sika deer antlers faces many challenges in a complex breeding environment (such as light change, object occlusion, etc.). More importantly, an effective method for the segmentation of sika deer antlers is still lacking, which hinders the development of subsequent quality classification of sika deer antlers. In order to fill the research gap and lay a foundation for future sika deer antler quality classification, this paper proposed an improved semantic segmentation model based on U-Net, named SDAS-Net. In order to improve the segmentation accuracy and generalization ability of the model in a complex environment, we introduced a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform module (2D-DWT) in the encoder head to reduce noise interference and enhance the ability to capture features. In order to compensate for the loss of feature information caused by 2D-DWT, we embedded the Star Blocks module in the encoder. In addition, the efficient mixed channel attention (EMCA) module was introduced to adaptively enhance key feature channels in the decoder, and the dual cross-attention mechanism (DCA) module was used to fuse high-dimensional features in skip connections. To verify the validity of the model, we constructed a 1055-image sika deer antler dataset (SDR). The experimental results show that compared with the baseline model, the performance of the SDAS-Net model is significantly improved, reaching 92.12% in MIoU and 93.63% in the PA index, and the number of parameters is only increased by 6.9%. The results show that the SDAS-Net model can effectively deal with the task of sika deer antler segmentation in a complex breeding environment while maintaining high precision.

AB  - Simple Summary The collared peccary is a wild ungulate important for the maintenance of ecosystems in the Americas. The in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique can contribute to the conservation of and knowledge about the reproductive characteristics of this species. The collared peccary's spermatozoa are sensitive to stress conditions. Therefore, the steps of seminal plasma (SP) removal and sperm selection for fertilization need to be determined. Consequently, the most used methods in domestic ungulate species, namely, swim-up, Percoll(& REG;) gradient (PG), and washing by centrifugation (WC), were evaluated. Initially, it was observed that regardless of the sample preparation for the swim-up (with SP or without SP), this method was not efficient in isolating motile sperm. Different PG concentrations were compared, revealing PG 45-90% recovered spermatozoa with better motility patterns compared to PG 35-70% and non-selected sperm. Then, PG 45-90% was compared to WC for sperm motility and heterologous IVF with swine oocytes. PG 45-90% showed better motility patterns, but the rate of fertilization and development of embryos were similar compared to WC. Therefore, PG 45-90% and WC are recommended for SP removal and sperm selection in the collared peccary. Methods for seminal plasma (SP) removal and the selection of collared peccary sperm for fertilization were compared. The experiments evaluated the following: the (I) impact of centrifugation for SP removal before swim-up for sperm selection and (II) a comparison of different Percoll(& REG;) gradient densities (PG 45-90% and PG 35-70%). Non-selected sperm served as the control. Sperm quality was assessed based on motility patterns, morphology, membrane functional integrity, viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and DNA integrity. Subsequently, the most successful group in the previous experiment and washing by centrifugation (WC) were compared for motility patterns and fertilization using pig oocytes. Swim-up decreased motility and enhanced ROS compared to the control. Centrifugation before swim-up harmed integrity and viability compared to the control. PG 45-90% (96.8 vs. 69.7 vs. 40.7 & mu;m/s) allowed for a better velocity average pathway (VAP), a better velocity straight line, and better linearity (LIN) than those of the control and PG 35-70% (88.4 vs. 56.0 vs. 27.3 & mu;m/s). Thus, PG 45-90% was used for fertilization. PG 45-90% obtained a higher VAP, a higher amplitude of the lateral head, straightness, and higher LIN than those of the control and WC. Cleavage (25.2-26.3%) and morula (8.1-10.5%) rates did not differ between the groups. Therefore, PG 45-90% and WC were efficient in isolating collared peccary sperm capable of fertilizing pig oocytes.

AB  - 14,000 year old DNA reveals the evolutionary dynamics and adaptations of South American vultures.
   The New World Vulture [Coragyps] occidentalis (L. Miller, 1909) is one of many species that were extinct by the end of the Pleistocene. To understand its evolutionary history we sequenced the genome of a 14,000 year old [Coragyps] occidentalis found associated with megaherbivores in the Peruvian Andes. occidentalis has been viewed as the ancestor, or possibly sister, to the extant Black Vulture Coragyps atratus, but genomic data shows occidentalis to be deeply nested within the South American clade of atratus. Coragyps atratus inhabits lowlands, but the fossil record indicates that occidentalis mostly occupied high elevations. Our results suggest that occidentalis evolved from a population of atratus in southwestern South America that colonized the High Andes 300 to 400 kya. The morphological and morphometric differences between occidentalis and atratus may thus be explained by ecological diversification following from the natural selection imposed by this new and extreme, high elevation environment. The sudden evolution of a population with significantly larger body size and different anatomical proportions than atratus thus constitutes an example of punctuated evolution.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Weaning stress in piglets often leads to intestinal damage, inflammation, and subsequent problems, including diarrhea and hindered growth. While antimicrobials have been utilized to mitigate these side effects, concerns regarding antibiotic resistance necessitate the exploration of alternatives. Purified seaweed extracts, notably fucoidan, exhibit promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of administering a preweaning highly purified fucoidan drench to piglets on post-weaning growth, immune response, and intestinal morphology. Results demonstrated that the preweaning fucoidan drench did not elicit adverse effects on piglets. However, neither preweaning fucoidan nor an antimicrobial drench improved growth, immune response, or intestinal morphology compared to the control-treated piglets. Further research should focus on refining preweaning administrative protocols and employing commercial models to comprehensively assess fucoidan's potential to promote the health and productivity of weaner piglets and, ultimately, reduce the industry's reliance on antimicrobials. Weaning stress imposes considerable physiological challenges on piglets, often manifesting in intestinal disturbances, such as inflammation and compromised barrier function, ultimately affecting growth and health outcomes. While conventional interventions, including antimicrobials, have effectively mitigated these sequelae, concerns surrounding antimicrobial resistance necessitate the exploration of alternatives. Fucoidan, derived from brown seaweed, offers promise due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Previous research has been limited to the in-feed supplementation of partially purified fucoidan extracted from brown seaweed. The focus of the present study is assessing the effect of a preweaning drench with highly purified (85%) fucoidan on piglet growth, immune response, and intestinal morphology post-weaning. Forty-eight male piglets at 17 +/- 3 days of age (5.67 +/- 0.16 kg) were assigned to a saline (control), fucoidan, or antimicrobial group, receiving treatment as a single 18 mL oral drench three days before weaning. Monitoring for seven days post-weaning included body weight measurements, blood sample collection for the inflammatory protein assay, and small intestine morphological analysis. The findings revealed that the preweaning fucoidan drench did not elicit adverse effects on piglets. However, neither fucoidan nor antimicrobial drenches significantly enhanced growth parameters, immune markers, or intestinal morphology compared to that of the control-treated piglets (p > 0.05). The lack of response may be attributed to the high health status of the experimental cohort and the limitation of a single dosage. Future research should consider a more challenging production setting to evaluate the viability and optimal application of fucoidan as an antimicrobial alternative in the pig industry.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminants (goat and sheep) are key livestock species in supporting women's empowerment (WE) in low- and middle-income countries. Animal vaccines are essential for livestock productivity, hence an important means to support WE. WE is, in turn, important for animal vaccine adoption. Little is known, however, of how WE is associated with animal vaccination for women-controlled livestock assets (e.g., goats and sheep). Our analysis explores the link between domains of WE and knowledge of, access to, and use of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) vaccines. Such knowledge can help inform the design of livestock vaccine systems that are better able to reach women and support their empowerment. Using a partial least squares structural equilibrium model (PLS-SEM), we analyzed data collected using the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool from goat keepers in Northern Ghana, which included a module on the PPR vaccine. We found a strong direct positive association between women and men's knowledge about animal health and PPR vaccination and a strong indirect positive association between access to PPR vaccines and empowerment. Moreover, women and men goat keepers differed in the dimensions of empowerment that the PPR vaccine facets were strongly associated with-asset ownership and input into decisions concerning livestock was significant for women but not for men. Consequently, policy and actions towards enhancing women's asset ownership, input into decisions about livestock production, knowledge of animal health and vaccines, and access to vaccines are important in designing effective and equitable livestock vaccine systems. Healthy livestock provide meaningful opportunities to enhance women's empowerment (WE) in low- and middle-income countries. Animal vaccines are important to keep livestock healthy and productive. However, gender-based restrictions limit women's access to animal health services, thereby affecting the potential of livestock to enhance their empowerment. While growing empirical evidence reveals that women-controlled livestock (e.g., small ruminants) have important implications for WE and support better household nutrition outcomes, little empirical evidence exists from rigorous analyses of the relationship between WE and animal vaccines for women-controlled livestock species. Our analysis explores the relationship between WE and involvement with PPR vaccination in Ghana. Data collected using the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool from 465 women and 92 men farmers (who keep goats) from northern Ghana, and analyzed using PLS-SEM, revealed a significant direct positive association between knowledge about animal health and PPR vaccines and a significant indirect positive association between access to PPR vaccines and empowerment. The empowerment of women goat farmers, as revealed by our model's results for the relationship between empowerment and vaccine facets, was significantly represented by asset ownership and input into decisions concerning livestock. These study results reveal important considerations in designing effective and equitable livestock vaccine systems.

AB  - lncMGPF is a novel positive regulator of myogenic differentiation, muscle growth and regeneration in mouse, pig, and human. But whether natural mutations within lncMGPF gene regulate animal meat production traits is unclear. In this study, ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pig lncMGPF (plncMGPF) gene were identified among commercial pig breeds and Chinese local pig breeds. These SNPs are highly linked and constructed into multiple haplotypes, and haplotype ATTCATGTTC (H1) mainly exists in commercial pig breeds while haplotype GCCTGCACCT (H3) is more frequent in Chinese local pig breeds. Association analysis indicated that all SNPs are significantly associated with the backfat thickness and loin muscle area (P < 0.05), respectively, and homologous H1 individuals have higher loin muscle area and lower backfat thickness than H3 pigs. Bioinformatics and functional analysis showed that haplotype H1 has a longer half-life and more stable RNA secondary structure than haplotype H3. plncMGPF haplotype H1 has stronger effects on pig primary myogenic progenitor cells differentiation and muscle growth than haplotype H3. Further experiments showed that two SNPs (rs81403974 and rs325492834) function together to confer plncMGPF stability and function. Our observation suggested that the SNPs in lncMGPF can change the RNA stabilities and lncMGPF function, thereby affecting the porcine meat production traits.

AB  - Tham Wiman Nakin or "Snake Cave" has so far been recognized as being the only late Middle Pleistocene Homobearing fauna, dated to older than 169 ka, in mainland Southeast Asia. Since the last two decades, the highly diversified mammal fauna found from this cave has been widely used as standard references for several studies, though the majority of fossil primates, carnivores, and ungulates have never been described in detail. This paper presents taxonomic descriptions of unpublished fossil specimens from the long-known collection of Tham Wiman Nakin. As a result, the fauna of Tham Wiman Nakin consisted of at least 28 large mammal taxa. Although several previously described specimens are re-assigned to different tooth elements and/or mammal taxa, our taxonomic study confirms the existence of most of the species identified from the previous work and describes three additional taxa for the locality: an Asian badger, a tiger, and a Himalayan goral. The Tham Wiman Nakin fauna is one of the most diverse Pleistocene mammals, including a hominin, in mainland Southeast Asia and documents long-term survivors of living species since the late Middle Pleistocene. Based on several recent dates of fossil sites in mainland Southeast Asia, biochronological data imply a possible faunal age up to the maximum of 300 ka for the Tham Wiman Nakin fauna, but younger than that of Pha Bong where Gigantopithecus was present. Fossil records in the region also suggest a relatively stable fauna through Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least from the late Middle to latest Pleistocene. The extinction occurring in the mainland varied across taxa and likely resulted in less impacted biodiversity loss prior to the Holocene, compared to other continents, as indicated by the small proportion of species becoming extinct during each interval. The importance of stable mosaic habitats through time may provide clues to the long-term survival of several large mammal taxa in the region.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of neonatal exposure to methoxychlor (MXC), a synthetic organochlorine used as an insecticide with estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activities, on luteal function in pigs. Piglets were injected subcutaneously with MXC (20 mu g/kg body weight) or corn oil (control) between postnatal Days 1 and 10 (N = 5/group). Corpora lutea from sexually mature gilts were examined for luteal steroid and prostaglandin concentrations and processed for total RNA isolation and subsequent RNA sequencing. Intra-luteal concentrations of androstenedione and prostaglandin E-2 were greater, while that of estrone was lower when compared to control. Fifty-three differentially expressed (DE) microRNAS (miRNAs) (p-adjusted <.05 and log2(fold change) >=.5) and 359 DE genes (p-adjusted <.05 and log2(fold change) >= 1) were identified in luteal tissue in response to neonatal MXC treatment. MXC was found to affect the expression of genes related to lipogenesis, steroidogenesis, membrane transport, immune response, cell signaling and adhesion. These results suggest an earlier onset of structural luteolysis in pigs caused by MXC actions in neonates. Since negative correlation analysis showed the potential interactions of miRNAs with specific messenger RNAs, we propose that these miRNAs are potential mediators of the long-term MXC effect on the CL function in pigs.

AB  - Bone cancer is considered a serious health problem, and, in many cases, it causes patient death. The X-ray, MRI, or CT-scan image is used by doctors to identify bone cancer. The manual process is time-consuming and required expertise in that field. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated system to classify and identify the cancerous bone and the healthy bone. The texture of a cancer bone is different compared to a healthy bone in the affected region. But in the dataset, several images of cancer and healthy bone are having similar morphological characteristics. This makes it difficult to categorize them. To tackle this problem, we first find the best suitable edge detection algorithm after that two feature sets one with hog and another without hog are prepared. To test the efficiency of these feature sets, two machine learning models, support vector machine (SVM) and the Random forest, are utilized. The features set with hog perform considerably better on these models. Also, the SVM model trained with hog feature set provides an F1-score of 0.92 better than Random forest F1-score 0.77.

AB  - Seed germination is a critical phase in the plant lifecycle of Camellia oleifera (oil tea), directly influencing seedling establishment and crop reproduction. In this study, we examined transcriptomic and physiological changes across five defined germination stages (G0-G4), from radicle dormancy to cotyledon emergence. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we assembled 169,652 unigenes and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at each stage compared to G0, increasing from 1708 in G1 to 10,250 in G4. Functional enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of genes associated with cell wall organization, glucan metabolism, and Photosystem II assembly. Key genes involved in cell wall remodeling, including cellulose synthase (CESA), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (COMT), and peroxidase (POD) showed progressive activation during germination. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed dynamic regulation of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and hormone signaling pathways. Transcription factors such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF), and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) were upregulated, suggesting hormone-mediated regulation of dormancy release and seedling development. Physiologically, cytokinin (CTK) and IAA levels peaked in G4, antioxidant enzyme activities were highest in G2, and starch content increased toward later stages. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed germination in C. oleifera and identify candidate genes relevant to rootstock breeding and nursery propagation.

AB  - Sea urchins are primary herbivores on coral reefs, regulating algal biomass and facilitating coral settlement and growth.(1-12) Recurringmass mortality events (MMEs) of Diadema species Gray, 1825 have been recorded globally,(13-23) the most notorious and ecologically significant of which occurred in the Caribbean in 1983,(14,17,19,20) contributing to the shift from coral to algal-dominated ecosystems.(17,24,25) Recently, first evidence of Diadema setosum mass mortality was reported from the eastern Mediterranean Sea.(23) Here, we report extensive mass mortalities of several diadematoid species inhabiting the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean (WIO)(26-28) including first evidence of mortalities in the genus Echinothrix Peters, 1853. Mortalities initiated in the Gulf of Aqaba on December 2022 and span the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Western Indian Ocean (Reunion Island), with population declines reaching 100% at some sites. Infected individuals are characterized by spine loss and tissue necrosis, resulting in exposed skeletons (i.e., tests) and mortality. Molecular diagnostics of the 18S rRNA gene confirm the presence of a waterborne scuticociliate protozoan most closely related to Philaster apodigitiformis in infected specimens-identical to the pathogen found in the 2022 Caribbean mass mortality of Diadema antillarum.(13,15,18) Collapse of these key benthic grazers in the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean may lead to algal dominance over corals, threatening the stability of coral reefs on a regional scale.(29-32) We issue a warning regarding the further expansion of mortalities and call for immediate monitoring and conservation efforts for these key ecological species.

AB  - The prolactin (PRL) hormone is a major regulator of mammary gland development and lactation. However, it remains unclear whether and how PRL contributes to mammary epithelial cell proliferation and secretion. The Boer and Macheng black crossbred goats are superior in reproduction, meat, and milk, and are popular in Hubei province. To elucidate the mechanisms of PRL on mammary growth and lactation, to improve the local goat economic trade, we have performed studies on these crossbred goats during pregnancy and early lactation, and in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). Here, we first found that the amino acid transporters of SNAT1 and SNAT2 expression in vivo and in vitro were closely associated with PRL levels, the proliferation and secretion of GMECs; knockdown and over-expression of SNAT1/2 demonstrated that PRL modulated the proliferation and lactation of GMECs through regulating SNAT1/2 expression. Transcriptome sequencing and qPCR assays demonstrated the effect of PRL on the transcriptional regulation of SNAT1 and SNAT2 in GMECs. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays further verified that the binding of the potential PRL response element in the SNAT1/2 promoter regions activated SNAT1/2 transcription after PRL stimulation. Additionally, silencing of either PRLR or STAT5 nearly abolished PRL-stimulated SNAT1/2 promoter activity, suggesting PRLR-STAT5 signaling is involved in the regulation of PRL on the transcriptional activation of SNAT1/2. These results illustrated that PRL modulates the proliferation and secretion of GMECs via PRLR-STAT5-mediated regulation of the SNAT1/2 pathway. This study provides new insights into how PRL affects ruminant mammary development and lactation through regulation of amino acid transporters.

TI  - Tensile, impact and thermal properties of farm-waste based hybrid basalt polymer composites
T2  - CLEANER MATERIALS
LA  - English
AB  - The use of conventional fiber (Glass/Carbon) reinforced polymer composites is not enough for many applications in modern world and hence hybrid polymer composites are required which can overcome the specific needs of various applications. In this study, farm-wastes are used to manufacture a hybrid composite which made it a cleaner material along with cost efficient one as well. Basalt reinforced sheep wool, paddy straw and bagasse based hybrid polymer composites with laminate structure were prepared using compression molding. Basalt fiber mats were kept on both sides of the mold and sheep wool content was varied in each composite sample. The composites then tested for their tensile, impact and thermal properties. The study on basalt-paddy straw-sheep wool and basalt-bagasse-sheep wool hybrid composites clearly brought out the effective use of waste material for producing value added product with improved properties. Varying of sheep wool also had optimum effect on these composites. Just 10% of sheep wool in these hybrid composites leads to more than 1.5 times improvement in tensile strength, 5 times increase in modulus, 3 times increase of elongation, and 2 times increase of charpy impact value at 20% sheep wool concentration. The thermal stability is also improved by 8-10 degrees as degradation temperature is increased. The sheep wool is more effective in basalt-paddy straw hybrid composite than the bagasse hybrid one.

AB  - Understanding the role of divergent host-use in promoting population differentiation among herbivorous insects provides valuable insight into the origin of diversity in this species-rich group. A strong signature of divergent selection in promoting population differentiation is provided by parallel phenotypic divergence across multiple insect species adapting to the same set of divergent host plants. In this study, we explored whether a key phenotype of gall-forming insects-gall size-exhibits parallel patterns of divergence across a community of gall-forming insect species because of adaptation to different host plant species. A previous study found parallel divergence in gall morphology across two gall-forming insect species adapted to two sister species of oaks (Fagaceae). Here, we expand this question to four additional members of the gall-forming insect community that specialise on the same two host plant species: Quercus geminata (Qg) and Quercus virginiana (Qv). Consistent with the previous result, all four additional gall-forming species tended to induce larger galls on Qg than on Qv, with two of the four species exhibited statistically significant differences and one species showed marginally significant differences. Moreover, we found gall size was similar for two gall-forming species when cross-reared on natural versus planted hosts, ruling out environmental causes of parallel host-associated gall size difference across multiple species. Our study documents parallel divergence in a key phenotype of gall-forming insects associated with different host environments, shedding light on the important role of divergent host use in driving the evolution of gall morphology.

AB  - 3D modelling of buildings using modern tools and techniques is an important objective for the management and planning of urban areas. Rhinoceros with Grasshopper is a powerful 3D modeller in the field of architecture, engineering and construction. In this paper, 3D modelling of several case studies based on the joint use of Rhinoceros and Grasshopper are shown. In particular, different levels of geometric complexity and detail are investigated. In order to achieve these objectives, adequate canvas designs have been developed according to the different case studies examined; specifically, several cases have been analysed, starting from simple volumes up to complex geometries and even large dimensions. The input sources for the elaborations in Grasshopper can be multiple; for example, numerical cartography, geodata from Open Street Map and point clouds generated by airborne LIDAR sensors were analysed. The 3D models generated in this way have parametric characteristics that are useful for integration into Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for analysis and simulation, or for visualising projects from illustrations to photorealistic renderings.

AB  - A small -plot field experiment with sugar beet (Beta vulgaris provar. altissima Doell.) was focused on the monitoring of year weather conditions, selected genotypes and stimulating substances on the formation of quantitative and qualitative parameters. The experiment was carried out in the Center for Plant Biology and Ecology in Nitra during the years 2021 - 2022. The area is located at an altitude of 170 - 175 m above sea level in a corn production area with warm and dry climatic characteristics. The results of the experiment confirmed a statistically proven effect of the year conditions (P < 0.01) on the formation of quantitative and qualitative production parameters. In the range of monitored factors, agro-ecological conditions were more favourable in 2021, when a statistically higher root yield of 68.99 t/ha (+9.68 t/ ha; rel. 16.32%) also sugar content of 16.75% (+0.68%; rel. 4.21%) were recorded. The statistical analysis confirmed a highly significant relationship (P < 0.01) between selected varieties and quantitative or qualitative production parameters. In the range of monitored genotypes, the highest root yield was recorded by Darvas 65.83 t/ha (+1.68 t/ha; rel. 2.62%) and the highest sugar content was indicated by Okapi 16.59% (+0.18%; rel. 1.11%). Implementation of stimulating substances with adaptogens positively affects the yield and sugar content of sugar beet. Stimulating preparations statistically affect (P < 0.01) the formation of monitored production parameters. The highest root yield of 67.40 t/ha (+7.56 t/ha; rel. 12.64%) and sugar content of 16.58% (+0.47%; rel. 2,91%) was indicated by variant 2 (Energeen Cleanstorm).

AB  - The influence of plants in the diversification of herbivorous insects, specifically those that utilize moribund and dead hosts, is little explored. Host shifts are expected because the effectiveness of toxic secondary chemicals is lessened by decay of dead plants. Feeding on dead plants also releases herbivorous insect lineages from diversifying within a particular plant lineage. Thus, phylogenetic constraints on the herbivorous insect lineage imposed by the host plants are diminished and repeated patterns of species diversification in an association with unrelated host trees is hypothesized (i.e., taxon cycle). Scolytini, a diverse weevil tribe, specialize on many different dead and moribund plant taxa as a source of food. These species and their hosts offer an opportunity to examine the association between dead host plants and the extent of phylogenetic constraints. A phylogeny of the Scolytini was reconstructed with likelihood and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequence data from nuclear (28S, CAD, ArgK) and mitochondrial (COI) genes. Ancestral host usage and geography was reconstructed using likelihood criteria and conservation of host use was tested. Results supported a monophyletic Scolytini, Ceratolepis, Loganius , and a paraphyletic Scolytus, Camptocerus and Cnemonyx. Diversification of the Scolytini generally occurred well after their host taxa diversified and suggests a sequential evolution of host use. In this scenario the beetle imposes little selection pressure on the tree but the tree provides a platform for beetle evolution. Major changes in host tree use occurred during periods of global cooling associated with changes in beetle biogeography. Diversification of beetles occurred on common and widespread hosts and there was likely a single origination of conifer-feeding from angiosperm-feeding species during the early Pliocene and a radiation of beetle species from the Palearctic to the Nearctic. Overall, the observed patterns of Scolytini host use are conserved and are similar to those expected in a taxon pulse diversification. That is, after a host switch to an unrelated tree, the beetles diversify within the host plant lineage. The need to locate an ephemeral food resource, i.e., a dying tree, likely maintains host specificity once a host shift occurs. These findings suggest that characteristics of dead and moribund host plants (e.g. secondary chemicals) influence the diversification of these saproxlic weevils despite the reduction of selection pressures.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a globally prevalent contagious disease caused by the positive-strand RNA PRRS virus (PRRSV), resulting in substantial economic losses in the swine industry. Modifying the CD163 SRCR5 domain, either through deletion or substitution, can eff1ectively confer resistance to PRRSV infection in pigs. However, large fragment modifications in pigs inevitably raise concerns about potential adverse effects on growth performance. Reducing the impact of genetic modifications on normal physiological functions is a promising direction for developing PRRSV-resistant pigs. In the current study, we identified a specific functional amino acid in CD163 that influences PRRSV proliferation. Viral infection experiments conducted on Marc145 and PK-15 CD163 cells illustrated that the mE535G or corresponding pE529G mutations markedly inhibited highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) proliferation by preventing viral binding and entry. Furthermore, individual viral challenge tests revealed that pigs with the E529G mutation had viral loads two orders of magnitude lower than wild-type (WT) pigs, confirming effective resistance to HP-PRRSV. Examination of the physiological indicators and scavenger function of CD163 verified no significant differences between the WT and E529G pigs. These findings suggest that E529G pigs can be used for breeding PRRSV-resistant pigs, providing novel insights into controlling future PRRSV outbreaks.

AB  - . We sampled the Lepidoptera fauna of the Californian San Joaquin Desert (SJD) over 12 years (2004-2016) and supplemented our results with species reported on iNaturalist and SCAN websites. We recorded 468 species representing 45 families in 20 superfamilies. In addition, there were another 200-250 specimens which we could not identify, in the Nepticuloidea, Tineoidea, Gracillarioidea and Gelechioidea superfamilies. These were not included in the general tally. Based upon known or published larval hosts, 70% of the recorded species are monophagous, feeding on plants in 45 families. Asteraceae was the most frequently used host plant family, sustaining 51 herbivore species. The remaining 29% are polyphagous. Many of the latter are potential crop pests and are more prevalent in the northeastern region of the Valley where agricultural activities are most intense. We found only one SJD endemic species, Schinia carrizoensis Osborne (Noctuidae) and one near-endemic, Euproserpinus euterpe Edwards (Sphingidae). The most diverse area was the southern region with 302 recorded species, while the least diverse was the Valley Floor area, with 162 species. Recognition of the historical aridity of this region and the establishment of restoration measures that consider the past and current desert-like environment and the effects of human activities and climate changes would benefit the entire flora and fauna of the SJD.

AB  - Nonetheless the key roles of growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) genes in livestock growth traits (including body measurements), few studies deployed them in camels, unlike other livestock species (cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat). So, this study was performed to investigate the genetic polymorphism of GH and IGF-1 markers, in Maghrabi camels by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing tools, with assessing the impacted live body measurements traits. In this study, 65 blood samples were collected from Maghrabi camel, and different body measurements were valued. Different genotypes of GH and IGF-1 genes were determined, via SSCP-PCR and sequencing tools. The results pointed out one genotype for the IGF-I gene, and three genotypes for the GH gene, with 23.21, 42.85, and 33.95 frequencies, of AA, AB, and BB genotypes, respectively. The sequence analysis showed specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for both A and B alleles. Those SNPs triggered alteration in some of the amino acids. Moreover, individuals of the BB genotype recorded the highest value in body weight, Neck length, Height at lumbar area, Anterior limb length, Neck circumference, and increased Body length associated with the AA genotype. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences, between the three genotypes, for the other body measurements. This study found that Maghrabi camels possess three genotypes of the GH gene and one genotype of the IGFI gene, and the BB genotype of the GH gene was associated with high performance of growth traits. Therefore, it is useful to use camel individuals, with the BB genotype of the GH gene, in camelid breeding programs, to improve live body measurement traits.

AB  - Plant trait variation is thought to suppress herbivore performance, but experiments typically manipulate only a single mean level of the trait. We manipulated the mean and variation of the concentration of a plant toxin in a model plant-herbivore system across three field and greenhouse experiments. Plants with leaves painted with a higher mean toxin concentration exhibited increased fitness and resistance to herbivores; however, at high mean concentrations, variation reduced the defensive effect, while at lower mean concentrations, variation enhanced it. This reversal aligns with models that include herbivore food selectivity, but our simulations revealed that the benefits of food selectivity for herbivores were minimal. Instead, nonlinear averaging and physiological tracking effects likely drove patterns in plant fitness and resistance to herbivores. We suggest that high defense variation in plants may be a widespread defensive phenotype, but for well-defended plants, variation may inadvertently promote herbivore niche expansion.

AB  - Polymorphism of the prion protein gene (PRNP) gene determines an animal's susceptibility to scrapie. Three polymorphisms at codons 136, 154, and 171 have been linked to classical scrapie susceptibility, although many variants of PRNP have been reported. However, no study has investigated scrapie susceptibility in Nigerian sheep from the drier agro-climate zones. In this study, we aimed to identify PRNP polymorphism in nucleotide sequences of 126 Nigerian sheep by comparing them with public available studies on scrapie-affected sheep. Further, we deployed Polyphen-2, PROVEAN, and AMYCO analyses to determine the structure changes produced by the non-synonymous SNPs. Nineteen (19) SNPs were found in Nigerian sheep with 14 being non-synonymous. Interestingly, one novel SNP (T718C) was identified. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the allele frequencies of PRNP codon 154 between sheep in Italy and Nigeria. Based on the prediction by Polyphen-2, R154H was probably damaging while H171Q was benign. Contrarily, all SNPs were neutral via PROVEAN analysis while two haplotypes (HYKK and HDKK) had similar amyloid propensity of PRNP with resistance haplotype in Nigerian sheep. Our study provides valuable information that could be possibly adopted in programs targeted at breeding for scrapie resistance in sheep from tropical regions.

AB  - The industrial processing of crude propolis generates residues. Essential oils (EOs) from propolis residues could be a potential source of natural bioactive compounds to replace antibiotics and synthetic antioxidants in pig production. In this study, we determined the antibacterial/antioxidant activity of EOs from crude organic propolis (EOP) and from propolis residues, moist residue (EOMR), and dried residue (EODR), and further elucidated their chemical composition. The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation, and their volatile profile was tentatively identified by GC-MS. All EOs had an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum as they caused disturbances on the growth kinetics of both bacteria. However, EODR had more selective antibacterial activity, as it caused a higher reduction in the maximal culture density (D) of E. coli (86.7%) than L. plantarum (46.9%). EODR exhibited mild antioxidant activity, whereas EOMR showed the highest antioxidant activity (ABTS = 0.90 mu mol TE/mg, FRAP = 463.97 mu mol Fe2+/mg) and phenolic content (58.41 mg GAE/g). Each EO had a different chemical composition, but alpha-pinene and beta-pinene were the major compounds detected in the samples. Interestingly, specific minor compounds were detected in a higher relative amount in EOMR and EODR as compared to EOP. Therefore, these minor compounds are most likely responsible for the biological properties of EODR and EOMR. Collectively, our findings suggest that the EOs from propolis residues could be resourcefully used as natural antibacterial/antioxidant additives in pig production.

AB  - Estimating animal behaviour during heat stress (HS) is particularly insightful to monitor animal welfare but also to better understand how animals thermoregulate. The present study is a proof of concept combining computer vision to monitor animal behaviour, continuous monitoring of subcutaneous temperature and recording of ambient temperature, with the aim to study the link between behaviour and animal body temperature during HS. A total of 22 pigs were video-monitored from 8:00 to 18.00 under two contrasted conditions: HS corresponding to the tropical climate (between 20.3 degrees C and 27.9 degrees C) and Thermoneutral (TN) consisting of an indoor temperature-controlled room at 22 degrees C. Animal temperature (Tmuscle) and ambient temperature were monitored continuously using temperature loggers. Pig postures estimated by a neural network show that animal in HS spend more time lying laterally and less time lying sternally than in TN. Moreover, in HS, the length of the lateral sequences increased with the outdoor ambient temperature. The ability of an animal to dissipate heat while lying laterally was quantified through a Heat Dissipation Coefficient (HDC), combining Tmuscle and lateral lying sequence duration, and showed great individual variation. A Heat Discomfort Index (HDI) was also determined to quantify the difference in time spent lying laterally between HS and TN and could be useful as a proxy to quantify animal welfare reduction due to HS. This study demonstrates that combining image analysis to monitor animal behaviour and physiological data is an efficient tool to derive quantitative criterion to characterize animal welfare and traits related to heat tolerance.

AB  - Associative learning and memory mechanisms drive interoceptive signaling along the gut-brain axis, thus shaping affective-emotional reactions and behavior. Specifically, learning to predict potentially harmful, visceral pain is assumed to succeed within very few trials. However, the temporal dynamics of cerebellar and cerebral fMRI signal changes underlying early acquisition and extinction of learned fear signals and the concomitant evolvement of safety learning remain incompletely understood.
   3 T fMRI data of healthy individuals from three studies were uniformly processed across the whole brain and the cerebellum. All studies employed differential delay conditioning (N = 94) with one visual cue (CS+) being repeatedly paired with visceral pain as unconditioned stimulus (US) while a second cue remained unpaired (CS). During subsequent extinction (N = 51), all CS were presented without US.
   Behavioral results revealed increased CS+-aversiveness and CS -pleasantness after conditioning and diminished valence ratings for both CS following extinction. During early acquisition, the CS - induced linearly increasing neural activation in the insula, midcingulate cortex, hippocampus, precuneus as well as cerebral and cerebellar somatomotor regions. The comparison between acquisition and extinction phases yielded a CS- induced linear increase in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus during early acquisition, while there was no evidence for linear fMRI signal changes for the CS+ during acquisition and for both CS during extinction.
   Based on theoretical accounts of discrimination and temporal difference learning, these results suggest a gradual evolvement of learned safety cues that engage emotional arousal, memory, and cortical modulatory networks. As safety signals are presumably more difficult to learn and to discriminate from learned threat cues, the underlying temporal dynamics may reflect enhanced salience and prediction processing as well as increasing demands for attentional resources and the integration of multisensory information. Maladaptive responses to learned safety signals are a clinically relevant phenotype in multiple conditions, including chronic visceral pain, and can be exceptionally resistant to modification or extinction. Through sustained hypervigilance, safety seeking constitutes one key component in pain and stress-related avoidance behavior, calling for future studies targeting the mechanisms of safety learning and extinction to advance current cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches.

AB  - The cyber security field has witnessed several intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that are critical to the detection of malicious activities in network traffic. In the last couple of years, much research has been conducted in this field; however, in the present circumstances, network attacks are increasing in both volume and diverseness. The objective of this research work is to introduce new IDSs based on a combination of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Optimized Gradient Boost Decision Trees (OGBDTs). To improve classification, enhanced African Buffalo Optimizations (EABOs) are used. Optimization Gradient Boost Decision Trees (OGBDT-IDS) include data exploration, preprocessing, standardization, and feature ratings/selection modules. In high-dimensional data, GAs are appropriate tools for selecting features. In machine learning techniques (MLTs), gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are used as a base learner, and the predictions are added to the set of trees. In this study, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods improve cyber intrusion detection for unused and new cases. Based on performance evaluations, the proposed IDS (OGBDT) performs better than traditional MLTs. The performances are evaluated by comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score using the UNBS-NB 15, KDD 99, and CICIDS2018 datasets. The proposed IDS has the highest attack detection rates, and can predict attacks in all datasets in the least amount of time.

AB  - Social genetic effects (SGEs) refer to how the genotypes of other individuals impact an individual's phenotype within a population. These effects significantly influence the feeding behavior and production performance in pigs, though their mechanisms are not well understood. This study examined two pig groups with extreme SGE values for residual feed intake (RFI), analyzing their feeding behavior and the molecular mechanisms involved using transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of liver and ileum tissues. Pigs with higher SGE values exhibited distinct feeding patterns, spending more time at the feeder but making fewer visits. They consumed less overall feed but had a higher intake per visit. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were identified in the liver and ileum and were associated with processes such as mitochondrial functions, oxidative phosphorylation, and cholesterol metabolism. Integrated analysis supported these findings. Combined transcriptome and proteome analysis identified potential key genes that were associated with processes including mitochondrial processes, oxidative phosphorylation, fat digestion and absorption, and cholesterol metabolism. The results showed that pigs with differing SGE values display different feeding behaviors and utilize distinct molecular pathways affecting RFI. These findings offer valuable insights into how SGEs influence feed efficiency and shed light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying it.

AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is a neonicotinoid compound widely used in agriculture production, causing surface water pollution and threatening non-target organisms. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of IMI on grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) liver cell (L8824) injury. The L8824 cells were exposed to different doses of IMI (65 mg/L, 130 mg/L and 260 mg/L) for 24 h. Our results demonstrated that exposure IMI significantly sup-pressed the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and T-AOC) and accumulated oxidase (MDA) levels, and promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in L8824 cells. Additionally, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), mitochondria-derived ROS and ATP content and the MitoTracker Green indicated that IMI aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing inflammation and enhancing pro-inflammatory genes (NF-kappaB, TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) expressions. However, the addition of 2 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) can reverse these adverse effects of high-dose IMI-induced. Hence, ROS is the main factor of IMI-induced mito-chondrial dysfunction and inflammation. We further found that exposure to IMI induced apoptosis, which is characterized by promoting release of cytochrome c (Cyt-C), and increasing the expression of Bcl-2-Associated X (BAX), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinases (Caspase 9 and 3), decreasing Bcl-2 level. Immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR and Western Blot results indicated that IMI exposure also activated mitophagy, which was demonstrated by the expression of mitophagy-related genes (BNIP3, LC3B and P62). Conversely, scavenging JNK by SP600125(10 mu M) alleviated the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis and mitophagy-related gene induced by high-dose IMI. Therefore, these results of study demonstrated that IMI-induced oxidative stress to regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, thus causing inflammation, mitochondrial apoptosis and mitophagy in grass carp hepatocytes through NF-kappaB/JNK pathway.

AB  - Ameliorative effects of sheep slaughterhouse waste-derived soil amendments (struvite, blood meal, bone meal) were explored and quantified by a series of comparative greenhouse trials. A scoring matrix system was developed for 25 different test plants using 300 agricultural measurements obtained for three basic growth parameters (fresh-dry plant weights and plant heights) and four different fertilizer sources including solid vermicompost. More than 70% of NH4+-N recovery from sheep slaughterhouse wastewater was achieved using a chemical combination of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O + NaH2PO4 center dot 2H(2)O, a molar ratio of Mg2+:NH4+-N:PO43-P = 1.2:1:1, a reaction pH of 9.0, an initial NH4+-N concentration of 240 mg/L, and a reaction time of 15 min. According to SEM micrographs, surface morphology of struvite exhibited a highly porous structure composed of irregularly shaped crystals of various sizes (11.34-79.38 mu m). FTIR spectroscopy verified the active functional groups on the proximity of all fertilizer sources within the spectral range of 500-3900 cm(-1). TGA-DTG-DSC thermograms of struvite revealed that the mass loss occurred in two temperature regions and reached a maximum mass loss rate of 1.63%/min at 317 degrees C. The average percentages of increase (57.55-100.62%) and performance points (69-79) corroborated that the fertility value of struvite ranked first on average in cultivation of the analyzed plant species. Findings of this agro-valorization study confirmed that sheep slaughterhouse waste-derived fertilizers could be a beneficial way to promote bio-waste management and environmentally friendly agriculture.

AB  - High ammonia (NH3) and odor emission can occur after land application of liquid animal manure. This study was aimed at evaluating NH3 loss and odor nuisance after field application of cattle manure and how it is affected by two anaerobic digestion strategies: i) digestion of cattle manure alone and ii) digestion with catch crops and dilution by water. A system of dynamic chambers with online measurements of NH3 and odorous compounds (summarized as odor activity value, OAV) was used. Two experiments were conducted under different tem-perature conditions. The results demonstrated that anaerobic digestion did not affect NH3 loss but did decrease OAV. Addition of catch crops and water to the digestion process reduced both NH3 loss and OAV. Cool tem-perature in one of the experiments had a large effect on both NH3 and odor emissions, and at high temperature the differences between treatments increased.

AB  - Research into avian olfactory abilities has so far attracted relatively limited attention due to their complex nature and methodological difficulties. To address the challenges of avian olfactory research, we screened literature spanning four decades by searching publications in the Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Based on the analyses of 80 experiments that focused on the foraging behaviour of birds, we highlight significant biases in the study of avian olfactory foraging, emphasizing gaps in bird taxa, geographical regions and methodological approaches. While much attention has been paid to the responses of seabirds to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) or of insectivorous birds to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), olfactory responses of frugivorous or nectarivorous birds remain underexplored. The predominance of studies in temperate regions further limits our understanding of bird olfaction in bird species-rich tropical areas. The detection of general traits of bird olfactory behaviour is difficult especially because of varying methodological approaches and lack of detailed information on bird and odour characteristics. Future research should distinguish between innate and learned olfactory behaviours, address the impact of environmental noise and consider individual and sex-specific differences in response to volatile compounds. Intensifying the consideration of these aspects will improve and deepen our knowledge of bird olfactory foraging behaviour and allow for ecological applications for targeted pest management and fruit dispersal strategies.

AB  - The precise and simultaneous acquisition of multiple beneficial alleles in the genome is in great demand for the development of elite pig breeders. Cytidine base editors (CBEs) that convert C:G to T:A have emerged as powerful tools for single-nucleotide replacement. Whether CBEs can effectively mediate C-to-T substitution at multiple sites/loci for trait improvement by direct zygote injection has not been verified in large animals. Here, we determined the editing efficiency of four CBE variants in porcine embryonic fibroblast cells and embryos. The findings showed that hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y130F consistently resulted in increased base-editing efficiency and low toxic effects in embryonic development. Further, we verified that using a one-step approach, direct zygote microinjection of the CBE system can generate pigs harboring multiple point mutations. Our process resulted in a stop codon in CD163 and myostatin (MSTN) and introduced a beneficial allele in insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2). The pigs showed disrupted expression of CD163 and MSTN and increased expression of IGF2, which significantly improved growth performance and infectious disease resistance. Our approach allows immediate introduction of multiple mutations in transgene-free animals to comprehensively improve economic traits through direct embryo microinjection, providing a potential new route to produce elite pig breeders.

AB  - Phospholipase A (PLA) in goat semen aggregates with egg yolk in semen diluent, leading to sperm death. The aim of this study is to address the issue of sperm death caused by the interaction between PLA and egg yolk, and to explore the protective effect and metabolic regulation mechanism of the combination of dexamethasone (DXMS) and azithromycin (AZM) on goat sperm under low temperature conditions. At a low temperature of 4 degrees C, different concentrations of DXMS were added to semen diluents containing 30 mu g/mL AZM to detect the quality of goat sperm. The optimal concentration of DXMS was determined to be 20 mu g/mL. On the 5th day of storage, antioxidant capacity, total cholesterol (TC) levels, energy metabolism, and metabolomics analysis were performed on the sperm of the 20 mu g/mL DXMS group. The results showed that there was no aggregation caused by the interaction between PLA and egg yolk in the group containing 30 mu g/mL AZM at 4 degrees C. 20 mu g/mL DXMS significantly improved sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (P < 0.05), catalase (CAT) (P < 0.01), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (P < 0.01). The content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Fe2+ significantly decreased (P < 0.01), while the content of ATP (P < 0.01) and TC (P < 0.05) significantly increased. Through metabolomics analysis, a total of 56 differential metabolites (P < 0.05) were screened, including 5a, 6-Anhydrotetracycline, Betamethasone, and 11-Dehydrocorticosterone, mainly enriched in 8 metabolic pathways (P < 0.05), including steroid hormone biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and choline metabolism in cancer. Among them, 5 metabolic pathways are related to lipid metabolism. The results indicate that AZM effectively inhibits the aggregation of PLA and yolk, and the combination of AZM and DXMS enhances the preservation quality of goat sperm during low-temperature preservation by regulating lipid metabolism.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a major woody oilseed species in China, but it is typically cultivated in nutrient-poor soils and may be affected by various trace elements. This study examined how spraying selenium, boron, and zinc trace elements affected the traits and functional active compounds of C. oleifera under nutrient deficiency. The results revealed significant variations in the effects of different trace element combinations on C. oleifera. Optimal concentrations of zinc and selenium are critical for promoting the growth and development of C. oleifera fruit. The transverse diameter of the fruit, the single fruit weight, the number of seeds per fruit, the single fresh seed weight, the oil content in the fruit, and the oil yield per plant of other treatments can be increased by up to 3.07%, 10.57%, 23.66%, 30.23%, 7.94%, and 21.95%, respectively, at most, compared to the control group. Diluting zinc from 1000 to 1500 times and maintaining a selenium concentration from 100 to 200 mg/L has been found to be beneficial for fruit growth. While low concentrations of selenium may promote an increase in fruit transverse diameter, high concentrations of selenium, along with high dilutions of zinc, can have the opposite effect, leading to a reduction in fruit diameter. However, a high concentration of selenium can positively impact the number of seeds per fruit. The most effective combination was found to be a selenium concentration of 0 mg/L, a boron concentration of 4 mg/L, and a zinc dilution of 1500. Interestingly, lower concentrations of selenium and boron, as well as lower dilutions of zinc, were found to increase the oil yield per plant. This suggests that a careful balance of trace elements is required to promote both fruit growth and oil content. The total sterol, squalene, total flavonoid, and polyphenol content of other treatments can be increased by up to 28.81%, 32.07%, 188.04%, and 92.61%, respectively, at most, compared to the control group. Selenium fertilizer and boron fertilizer increased the total sterol content in Camellia oil and had a significant positive correlation at the 0.01 level, but zinc fertilizer had little influence on it. High concentration selenium fertilizer generally increased the squalene, total flavonoid, and polyphenol content in Camellia oil, but boron and zinc fertilizers had little effect on these components. The results suggested that choosing appropriate fertilizer combinations could improve nutrient deficiency in C. oleifera and enhance the functional active compounds of its oil, thereby enhancing its value.

AB  - Epigenetic changes in the methylation of DNA may occur in response to environmental stressors, including warming climates. DNA methylation may also play an important role in regulating gene expression during both male and female reproduction in many insect species. However, it is currently unknown how DNA methylation shifts when individuals are reproducing under warmer temperatures. We exposed European corn borer moths (Ostrinia nubilalis) to heat during the pupal and adult life stages then investigated changes in DNA methylation across the genome using enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq). We compared methylation patterns in reproductive males and females exposed to heat (28 degrees C) to those that experienced an ambient temperature (23 degrees C). We found that heat exposure led to a small but significant increase in the percentage of methylated CpG sites throughout the genome in both sexes. However, DNA methylation rates were higher in females and differential methylation following heat exposure localised to unique regions in each sex. In males, methylation shifted within genes belonging to pathways including Hippo signalling, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA damage repair and spermatogenesis. In females, differential methylation occurred in genes related to histone modification and oogenesis. Our results suggest that DNA methylation patterns respond to moderate heat exposure in Lepidoptera and provide insight into epigenetic responses to heatwaves, suggesting novel pathways that may be involved in responding to heat stress during metamorphosis and reproduction.

AB  - Exposure to severe stress can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cause of PTSD is dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an imbalance of monoamines. Fruits and vegetables contain large amounts of luteolin (LU; 3 ',4 ',5,7-tetrahydroxylflavone), which has various pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-allergic effects. We investigated the effects of LU on fear, depression, and anxiety following monoamine imbalance and hyperactivation of the HPA axis in rats exposed to single prolonged stress (SPS). Male rats were dosed with LU (10 and 20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days after exposure to SPS. Administration of LU reduced fear freezing responses to extinction recall and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and suppressed increases in plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Also, administration of LU restored the increased norepinephrine and decreased serotonin levels in the structures within the fear circuit, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Our results showed that administration of LU improved freezing behavior according in a situation-dependent manner, and showed anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects. Thus, LU may be a useful therapeutic agent to prevent traumatic stress such as PTSD.

AB  - Endophytic microbes are vital for nutrient solubilization and uptake, growth, and survival of plants. Here, 88 endophytic actinobacteria (EnA) associated with five tea clones were isolated, assessed for their diversity, plant growth promoting (PGP), and biocontrol traits, and then used as an inoculant for PGP and disease control in host and non-host plants. Polyphasic methods, including phenotypic and genotypic characteristics led to their identification as Streptomyces, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Janibacter, Rhodococcus, Nocardia, Gordonia, Nocardiopsis, and Kribbella. Out of 88 isolates, 35 (39.77%) showed antagonistic activity in vitro against major fungal pathogens, viz. Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Exobasidium vexans, Poria hypobrunnea, Phellinus lamaensis, and Nigrospora sphaerica. Regarding PGP activities, the percentage of isolates that produced indole acetic acid, siderophore, and ammonia, as well as P-solubilisation and nitrogen fixation, were 67.05, 75, 80.68, 27.27, 57.95, respectively. A total of 51 and 42 isolates showed chitinase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity, respectively. Further, two potent Streptomyces strains KA12 and MA34, selected based on the bonitur scale, were screened for biofilm formation ability and tested in vivo under nursery conditions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and the crystal violet staining technique revealed that these Streptomyces strains can form biofilms, indicating the potential for plant colonization. In the nursery experiment, they significantly enhanced the shoot and root biomass, shoot and root length, and leaf number in host tea plants. Additionally, treatment of tomato seeds by KA12 suppressed the growth of fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, increased seed germination, and improved root architecture, demonstrating its ability to be used as a seed biopriming agent. Our results confirm the potential of tea endophytic actinobacterial strains with multifarious beneficial traits to enhance plant growth and suppress fungal pathogens, which may be used as bioinoculant for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the reproductive effects of adding monosodium glutamate (MSG) to the diet of goats. Eleven adult goats received synchronized estrus and follicular waves using three prostaglandin analog injections every seven days. Goats allocated to individual pens received 1 g/kg BW of MSG in their diet for 23 days (MOGLU group, n = 6), whereas the control group (n = 5) maintained the base diet. The supplemented animals showed an increase in dry matter intake (P < 0.0001) and a reduction in heart rate (P < 0.05), respiratory rate, and ruminal movement (P < 0.001). Surface and rectal temperatures were higher in the MOGLU group, (P < 0.0001) with a significant increase in the afternoon. There was an increase (P < 0.05) in the frequency of behaviors related to rumination, defecation, and urination in the MOGLU group, and a reduction in behaviors associated with stress (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in the plasma levels of proteins, albumin, urea, cholesterol, or triglycerides. Glucose levels were lower (P < 0.05) in the MOGLU group, which also showed increased glutathione peroxide levels during the induction of ovulation. Supplemented animals recorded a larger number (P < 0.05) of follicles throughout the experimental period and higher intraovarian blood perfusion (P < 0.05) during ovulation induction. We conclude that MSG exerts a positive effect on the reproductive response in goats and therefore represents an effective nutritional supplement.

AB  - Bacterial respiratory disease is one of the major concerns in the modern pig industry. To address the limitations of culture-based methods, 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to characterize the pig lung microbiome to gain a better understanding of microbial physiology and their population genetics. A batch of 510 slaughtered pigs from a farm located in Lampang province, Thailand, was selected. Individual pig weight was recorded. A total of 24 lungs (10 normal and 14 pneumonic lungs) were sampled for gross lesion examination and lung microbial communities were investigated. Poor growth performance and weight uniformity were denoted in this batch. Several pathogenic bacteria were detected in both normal and pneumonic lungs. Microbial diversity was decreased in the pneumonic group. PCoA and NMDS analysis showed a clear separation between the groups. Stenotrophomonas spp. (42.12%) was the dominant genus identified in normal lungs, while Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (71.97%) was the most abundant in pneumonic lungs, correlating with the commonly observed consolidation lesions. The slaughterhouse serves as a key checkpoint for gathering comprehensive information on pig respiratory health, and lung is representative of the lower respiratory tract for microbiomics. Monitoring of lung lesions should be implemented routinely to gain a better understanding of regional pig respiratory health.

AB  - Our objective was to study how changes in the light spectra affect growth; the concentration of carbohydrate, chlorophyll, carotenoid, terpene, alkaloid, and phenolic compounds; and the emissions of BVOC (biogenic volatile organic compound) of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) seedlings. This study was conducted during the growth of the third needle generation in plant growth chambers. The plants were exposed to two light spectra with equal photon flux densities but different proportions of blue light (400-500 nm) produced by LED (light-emitting diode) lamps: (i) control (white light 1 - 12% blue light) and (ii) increased blue light (+B) (white light + 45% blue light). The +B treatment increased the concentrations of total flavonoids and acetophenones in needles. The major changes in the phenolic profile were an accumulation of astragalin derivatives and the aglycone of picein. The +B treatment also decreased concentrations of the main alkaloid compound, epidihydropinidine, and its precursor, 2-methyl-6-propyl-1,6-piperideine; the emission rates of limonene, myrcene, and total monoterpenes; and the concentrations of a few terpenoid compounds, mainly in stems. Growth as well as the carbohydrates and pigments present in the needles were not affected. The results suggest that supplemental blue light shifts carbon allocation between secondary metabolism routes - from alkaloid and terpenoid synthesis to flavonoid and acetophenone synthesis. The changes may affect herbivory and abiotic stress tolerance of Norway spruce.

AB  - Simple Summary Mammary bioreactors represent a promising method for the production of recombinant proteins. In this study, the human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) sequence was knocked into the seventh exon of the goat beta-casein (CSN2) gene under the control of the CSN2 promoter using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. A mixture of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and a homologous plasmid including the T2A-HNP1 sequences were microinjected into the embryos of donor goat and then transplanted into recipient goats through embryo transfer technology. This allowed the HNP1 gene to be expressed in the offspring, facilitating the production of antimicrobial peptide proteins through the goat's mammary glands. This experiment successfully produced genetically edited goats that secrete HNP1 with mammary-specific characteristics, providing a scientific basis for the further promotion of gene-editing technology and the development of new transgenic goat breeds with antimicrobial components in their milk.Abstract Mammary gland bioreactors are promising methods for recombinant protein production. Human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) exhibits antibacterial and immune-modulating properties. This study aims to establish a method to generate goats secreting HNP1 using the mammary gland as bioreactors. HNP1 transgenic goats were generated by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock-in (KI) the HNP1 sequence into exon 7 of the goat beta-casein (CSN2) gene under the control of the CSN2 promoter. One-cell stage embryos were cytoplasmically injected with a mixture of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and a homologous plasmid including the T2A-HNP1 sequences, followed by transfer to recipient goats. A total of 22 live offspring goats were delivered, and 21 of these goats (95.45%) exhibited targeted edits at the CSN2 locus, and 2 female goats (9.09%) demonstrated successful HNP1 integration. Western blot and ELISA analyses confirmed the presence of HNP1 protein at high levels in the milk of these HNP1-positive goats, with mean concentrations of 22.10 mu g/mL and 0.0092 mu g/mL during the initial 60 days of lactation. Furthermore, milk from these transgenic goats exhibited notable antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrating the functionality of the expressed HNP1 protein. In conclusion, we established an efficient method for developing new transgenic goat lines as a mammary gland bioreactor, and the bioactive HNP1 protein secreted by the transgenic goat has the potential to combat microbial resistance.

AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a crucial indicator of sensorimotor gating that is often impaired in neuropsychiatric diseases. Although dopamine D1 receptor agonists have been found to disrupt PPI in mice, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to identify the brain regions responsible for the PPI-disruptive effect of the D1 agonist in mice. Results demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF82958 dramatically inhibited PPI, while the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 enhanced PPI. Additionally, local infusion of SKF82958 into the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex disrupted PPI, but not in the ventral hippocampus. Infusion of SCH23390 into these brain regions also failed to enhance PPI. Overall, the study suggests that the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex are responsible for the PPI-disruptive effect of dopamine D1 receptor agonists. These findings provide essential insights into the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying the disruptive effects of dopamine D1 receptor agonists on PPI and may contribute to the development of novel treatments for neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - Many species of insects show phenotypically plastic dispersal traits in response to suboptimal environmental conditions. These polyphenetic traits can have large impacts on the population dynamics of the dispersing insects. Therefore, it is important to understand what environmental factors affect the development of dispersal traits and how these factors affect population dynamics via immigration/emigration.Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibit a polyphenetic wing dimorphism in which individuals are either winged (alate) or not (apterous). The production of alate offspring is determined by environmental cues experienced by the mother. Environmental factors associated with these cues have been intensively studied, with crowding, host plant quality, natural enemies, fungal infection, and viral infection being shown to affect the production of pea aphid alates under controlled laboratory conditions. Nonetheless, environmental factors affecting alate production have rarely been studied in field populations of pea aphids.Using data from a three-year study of alate production in 5-9 alfalfa (lucerne) fields, we examined the effects of (i) pea aphid abundance, (ii) host plant maturity, (iii) temperature, (iv) predator and herbivore abundance, (v) parasitism, and (vi) entomopathic fungal incidence. In twice-weekly samples taken over the growing season, alate production ranged from 0% to 83% of the nymphal population.Pea aphid abundance, temperature, and alfalfa maturity together explained 67% of the variation in alate production. The other factors we investigated explained little variation. These results suggest there is a limited number of key environmental factors that consistently predict changes in alate production in field populations, while many factors identified in lab studies may be unimportant. Our results highlight the value of investigating factors affecting the expression of plastic traits in insect species at a broad spatiotemporal scale and under natural conditions.

AB  - Understanding the organisational principles of sperm motility has both evolutionary and applied impact. The emergence of computer aided systems in this field came with the promise of automated quantification and classification, potentially improving our understanding of the determinants of reproductive success. Yet, nowadays the relationship between sperm variability and fertility remains unclear. Here, we characterize pig sperm motility using t-SNE, an embedding method adequate to study behavioural variability. T-SNE reveals a hierarchical organization of sperm motility across ejaculates and individuals, enabling accurate fertility predictions by means of Bayesian logistic regression. Our results show that sperm motility features, like high-speed and straight-lined motion, correlate positively with fertility and are more relevant than other sources of variability. We propose the combined use of embedding methods with Bayesian inference frameworks in order to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between fertility and sperm motility in animals, including humans.
   Dimension reduction methods on porcine sperm motility landscapes reveal heterogeneity and hierarchy in sperm movement behavior and show high-speed and straight-lined motion as predictive features of fertility.

AB  - This essay is a historical-geographical account of how scientists and public health officials conceptualized and assessed northern radioactive exposures in the late 1950s and 1960s. The detection of radionuclides in caribou bodies in northern Canada both demonstrated the global reach of nuclear fallout and revealed the unevenness of toxic relations and radioactive exposures. Following the documentation of the lichen-caribou-human pathway of exposure, Canadian public health officials became increasingly concerned about the possibility of heightened radioactive exposures among Indigenous northerners. Between 1963 and 1969, scientists and officials with Canada's Radiation Protection Division (RPD) coordinated an interdepartmental monitoring program through which they sought to determine whether the consumption of contaminated caribou meat had caused radioactive exposure levels in northern communities to exceed the officially recognized "safe limits." In 1969, the northern monitoring program was suspended after officials determined that radionuclide body burdens had not exceeded the threshold for radioactive exposures. While the RPD emphasized its development of a technoscientific approach to measuring radioactive body burdens, the legitimacy of the monitoring program was linked directly to interdepartmental relations within Canada's colonial northern administration. I situate the northern monitoring program within broader shifts in public health approaches to radiation protection and use Gabrielle Hecht's concept of nuclearity to demonstrate how RPD officials employed the logic of the threshold in their assessment of radioactive exposures.

AB  - Understanding the interactive effects and relationships between biochemical elements of tea leaves and the related factors, particularly climatic, cultivar, and geographic, is key for high-quality Ceylon tea production. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effects of season x cultivar x agro-ecological regions (AERs) on the four tested biochemicals in fresh tea leaves, total polyphenol content (TPC), free sugar, protein, and theanine; (2) determine the relationships between, and develop a model to estimate, the biochemicals and their related factors; and (3) project the potential concentrations and distributions of four tested biochemicals in tea leaves with respect to the current and future climate. This study primarily uses inferential statistics via the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), cross-validation using R software, and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) approach in ArcGIS. The results demonstrate that the season, cultivar (Ceylon tea cultivars of TRI 2025 and TRI 4053), and AER and their interactions on biochemicals have significant effects (p < 0.05). The models derived in the regression analysis demonstrate the strong relationships between the independent variables and the biochemicals, with multiple correlation coefficients (R) around 0.8 and coefficient of determination (R-2) around 0.6. The low standard deviation of error of prediction (SDEP < 0.1) and the high correlation coefficient of leave-one-out cross-validation (Q(2)) for all four biochemicals ranged from 0.56 to 0.61, which signifies the predictive ability of the models. The future projections show a considerable increase in the thresholds of all tested biochemicals. The distribution category with 'very high' concentrations of TPC and theanine is predicted to increase in the future by averages of 10% and 14%, respectively, while reducing the classes of protein and free sugar by 14% and 12%, respectively. Overall, the changing concentrations of the thresholds of relevant biochemicals and their distribution will negatively affect the final quality of tea, and these variations indicate that climate change has started to diminish Ceylon tea quality.

AB  - Objectives: Thermal stress negatively affects the productive performance and immunity responses of rabbits. In this study, we examined the effects of two allicin (AL) and lycopene (LP) levels on performance index, a liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) gene expression, histological parameters of liver, and small intestine of V-line growing rabbits exposed to thermal stress.Methods: In nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress, 135 male rabbits (5 weeks old, average weight 772.02 +/- 6.41 g) were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments in nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress (temperature-humidity index average 31.2). The 1st group served as the control, receiving no supplements; The 2nd and 3rd groups received 100 and 200 mg AL/kg of diet supplements; and the 4th and 5th groups were supplemented with 100 and 200 mg LP/kg diet, respectively.Results: show that AL and LP rabbits had the best final body weight, body gain, and feed conversion ratio compared with the control. compared with control, rabbit liver TNF-alpha levels significantly decreased in diets containing AL and LP In contrast, AL rabbits were slightly more effective in downregulating the expression of the TNF-alpha gene than LP groups. Furthermore, dietary supplementation of AL and LP significantly improved antibody titers against sheep red blood titers. Compared with other treatments, AL100 treatment significantly improved immune responses to phytohemagglutinin. In all treatments, histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in binuclear hepatocytes. The diameter of the hepatic lobules, villi height, crypt depth, and absorption surface of heat-stressed rabbits were all positively affected by both doses of LP (100-200 mg/kg diet).Conclusion: rabbit dietary supplementation with AL or LP could positively affect performance, TNF-alpha, immunity, and histological parameters of growing rabbits under thermal stress.

AB  - Dholes (Cuon alpinus) are endangered large carnivores found in scattered populations in Asia. One of the main threats to dholes is the decreasing prey availability throughout their distribution range. In the present study, we used camera trap data collected over 6 years to investigate the temporal activity patterns of dholes and their putative prey species in Baluran National Park in Java, Indonesia. We also explored the overlap in activity between dholes and the park's other remaining large carnivore the Javan leopard (Panthera pardus melas), as well as humans. Furthermore, we investigated potential differences in activity patterns between dholes in packs and dholes roaming in pairs or alone. We found a high temporal overlap between dholes and their wild ungulate prey species (ranging from Delta = 0.66-0.90), with the lowest overlap observed between dholes and bantengs (Bos javanicus) (Delta = 0.66), and the highest between dholes and muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak) (Delta = 0.90). A very low overlap was found between dholes and domestic cattle (Bos indicus) (Delta = 0.27) whereas a moderately high overlap was found between dholes and leopards (Delta = 0.70) and dholes and humans (Delta = 0.62). We found a significant difference in activity patterns between dholes in packs and dholes roaming alone or in pairs (Delta = 0.78, p = .01). Single/pairs of dholes were more active both during the day and at night, whereas packs were predominantly active around sunrise and sunset. The high overlap with humans potentially has a negative effect on dhole activity, particularly for dispersing individuals, and the low overlap with domestic species questions the extent to which dholes are considered to predate on them.

AB  - The medicinal and nutritional benefits of mushrooms have long been explored, with polysaccharides among the major bioactive constituents. Among these, Lignosus rhinocerus (tiger milk mushroom) is well documented for the traditional treatment of ailments, including respiratory illness, and has been shown to express several bioactivities, including anti-asthmatic effects. In this study, the polysaccharide constituents of L. rhinocerus mushroom were successfully extracted and fractionated using Soxhlet extraction, column chromatographic methods followed by cytotoxicity analysis. To test for its airway relaxation potential, an isolated guinea pig trachea (GPT) ring was used in a functional multichannel myograph study to evaluate the relaxation effects of L. rhinocerus polysaccharides (LRP) on muscarinic, histamine, and beta 2 airway receptor agonist-antagonist responses. The mushroom polysaccharides were found to be a neutral, water-soluble polysaccharide-protein complex, and the LR crude extract and its polysaccharides fraction showed no cytotoxic effect against the Vero cell line. LRP induced concentration-dependent relaxation in contracted airway smooth muscle, which was pre-contracted with EC40 carbachol and EC50 histamine. The airway relaxation effect of LRP is mediated via muscarinic and histamine receptors which supports the therapeutic potential of LRP as a natural alternative for the management of asthma.

AB  - Simple Summary Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a disruption in the development of animal embryos or fetal organs in the maternal uterus and is highly regarded because of its serious detrimental effects on animal husbandry. However, there are few diagnostic methods and treatment options for IUGR, and its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, a bioinformatics approach was applied to identify four IUGR-related diagnostic genes (IUGR-DGs) in sheep, construct a gene scoring system based on the IUGR-DGs, and evaluate the relationship between the IUGR score and disease risk. A new artificial neural network model was constructed to better diagnose the occurrence of IUGR in sheep based on the four IUGR-DGs. Although future studies will be necessary to elucidate the entire molecular mechanisms involved, we believe that the findings of this paper will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of IUGR in sheep and improve livestock production levels.Abstract Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common perinatal complication in animal reproduction, with long-lasting negative effects on neonates and postnatal animals, which seriously negatively affects livestock production. In this study, we aimed to identify potential genes associated with the diagnosis of IUGR through bioinformatics analysis. Based on the 73 differentially expressed related genes obtained by differential analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we used three machine learning algorithms to identify 4 IUGR-related hub genes (IUGR-HGs), namely, ADAM9, CRYL1, NDP52, and SERPINA7, whose ROC curves showed that they are a good diagnostic target for IUGR. Next, we identified two molecular subtypes of IUGR through consensus clustering analysis and constructed a gene scoring system based on the IUGR-HGs. The results showed that the IUGR score was positively correlated with the risk of IUGR. The AUC value of IUGR scoring accuracy was 0.970. Finally, we constructed a new artificial neural network model based on the four IUGR-HGs to diagnose sheep IUGR, and its accuracy reached 0.956. In conclusion, the IUGR-HGs we identified provide new potential molecular markers and models for the diagnosis of IUGR in sheep; they can better diagnose whether sheep have IUGR. The present findings provide new perspectives on the diagnosis of IUGR.

AB  - Rhinoceroses are among the most endangered mammalian species today. Their past diversity is well documented from the Eocene onward, although their evolutionary history is far from being fully understood. Here, we elucidate the systematic affinities of a Pleistocene rhinoceros species represented by a partial skeleton from 709 +/- 68 kya archaeological deposits in Luzon Island, Philippines. We perform a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, including all living species and a wide array of extinct rhinocerotid species. We confirm the early split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae at c. 35.5 Mya and constrain the divergence between recent Asian and African rhinoceroses at c. 24 Mya, with contrasting phenotypic evolutionary rates in Diceroti and Rhinoceroti. Dental features reveal the existence of an unsuspected Asian Pleistocene clade, referred to as Nesorhinus gen. nov.. It includes the rhinoceros from the Philippines and another extinct species from Taiwan, N. hayasakai. Nesorhinus is the sister-group to a cluster comprising Dicerorhinus and Rhinoceros. Our phylogenetic results strongly suggest an island-hopping dispersal for Nesorhinus, from the Asian mainland towards Luzon via Taiwan by the Late Miocene or later, and Pleistocene dispersals for representatives of Rhinoceros. Nesorhinus philippinensis would be the first perissodactyl species supporting the island-rule hypothesis, with decreased body weight and limb-bone robustness.

AB  - Sensory analysis is unusual in sustainability research, although it can offer a neoteric aspect of nature and wild animals' perception. The study's objective was to identify consumers' attitudes towards plant and animal products from wild and conventional foods and put these findings into a broader social context. A blind sensory evaluation with 80 semi-trained assessors was used, segmented by gender, age, education, income, place of origin, family status, number of children, and willingness to pay. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was chosen as an example of an overpopulated animal species occurring in the wild, which could be considered a partial substitute for pork. Statistical testing in these blind evaluations proved that wild boar meat is not considered less tasty. Therefore, wild boar meat could represent a partial substitute, complementing pork, on which consumers are willing to spend the same amount of money. Despite the mostly indifferent sensory evaluation, focus group responses showed considerable barriers to wild food. This paper concludes that possible educational and popularizing procedures are presented, including forest pedagogy, eliminating consumers' prejudices. A mixed-methods approach within quantitative and qualitative methodology was chosen.

AB  - In the context of the widespread expansion of damage by herbivorous pests of Brassica crops, taking into account the requirements for minimizing pesticide pollution of the environment, it is important to have fundamental knowledge of the geographical features of the distribution of pests and about the botanical confinement of plant resistance in order to develop a strategy for creating new Brassica cultivars with complex resistance to insects. The relevance of our work is related to the study of the variability in the degree of resistance of the extensive genetic diversity of Brassica rapa accessions to the main herbivorous pests of Brassica crops in contrasting ecological and geographical zones of the Russian Federation (Arctic, northwestern, and southern zones). We have studied the distribution and food preferences of Lepidoptera insects (diamondback moth Plutella xylostella and cabbage moth Mamestra brassicae) on a set of 100 accessions from the VIR B. rapa collection (Chinese cabbage, pakchoi, wutacai, zicaitai, mizuna, and leaf and root turnips) in the field in three zones of the Russian Federation. We have found that the diamondback moth and cabbage moth are largely harmful in three zones of the European part of the Russian Federation, although the degree of damage to plants by these insects varies by year of cultivation. On average, for the set studied during the two years of the experiment, the degree of plant damage by both pests in the Arctic zone was low and almost low, and in the northwestern and southern zones, it was medium. It was noted that diamondback moth damage was greater in the northwestern zone in both years and in the southern and Arctic zones in 2021, while in 2022, the degree of cabbage moth damage was slightly higher in the southern and Arctic zones. Under the conditions of field diamondback moth damage, the accessions of Chinese cabbage, wutacai, and mizuna turned out to be the most resistant (the damage score was 1.92-1.99), whereas the accessions of wutacai and pakchoi were the most resistant to the cabbage moth (the damage score was 1.62-1.78). A high variability in the degree of resistance of Brassica crops to Lepidoptera insects from complete resistance to susceptibility was revealed. We have identified sources of resistance to insects, including complex resistance in all study areas, among landraces and some modern cultivars of Chinese cabbage, pakchoi, wutacai, and mizuna from Japan and China, as well as European turnips. The highest susceptibility to pests in the studied set was noted in the accession of root turnip "Hinona" (k-1422, USA) (average damage score of 3.24-3.53 points). We were not able to establish the morphological features of resistant plants or the geographical confinement of the origin of resistance of B. rapa crop accessions.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by fungi belonging to the genera Fusarium spp. and commonly found in feed and food. It is frequently related to reproductive disorders in farm animals and, occasionally, to hyperestrogenic syndromes in humans. Nowadays, knowledge about ZEN effects on wild boars (Sus scrofa) is extremely scarce, despite the fact that they represent one of the most hunted game species in Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate how ZEN affects the liver, kidney, and muscle oxidative status and morphology of wild boars hunted in various locations throughout the province of Avellino, Campania Region, Southern Italy, during the 2021-2022 hunting season. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, were assessed by colorimetric assays; tissue morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's stains. Our data showed that ZEN contamination might result in oxidative stress (OS) and some histopathological alterations in wild boars' livers and kidneys rather than in muscles, emphasizing the importance of developing a wildlife monitoring and management strategy for dealing not only with the problem of ZEN but the surveillance of mycotoxins in general.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The "Capocollo di Martina Franca" is a traditional dry-cured pig meat product made in Apulia. Its quality depends on the raw material which, in turn, is influenced by the kind and amount of fat supplementation in the pigs' diet. Dietary manipulation of the fatty acid composition of muscle and subcutaneous fat in pork may affect the quality and suitability of meat for processing. Vegetable oils, such as olive oil, are used for pig feeding. The extraction process of olive oil affects its content in polyphenols, which are health promoting molecules. This study was planned in order to test the effects of a diet containing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO, rich in polyphenols) extracted by ultrasound technology, in comparison with refined olive oil (ROO, devoid of polyphenols), on the quality of pig meat and capocollo. The longissimus lumborum muscle was evaluated for physical and chemical features. The capocollo was analysed in relation to its storage time after seasoning (t(1) = 0 vs. t(2) = +6 months). The EVOO diet improved the fatty acid profile of fresh meat and lowered the atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indices, with potential benefits for human health. Moreover, the capocollo quality was better following the EVOO diet but only immediately after ripening (t(1) = 0).
   The "Capocollo di Martina Franca" is a traditional dry-cured pig meat product made in Apulia. The dietary fat source is able to influence the lipid profile of muscle and subcutaneous fat in pork, thus affecting its nutritional and sensorial quality as well as its suitability for technological processing. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a diet containing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO, 3%, as-fed basis) extracted by ultrasound technology in comparison to refined olive oil (ROO, 3%, as-fed basis) on the quality of pig meat (longissimus lumborum muscle) and capocollo in relation to its storage time after seasoning (t(1) = 0 vs. t(2) = +6 months). The EVOO diet lowered the concentration of myristic, palmitic, stearic and total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and increased oleic, linoleic, total monounsaturated (MUFAs), polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in pig meat; moreover, the atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indices were lowered, with potential benefits for human health. The overall quality of capocollo was positively affected by the EVOO diet, although storage for 6 months after ripening levelled the protective effects of extra virgin olive oil in comparison with refined olive oil.

AB  - Simple Summary The rostral epidural rete mirabile is built of considerable small arterial vessels that anastomose with each other at the base of the cranial cavity. This structure is formed as a result of the division of a large arterial vessel into many small arteries. Furthermore, on the other side of the rete mirabile, these small arteries are joined together to form one large artery, through which blood flows out of the rete mirabile. This system participates in decreasing the temperature of the brain and thus protects the body from thermal stress. Moreover, it influences body-water balance and has a crucial role in the retrograde transfer of neuropeptides. According to old systematics, pigs and hippopotamuses are in one suborder. Hence it was decided to compare their structures and blood supplies. It was found that the shape of the analyzed structure and the inflows differed in these groups. The rostral epidural rete mirabile (rete mirabile epidurale rostrale) is built of considerable small arterial vessels that anastomose with each other. This structure is formed as a result of the division of a large arterial vessel into many small arteries. Furthermore, on the other side of the rete mirabile, these small arteries are joined together to form one large artery, through which blood flows out of the rete mirabile. This system participates in decreasing the temperature of the brain and thus protects the body from thermal stress. Moreover, it influences body-water balance and has a crucial role in the retrograde transfer of neuropeptides. The goal of this study was to describe the rostral epidural rete mirabile and pathways that provide blood to this structure as well as compare it in selected Suiformes and hippopotamuses. The study was performed on desert warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), Eurasian wild boars (Sus scrofa), collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), pygmy hippopotamuses (Choeropsis liberiensis), and common hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius). Preparations were made using the latex method and corrosion cast. An elongated shape characterizes its anatomy with a much wider rostral part than caudal part in the Eurasian wild boars, desert warthogs, and collared peccaries. The main source of blood was the branch to the rostral epidural rete mirabile branched off from the internal carotid artery. Moreover, blood enters the rete by the caudal branch and rostral branch to the rostral epidural rete mirabile. In hippopotamuses, the major source of blood was the rostral branches to the rostral epidural rete mirabile.

AB  - Although large carnivores usually prefer large prey, in some situations, they may shift their predation patterns towards smaller but abundant prey. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large carnivore capable of changing its diet according to prey and habitat availability. Here, we assessed the temporal and spatiotemporal interactions between jaguars and their prey in the Marac & aacute;-Jipioca Islands (Northeastern Amazon, Brazil) through camera traps. We assessed overlapping activity patterns and tested for spatiotemporal segregation/avoidance between jaguars and nine potential prey species. We used a time-to-encounter approach, which consists in calculating the minimum time between prey and jaguar's detections, and vice versa, for each record of preys' species at a specific camera trap station, which translates into aggregation or avoidance behaviors. We found that these insular jaguars are more active in daylight periods when most of their prey are active and in locations used by species that cannot become nocturnal to avoid predators due to morphology constraints. Four prey species (great egret, white-tailed deer, muscovy duck, and black-and-white tegu) presented moderate activity overlapping with jaguars. Agoutis and white-tailed deer seek to spatiotemporally segregate from jaguars, although jaguars did not show spatiotemporal aggregation with any of the evaluated prey. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics is essential to establish the islands' trophic network composition and structure. This is fundamental information to efficiently allocate efforts for reducing costs and maximizing benefits in managing this population aiming to protect and conserve it, and consequently, the related ecosystems.

AB  - Interactions between alien plants and local enemies in introduced ranges may determine plant invasion success. However, little is known about whether herbivory-induced responses are transmitted across vegetative generations of plants and whether epigenetic changes are involved during this process. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined the effects of herbivory by the generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura on the growth, physiology, biomass allocation and DNA methylation level of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides in the first- (G1), second- (G2) and third-generation (G3). We also tested the effects of root fragments with different branching orders (i.e., the primary- or secondary-root fragments of taproots) of G1 on offspring performance. Our results showed that G1 herbivory promoted the growth of the plants in G2 that sprouted from the secondary-root fragments of G1 but had a neutral or negative effect on the growth of the plants in G2 from the primary-root fragments. The growth of plants in G3 was significantly reduced by G3 herbivory but not affected by G1 herbivory. Plants in G1 exhibited a higher level of DNA methylation when they were damaged by herbivores than when they were not, while neither plants in G2 nor G3 showed herbivory-induced changes in DNA methylation. Overall, the herbivory-induced growth response within one vegetative generation may represent the rapid acclimatization of A. philoxeroides to the unpredictable generalist herbivores in the introduced ranges. Herbivory-induced trans-generational effects may be transient for clonal offspring of A. philoxeroides, which can be influenced by the branching order of taproots, but be less characterized by DNA methylation.

AB  - Simple Summary AKAP12, the family of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), plays an important role in the regulation of growth and development. There have been no corresponding studies of the effect of the AKAP12 gene on growth traits in goats. In our previous study, 7 bp (intron 3) and 13 bp (3 ' UTR) indels within the AKAP12 gene significantly influenced AKAP12 gene expression. This study expected to identify the association between these two genetic variations and growth-related traits in 1405 Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats. The P1-7 bp indel locus was significantly correlated with height at hip cross (HHC; p < 0.05) and the P2-13 bp indel locus was associated with body weight, body length, chest depth, chest width, hip width, chest circumference and cannon (bone) circumference in SBWC goats (p < 0.05). These results prove that the AKAP12 gene plays an important role in the growth and development of goats. The A-kinase anchoring protein 12 gene (AKAP12) is a scaffold protein, which can target multiple signal transduction effectors, can promote mitosis and cytokinesis and plays an important role in the regulation of growth and development. In our previous study, P1-7 bp (intron 3) and P2-13 bp (3 ' UTR) indels within the AKAP12 gene significantly influenced AKAP12 gene expression. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between these two genetic variations and growth-related traits in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (SBWC) (n = 1405). Herein, we identified two non-linkage insertions/deletions (indels). Notably, we found that the P1-7 bp indel mutation was related to the height at hip cross (HHC; p < 0.05) and the P2-13 bp indel was associated with body weight, body length, chest depth, chest width, hip width, chest circumference and cannon (bone) circumference in SBWC goats (p < 0.05). Overall, the two indels' mutations of AKAP12 affected growth traits in goats. Compared to the P1-7 bp indel, the P2-13 bp indel is more suitable for the breeding of goat growth traits.

AB  - Humans living close to carnivore habitats sometimes develop a negative attitude towards them because of the damages they cause. Such an attitude has costs, both for wild carnivores and local communities. Human costs are mostly in the form of economic loss to property and infrastructure, damage to crops, and depredation on livestock. In northern Pakistan where large carnivores like common leopard (Panthera pardus), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetinus), Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus)), grey wolf (Canis lupus), and lynx (Lynx lynx) often encounter humans and contribute to significant economic losses. The present study was conducted in Kalam Valley, District Swat, Pakistan to estimate the occurrence of brown bear and conflicts with humans. Data about the presence-absence and depredation in five years (2009-2013) were collected from 86 households in the area. Total losses in Kalam Valley during the five year period were 72 animals. The brown bear predation was estimated as 29% of total predation in the area that killed 15 goats, 2 sheep, and 4 cattle. The snow leopard and wolf predation was 31% and 39%, respectively. To estimate the occurrence, 10 transects were laid out in each survey area with 100 m length and 50 m width. Each transect was laid out with minimum distance of one km from each other. Higher sign density was found in the forest compared to the other habitats. Twenty brown bear signs were recorded at four sites of the study area. According to signs, brown bear was widely distributed in Batendar area, while Jaba had the least distribution. Estimated livestock predation per household was 0.84 +/- 1.13 animals. The total economic loss was PKR 20,207 or US$ 196 per household/year. The economic loss due to brown bear was PKR 5860 or US$ 58, snow leopard as PKR 6264 or US$ 63 and wolf as PKR 7880 or US$ 78 per household/year. Livestock predation and crop damages resulted in ruthless killing of large carnivores including brown bear in the area, which makes conservation efforts difficult.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different levels of combined amoxicillin and copper (Cu) pollution on the methanogenesis of microbial communities during aerobic composting of dairy manure. Three groups were established: the control group (CK), a low-level combined pollution group (L), and a high-level combined pollution group (H). As the level of pollution increased, carbohydrate metabolism decreased during the thermophilic phase of composting, while signal translation increased. Compared with the initial phase, functional genes related to the acetoclastic pathway decreased significantly in abundance during the thermophilic phase, and cdh had the lowest relative abundance among acetoclastic pathway with a decrease of 81.52%, 81.88%, and 84.73% in groups CK, L, and H, respectively. The cumulative methane emissions in group H decreased by 31.56% and 9.23%, respectively, compared with those from groups CK and L. These results contribute to understanding the effects of combined amoxicillin and Cu pollution on methane emissions during composting.

AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of faunal remains unearthed from the rock shelter site of Tor Hamar in southern Jordan were analyzed for reconstructing paleoenvironments and hunting activities in the region. The site is located at the Jebel Qalkha area and has archaeological deposits dated to the Early Upper Paleolithic (ca. 38-37 ka) and the Epipaleolithic (ca. 24-15 ka) periods. The excavations at the site have yielded remains of animal prey in addition to lithic tools enabling estimation of paleoenvironments during the late Pleistocene. Despite the poorly preserved condition of animal remains, which is typical of this region, we performed isotope analysis together with identification by morphological analysis and peptide sequencing on animal tooth fragments in addition to the isotope analysis on paleosol organic matters. The in-situ paleosol isotope data points to an environmental shift from a wetter condition in the older period yielding the Qalkhan artifacts (-24-18 ka) to a drier condition in the later period yielding the Mushabian artifacts (-15.5-15.2 ka). The results are consistent with the Pleistocene lake-level shift of Lake Lisan and its pollen data that indicate a sudden shift towards a drier condition since -15-16 ka. This evidence points to a paleoclimatic trend opposite to the one in Mediterranean coast and an even more prominent shift than is recorded in Soreq and Tzavoa cave speleothems during the terminal Pleistocene of the northern Negev. Yet the environmental shift around Tor Hamar was not mirrored in gazelle isotope data. The data show among the greatest isotopic variations in Levant suggesting a change in human hunting strategy that possibly targeted multiple different species of genus Gazella and/or a use of different hunting areas particularly between the Qalkhan and the Mushabian periods.

AB  - Wildlife populations increasingly encounter unpredictable environmental conditions and reduced resource availability, influencing energy and protein available for immune defenses. According to resource-constraint hypotheses, central to ecoimmunology, organisms with more resources should have the ability to invest more into immune defenses. We investigated whether fat condition or protein content influenced three constitutive immune defenses-bacterial killing ability, hemolytic complement activity, and total antioxidant capacity-in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). We used hundreds of samples from individuals captured during 2014-2021 and generalized linear models fit in a Bayesian framework to determine the probability of the direction of a relationship. Bacteria-killing ability had greatest probability (0.87) of a positive relationship with fat condition, and a 0.84 probability of a negative relationship with protein. In contrast, hemolytic complement activity had a 0.93 probability of being negatively associated with protein content and antioxidant capacity had a 0.94 probability of a positive association with protein content. Neither had a clear directional relationship with fat condition. Still, absolute effect sizes were small, and immune differences between a deer in poor nutritional condition and one in good nutritional condition were minor. The small effect sizes were contrary to the assumptions of many studies and might arise because the immune defenses in this study were constitutive, highly regulated by negative feedback cycles, and had low energy and resource costs. These nuanced results, however, support different, albeit small, effects of protein and fat reserves on immune defenses. Our results highlight the importance of assessing the assumed relationship between immune defenses and nutritional reserves in each population.

AB  - Heat stress significantly affects livestock production, particularly in tropical regions where temperatures often exceed animals' comfort zones. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of heat stress tolerance in Jamunapari goats (Capra hircus) through transcriptomic analysis, gene co-expression network construction, and hub gene identification. Female goats (1-2 years old) were monitored during high Thermal Humidity Index (THI) in June and normal THI in March. Based on heat tolerance and physiological parameters, goats were classified into Thermo-Neutral (TNG) and Heat-Stress (EHSG) groups. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 133 upregulated genes and 501 downregulated genes in the EHSG group. Upregulated pathways included NF-kappa B signaling, MAPK signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, while downregulated genes were linked to IL-17 signaling and platelet activation. Notably, the small heat shock proteins (CRYAB) and aquaporins (AQP11) were significantly downregulated. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified key gene modules associated with Iberia Heat Tolerance Coefficient and respiration rate. Hub genes such as TUFM, TOMM40, BCSL1, VCL, VASP, ITGB, and VWF were critical for adaptation to heat stress. These findings enhance our understanding of heat stress resilience, offering potential targets for breeding programs aimed at improving livestock tolerance to heat stress in tropical environments.

AB  - The SCD is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in dairy cows; however, its role in the mammary gland of buffalo is not well understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized the complete coding sequence (CDS) of the buffalo SCD gene from mammary gland tissue and investigated its effects on milk fat synthesis using bioinformatics analyses, tissue differential expression detection, and cellular functional experiments. The cloned SCD gene has a CDS length of 1080 bp, encoding a protein of 359 amino acids. This protein is hydrophilic, lacks a signal peptide, and contains four transmembrane domains, including 10 conserved motifs and a Delta9-FADS domain, characteristic of the fatty acid desaturase family involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis within the endoplasmic reticulum. Molecular characterization revealed that the physicochemical properties, conserved domains, structures, and functions of buffalo SCD are highly similar to those in other Bovidae species. Among the tissues analyzed, SCD expression was highest in the mammary gland during lactation and in the cerebellum during dry-off period. Notably, SCD expression in the mammary gland was significantly higher during lactation compared to the dry-off period. Subcellular localization experiments confirmed that SCD functions in the endoplasmic reticulum of buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). Functional overexpression and interference experiments in BuMECs demonstrated that SCD promotes milk fat synthesis by affecting the expression of lipid synthesis-related genes such as ACACA, FASN, and DGAT1, as well as milk fat regulatory genes like SREBFs and PPARG, thereby influencing intracellular triglyceride (TAG) content. Additionally, 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the buffalo SCD gene, with a specific SNP at c.-605, showing potential as molecular markers for improving milk production traits. These findings highlight that the SCD gene is a key gene in buffalo milk fat synthesis, involved in the de novo synthesis of milk fatty acids.

AB  - Every ecosystem shows multiple levels of species interactions, which are often difficult to isolate and to classify regarding their specific nature. For most of the observed interactions, it comes down to either competition or consumption. The modes of consumption are various and defined by the nature of the consumed organism, e.g., carnivory, herbivory, as well as the extent of the consumption, e.g., grazing, parasitism. While the majority of consumers are animals, carnivorous plants can also pose a threat to arthropods. Water fleas of the family Daphniidae are keystone species in many lentic ecosystems. As most abundant filter feeders, they link the primary production to higher trophic levels. As a response to the high predatory pressures, water fleas have evolved various inducible defenses against animal predators. Here we show the first example, to our knowledge, in Ceriodaphnia dubia of such inducible defenses of an animal against a coexisting plant predator, i.e., the carnivorous bladderwort (Utricularia x neglecta Lehm, Lentibulariaceae). When the bladderwort is present, C. dubia shows changes in morphology, life history and behavior. While the morphological and behavioral adaptations improve C. dubia's survival rate in the presence of this predator, the life-history parameters likely reflect trade-offs for the defense.

AB  - Background To optimize animal production systems for future sustainability, research now focuses on improving feed quality to enhance livestock performance. Here, we test the impact on goat metabolism of varying leaf proportions in the alfalfa component of an alfalfa-maize diet. Methods In a pen-feeding experiment, 16 three-month-old goats were divided into eight groups, four of which were fed a ration containing 40% alfalfa with leaves intact (LI) and four of which were fed an otherwise identical diet containing stemmy alfalfa (leaves removed, LR). Results As expected, LR reduced protein intake compared to LI (48.3 vs. 93.3 g d(-1); p < 0.001) and increased acid detergent fiber intake (239 vs. 167 g d(-1); p < 0.001), but neutral detergent fiber and dry matter digestibility did not differ between LR and LI. The LR group had lower gross energy, digestible energy, and metabolizable energy intakes than the LI group (p = 0.080, 0.030, and 0.022, respectively). Retained nitrogen for LI and LR was 2.30 and 1.72 g d(-1), respectively. Body weight gain was 74 g d(-1) in LI and 52 g d(-1) in LR (p < 0.001). Conclusions These results highlight that even where alfalfa is only one component of a mixed diet, the nutritive quality and leaf content of the alfalfa component are important to animal performance.

AB  - Sheep have evolved remarkable phenotypic diversity through artificial and natural selection, with reproductive traits being pivotal for breeding economics. As a unique genetic resource, Pishan red sheep exhibit exceptional advantages, including perennial estrus, high fecundity, and stable hereditary characteristics, establishing them as an optimal model for investigating reproductive genetics. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing of Pishan red sheep, generating 9084.81 Gb of raw data and identifying 53,968,686 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Through selective sweep analysis, 92 genomic regions under selection were detected, containing 90 positional candidate genes significantly associated with growth, reproduction, and immune functions. Notably, we revealed BMPRIB, UNC5C, PDLIM5, GRID2, and HPGDS as core positional candidate genes influencing litter size, operating through the TGF-beta and Thyroid hormone signaling pathways. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) further identified 59 trait-related SNPs, including 39 loci linked to growth traits (affecting positional candidate genes such as PROM1, TAPT1, LDB2, and KIF16B) and 20 loci of positional candidate genes associated with reproductive traits (involving ASPA, RAP1GAP2, PHIP, and WDR82).These findings not only elucidate the molecular basis of superior reproductive performance in Pishan red sheep, but also provide functional markers for precision breeding.

AB  - Clinical treatment of Osteoarthritis (OA) remains a challenge due to the poor self-regeneration ability of cartilage. Deer antler is the only cartilage tissue that can completely regenerate each year. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is one of the major active components in the deer antler that participate in regulating the rapid regeneration of deer antler cartilage. This has led us to speculate that deer IGF-1 might potentially become a candidate drug for reducing damage and inflammation of OA. Thus, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of deer IGF-1 in chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation response. Deer, mouse, and human IGF-1 amino acid sequences and protein structures were aligned using CLUSTAL and PSIPRED. The underlying molecular mechanism of deer IGF-1 on primary chondrocytes was investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology combined with various experiments. Cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) was used to induce the inflammation response of primary chondrocytes. We found that deer IGF-1 was more similar to human IGF-1 than mouse IGF-1. qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence assay indicated that deer IGF-1 had stronger effects than mouse IGF-1. We also found that the deer IGF-1 enhanced the expression of cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, but decreased the expression of ECM-degrading genes. Deer IGF-1 also attenuated the IL-1 beta-induced inflammatory and ECM degradation in chondrocytes. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of deer IGF-1 on primary chondrocyte viability and presents a candidate for combatting inflammatory responses in OA development.

AB  - Rafting has been proposed as a dispersive mechanism for some species of seahorses. Juvenile Hippocampus patagonicus rafting on the sea surface have been reported. This life stage has high mortality in nature due to ecological and environmental factors usually affecting juvenile planktonic teleosts (e.g. predation).
   In this study, 50 juvenile seahorses were captured while rafting at the beginning of the reproductive season (December). They were grown out under a standard protocol in a recirculating aquaculture system for 120 days until they reached maturity.
   During this period, only three seahorses died (6%). Mature seahorses were 65 +/- 7 mm average height and showed variable coloration and pigmentation pattern (n = 47; 94%).
   The availability of juvenile seahorses during the reproductive season and their high survival performance ex situ highlight the feasibility of developing protocols in which juvenile seahorses serve as a novel source of broodstock.

AB  - Subsequent to escape from intense herbivory in the native range, invasive plants are expected to reduce allocation to costly anti-herbivory defences and have greater competitive ability than co-occurring native species. Given that invasive alien plants often occur in open habitats where light is less limited, it is reasonable to hypothesize that invasive plants should express high concentrations of gibberellins that enable them to allocate more biomass to roots, and thus have higher competitive ability than native plants. To test this prediction, we grew five congeneric pairs of invasive alien plants and native plants under two levels of nutrient availability (low versus high) and treated a half of the plants with a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol. Paclobutrazol significantly decreased aboveground, belowground and total biomass of the test plants. Interestingly, the effects on belowground biomass were significantly stronger for invasive plants than for native plants. A similar pattern was found for total biomass (marginally significant effect p = 0.0592). Additionally, paclobutrazol decreased root mass fraction for invasive plants, but tended to increase it for native plants. Our findings suggest that plant hormones can differently regulate biomass allocation of invasive and native plants, and thus contribute to greater growth of invasive plants compared to native plants.

AB  - Decoupling material use from economic growth is a prerequisite for alleviating the adverse effects of anthropogenic material use and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis with decoupling analysis to examine the relationship between the iron and steel cycle and economic growth in 23 industrialized countries from 1860 to 2018. Specifically, we employ both the quadratic and asymptotic functions to fit the relationship of per capita steel flow/stock indicators at six life cycle stages, including domestic production and apparent consumption of iron ore, pig iron, crude steel, finished steel, and fabricated steel, as well as in-use stock, against per capita GDP. A sequential decoupling between steel flow/stock indicators and GDP growth along the iron and steel cycle is evident. The historical dynamics of the comparative advantage of material flow indicators depict the wave-like geographic diffusion of industrialization. The mechanisms underlying the evolution of material-economy relationship can be attributed to resource endowments, industry policies, trade effects, and lock-in effect of in-use stock. Understanding this phenomenon can facilitate policy-making to promote dematerialization and improve material efficiency in developing countries.

AB  - From the perspective of the industry chain, this paper uses the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to divide the swine industry into six production stages: feed crop cultivation, feed crop transportation and processing, intestinal fermentation, manure management, energy consumption in pig farming, and slaughtering and processing. Using the LCA method, the carbon emissions from the swine industry are measured from 2001 to 2020 for the whole country and 31 provincial regions. Based on the measurement results, this paper analyzes the dynamic evolution of carbon emissions from the national swine industry during the study period. Meanwhile, the spatial divergence in carbon emissions from the swine industry and the share of carbon emissions from each production stage were further analyzed by combining different provincial regions and production stages. Afterward, this paper uses the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to decompose the influencing factors of carbon emissions at the national and provincial levels, and in each production stage. It is found that (1) The dynamic evolution of China's swine industry carbon emissions from 2001 to 2020 roughly follows a trend of "slow growth-sharp decline-fluctuating rise-fluctuating decline." The fluctuations are influenced by multiple factors, including the industry structure, agricultural policy, and farming scale. The primary driver for the increase in carbon emissions from the swine industry is the growth in demand for pork consumption, leading to the rise in swine supply. (2) In terms of spatial divergence at the provincial level, the regional differences in carbon emissions from the swine industry are significant, the total carbon emissions and unit carbon emissions of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan are higher than the national average. (3) In the production stages of the swine industry, feed crop cultivation and manure management are the primary sources of carbon emissions, associated with factors such as substantial feed consumption, crop production patterns, and backward manure management practices. (4) Regarding influencing factors, production efficiency, industry structure, and urbanization level have inhibiting effects on carbon emissions in the swine industry. Economic development and population scale have promoting effects. Production efficiency is the most significant inhibiting factor, and economic development is the most significant promoting factor. Finally, suggestions are made to curb carbon emissions in China's swine industry, including strengthening environmental control, formulating long-term plans for carbon emission reduction, delineating key areas and demonstration bases for carbon emission reduction, enhancing expertise in fertilizer application and manure treatment, and improving agricultural machinery and equipment.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used for genome editing in livestock production, although off-target effects can occur. It is the main method to produce genome-edited goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-edited primary goat fetal fibroblast cells (GFFs). Improving the double-strand break (DSB) efficiency of Cas9 in primary cells would improve the homologous repair (HR) efficiency. The low efficiency of HR remains a major hurdle in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise genome editing, increasing the work required to screen the genome-edited primary cell clones. In this study, we modified several essential parameters that affect the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in GFF cloning system, including establishing a high-efficiency transfection system for primary cells via nucleofection and optimizing homology arm (HA) length during HR. Here, we specifically inserted a recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase gene (rhBChE) into the goat fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-5 locus through the CRISPR/Cas9 system, thereby achieving simultaneous rhBChE insertion and FGF5 knock-out. First, this study introduced the Cas9, FGF5 knock-out small guide RNA, and rhBChE knock-in donors into GFFs by electroporation and obtained positive cell clones without off-target effects. Then, we demonstrated the expression of rhBChE in GFF clones and verified its function. Finally, we obtained a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated rhBChE-overexpression goat.

AB  - Egeria densa is a submerged aquatic weed that can grow into dense monocultures in rivers and dams in South Africa, which negatively affects ecosystem functioning and services. The biological control agent Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues-J & uacute;nior (Diptera: Ephydridae) was first released against Egeria densa Planchon (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa in 2018. Biotic resistance in an introduced range can have negative impacts on the ability of a biological control agent to establish and exert top-down pressure. Dipteran and lepidopteran species that are used as biological control agents are often susceptible to higher levels of parasitism in their introduced range than biological control agents from other insect orders. In addition, ecological analogues that are present in South Africa, make H. egeriae particularly vulnerable to biotic resistance. Considering this, post-release surveys were conducted to investigate if native parasitoids will extend their host range to include H. egeriae. Chaenusa seminervata van Achterberg, C. anervata van Achterberg (Braconidae: Alysiinae: Dacnusini) and Ademon lagarosiphonae van Achterberg (Braconidae: Opiinae) were reared from field-collected H. egeriae pupae, within a year of its release. These braconid parasitoids were previously recorded from a native herbivore, Hydrellia lagarosiphon Deeming (Diptera: Ephydridae). Parasitism levels of H. egeriae ranged from 50 to 74% in cold months and 0 to 60% in warmer months, with higher levels of parasitism at a site where H. lagarosiphon naturally occurs. This study also found that cumulative release events of the biological control agent increase the probability of parasitism of field populations, by directly increasing the host pool. However, biological control efficacy can potentially be increased by limiting release efforts to a maximum of two release events per site per season, with particular focus on releasing in warm (i.e. spring/summer) months. Continued post-release surveys are necessary to not only monitor H. egeriae's impact on E. densa, but also to obtain a better understanding of seasonal parasitism levels across E. densa-invaded sites in South Africa.

AB  - Hybridization and and introgression between distinct populations or species may promote or suppress local adaptation. Leopard frogs in the Lithobates (= Rana) pipiens complex have had widespread hybridization throughout their North American range. In South Dakota (SD), USA, Plains Leopard Frogs (L. blairi) are known to hybridize with Northern Leopard Frogs (L. pipiens); however, the distribution of L. blairi or hybrids therein in the southwestern part of the state is unresolved. We used morphometric and phenotypic characters to assess potential hybridization of leopard frogs at multiple sites in the southern Black Hills (BH) and Buffalo Gap National Grasslands (BGNG) of southwestern SD. We found subtle morphometric variation among population sites, which may represent local adaptation. Moreover, we identified a BGNG site with multiple individuals that expressed subtle or more pronounced phenotypic characters intermediate of L. blairi and L. pipiens, suggesting occurrence of introgression. This locality was most proximal to known hybrid sites to the east. Our data add resolution to the possible extent of L. blairi x L. pipiens hybridization in southwestern SD. Further studies, including genomic analyses, could elucidate the extent of introgression as well as infer any effects therein on local adaptation. Such data would be valuable for conservation efforts, especially in sympatric regions where they exist as sensitive species of concern.

AB  - Simple Summary Historical documentation shows that the Spanish Merino sheep was selected over many centuries due to the quality of wool, following which it was used to originate all other Merino breeds around the world, mainly by crossbreeding with local breeds. Today, the historical genetic lines that originated the Spanish Merino are still preserved in several closed herds in which they have been bred for nearly 200 years, maintaining their original genetic purity. Our study demonstrates, using a genomic approach, the exceptional genetic richness and variability of these lines, which are clearly differentiated from modern Merino breeds, and must therefore be protected to safeguard the large genetic pool they represent. According to historiographical documentation, the Romans first began to select Merino sheep in the Iberian Peninsula during the first century, with the aim of obtaining a breed appreciated for the quality of its wool. This process continued locally during the Middle Ages, when Spanish sheep were protected, and their export to foreign countries was banned. It was during the 16th century when individual Merino sheep were allowed to spread around the world to be used to improve the wool quality of local breeds. However, the wool crisis of the 1960s shifted the selection criteria of the Merino breed towards meat production at the expenses of wool. Consequently, individuals that display the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of those sheep originally bred in the kingdom of Spain in the Middle Ages are extremely difficult to find in commercial herds. In this study, we characterized the genetic basis of 403 individuals from the main historical Spanish Merino genetic lines (Granda, Hidalgo, Lopez-Montenegro, Maeso, Donoso and Egea), which were bred in isolation over the last 200 years, using a genomic approach based on genotyping data from the Axiom (TM) Ovine 50K SNP Genotyping Array. Our analysis included measuring population structure, genomic differentiation indexes, runs of homozygosity (ROH) patterns, and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). The results showed large genetic differences between the historical lines, even though they belong to the same breed. In addition, ROH analysis showed differences due to increased inbreeding among the ancient generations compared with the modern Merino lines, confirming the breed's ancestral and closed origin. However, our results also showed a high variability and richness within the Spanish historical Merino lines from a genetic viewpoint. This fact, together with their great ability to produce high-quality wool, suggests that ancestral Merino lines from Spain should be considered a valuable genetic population to be maintained as a resource for the improvement of wool-producing sheep breeds all around the world.

AB  - To reduce greenhouse gas emissions during the composting of animal manure and promote the resource utilization of Chinese herbal plants, experiments on pig manure composting were conducted in a plastic greenhouse. A mixture of herbal powders (Radix isatidis and Radix Polygoni Multiflori, mixed in a 1:1 ratio) was added to the pig manure at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.5% (w/w), respectively. The results showed that the emission peaks of greenhouse gases occurred in the early stages of composting. The addition of 0.5% of a mixture of Chinese herbal plant powders resulted in a significant reduction in cumulative emissions of CO2 (45.0%) and N2O (60.0%) compared to the control. This treatment also resulted in the lowest global warming potential, measured at 91.3 g kg(-1), and significantly increased the germination index. The study concluded that adding 0.5% Chinese herbal plant powder to compost effectively mitigated greenhouse gas emissions during the composting process.

AB  - Secondary plant chemistry mediates a variety of communication signals among species, playing a fundamental role in the evolutionary diversification of communities and ecosystems. Herein, we explored diet-mediated host plant effects on development and immune response of a generalist insect herbivore. Vanessa cardui (Nymphalidae) caterpillars were reared on leaves of three host plants that vary in secondary metabolites, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) and Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae). Insect development was evaluated by larval and pupal viabilities, survivorship, and development rate. Immune response was measured as phenoloxidase (PO) activity. Additionally, chemical profiles of the host plants were obtained by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the discriminant metabolites were determined using a metabolomic approach. Caterpillars reared on P. lanceolata exhibited the highest larval and pupal viabilities, as well as PO activity, and P. lanceolata leaves were chemically characterized by the presence of iridoid glycosides, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Taraxacum officinale leaves were characterized mainly by the presence of phenylpropanoids, flavones O-glycoside and germacranolide-type sesquiterpene lactones; caterpillars reared on this host plant fully developed to the adult stage, however they exhibited lower larval and pupal viabilities compared to individuals reared on P. lanceolata. Conversely, caterpillars reared on T. diversifolia leaves, which contain phenylpropanoids, flavones and diverse furanoheliangolide-type sesquiterpene lactones, were not able to complete larval development and exhibited the lowest PO activity. These findings suggested that V. cardui have adapted to tolerate potentially toxic metabolites occurring in P. lanceolata (iridoid glycosides), however caterpillars were not able to cope with potentially detrimental metabolites occurring in T. diversifolia (furanoheliangolides). Therefore, we suggest that furanoheliangolide-type sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for the poor development and immune response observed for caterpillars reared on T. diversifolia.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) typically spreads through ticks and is categorized as a viral hemorrhagic fever. CCHF is a fatal endemic disease in Iraq, and it has been reported sporadically since its first report in 1979. Recent outbreaks during 2021-2023 and their fatal consequences captured the interest of this study. CCHF is a tick-borne disease that represents a major challenge to the public health, social, and economic sectors. The geographical distribution of CCHF is closely linked with Hyalomma vector tick distribution. Therefore, predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of the disease vector in relation to relevant environmental factors provides invaluable information for establishing an early warning system based on which preventive measures can be taken to minimize the spread and, hence, the fatal consequences of CCHF. To achieve this, this study incorporates geospatial techniques and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) to assess the habitat suitability of the Hyalomma vector and to identify the key environmental drivers contributing to its spatial distribution in Iraq. Utilizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the performance metric, the model evaluation yielded successful results in predicting habitat suitability for Hyalomma vector ticks in Iraq. The AUC attained an average score of 0.885 with a regularization multiplier (beta) set at 1. The Hyalomma ticks' suitable habitat distribution within the study area covers a fraction of the total land, at approximately 51% (225,665 km(2)) of the entire 441,724 km(2) region. Among these suitable areas, 41.57% (183,631 km(2)) were classified as lowly suitable, 8.61% (38,039 km(2)) as moderately suitable, and 0.9% (3994 km(2)) as highly suitable. Several factors have significantly influenced Hyalomma vector tick distribution in Iraq. These include land cover (accounting for 50.8%), elevation (contributing 30.4%), NDVI (5.7%), temperature seasonality (4.7%), precipitation seasonality (3.3%), sheep density (2.3%), goat density (2.2%), and the mean diurnal range (0.5%). The findings of this study could have significant implications for establishing a strategic early warning system and taking preventive measures beforehand to minimize and control Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Iraq and similar ecoregions in the Middle East. As a primary precaution, this study recommends focusing on highly suitable areas (3994 km(2)) in the southern part of Iraq for management and preventive actions.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of pigs' weaning weight (WW) on their growth performance and blood immunological, antioxidant, and gut permeability parameters in the early nursery period. At weaning, a total of 48 pigs, weaned at 20.7 +/- 0.74 d of age, were allotted to two WW categories-HWW, with a WW over 5.5 kg (average 6.79 +/- 0.53 kg), and LWW, with a WW of less than 5.5 kg (average 4.43 +/- 0.56 kg)-for a 14 d postweaning period. The WW did not affect the average daily gain (ADG) in d 0-7 postweaning or the plasma malondialdehyde levels over the entire period. HWW pigs had a higher body weight and ADG than LWW pigs (p < 0.05) in the overall period, with greater plasma immunoglobulin G (p < 0.05) and A (p = 0.06, tendency) levels at d 7 postweaning and superoxide dismutase activity at d 14 postweaning (p = 0.05, tendency), with positive correlations with the WW (p < 0.05). HWW pigs had lower plasma diamine oxidase (p < 0.05) and d-lactate (p = 0.06, tendency) levels at d 14 postweaning, with a negative correlation with the WW (p < 0.05). In conclusion, although there was no effect of the WW on growth rate in the first week postweaning and oxidative stress in the early nursery period, HWW pigs exhibited greater growth performance, immunoglobulin levels, and antioxidant capacity but lower gut permeability than LWW pigs in the early nursery period.

AB  - IntroductionLaboratory animals are widely used in biomedical research. Surveillance of naturally occurring virus in laboratory animals is important to fully understand the results of animal experiment, control laboratory-acquired infections among research personnel and manage viral transmission within laboratory animal populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of multiple RNA viruses in laboratory animals commonly used in China.MethodsWe screened viral RNA for five different potentially zoonotic RNA viruses (astrovirus, coronavirus, hepevirus, hepatovirus and picornavirus) that can be transmitted via the faecal-oral route in 759 faecal samples collected from nine commonly used laboratory animals (mice, rats, monkeys, rabbits, pigs, dogs, ferrets, goats and tree shrews) in China. Viral RNA was screened by broad-spectrum reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers annealing in genome-conserved regions. The laboratory mice and rats used in this study were specific-pathogen-free. The other laboratory animals were conventional animals.ResultsAt least one selected virus was detected in each of the nine sampled laboratory animal types, except tree shrews. The total positive rates of viral RNA for astroviruses, coronaviruses, hepeviruses and picornaviruses in the selected laboratory animals were 4.3%, 7.6%, 8.0% and 1.1%, respectively. Among these, the positivity rates for hepevirus RNA in laboratory ferrets (41.3%) and rabbits (17.8%), astrovirus RNA in laboratory pigs (75.0%) and coronavirus RNA in laboratory ferrets (45.7%) were relatively high. Viral RNA for hepatovirus was negative in all selected laboratory animals. Co-infection with multiple viruses has also been observed in laboratory dogs, pigs, ferrets and rabbits.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for the surveillance of natural viral infections in laboratory animals.

AB  - Rhino species use their horns in social interactions but also when accessing resources, rubbing and in interspecific defence. The current poaching crisis has seen southern white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) increasingly dehorned as a conservation management practise, but few studies have evaluated whether the procedure has any behavioural effects. This study sought to document and describe horn-contingent behaviours during resource access, wallowing and rubbing in freeranging white rhinos and establish whether dehorning, also known as horn trimming, impacts on their frequency or function. Data were collected through camera trapping and field observations at two sites in South Africa. The results provide no evidence that dehorning disrupts digging behaviours during mineral consumption or wallowing and suggests that dehorning is unlikely to have a strong biological impact on resource access. Furthermore, the frequency of horn-rubbing behaviours did not appear to be influenced by levels of horn growth. This suggests the procedure has a limited impact on these aspects of the species' ecology and provides support that dehorning can be employed as a management tool to reduce poaching in freeranging populations of white rhino.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of supplementing feed with arazyme and dietary carbohydrolases derived from inver-tebrate gut-associated symbionts on the noxious gas emissions, gut microbiota, and host-microbiome interactions of pigs. Here, 270 and 260 growing pigs were assigned to control and treatment groups, respectively. The tested feed additives contained a mixture of arazyme (2,500,000 Unit/kg) and synergetic enzymes, xylanase (200,000 Unit/kg) and mannanase (200,000 Unit/kg), derived from insect gut-associated symbionts in a 7.5:1:1 ratio. The control group was fed a basal diet and the treatment group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.1 % enzyme mixture (v/v) for 2 months. Odorous gases were monitored in ventilated air from tested houses. Fecal samples were collected from steel plate under the cage at the completion of the experiment to determine chemical composition, odor emis-sions, and bacterial communities. There was a significant decrease in the concentration of NH3 (22.5 vs. 11.2 ppm; P < 0.05), H2S (7.35 vs. 3.74 ppm; P < 0.05), trimethylamine (TMA) (0.066 vs. 0.001 ppm; P < 0.05), and p-cresol (0.004 ppm vs. 0 ppm; P < 0.05) at 56 din treatment group compared with the control group. Moreover, fecal analysis results showed that exogenous enzyme supplementation caused a reduction in VFAs and indole content with approximately >60 % and 72.7 %, respectively. The result of gas emission analysis showed that NH3 (9.9 vs. 5.3 ppm; P < 0.05) and H2S (5.8 vs. 4.1 ppm; P < 0.05) were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group. The gut microbiota of the treatment group differed significantly from that of the control group, and the treatment group altered predicted metabolic pathways, including sulfur and nitrogen related metabolism, urea degradation. The results demonstrated that supplementing feed with arazyme with dietary carbohydrolases effectively controls noxious gas emissions and improves health and meat quality of pigs.

AB  - Context. The fluctuating fortunes of the brush-tailed bettong have seen this species classified as "Rare or Likely to Become Extinct' in the 1970s, delisted and hailed as a conservation success in the 1990s, and re-listed as "Critically Endangered' in 2008. Key actions to recover this species, broad-scale fox control and reintroduction to fox-free habitat, have had variable success. Aims. To monitor the reintroduction of bettong to fox-free habitat of Wadderin Sanctuary in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia. Methods. Growth of the population was monitored over a 12-year period by regular trapping throughout the sanctuary. Key results. The population increased monotonically to peak at 305 individuals (0.71 ha-1) at 7.5 years following release, before subsequent decline. Population growth was accompanied by a significant decline in mean condition and a reduction in the proportion of females with pouch young or lactating, presumably owing to resources per head gradually declining. The proportion of large pouch young relative to total young carried by females declined as woylie numbers increased, suggesting that, increasingly, pouch young did not go to full term. Declines in population number, condition and reproduction were exacerbated by dry seasons. Bettongs established successfully, despite a succession of single feral cats within the 427 ha sanctuary. The removal of the last cat, 8 years following the establishment of bettongs, had no obvious impact on bettong numbers, as, at this point, their population was stabilising because of declining body condition and reduced reproductive output. Conclusions. The observed pattern of population growth of bettongs was consistent with an herbivore irruption consequent of a release of a species to new habitat. Decline following peak numbers appeared as a result of density-dependent resource limitation (declining resources per head with increased abundance) interacting with years of low rainfall. Implications. The dynamics of irruption and decline of herbivores are relevant to management of reintroduced populations to fenced predator-free sites and, potentially, to unfenced populations following release from predation.

AB  - Latrine behaviour in lemurs has been interpreted as a means of olfactory communication linked to energy efficient resource defence against neighbouring individuals and/or social bonding within social groups. For social bonding, latrines might best be placed at the core of home ranges, while resource defence could be based on defending the most important part of the home range, i.e., the core area or by establishing olfactory landmarks at the periphery of the home range. Most studies on lemurs describe deposition of urine and faeces in latrines in the core of the home range. In a study at the limit of the distributional range of Lepilemur petteri, at a site with unpredictable weather conditions, we radio-tracked 12 individuals and located latrines within their home ranges. In our study, latrines were located at the periphery of the home ranges. This is interpreted as a means to defend a larger area rather than specific resource rich sites that may or may not provide food in a given year. Regardless of the flexible spatial pattern, and in common with other mammals, lemur latrines are characterized by conspicuous trees, even though urine and faeces are deposited at the base of trees. This indicates some kind of optimal structure of latrines to convey information most effectively, possibly by combining visual and olfactory cues.

AB  - Wild Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana Decne.) results from a cross between various cultivars of P. calleryana and any other Pyrus individual. While many cultivars of this species are still commercially produced and sold for horticultural purposes in the United States, Callery pear is a detrimental invasive species that encroaches on many managed and natural areas, damages equipment and injures people, pets, and livestock with its thorny branches, and likely causes detrimental ecological impacts. Despite its importance as an invasive species, the mechanisms behind Callery pear's invasion and spread are unclear. To identify potential drivers of invasion, we quantified feeding of generalist and specialist herbivores on Callery pear and four native tree species, based on insect host ranges, with choice and no-choice experiments followed by field surveys of herbivory on these same tree species. Feeding by all herbivores was lower on Callery pear than on native tree species in no-choice assays. Specifically, feeding on Callery pear was moderate by generalists and very low by specialists. Specialist feeding on Callery pear was comparable to native species in choice assays but was significantly reduced in no-choice assays. Reduced specialist feeding along with moderate generalist feeding on Callery pear in the field provides evidence for the Enemy Release Hypothesis as a potential driving mechanism behind its invasion success.

AB  - The Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) in the foothills of the Himalayas is one of the four major elephant ranges in India. In response to the escalating problem of crop raiding by elephants, the State Forest Department of Uttarakhand (UKFD) has built walls along the forest boundary in several protected areas and multiple-use forest divisions. Given the high costs of constructing walls and the growing demand from farmers, the UKFD solicited an evaluation of wall efficacy. In response, we surveyed 98.4 km of walls in the TAL to assess frequency of breaches. We used generalized linear models to examine the influence of 7 explanatory variables on variation in breach frequencies between stretches of the wall. We observed 598 breaches and 87 weak spots in the 98.4 km of walls. Elephants caused 48% of the breaches, suggesting that walls in the TAL were not effective barriers against elephants. Explanatory variables of wall length, forest division, relative density of elephants, and land use along the wall stretches explained variation in wall breach frequencies. Based on our results, walls would only reduce elephant intrusion on 9 stretches (>1 km) totaling 11.8 km (approximately 12% of the wall stretches built in TAL). (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Ectoparasites in livestock and pets are associated with the transmission of diseases of veterinary and public health importance. The paucity of data on the ectoparasite diversity of pet and domestic animals in Puducherry is the basis for our study. Ectoparasites in animals brought to the veterinary dispensaries in Puducherry were retrieved and identified morphologically. Molecular confirmation of the ectoparasites was done by amplifying and sequencing the genes cytochrome oxidase I (COI), 16s rRNA and 18s rRNA. A total of 792 animals were screened and 2625 ectoparasites were retrieved. The most common ectoparasite retrieved was ticks (n = 2140) followed by fleas (n = 326) and lice (n = 180). Eight tick species belonging to two genera were collected: Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rh. simus, Rh. bursa, Rh. (Boophilus) annulatus, R. (Boophilus) microplus, Rh. haemaphysaloides, Haemaphysalis intermedia and Ha. bispinosa. Three sucking lice, Haematopinus quadripertusus, H. tuberculatus, Linognathus africanus, and two chewing lice, Heterodoxus spiniger and Trichodectes canis were found infesting the animals. Ctenocephalides felis felis was the only flea species observed to infest the animals. Common grazing areas and stray animals contributed to wide dispersal of the ectoparasites on different hosts. A longitudinal study might uncover the influence of season on ectoparasite prevalence and diversity in Puducherry.

AB  - There are growing concerns about the neurodevelopmental toxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), but the toxicological phenotypes and mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 2,2 ',4,4 '-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) from 4 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf). The results showed that BDE-47 stimulated the production of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, but inhibited expression of Nestin, GFAP, Gap43, and PSD95 in 24 hpf embryos. Importantly, we unraveled the inhibitory effects of BDE-47 on neural crest-derived melanocyte differentiation and melanin syntheses process, evidenced by disrupted expression of wnt1, wnt3, sox10, mitfa, tyrp1a, tyrp1b, tryp2, and oca2 gene in 72 hpf embryos and decreased tyrosinase activities in embryos at 48 and 72 hpf. The transcriptional activities of myosin VAa, kif5ba, rab27a, mlpha, and cdc42 genes, which are associated with intracellular transport process, were also disturbed during zebrafish development. Ultimately, these alterations led to fast spontaneous movement and melanin accumulation deficit in zebrafish embryos upon BDE-47 exposure. Our results provide an important extension for understanding the neurodevelopmental effects of PBDEs and facilitate the comprehensive evaluation of neurotoxicity in embryos.

AB  - The study aimed to explore the impact of strength training on long-term memory in adult and middle-aged rodents, specifically male Wistar rats aged 9 and 20 months. These rats were divided into two groups: one sedentary (SED) and the other trained (ST) for a period of 12 weeks. The strength training involved squatting exercises using adapted equipment, while the sedentary group maintained their regular, non-exercised routine. Behavioral tasks assessing mobility, anxiety, and multiple facets of memory, such as object recognition memory (ORM), social recognition memory (SRM), and object location memory (OLM), were conducted post-training. The findings were promising, revealing a generally beneficial impact of strength training on memory tasks across both age groups. Specifically, the ORM tasks showed facilitated and improved learning in both adult and middle-aged rats that underwent training. In contrast, OLM displayed only a facilitatory effect in both age groups, meaning that while the trained rats learned the task, they did not outperform the sedentary group. For SRM, a facilitatory effect was observed only in the adult group. In addition to the cognitive benefits, strength training was found to have an anxiolytic effect in the 9-month-old rats and positively affected body mass and adipose tissue composition. Notably, the study correlated the strength gains from the training with improved performance in memory tasks. These outcomes provide crucial insights into the potential of exercise-based interventions to bolster cognitive health and mitigate age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - With the rapid growth of livestock breeding, manure composting has evolved to be an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4) which accelerates global warming. Calcium superphosphate (CaSSP), as a commonly used fertilizer, was proposed to be effective in reducing CH4 emissions from manure composting, but the intrinsic biological mechanism remains unknown. Methanogens and methanotrophs both play a key role in mediating CH4 fluxes, therefore we hypothesized that the CaSSP-mediated reduction in CH4 emissions was attributed to the shift of methanogens and methanotrophs, which was regulated by physicochemical parameter changes. To test this hypothesis, a 60-day pig manure windrow composting experiment was conducted to investigate the response of CH4 emissions to CaSSP amendment, with a close linkage to methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. Results showed that CaSSP amendment significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 49.5% compared with the control over the whole composting period. The decreased mcrA gene (encodes the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase) abundance in response to CaSSP amendment suggested that the CH4 emissions were reduced primarily due to the suppressed microbial CH4 production. Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis showed that the overall distribution pattern of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities were significantly affected by CaSSP amendment. Particularly, the relative abundance of Methanosarcina that is known to be a dominant group for CH4 production, significantly decreased by up to 25.3% accompanied with CaSSP addition. Only Type I methanotrophs was detected in our study and Methylocaldum was the dominant methanotrophs in this composting system; in detail, CaSSP amendment increased the relative abundance of OTUs belong to Methylocaldum and Methylobacter. Moreover, the increased SO42- concentration and decreased pH acted as two key factors influencing the methanogenic and methanotrophic composition, with the former has a negative effect on methanogenesis growth and can later promote CH4 oxidation at a low level. This study deepens our understanding of the interaction between abiotic factors, function microbiota and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as provides implication for practically reducing composting GHG emissions.

AB  - The presented ecological and economic assessment of agricultural land in the Republic of Tyva was developed taking into account the theoretical foundations of the economic assessment of the cost of land and the methods for valuation of environmentally significant factors. According to the agricultural and natural-economic zoning of the East Siberian region, the Republic of Tyva is assigned to the steppe sheep-breeding and cattle-breeding zone. For the purpose of a more rational distribution and scientifically based specialization of agricultural production, the territory of Tuva is divided into four agricultural zones (Economics of the Tuva ASSR, 1973). The agricultural lands of the study area are included in the Central agricultural zone, mainly agricultural subtaiga, livestock-grain steppe and in the mainly livestock-grain Western agricultural zone. These are the largest, developed and densely populated parts of the republic, where most of the arable land, two-thirds of the hayfields and pastures, and more than 80% of the population of the republic are concentrated. Territories of agricultural lands are located within the dry-steppe, steppe and forest-steppe natural and climatic zones. The climate is characterized by the highest degree of aridity. The main types of soils on arable land are chestnut sandy loamy soils that are subject to wind erosion (60%), chernozems (23%), and alluvial soddy soils (15%). The performed assessment shows that the total damage from soil degradation for the Central and Western agricultural zones of the republic is estimated at more than 3.5 bln rubles, which is about one-third of the cost of agricultural land of the republic. A decrease in the cost of land for the period from 2012 to 2017 was revealed for the Tandinskii (54.1%) and Chedi-Kholskii districts (47.2%), which is due to soil degradation.

   Toxoplasma gondii is a significant pathogen affecting humans and animals. Rodents are known to be reservoir hosts of T. gondii and therefore play a significant role in the dissemination of this parasite. We conducted seromonitoring for T. gondii in four sylvatic rodent species in Poland. We report an overall seroprevalence of 5.5% (3.6% for Myodes glareolus and 20% for other vole species). Seroprevalence in bank voles varied significantly between host age and sex. Our results, therefore, make a significant contribution to the understanding of the role of wild rodent populations in the maintenance and dissemination of T. gondii and identify key factors that affect the magnitude of seroprevalence in specific host populations.
   Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite with a broad range of intermediate hosts, including humans and rodents. Rodents are considered to be reservoirs of infection for their predators, including cats, felids, pigs, and wild boars. We conducted a multi-site, long-term study on T. gondii in northeastern Poland. The study aimed to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii in the four abundant vole species found in the region (Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, and Alexandromys oeconomus) and to assess the influence of both extrinsic (year of study and study site) and intrinsic (host sex and host age) factors on seroprevalence. A bespoke enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect antibodies against T. gondii. We examined 577 rodent individuals and detected T. gondii antibodies in the sera of all four rodent species with an overall seroprevalence of 5.5% [4.2-7.3] (3.6% [2.6-4.9] for M. glareolus and 20% [12-30.9] for M. arvalis, M. agrestis, and A. oeconomus). Seroprevalence in bank voles varied significantly between host age and sex. Seroprevalence increased with host age and was higher in females than males. These results contribute to our understanding of the distribution and abundance of T. gondii in voles in Poland and confirm that T. gondii also circulates in M. glareolus and M. arvalis, M. agrestis and A. oeconomus. Therefore, they may potentially play a role as reservoirs of this parasite in the sylvatic environment.

AB  - Background: The extant members of the Asian rhinos have experienced severe population and range declines since Pleistocene through a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. The one-horned rhino is the only Asian species recovered from such conditions but most of the extant populations are reaching carrying capacity. India currently harbours similar to 83% of the global wild one-horned rhino populations distributed across seven protected areas. Recent assessments recommend reintroduction-based conservation approaches for the species, and implementation of such efforts would greatly benefit from detailed genetic assessments and evolutionary history of these populations. Using mitochondrial data, we investigated the phylogeography, divergence and demographic history of one-horned rhinos across its Indian range.
   Results: We report the first complete mitogenome from all the extant Indian wild one-horned rhino populations (n = 16 individuals). Further, we identified all polymorphic sites and assessed rhino phylogeography (2531 bp mtDNA, n = 111 individuals) across India. Results showed 30 haplotypes distributed as three distinct genetic clades (F-st value 0.68-1) corresponding to the states of Assam (n = 28 haplotypes), West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh (both monomorphic). The reintroduced population of Uttar Pradesh showed maternal signatures of Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Mitochondrial phylogenomics suggests one-horned rhino diverged from its recent common ancestors similar to 950 Kya and different populations (Assam, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh/Nepal) coalesce at similar to 190-50 Kya, corroborating with the paleobiogeography history of the Indian subcontinent. Further, the demography analyses indicated historical decline in female effective population size similar to 300-200 Kya followed by increasing trends during similar to 110-60 Kya.
   Conclusion: The phylogeography and phylogenomic outcomes suggest recognition of three 'Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs)' in Indian rhino. With ongoing genetic isolation of the current populations, future management efforts should focus on identifying genetically variable founder animals and consider periodic supplementation events while planning future rhino reintroduction programs in India. Such well-informed, multidisciplinary approach will be the only way to ensure evolutionary, ecological and demographic stability of the species across its range.

AB  - The alternative prey hypothesis (APH) states that temporally synchronous population fluctuations of microtine rodents and other small herbivores are caused by generalist predators that show functional and numerical responses to the abundance of microtines. This would lead to an increased predation of alternative prey in the low phase of the microtine population fluctuations. One candidate for such a predator is the tree-climbing pine marten (Martes martes), which includes bird eggs in its diet, among them eggs of the cavity-nesting boreal owl (Aegolius funereus). I used long-term data to test whether pine marten predation of boreal owl eggs in nest boxes varied as predicted by the APH. The probability of predation of owl nests situated < 45 km from a site where microtines were trapped in spring during four decades increased with microtine trapping index, which is opposite to the prediction from the APH. As the data set was limited to one nest per box, I extended it spatially and temporally using the clutch size of each boreal owl nest as a proxy for the actual microtine abundance at the site. The probability of nest predation increased with clutch size. However, the effects of microtine index and owl clutch size became non-significant when I controlled for habitat, and in particular cavity age, which had an overriding effect. The increase in predation probability with cavity age suggests that the long-term spatial memory of pine marten is an important factor in the pattern of its nest predation in tree cavities.

AB  - The high mortality upon enteric virus infection in piglets causes huge economic losses. To control these in-fections, potential causes for this high susceptibility for enteric virus infections in younger piglets were analyzed by comparing the intestinal barrier between 1-week, 2-week and 4-week-old piglets. In this study, histological staining was used to analyze morphological differences in intestinal villi, real-time qPCR was performed to assess mRNA expression levels of genes that were related to viral infection and differentiation of immune cells, and flow cytometry was utilized to measure the frequencies of T cells. According to the results obtained, 1-week-old piglets have intestinal villi with shallower crypts, less well developed epithelial cells and a more immature immune system compared to older pigs. Moreover, high amounts of enteric virus invasion-assisting proteins but low amounts of resistant proteins in 1-week piglets could also be a reason for the high susceptibility of 1 -week-old piglets.

AB  - Sheep with naturally occurring CLN5 and CLN6 forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (Batten disease) share the key clinical features of the human disease and represent an ideal model system in which the clinical efficacy of gene therapies is developed and test. However, it was first important to characterize the neuropathological changes that occur with disease progression in affected sheep. This study compared neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal storage accumulation in CLN5 affected Borderdale, CLN6 affected South Hampshire, and Merino sheep brains from birth to end-stage disease at <= 24 months of age. Despite very different gene products, mutations, and subcellular localizations, the pathogenic cascade was remarkably similar for all three disease models. Glial activation was present at birth in affected sheep and preceded neuronal loss, with both spreading from the visual and parieto-occipital cortices most prominently associated with clinical symptoms to the entire cortical mantle by end-stage disease. In contrast, the subcortical regions were less involved, yet lysosomal storage followed a near-linear increase across the diseased sheep brain with age. Correlation of these neuropathological changes with published clinical data identified three potential therapeutic windows in affected sheep-presymptomatic (3 months), early symptomatic (6 months), and a later symptomatic disease stage (9 months of age)-beyond which the extensive depletion of neurons was likely to diminish any chance of therapeutic benefit. This comprehensive natural history of the neuropathological changes in ovine CLN5 and CLN6 disease will be integral in determining what impact treatment has at each of these disease stages.

AB  - Twenty-six samples of wild boar liver and muscle from the Central Apennine Mountain (Italy) were analysed for 19 perfluoro-alkyl substances (PFASs), 10 polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and 3 hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs). All samples were analysed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for PBDEs and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for PFASs and HBCDs, using an in-house developed analytical procedure. The brominated flame retardants (BFR) levels in livers were negligible: E10PBDEs reached a maximum value of 0.079 mu g/kg, whereas HBCDs were not quantified in almost all of the samples analysed. BFR concentrations in muscles were higher, but not significantly therefore, for E10PBDEs lower bound, a mean value of 0.045 mu g/kg (0.005-0.155 mu g/kg range) was measured, while a-HBCD was quantified with a maximum of 0.084 mu g/kg in 9 of the samples. Only two muscles contained all 3 HBCD isomers at concentrations of approximately 0.200 mu g/kg. E19PFAS in the 26 wild boar livers was in the range 31.9-228 mu g/kg, with a mean value of 87.7 mu g/kg, reaching levels significantly higher than in muscles, which exhibited a mean concentration of 3.08 mu g/kg (0.59-9.12 mu g/kg range). Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most prevalent compound in all liver samples, accounting for more than half of the total PFASs contamination, confirming that the liver is the primary target organ for PFOS exposure Perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), which accounts for 25-30-% of the total contamination, was the most abundant compound in the muscle, followed by PFOS.

AB  - Although vaccination is broadly used in North American swine breeding herds, managing swine influenza is challenging primarily due to the continuous evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) and the ability of the virus to transmit among vaccinated pigs. Studies that have simultaneously assessed the impact of vaccination on the emergence of IAV reassortment and genetic variation in pigs are limited. Here, we directly sequenced 28 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, and characterized 202 individual viral plaques recovered from 13 BALF samples. We identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, we found that prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, our results highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.

AB  - Genomic prediction (GP), which uses genome-wide markers to estimate breeding values, is a crucial tool for accelerating genetic progress in livestock and plant breeding. The accuracy of GP depends on several factors, including the statistical model, marker density, and cross-validation strategy. This study evaluated these factors to optimize GP accuracy for eight economically important carcass and body traits in a Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) (DLY) pig population. This study used 50 K SNP chip data from 1494 DLY pigs, which were imputed to the whole genome sequence (WGS) level. Seven different models were compared, including GBLUP, ssGBLUP, and five Bayesian models. The ssGBLUP model consistently outperformed other models across all traits, with prediction accuracies ranging from 0.371 to 0.502. Further analyses showed that prediction accuracy improved with increasing cross-validation folds and marker density, particularly in the low-density panel. However, the improvement plateaued in medium-to-high-density scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting the model, marker density, and cross-validation strategy to optimize GP accuracy for carcass and body traits in commercial pigs. The insights from this study can guide breeders and researchers in maximizing genetic progress in pig breeding programs.

AB  - With its facility to assess causal mechanisms among multiple variables, the application of path analysis in medical, natural, and social sciences has become widespread. Of the many types of path analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), including Bayesian applications of this method, has gained popularity. However, SEM remains constrained by biased estimates in the case of model misspecification, while Bayesian methods are limited by time consumption and computational requirements. Here, we propose a novel estimator utilizing robust estimating equations combined within a Bayesian framework to improve multilevel path analysis. We apply this method to an ecological trophic interaction case study that assessed the path effects of global plant diversity on the interactions of plants, invertebrate herbivores, and their natural enemies. Using a simulation study, we show that this new estimator is unbiased and more robust. Moreover, the computational time cost for the estimating procedure is reduced compared with multivariate Bayesian analysis.

AB  - The illegal wildlife trade is resulting in worldwide biodiversity loss and species' extinction. It should be exposed so that the problems of conservation caused by it can be highlighted and resolutions can be found. Social media is an effective method of information dissemination, providing a real-time, low-cost, and convenient platform for the public to release opinions on wildlife protection. This paper aims to explore the usage of social media in understanding public opinions toward conservation events, and illegal rhino trade is an example. This paper provides a framework for analyzing rhino protection issues by using Twitter. A total of 83,479 useful tweets and 33,336 pieces of users' information were finally restored in our database after filtering out irrelevant tweets. With 2422 records of trade cases, this study builds up a rhino trade network based on social media data. The research shows important findings: (1) Tweeting behaviors are somewhat affected by the information of traditional mass media. (2) In general, countries and regions with strong negative sentiment tend to have high volume of rhino trade cases, but not all. (3) Social celebrities' participation in activities arouses wide public concern, but the influence does not last for more than a month. NGOs, GOs, media, and individual enterprises are dominant in the dissemination of information about rhino trade. This study contributes in the following ways: First, this paper conducts research on public opinions toward wildlife conservation using natural language processing technique. Second, this paper offers advice to governments and conservationist organizations, helping them utilize social media for protecting wildlife.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are unicellular marine micro-organism with a hard exoskeleton and commonly present in the benthic community of marine ecosystem. This study aimed to identify the benthic foraminifera present along the coastal areas of eight municipalities in Biliran Island, Philippines. Quadrat sampling was conducted and three samples per quadrant transect of 1 m x 1 m divided into nine squares were collected. The samples were then observed under the microscope, and the specimens seen were identified by comparing them with the images of the sample species from the website https://marinespecies.org/. The researchers conducted an in-situ collection of the foraminiferal shells from intertidal areas along shallow water coastlines of the island. Results showed that the coastal environment of Biliran Island has the presence of the genera Spirillina, Quinqueloculina, Marginopora and Sorites. The identified species were classified based on their feeding mechanisms as herbivory and passive suspension feeding. The presence of benthic foraminifera species along the coastal environments of Biliran Island provides a record of the environment where they are found, making them natural bioindicators of water quality. This study provides a baseline for further studies on the distribution and abundance of benthic foraminifera in the area and can contribute to the understanding of the environmental conditions of the coastal areas in Biliran Island.

AB  - Personal ornaments have become a key cultural proxy to investigate cognitive evolution, modern human dispersal, and population dynamics. Here, we reassess personal ornaments found at Zhoukoudian Upper Cave and compare them with those from other Late Paleolithic Northern Chinese sites. We reappraise the information provided by Pei Wen Chung on Upper Cave personal ornaments lost during World War II and analyze casts of 17 of them, along with two unpublished objects displayed at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum and three original perforated teeth rediscovered at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum. We apply archeozoological, technological and use-wear analyses to document variation in ornamental practices and their change throughout the site stratigraphy. Badger, fox, red deer, sika deer, marten, and tiger teeth as well as carp bone, bird bone, Anadara shell, limestone beads, and perforated pebble appear to have been the preferred objects used as ornaments by Upper Cave visitors. Multivariate analysis of technological data highlights a correspondence between cultural layers and perforation techniques, with radial incising being typical of layer L2 and bidirectional incising of L4. The three rediscovered badger canines display features suggesting they were sewed on clothing rather than suspended from necklaces or bracelets. Elemental scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectromety and mineralogical (mu-Raman) analyses of red residues adhering to the rediscovered teeth indicate these objects were originally coated with ochre and identify variations that match differences in technology. The two ornaments exhibited at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum are ancient teeth that were recently perforated and should be excluded from the Upper Cave assemblage. A seriation of Late Paleolithic ornaments found at Northern Chinese sites identifies a clear-cut difference in preferred ornament types between western and eastern sites, interpreted as reflecting two long-lasting traditions in garment symbolic codes.

AB  - This study investigates soil phosphorus (P) partitioning and transformations through chemical fractionation and modeling across various land uses to elucidate their impact on P dynamics and the potential for eutrophication. Geo-referenced soils (0-30 cm at various depth intervals) were collected from diverse land uses, including corn, soybean, wheat stubble, modified relay intercropping, corn-soybean with rye under conventional tillage and no-till systems, and sheep pastures, alongside an adjacent forest (control). Processed soils were sequentially extracted to quantify soluble reactive (SRP), exchangeable (EP), Ca and Mg bound (CaMgP), Fe and Al bound (FeAlP), particulate organic (POP), residual (RP), and total P pools. Results showed significant effects of land use and soil depth on extracted P pools. Notably, corn-soybean with rye exhibited a higher SRP accumulation (2.8 mg/kg) compared to the forest. The labile (SRP + EP), moderately labile (FeAlP + CaMgP + POP), and non-labile P (RP) pools accounted for 1 to 2, 23 to 29, and 65 to 76% of total P, respectively. The structural equation model elucidated soil P transformation, indicating the contribution of labile, moderately labile, and non-labile P pools to SRP accumulation in various land uses. Our findings underscore the critical link between land use, soil P dynamics, and eutrophication risk, offering valuable insights for developing agricultural management practices aimed at mitigating edge-of-field P loss and protecting water quality against eutrophication.

AB  - CrAssphage is a novel and by far the most abundant bacteriophage in the human gut and has been proposed as a human-specific microbial source tracking (MST) marker. However, its global use as a human-specific MST marker requires validation in more extensive regions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specificity and abundance of the human-specific MST marker crAssphage with PCR and RT-PCR assays in human and animal feces in Korea. The prevalence of crAssphage was confirmed in 94 human feces samples (subjects: 19 to 45 years old) and 56 animal feces samples (from birds, raccoons, squirrels, weasels, deer, wild boars, hares, cats, and dogs). CrAssphage showed sensitivity of 0.39 and specificity of 1.00 in Korea, with a sequencing analysis showing that genotype II was dominant at 71.9%. The quantitative analysis showed that crAssphage is sufficiently abundant in human feces given the high concentration range of 4.26 to 8.25 log gene copies (GC)/ng in human feces. In conclusion, this study confirmed the crAssphage as a specific and abundant MST marker with which to identify human fecal contamination in Korea.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Reindeer are an important wild and domesticated species of the Arctic, Northern Europe, Siberia and North America. As reindeer have developed various strategies to adapt to extreme environments, this makes them an interesting species for studies into diversity of immune and metabolic functions in the animal kingdom. Importantly, while reindeer carry natural infections caused by viruses (including coronaviruses), bacteria and parasites, they can also act as carriers for transmitting such diseases to other animals and humans, so called zoonosis. Reindeer are also affected by chronic wasting disease, a neuronal disease caused by prions, similar to scrapie in sheep, mad cows disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The current study assessed a specific protein modification called deimination/citrullination, which can change how proteins function and allow them to take on different roles in health and disease processes. Profiling of deiminated proteins in reindeer showed that many important pathways for immune defenses, prion diseases and metabolism are enriched in deiminated proteins, both in plasma, as well as in plasma extracellular vesicles. This study provides a platform for the development of novel biomarkers to assess wild life health status and factors relating to zoonotic disease.
   The reindeer (caribou) Rangifer tarandus is a Cervidae in the order Artiodactyla. Reindeer are sedentary and migratory populations with circumpolar distribution in the Arctic, Northern Europe, Siberia and North America. Reindeer are an important wild and domesticated species, and have developed various adaptive strategies to extreme environments. Importantly, deer have also been identified to be putative zoonotic carriers, including for parasites, prions and coronavirus. Therefore, novel insights into immune-related markers are of considerable interest. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a phylogenetically conserved enzyme family which causes post-translational protein deimination by converting arginine into citrulline in target proteins. This affects protein function in health and disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in cellular communication, in physiological and pathological processes, via transfer of cargo material, and their release is partly regulated by PADs. This study assessed deiminated protein and EV profile signatures in plasma from sixteen healthy wild female reindeer, collected in Iceland during screening for parasites and chronic wasting disease. Reindeer plasma EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed distribution from 30 to 400 nm and were positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers. Deiminated proteins were isolated from whole plasma and plasma EVs, identified by proteomic analysis and protein interaction networks assessed by KEGG and GO analysis. This revealed a large number of deimination-enriched pathways for immunity and metabolism, with some differences between whole plasma and EVs. While shared KEGG pathways for whole plasma and plasma EVs included complement and coagulation pathways, KEGG pathways specific for EVs were for protein digestion and absorption, platelet activation, amoebiasis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ECM receptor interaction, the relaxin signaling pathway and the estrogen signaling pathway. KEGG pathways specific for whole plasma were pertussis, ferroptosis, SLE, thyroid hormone synthesis, phagosome, Staphylococcus aureus infection, vitamin digestion and absorption, and prion disease.
   Further differences were also found between molecular function and biological processes GO pathways when comparing functional STRING networks for deiminated proteins in EVs, compared with deiminated proteins in whole plasma. This study highlights deiminated proteins and EVs as candidate biomarkers for reindeer health and may provide information on regulation of immune pathways in physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative (prion) disease and zoonosis.

AB  - BackgroundPlant-beneficial fungi play an important role in enhancing plant health and resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. Although extensive research has focused on their role in eliciting plant defences against pathogens, their contribution to induced resistance against herbivorous insects and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we used insect bioassays and untargeted metabolomics to investigate the impact of root inoculation of sweet pepper with the plant-beneficial fungus Trichoderma harzianum T22 on direct defence responses against the insect herbivore Nezara viridula.ResultsWe observed reduced relative growth rate of N. viridula on leaves of fungus-inoculated plants, with no change in mortality. Untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed that inoculation with T. harzianum did not affect the leaf metabolome in the absence of herbivory five weeks after inoculation. However, compared to non-inoculated plants, inoculated plants exhibited significant metabolic alterations in herbivore-damaged leaves following N. viridula feeding, while changes in the metabolic profile of distant leaves were less pronounced. Notably, metabolites involved in the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway, known to be involved in plant defence responses, displayed higher accumulation in damaged leaves of inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated plants.ConclusionOur results indicate that root inoculation with T. harzianum T22 affects plant defences against N. viridula, leading to reduced insect performance. Metabolite-level effects were primarily observed in damaged leaves, suggesting that the priming effect mainly results in localized metabolite accumulation at the site of attack. Future research should focus on identifying the detected compounds and determining their role in impairing N. viridula performance.

AB  - Yawning may serve as a cue that an individual is undergoing a downregulation of arousal and vigilance. Accordingly, the group vigilance theory posits that witnessing someone yawn should enhance the vigilance of the observer as a means of compensating for the reduced arousal and vigilance experienced by the yawner. This theory has gained empirical support from two recent studies, whereby exposure to yawning stimuli enhanced the detection of recurrent survival threats (e.g., snakes and lions) but did not alter the detection of comparable, nonthreatening stimuli (e.g., frogs and impala). The current study extends upon this line of research by examining how seeing other people yawn affects the detection of spiders and cockroaches. In a repeated-measures design, 30 participants completed a series of visual search tasks with spiders and cockroaches both following exposure to yawning and control videos. As expected, spiders were detected faster and elicited a greater number of fixations when presented as distractors. Moreover, following the observation of yawning videos, participants were faster at detecting both spiders and cockroaches and were less likely to fixate on distractor stimuli. These findings provide further evidence that seeing others yawn enhances the detection of fearful animals.

AB  - The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi was assessed in 117 triatomine insects from central Texas. The qPCR-based results revealed T. cruzi in 59% of the insects (62 adults and eight nymphs), with overall prevalences of T. cruzi of 0% (0/9), 64% (11/17), 58% (10/17), 73% (30/41), and 57% (19/33) for the Bastrop, Caldwell, Gonzales, Guadalupe, and Hays counties, respectively. Analyses of 18S rRNA fragments confirmed T. cuzi in 81% of these samples. Vectors were identified as Triatoma gerstaeckeri (35% of which 65% were positive for T. cruzi), T. sanguisuga (21%, 43% positive), and Paratriatoma leticularia (0.3%, 100% positive). Food sources were recovered from 29% of the insects. Raccoons were 53% of the blood meals (83% positive for T. cruzi), while the remainder came from a variety of sources, including humans (33% positive), house geckos, Eastern woodrats, plain-bellied water snakes (50% positive), hispid cotton rats (0% positive), chickens (100% positive); Asian forest turtles, bison, and pigs (0% positive). The serendipitous detection of blood meal sources at known minimum distances from the collection of the vector insect enabled us to provide several instances where the insect foraging distance was greater than 400 m. These vector foraging distances are novel information that can assist in our understanding of the landscape dynamics for the spread of the pathogen.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. However, how miRNAs and their targets regulate natural rubber metabolism remains unclear in the rubber-producing dandelions, which are being developed as alternative commercial sources of natural rubber. Here, we combined small RNA sequencing, degradome sequencing, target gene prediction, and mRNA sequencing to identify miRNAs and their targets in two dandelion species, the high rubber-yielding Taraxacum kok-saghyz (Tk) and the low rubber-yielding T. spadiceum (Ts). A total of 142 miRNAs, including 108 known and 34 novel ones, were discovered, with 53 identified as differentially expressed (DE) between the latex of Tk and Ts. Degradome sequencing identified 145 targets corresponding to 74 miRNAs. TAPIR and psRNATarget, respectively, predicted 165 and 164 non-redundant targets for the 53 aforementioned DE miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated the DE miRNAs and their targets might affect natural rubber production via regulating macromolecular biosynthesis and metabolism in latex. Four critical types of regulatory modules, including miR172-AP2/ERF, miR164-NAC, miR160-ARF, and miRN19-protein kinase, were identified and their interaction networks were constructed, indicating a potential involvement in natural rubber production. The findings and the large miRNA dataset presented here are beneficial to further deciphering the roles of miRNAs in the biosynthesis of natural rubber and medicinal metabolites in dandelion.

AB  - Phthalates are a group of neurotoxicants with cognitive-disrupting potentials. Given the structural diversity of phthalates, the corresponding neurotoxicity is dramatically altered. To identify the potential contributions of different phthalates on the process of cognitive impairment, data of 836 elders from the NHANES 2011-2014 cycles were used. Survey-weighted logistic regression and principal component analysis-weighted quantile sum regression (PCA-WQSR) models were applied to estimate the independent and combined associations of 11 urinary phthalate metabolites with cognitive deficit (assessed by 4 tests: Immediate Recall (IR), Delayed Recall (DR), Animal Fluency (AF), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)) and to identify the potential phthalate with high weight. Laboratory mice were further used to examine the effect of phthalates on cognitive function and to explore the potential mechanisms. In logistic regression models, MBzP was the only metabolite positively correlated with four tests, with ORs of 2.53 (quartile 3 (Q3)), 2.26 (Q3), 2.89 (Q4) and 2.45 (Q2), 2.82 (Q4) for IR, DR, AF, and DSST respectively. In PCA-WQSR co-exposure models, low-molecular-weight (LMW) phthalates were the only PC positively linked to DSST deficit (OR: 1.93), which was further validated in WQSR analysis (WQS OR7-phthalates: 1.56 and WQS OR8-phthalates: 1.55); consistent with the results of logistic regression, MBzP was the dominant phthalate. In mice, butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), the parent phthalate of MBzP, dose-dependently reduced cognitive function and disrupted hippocampal neurons. Additionally, the hippocampal transcriptome analysis identified 431 differential expression genes, among which most were involved in inhibiting the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and activating the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Our study indicates the critical role of BBP in the association of phthalates and cognitive deficits among elderly individuals, which might be speculated that BBP could disrupt hippocampal neurons, activate neuroinflammation, and inhibit neuroactive receptors. Our findings provide new insight into the cognitive-disrupting potential of BBP.

AB  - In recent decades there has been a sustained and substantial shift in human diets across the globe towards including more livestock-derived foods. Continuing debates scrutinize how these dietary shifts affect human health, the natural environment, and livelihoods. However, amidst these debates there remain unanswered questions about how demand for livestock-derived foods may evolve over the upcoming decades for a range of scenarios for key drivers of change including human population, income, and consumer preferences. Future trends in human population and income in our scenarios were sourced from three of the shared socioeconomic pathways. We used scenario-based modeling to show that average protein demand for red meat (beef, sheep, goats, and pork), poultry, dairy milk, and eggs across the globe would increase by 14% per person and 38% in total between the year 2020 and the year 2050 if trends in income and population continue along a mid-range trajectory. The fastest per person rates of increase were 49% in South Asia and 55% in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that per person demand for red meat in high-income countries would decline by 2.8% if income elasticities of demand (a partial proxy for consumer preferences, based on the responsiveness of demand to income changes) in high-income countries decline by 100% by 2050 under a mid-range trajectory for per person income growth, compared to their current trajectory. Prices are an important driver of demand, and our results demonstrate that the result of a decline in red meat demand in high-income countries is strongly related to rising red meat prices, as projected by our scenario-based modeling. If the decline in the income elasticity of demand occurred in all countries rather than only in high-income countries, then per person red meat demand in high-income countries would actually increase in 2050 by 8.9% because the income elasticity-driven decline in global demand reduces prices, and the effect of lower prices outweighs the effect of a decline in the income elasticity of demand. Our results demonstrate the importance of interactions between income, prices, and the income elasticity of demand in projecting future demand for livestock-derived foods. We complement the existing literature on food systems and global change by providing quantitative evidence about the possible space for the future demand of livestock-derived foods, which has important implications for human health and the natural environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Nutrient waste management poses significant challenges associated with environmental concerns and feed expenses for the pig industry. Additionally, including high levels of crude protein in pig diets has been linked to postweaning diarrhea and protein fermentation in the large intestine compared to diets with a lower protein content, which can impair gut health. This study was conducted to assess the impact of low-protein diets on weaning to finishing pigs related to growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and meat quality. Our findings indicate that when supplemented with appropriate amino acids, low-protein diets do not negatively affect growth performance or nutrient digestibility in weaning to finishing pigs. Furthermore, the quality was superior in pigs fed low-protein diets as opposed to those fed high-protein diets. Consequently, employing low-crude-protein diets in weaning to finishing pigs is recommended. This study aimed to evaluate optimal crude protein (CP) levels based on the National Research Council guidelines from 1998 and 2012 and their impacts on growth performance, fecal score, blood profiles, nutrient digestibility, and carcass characteristics of weaning to finishing pigs. Four diets were established in this experiment: high-protein (HP), medium-high-protein (MHP), medium-low-protein (MLP), and low-protein (LP). The HP diet followed the NRC (1998) guidelines, while the MHP diet reduced the CP content by 1%. The MLP diet had 1.5% lower CP content than the HP diet. The LP diet followed the NRC guideline of 2012, which suggests less protein than the NRC guideline of 1998. There were no significant differences in body weight, average daily feed intake, or nutrient digestibility. However, the average daily gain (ADG) of pigs fed the LP diet at 7-10 weeks was lower than in the other treatments, whereas the ADG of the pigs fed the LP diet was higher compared with that of pigs fed the other diets, showing compensatory growth in finishing periods (p < 0.05). The blood urea nitrogen of pigs fed the LP diet showed the lowest value, whereas the highest value was found in pigs fed the HP diet, and the other two diets were similar to the HP diet or positioned between the HP and LP diets (p < 0.05). Water holding capacity, cooking loss, shear force, and pH in the longissimus muscle were not influenced by varying dietary CP levels (p > 0.05), but the hunter values L and b were increased in pigs fed the LP diet (p < 0.05). Conclusively, a low-protein diet did not negatively affect growth performance, nutrient digestibility, or meat quality.

AB  - The advantageous characteristics of invasive pests, particularly their ability to reproduce and adapt to the environment, have been observed. However, it remains unclear what specific inherent superiority enables fruit pests to successfully invade and dominate in interactions with other species. In this study, we report that Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus), a notorious invasive pest of pome fruits and walnuts globally, employs unique reproductive strategies in response to quercetin, a plant compound in host fruits. By monitoring adult dynamics and fruit infestation rates, we observed a competitive relationship between C. pomonella and the native species Grapholita molesta (Busck). C. pomonella was able to occupy vacant niches to ensure its population growth. We also found that quercetin had different effects on the reproductive capacity and population growth of C. pomonella and G. molesta. While quercetin stimulated the fecundity and population growth of G. molesta, it inhibited C. pomonella. However, C. pomonella was able to rapidly increase its population after exposure to quercetin by adopting an 'accelerated burst' of oviposition strategy, with each individual making a greater reproductive contribution compared to the control. We further demonstrated that the effect of quercetin on oviposition is regulated by the juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathway in C. pomonella, allowing it to prioritize survival. The enhanced reproductive fitness of G. molesta in response to quercetin is attributed to the regulation of JH titers and key genes such as Met and Kr-h1, which in turn up-regulate reproduction-related genes Vg and VgR. In contrast, C. pomonella is inhibited. These findings shed light on the mechanisms interspecific competition and help to improve our understanding of the global spread of C. pomonella, which can be attributed to its inherent supe- riority in terms of reproductive strategy.

AB  - The silver content in soils in the area in the surroundings of the Gallocanta Lake (Aragon, NE Spain) is lower than expected considering the estimated silver emission during the last 50 years by hail suppression systems. To understand the silver accumulation processes, selected water (4 surface, 3 groundwater), biota and sediment (6 surface sediments and 3 cores from Gallocanta and Campillo de Duenas Lakes and Used Reservoir) samples have been analysed. An essay comparing the growth of wheat in pots with different silver iodide concentrations has been carried out. Finally, silver content in 7 tissues from two sheep that graze in areas both with and without hail suppression systems during 6-8 years were analysed.
   Our results show that after 50 years of silver iodide emissions to the atmosphere, silver accumulation in the waters and sediments of the lowlands, including some wetlands of high ecological value, has not been significant. Sediment cores did not show any peaks associated to silver emission.
   We propose that constant absorption of silver by plants could explain the low concentration in water and sediments. Crops and grass could accumulate the excess silver, as both wheat and sheep are able to absorb significant amounts of silver. These bio -accumulation processes could have helped to avoid a progressive environmental deterioration of the surroundings of the Gallocanta Lake. However, this hypothesis should be corroborated and quantified by further research on the analysis of natural and agricultural areas under the influence of hail suppression systems.

AB  - Twist1 promote the bypass of p53 response by interacting with p53 and facilitating its MDM2-mediated degradation. We reasoned that reagents able to interfere with the p53:Twist1 complex might alleviate Twist1 inhibitory effect over p53, thus representing potential therapeutic tools in p53 wild type tumors. From a preimmune library of llama nanobodies (VHH), we isolated binders targeting the p53 C-terminal region (p53CTD) involved in the interaction with Twist1 by using recombinant Twist1 as an epitope-specific competitor during elution. Positive hits were validated by proving their capacity to immunoprecipitate p53 and to inhibit Twist1:p53 binding in vitro. Molecular modeling confirmed a preferential docking of positive hits with p53-CTD. D11 VHH activity was validated in human cell models, succeeded in immunoprecipitating endogenous p53 and, similarly to Twist1 knock-down, interfered with p53 turnover, p53 phosphorylation at Serine 392 and affected cell viability. Despite the limited functional effect determined by D11 expression in target cells, our results provide the proof of principle that nanobodies ectopically expressed within a cell, have the capacity to target the assembly of the pro-tumorigenic Twist1:p53 complex. These results disclose novel tools for dissecting p53 biology and lay down the grounds for the development of innovative targeted therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Bardoka and Karakachan sheep are primitive regional transboundary Pramenka-type sheep autochthonous to the Balkan Peninsula, whose populations have been reduced to a critically small size in Serbia. We genotyped 105 Bardoka animals (97 ewes and 8 rams from three flocks) and 97 Karakachan sheep (86 ewes and 11 rams from four flocks), along with 28 Ile-de-France (IDF) animals used for a comparison (25 ewes and 3 rams), using 14 nuclear microsatellites to assess their genetic status and establish a foundation for their genetically informed conservation. We utilized genetic data to assess inbreeding values of individuals (I) and pairwise relatedness (r) traditionally inferred from the pedigree data, which are incomplete in the studied autochthonous breeds. We used these data to assemble a data set of unrelated individuals for subsequent genetic analyses. Low but statistically significant genetic differentiation of Bardoka and Karakachan sheep (FST = 0.031, p < 0.01) demonstrates that these phenotypically distinct breeds differ at the genetic level as well. The I and r in ewes were higher in the Karakachan sheep (I = 0.09, r = 0.07) than in Bardoka (I = 0.06, r = 0.06). Contrary to the IDF rams, Bardoka and Karakachan sheep rams were genetically heterogeneous and those of the latter breed displayed higher average r values (0.01 vs. 0.08, respectively). Rams of both local breeds had identical I values of 0.02. Although Bardoka and Karakachan sheep still harbor rather high levels of genetic diversity (HE = 0.761 +/- 0.028 and 0.761 +/- 0.021, respectively), the overall genetic data demonstrate that the genetic consequences of the population decline were more severe in the latter breed. A genetic structure presenting a general trend of differentiation of flocks with low genetic exchange into separate genetic entities was observed, indicating the effects of genetic drift. The implementation of the genetically informed conservation, together with the ongoing efforts of the state to enlarge the Bardoka and Karakachan sheep populations, would increase the prospects for the long-term survival of both breeds in Serbia.

AB  - Primary production environment is considered as reservoir of Escherichia coli contamination of produce. E. coli is classified into eight phylogroups which differ in ecological niches, evolutionary history, and phenotypic properties. To understand the population genetic structure and composition of E. coli in primary production environments in Metro Manila, Philippines, a total of 80 E. coli recovered from irrigation water, soil, vegetables, and feces of cat, carabao, chicken, dog, and goat were allocated into distinct phylogroups based on the presence and absence of genetic markers. Results showed that the most prevalent phylogroup was B1 (71.3%), followed by A (18.6%), D (6.3%), B2 (1.3%), E (1.3%), and an unknown phylogroup (1.3%). The most prevalent genetic marker was arpA, followed by TspE4.C2, yjaA, and chuA. The carbapenem resistance of 24 E. coli isolates representing different phylogroups was also evaluated. Intriguingly, all isolates exhibited uniform susceptibility. This is the first report to provide insights into the phylogroup structure and composition, as well as carbapenem resistance of E. coli from primary production in the Philippines, which highlights possible source of and solution for gastrointestinal and enteric diseases.

AB  - Risk assessment relies on cost-benefit analysis by prey species in relation to predator behavior. The lunar cycle can have strong influences on the way that predator and prey species behave in their environment as light levels can influence activity patterns. By examining how lunar phase influences behavior, we may be able to better predict instances of human-wildlife conflict. As part of the Elephants and Sustainable Agriculture in Kenya project, over 5 years of study have been dedicated to mitigating human-elephant conflict in the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor in southern Kenya, focusing on the construction of deterrent fences and the collection of environmental data in and bordering the Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary. Elephant presence around crop fields was hypothesized to have a negative relationship with lunar light levels because of an increase in perceived risk from typically greater human activity with moonlight, and a positive relationship with increased darkness during the waning moon phases. The lunar phase data were compared to elephant presence within 12 m of experimental crop fields along the boundary of their wild habitat and human agricultural land to provide insight for potential crop raiding events. Elephants were present significantly less during the full and gibbous moon phases when compared to the new moon phase, and significantly more during the new and waning moon phases. Our findings are being shared with the farmers living in the KWC and may be useful to others living in high HEC areas by providing a form of early warning system that also may have broader applications in the mitigation of other human-wildlife interactions.
   HIGHLIGHTSDynamic landscape of fear provides novel insight on elephant behavior near agricultural lands with applications for conservation strategies.

Distribution of Rhinomias forticornis is analyzed using known occurrences, original ecological data, correlative species distribution modeling with aspect on Last Glacial Maximum environment are given. To achieve a more realistic and precise spatial pattern, selected climatic variables are combined with remote sensing vegetation indices (LAI and NDVI). Presumable geographic limits of realized niche are Rhine River and Elbe River on the northwest, Dniester River on the northeast. The southeastern barrier in the Carpathians is possibly Tisza River. Since the natural climatic barrier in Asia Minor, it is definitely absent in the Caucasus despite the existence of suitable bioclimatic conditions. This is the first confirmation of Rh. forticornis in Ukraine.

AB  - Bisphenols (BPs) can negatively affect neurobehaviors in rats, whereas the mechanism remains unclear. Here, the mechanism of BPs-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity and its effective detoxification measures were investigated in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro experiments, primary hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats of different genders were treated with bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol B (BPB) at 1 nM-100 mu M, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and G15, an antagonist of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) for 7 d. Results indicated that BPs affected neuronal morphogenesis, impaired GABA synthesis and Glu/GABA homeostasis. Neuronal morphogenetic damage induced by low-doses BPA may be mediated by GPER. Neurotoxicity of BPS is weaker than BPA and BPB. In in vivo studies, exposure to BPA (0.5 mu g/kg center dot bw/day) on PND 10-40 caused oxidative stress and inflammation in rat hippocampus, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis and neurotransmitter homeostasis, ultimately impaired spatial memory of rats. Males are more sensitive to BPA exposure than females. Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that EGCG, a phytoestrogen, can alleviate BPA-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, low-doses BPA exposure sex-specifically disrupted neurodevelopment and further impaired learning and memory ability in rats, which may be mediated by GPER. Promisingly, EGCG effectively mitigated the BPA-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity.

AB  - Cannabis aphid Phorodon (Diphorodon) cannabis Passerini 1860 is an economically important pest of oil hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) and is controlled by insecticides. Oil hemp crops are treated with herbicides, which are non-target pesticides for aphids but may also affect aphid populations. Such ecological implications of plant protection products are rarely investigated. The aim of the present research was to better understand plant-aphid-herbicide interactions, specifically, changes of fatty acids (FAs) in leaves, caused by cannabis aphids and a common herbicide used in hemp fields. Of 21 FAs detected in hemp leaves, aphid feeding significantly increased the amounts of myristic and oleic acids and decreased the content of alpha-linolenic acid. This effect was found when aphids fed on hemp plants and especially when plants were treated with an herbicide containing quizalofop-P-tefuryl. This compound on its own did not affect the FA composition. In spite of the extremely high increase of myristic acid (7-to 9-fold, depending on the experiment variant), which could cause the repellent effect in hemp plants, the decreased amount of alpha-linolenic acid, the precursor of jasmonic acid may have helped aphids to manipulate the jasmonate signaling pathway involved in plant defense to herbivory enabling their continued feeding on hemp. This study revealed the importance of FAs in plant defense as well as the side effects of non-target plant protection products. Future pest management should take into account the complex interactions between crop plants, their pests and non-target effects of chemicals used in real field situations.

AB  - This study conducted transcriptome sequencing of goat-mammary-gland tissue at the late lactation (LL), dry period (DP), and late gestation (LG) stages to reveal the expression characteristics and molecular functions of circRNAs during mammary involution. A total of 11,756 circRNAs were identified in this study, of which 2528 circRNAs were expressed in all three stages. The number of exonic circRNAs was the largest, and the least identified circRNAs were antisense circRNAs. circRNA source gene analysis found that 9282 circRNAs were derived from 3889 genes, and 127 circRNAs' source genes were unknown. Gene Ontology (GO) terms, such as histone modification, regulation of GTPase activity, and establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, were significantly enriched (FDR < 0.05), which indicates the functional diversity of circRNAs' source genes. A total of 218 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified during the non-lactation period. The number of specifically expressed circRNAs was the highest in the DP and the lowest in LL stages. These indicated temporal specificity of circRNA expression in mammary gland tissues at different developmental stages. In addition, this study also constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks related to mammary development, immunity, substance metabolism, and apoptosis. These findings help understand the regulatory role of circRNAs in mammary cell involution and remodeling.

AB  - To study the early molecular immunity of Echinococcus granulosus infection in livestock, especially in sheep, the immunohistochemistry, in-situ hybridization was used to study the relationship and the distribution between miR-216b and IL2RB in the intestine tissue of kazakh sheep with resistant and non-resistant MHC haplotypes after oral infection with E. granulosus eggs. The results demonstrated that miR-216b negatively regulated IL2RB in the cystic echinococcosis intestinal tissues, and they were differentially expressed in the intestine tissue between the resistant sheep and non-resistant sheep, more widely distributed in the resistant group. These results illustrated that miR-216b and IL2RB activated stronger immune response in the resistant sheep, compared with the non-resistant sheep, and participating in the T cell immune response.

AB  - In phytopathogenic fungi, the Hog1 MAPK pathway plays roles in osmoregulation, oxidation responses, fungicide sensitivity, among others. However, how fungi depend on the HOG MAPK pathway to regulate their functions is poorly understood. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the HOG MAPK pathway, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was adopted to screen interacting proteins of two key components (CsPbs2 and CsHog1) of the HOG MAPK pathway in a cDNA library of Colletotrichum siamense. The results showed that 19 proteins may interact with CsPbs2, including cytochrome P450 4F5, ceramide very-long-chain fatty acid hydroxylase SCS7, the oxidative stress response two-component system protein SSK1, and other proteins. Twenty-one proteins may interact with CsHog1, including the cell wall protein PhiA, acriflavine sensitivity control protein acr-2, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, respiratory supercomplex factor 2-like protein, and others. Five proteins interact with both CsHog1 and CsPbs2: antigenic thaumatin-like protein, aspirochlorine biosynthesis protein N, secreted beta-glucosidase sun 1, alcohol dehydrogenase 1, and hypothetical protein GQ607_005106. Furthermore, the interaction of CsSCS7 and CsCytP450 4F5 with CsPbs2 was verified by His pull-down. qPCR revealed significantly upregulated CsPbs2, CsHog1, CsSCS7 and CsCytP450 4F5 expression in Colletotrichum treated with 50 mu g/mL fludioxonil for 2 h. This research identified candidate CsHog1- and CsPbs2-interacting proteins via a Y2H system and confirmed the interactions of CsSCS7 and CsCytP450 4F5 with CsPbs2. The findings lay the foundation for further studies of HOG MAPK pathway function and regulatory mechanisms, especially regarding fungicide sensitivity.

AB  - Showers can be used in the outdoor run to improve thermal comfort and provide environmental enrichment for growing-finishing pigs. Showers may also reduce ammonia emissions by preventing excessive soiling in summer. Few studies have addressed water cooling measures for pigs in systems with concrete outdoor runs, and none have considered the operation of showers outdoors. We therefore investigated the effect of showers in the outdoor run on pigs' use of different pen areas, thermal comfort, and soiling of the pigs and the pen in multi-farm experiments in Austria and Switzerland. In a pilot experiment on three organic farms involving a total of 428 growing-finishing pigs in 15 groups with two to three assessment days each, we compared groups with access to showers to groups without showers. A subsequent larger trial (referred to as SHORT/LONG experiment) compared two different shower programmes (SHORT = 10-minutes; LONG = 30-minutes shower activation per hour), comprising a total of 472 pigs in 20 groups on three farms with six to seven assessment days each. The treatments SHORT and LONG were alternately applied with at least three replicates per farm. We assessed the pigs' behaviour (activity, lying posture), respiratory rate and cleanliness as well as soiling of the pens on a group level. The pilot experiment revealed increased activity (p = 0.03) and reduced lateral lying (p = 0.08) in pigs with access to showers compared to pigs without, which supports the potential of showers to improve thermal comfort. In the SHORT/LONG experiment, we found interactions between treatment and outdoor temperature: The proportion of pigs under the shower (p < 0.01), lateral lying in the shower area (p = 0.01) and respiratory rate (p < 0.01) increased more with rising temperatures in treatment LONG than in SHORT. In both treatments, high temperatures increased the use of the outdoor run (p = 0.02) and the shower area (p < 0.001) as well as the soiling of pigs (p < 0.01), while at the same time reducing activity in the shower area (p = 0.02). Interestingly, fewer pigs were present in the shower area during and at the end of shower activation compared to the time before (p < 0.001), indicating avoidance of the water spray. This casts doubt on whether showers, apart from reducing heat stress, provide appropriate means to allow all aspects of species-specific thermoregulation. Our results suggest complex interactions between outdoor temperature, shower duration, pig behaviour, and soiling (with potential impact on ammonia emission), which require further investigation especially in open-air settings.

AB  - Animal manure application to soils is considered to be one of the main cause of antibiotic and bacterial pathogen spread in the environment. Pig livestock, which is the source of one of the most used fertilizer for cultivated land, is also a hotspot for antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Besides harsh chemical and physical sanitization treatments for the abatement of antibiotics and bacterial load in livestock waste, more sustainable and environmentally friendly strategies need to be considered. In this context, the use of natural substances which are proved useful for pest and disease control is currently under exploration for their role in the reduction of bacterial pathogen population. Among these, plants and derived products from the Brassicaceae family, characterized by the presence of a defensive glucosinolate-myrosinase enzymatic system, have been successfully exploited for years in agriculture using the so-called biofumigation technique against crop diseases. Although the application of biofumigation to suppress a range of soil borne pests has been well documented, no studies have been examined to reduce bacterial population in animal waste. In the present study, the release and the antibacterial activity of bioactive compounds deriving from different Brassicaceae defatted seed meals against pathogens and bacterial population in pig manure is addressed. Rapistrum rugosum and Brassica nigra defatted seed meals were found to be the most active products against tested pathogens and able to significantly reduce the bacterial load in the manure.

AB  - Conventionalization of organic farming calls into question its sustainability. No consensus has been reached on the criteria allowing evaluation of this conventionalization. We propose a methodology based on autonomy - a major sustainability attribute from an agroecological perspective. It was applied to Mediterranean beef cattle and pig livestock systems in Spain and led to the differentiation of five models based on their degree of closeness to conventional systems. Semi-intensive white pig systems were the most conventional compared to the extensive dehesa pastureland systems. In most cases, conventionalization derived from the farms' socioeconomic and institutional context. It is essential to adapt and change public policies in order to improve livestock farm sustainability and to prevent the most vulnerable farmers from disappearing: they are the ones who generate the most valuable ecosystem services. The proposed methodology, based on environmental and socioeconomic indicators, is applicable to assess the conventionalization of other organic systems beyond the Mediterranean.

AB  - Environmental factors affect daily milk production in dairy animals. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of environmental factors, specifically mean temperature (degrees C), relative humidity (%), temperature-humidity index (THI), solar radiation (degrees), pluvial precipitation (mm) and lunar calendar (full moon, waxing quarter, waning quarter, new moon), on milk production (kg/d). The analysis was based on 96,195 morning and evening milking records documented on 109 consecutive days, from 869 Lacaune ewes. Ewes were housed in groups of 174 individuals. The analysis was performed in two independent procedures, a Pearson correlation analysis and a multivariate analysis of the ewe's interrelationships, which was based on the total variance estimate and a Varimax-rotated factorial analysis. Milk yield (kg/d) was significantly (p < 0.05) negatively correlated with mean temperature (-0.24), relative humidity (-0.16), THI (-0.24), and radiation (-0.18), which suggests that the higher these environmental factors, the lower the milk yield. Lunar calendar had a significant (p < 0.01) effect on milk production yield; specifically, yields were higher on the full moon and new moon (2.25 +/- 0.05 kg/day) than they were on the crescent or waning moon (2.17 +/- 0.05 kg/day). In conclusion, ewes that had been exposed to higher mean temperature, relative humidity, THI and solar radiation had the lowest milk yield, and milk yields are highest on full and new moons. The results of this work may be helpful in making predictions for milk production in Lacaune ewes in the Mediterranean region throughout the year.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to minimize protein requirements and nitrogen emissions in pig production, it is important to understand the physiology of protein breakdown in the pig's gastrointestinal tract and to find ways to improve the protein utilization efficiency of the animals. In this review, we summarize and discuss factors influencing protein degradation and thereby affecting the efficiency of the animals. We shed light on the individual pillars of protein breakdown, starting with the enzymatic breakdown of the fed protein, via the amino acid transporters absorbing in the intestine, to the proteolytic capacity of the microbial and animal-specific proteome. The available literature shows the specific activities and expression levels of proteolytic enzymes and AA transporters depending on the availability of free or bound AA in the feed. Improvements in nutrient digestibility result from changes in nutrient transporter and enzyme gene expression, as well as a change in microbial activity. We are of the opinion that in the future, also with the help of transcriptomics, more time should be invested in researching the physiology of protein degradation and the associated protein utilization efficiency using highly standardized animal trials. Pigs are among the most important farm animals for meat production worldwide. In order to meet the amino acid requirements of the animals, pigs rely on the regular intake of proteins and amino acids with their feed. Unfortunately, pigs excrete about two thirds of the used protein, and production of pork is currently associated with a high emission of nitrogen compounds resulting in negative impacts on the environment. Thus, improving protein efficiency in pigs is a central aim to decrease the usage of protein carriers in feed and to lower nitrogen emissions. This is necessary as the supply of plant protein sources is limited by the yield and the cultivable acreage for protein plants. Strategies to increase protein efficiency that go beyond the known feeding options have to be investigated considering the characteristics of the individual animals. This requires a deep understanding of the intestinal processes including enzymatic activities, capacities of amino acid transporters and the microbiome. This review provides an overview of these physiological factors and the respective analyses methods.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is a key woody oilseed tree. In recent years, China's Camellia oleifera industry has shifted from extensive to refined management, with an action plan launched to boost productivity and efficiency. This study utilized remote sensing technology to diagnose crop nutrient levels. Focusing on 240 Camellia oleifera trees from four varieties at the Dechang Cooperative in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, the study collected full-spectrum canopy reflectance data (350-2500 nm) across five growing stages: spring shoot, summer shoot, fruit expanding, fruit ripening, and full blooming. First-order derivative (FD) and second-order derivative (SD) transformations were used to preprocess the spectral data and analyze the relationships between leaf potassium concentration (LKC) and the raw spectra (R), FD, and SD. The VCPA-IRIV strategy was then applied to identify sensitive wavelengths and artificial neural network algorithms were used to construct LKC estimation models. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) In the spring shoot stage, LKC ranged from 1.93 to 8.06 g/kg, with an average of 3.70 g/kg; in the summer shoot stage, LKC ranged from 2.01 to 8.82 g/kg, with an average of 4.96 g/kg; in the fruit expanding stage, LKC ranged from 1.40 to 18.27 g/kg, with an average of 4.90 g/kg; in the fruit ripening stage, LKC ranged from 1.45 to 8.90 g/kg, with an average of 3.71 g/kg.; and in the full blooming stage, LKC ranged from 2.38 to 9.57 g/kg, with an average of 5.79 g/kg. Across the five growth stages, the LKC content of Camellia oleifera showed a pattern of initially increasing, then decreasing, and subsequently increasing again. (2) The optimal LKC model for the spring shoot stage was FD-[7,6,2], with Rc2 = 0.6559, RMSEC = 0.1906 in the calibration set, RT2 = 0.4531, RMSET = 0.2009 in the test set. The optimal LKC model for the summer shoot stage was FD-[6,5,4], with Rc2 = 0.7419, RMSEC = 0.2489 in the calibration set, and RT2 = 0.7536, RMSET = 0.2259 in the test set; the optimal LKC model for the fruit expanding stage was SD-[7,6,2], with Rc2 = 0.3036, RMSEC = 0.2113 in the calibration set, and RT2 = 0.3314, RMSET = 0.1800 in the test set; the optimal LKC model for the fruit ripening stage was FD-[10,3,2], with Rc2 = 0.4197, RMSEC = 0.2375 in the calibration set, and RT2 = 0.5649, RMSET = 0.1772 in the test set, and the optimal LKC model for the full blooming stage was SD-[10,3,2], with Rc2 = 0.7013, RMSEC = 0.2322 in the calibration set, and RT2 = 0.5621, RMSET = 0.2507 in the test set.

AB  - To enhance pollinator loyalty, which is vital for plant reproduction, flowers have evolved rewards like nectar or excess pollen. Besides nutrients, nectars contain a plethora of secondary metabolites (SMs). Although the primary function of SMs is to protect plants from herbivores, growing evidence suggests that some of them may have adaptive functions in plant-pollinator interactions. GABA, which is prevalent in the nectar of many plants, interferes with learning and memory in restrained bees. Crucially, it is yet to be tested whether GABA affects pollinator foraging behaviour. The study aims to test whether free-flying bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) show a preference for artificial flowers dispensing GABA and whether GABA impacts bees' learning of visual floral cues and promotes flower fidelity. We used three concentrations of GABA throughout the experiments, including two within the natural range and a third above it, to investigate any dosedependent effects on foraging activity in flight arenas. The results showed that GABA did not affect bumble bee foraging preference at any concentration tested. Bees successfully learned to visit rewarding flowers regardless of the concentration of GABA, and no concentration affected the speed of learning. After learning, they tended to stay loyal to these flowers even when they became unrewarding. However, bumble bees that experienced GABA at the natural doses, but not at the unnatural high dose, remained faithful significantly longer to unrewarding flowers. The study provides insights into the use of SMs by plants to influence pollinator behaviour, with potential applications in agriculture.

AB  - The new species Caloplaca tswaluensis is described from Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Caloplaca tswaluensis occurs on the trunks of Vachellia erioloba (camelthorn) trees and is characterized by its 3-septate to quadrilocular ascospores. Molecular data indicate that the new species is placed in the subfamily Teloschistoideae but cannot be assigned to any existing genus and, because its systematic position is unclear, we choose to describe it in Caloplaca s. lat. Caloplaca tswaluensis is compared with other crustose Teloschistaceae species with plurilocular ascospores.

AB  - Strong multi-host adaptability significantly contributes to the rapid dissemination of Hyphantria cunea. The present study explores the involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) in the multi-host adaptation of H. cunea and aims to develop RNA pesticides targeting essential P450 genes to disrupt this adaptability. The results showed that inhibiting P450 activity notably reduced larval weight and food-intake across seven plants groups. The P450 gene HcCYP6AE178 was highly upregulated in H. cunea larvae from medium- and lowpreference host plant groups. Silencing HcCYP6AE178 significantly decreased H. cunea larval body weight, increased larval mortality, inhibited energy metabolism genes expression and interfered with growth regulatory genes expression. Overexpression of HcCYP6AE178 enhanced the tolerance of Drosophila and Sf9 cells to the plant defensive substances cytisine and coumarin. The RNA pesticide CS-dsHcCYP6AE178 constructed using chitosan (CS) exhibited remarkable stability. Treatment with CS-dsHcCYP6AE178 effectively reduced H. cunea larval body weight, heightened larval mortality, and disrupted growth regulatory genes expression in lowpreference host plant groups. Combined treatment of CS-dsHcCYP6AE178 and coumarin significantly elevated H. cunea larval mortality compared to coumarin alone, accompanied by the inhibition of growth regulatory genes expression and an abnormal increase in energy metabolism genes expression. Taken together, HcCYP6AE178 is essential for the adaptation of H. cunea to multiple host plants, and RNA pesticides targeting HcCYP6AE178 can effectively impair the performance of H. cunea in different host plants.

AB  - The open field test (OFT) is a commonly used protocol to measure anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. Exploration in the central area of the open field and rearing frequency are often readouts of anxiety measurement. However, concerns about carry-over effects associated with repeated assessments limit its application, with the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon still to be fully described. Here, we showed that repeated OFTs in the same mice led to reductions in the percentage of time spent in the central area and frequency of rearing. This effect reduced with an increase in the intervals between test. The decay caused by repeated OFTs was due to habituation, rather than frequent handling of the experimenter, since novel environments could prevent decay from repeated OFTs. Our results also indicated that tactile cues of the environment played important roles in the habituation of repeated OFTs. Furthermore, the decay of central area activity and rearing behavior during repeated OFTs would be blocked if the hippocampal CA1 was lesioned, suggesting that CA1 is a crucial region for habituation of the OFT in mice. Taken together, our study uncovers the important roles of tactile cues and hippocampal CA1 during repeated OFTs in mice.

AB  - Wildlife serves as a significant reservoir for various pathogens transmissible to domestic animals and humans. Vector-borne diseases represent an increasing concern in Europe, affecting both animal and human health. This pilot study investigated the circulation of endemic and emerging vector-borne viruses in wild ungulates in Hungary, utilizing a One Health approach. Serum samples were obtained from European fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) during routine national game management activities between 2020 and 2023. Samples were analyzed for antibodies against the Bluetongue virus (BTV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) using ELISA and neutralization tests. The results revealed a WNV seroprevalence of 22.3% in fallow deer and 31.8% in red deer, while BTV seroprevalence was 2.5% in fallow deer. All samples were negative for EHDV antibodies. These findings confirm the circulation of WNV and BTV in Hungarian wild ungulates. While the study's design precludes statistical analysis due to non-random sampling, it demonstrates the potential of integrating wild ungulate serosurveillance into disease monitoring programs, leveraging established wildlife management activities for a cost-effective and complementary approach to One Health surveillance, particularly considering the ongoing spread of EHDV in Europe and the importance of BTV serotype monitoring for effective vaccination strategies.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a kind of DNA virus and can infect both domestic pigs and wild boars with fatality up to 100%. The contaminated meat products mainly led to the worldwide transmission of ASFV. The outbreak of ASF greatly affects the supply stability of meat products as well as the development of the global pig industry. In this study, a visual isothermal amplification detection assay for ASFV based on trimeric G-quadruplex cis-cleavage activity of Cas12a was developed. The introduction of Cas12a could discriminate the specific amplification from the non-specific amplification and improve the sensitivity. The detection limit was as low as 0.23 copies/& mu;L. This assay had good potential in the detection of ASFV and would be helpful for the stability of meat production and supply.

AB  - An animal's movement is influenced by a plethora of internal and external factors, leading to individual- and habitat-specific movement characteristics. This plasticity is thought to allow individuals to exploit diverse environments efficiently. We tested whether the movement characteristics of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias differ across ontogeny and among habitats along the coast of Central California. In doing so, we elucidate how changes in internal state (physiological changes coinciding with body size) and external environments (differing seascapes and/or diel phases) shape the movement of this globally distributed predator. Twenty-one white sharks, from small juveniles to large adults, were equipped with motion-sensitive biologging tags at four contrasting seascapes: two islands, a headland, and an inshore cove. From multisensor biologging data, 20 metrics characterizing movement (i.e., depth use, vertical velocities, activity, turning rates, and bursting events) were derived and subjected to multivariate analyses. Movement characteristics were most different across seascapes, followed by ontogeny and diel phase. Juvenile sharks, which were only encountered at the cove, displayed the most distinct movement characteristics. Sharks at this seascape remained close to the shore traveling over smaller areas, shallower depth ranges, and with lower levels of tail beat frequencies, when corrected for size, than sub-adult and adult sharks tagged elsewhere. Distinct tortuous daytime versus linear nighttime horizontal movements were recorded from sharks at island seascapes but not from those at the headland or inshore cove. At the offshore islands, the linear nighttime swimming patterns coincided with repeated dives to and from deeper water. The availability of prey and access to deeper water are likely drivers of the differences in movement characteristics described, with varying demographics of pinniped prey found at the subadult and adult aggregation areas and juvenile sharks being piscivorous and their habitat neither adjacent to pinniped haul out areas nor deeper water. This study demonstrates plasticity in the movements of a top predator, which adapts its routine to suit the habitat it forages within.

AB  - Gelsemium elegans Benth. (GEB) is a traditional medicinal plant in China, and acts as a growth promoter in pigs and goats. Koumine (KM) is the most abundant alkaloid in GEB and produces analgesic, anti-cancer, and immunomodulatory effects. KM can be used as an aquatic immune stimulant, but its growth-promoting effects and transcriptional mechanisms have not been investigated. Diets containing KM at 0, 0.2, 2, and 20 mg/kg were fed to Cyprinus carpio for 71 days to investigate its effects on growth performance, intestinal morphology, microflora, biochemical indicators, and transcriptional mechanisms. Cyprinus carpio fed with KM as the growth promoter, and the number of intestinal crypts and intestinal microbial populations were influenced by KM concentration. KM increased the abundance of colonies of Afipia, Phyllobacterium, Mesorhizobium, and Labrys, which were associated with compound decomposition and proliferation, and decreased the abundance of colonies of pathogenic bacteria Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum. A total of 376 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) among the four experimental groups were enriched for transforming growth factor-beta 1 and small mother against decapentaplegic (TGF-beta 1/Smad), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and janus kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat) signaling pathways. In particular, tgfbr1, acvr1l, rreb-1, stat5b, smad4, cbp, and c-fos were up-regulated and positively correlated with KM dose. KM had a growth-promoting effect that was related to cell proliferation driven by the TGF-beta 1/Smad, MAPK, and Jak/Stat signaling pathways. KM at 0.2 mg/kg optimized the growth performance of C. carpio, while higher concentrations of KM (2 and 20 mg/kg) may induce apoptosis without significantly damaging the fish intestinal structure. Therefore, KM at low concentration has great potential for development as an aquatic growth promotion additive.

AB  - Reducing food waste and reusing it as animal feed are often regarded promising solutions to enhance sustain -ability. Hitherto, food waste policy assessments rarely account for interdependencies between reduction and reuse interventions, and how their market-including trade-feedbacks influence sustainability outcomes. Here, we apply a global agricultural economic model to assess the impact of food system feedbacks on sustainability when EU consumer food waste is reduced or reused as pig feed. Our results show that food waste interventions easily result in sustainability tradeoffs. Halving food waste generates larger EU emission savings than its valorization as pig feed. EU savings remain below those expected when not considering market feedbacks, but additional emission savings are projected to arise abroad as consequence of shifting trade flows. When food waste is halved, decreasing food prices improve food access for consumers but reduce farmers' income. The use of food waste as pig feed is only economically competitive if this novel feed is comparably cheap but then it stimulates pig production and imports of protein feed with potentially unsustainable consequences. Food waste reduction limits the amount of food waste biomass available for valorization. This could create unintended competition for food waste biomass. Thus, clear food waste reduction and valorization targets are needed, potentially focusing valorization on inedible waste parts only. Policy-makers need to consider such interdependencies when designing food waste interventions.

AB  - Pinus sylvestris trees are known to efficiently defend themselves against eggs of the herbivorous sawfly Diprion pini. Their direct defense against eggs is primable by prior exposure to the sex pheromones of this species and their indirect defense involves attraction of egg parasitoids by egg-induced pine needle odor. But it is unknown whether exposure of pine to D. pini sex pheromones also affects pine indirect defense against sawfly eggs. In this study, we investigated the influence of exposure of P. sylvestris trees to the sex pheromones of D. pini on indirect defense mediated by egg parasitoids. Behavioral assays with Closterocerus ruforum, a key parasitoid of sawfly eggs, revealed no significant attraction to odor from egg-free pines pre-exposed to pheromones. Chemical analyses of odor from egg-free pines showed no pheromone-induced change in the emission rates of the known key terpenoids promoting parasitoid attraction. Further comparative analyses of odor from egg-laden pines pre-exposed to the sex pheromones and of odor from egg-laden pines unexposed to pheromones neither revealed significant differences in the emission rates of terpenoids relevant for parasitoid attraction. The results suggest that a pheromone-induced or pheromone-primed, egg-induced pine indirect defense seems to be redundant in addition to the known pheromone-primable pine direct defense against the eggs and the known egg-inducible indirect defense.

AB  - Premise of research. Inbreeding depression is well known to contribute to the maintenance of outcrossing in flowering plants because of its direct negative impacts on germination, survival, and fertility. Yet inbreeding depression could also impact fitness indirectly by affecting traits that govern biotic interactions. Relatively little is known about inbreeding depression on traits related to pollination success. Although often associated with pollinator attraction or reward, pollination success is also determined by floral longevity. Inbreeding depression in floral longevity has not been studied but has the potential to compound pollination disadvantages confronting inbred plants.Methodology. We investigated inbreeding depression for traits related to pollination success in the mixed-mating biennial Sabatia angularis L. (Pursh) (Gentianaceae). Under controlled, pollinator-free conditions, we performed crosses to create families of selfed and outcross seed and raised these plants to flower. We compared selfed and outcrossed individuals for the following traits: flower number, flower size, corolla longevity, stigma longevity, and plant height. We also considered whether inbreeding depression was influenced by flower number-longevity trade-offs or plant size.Pivotal results. Selfed plants produced significantly smaller flowers that lived for a significantly shorter amount of time than flowers of outcrossed plants, based on corolla and stigma longevity. Consistent with prior work, we found trade-offs between floral longevity and flower number and positive relationships between longevity and plant height. However, we did not detect inbreeding depression for flower number or plant size.Conclusions. We find novel evidence that inbreeding reduces both floral longevity and flower size. Although moderate, inbreeding depression for these traits could leave selfed plants at a disadvantage in pollen-limited environments, especially where rates of pollen export outpace deposition such that plants are forced to rely on pollinators for seed production. Our work contributes to our understanding of how inbreeding depression can alter plant-pollinator interaction outcomes and raises questions about its influence on reproductive allocation.

AB  - Competition can cause the loss of certain species and concurrent dominance of other species, especially with invasive species. Here we explore the mechanisms behind competition between an invasive grass species, smooth brome Bromus inermis, and two dominant native grass species, big bluestem Andropogon gerardi and little bluestem Schizachyrium scoparium. Bromus inermis is now found in all contiguous states in the United States and may outcompete native species in North America, particularly when grazed. Grazing was simulated by cutting the plants once per year and three times per year, done monthly in the summer (plus an uncut control treatment). We grew all three species in the greenhouse as monocultures, as well as in a mix of B. inermis + A. gerardi and B. inermis + S. scoparium. We found that there was considerable yield suppression when smooth brome competed with both big- and little bluestem mixes with B. inermis after three cuts. Non-structural carbohydrates and total nitrogen declined considerably aboveground for the B. inermis + A. gerardi mix after three cuts. The clearest overall impact was that of cutting frequency, with plants receiving three cuts per season having lowest biomass. We conclude that the maintenance of biomass in B. inermis, despite the level of simulated herbivory, was probably the reason that they remained competitively dominant over the two native bluestem species.

AB  - Shrubs tended to increase their abundance as climatic aridity and grazing intensity increased in the Inner Mongolian grassland. Increasing shrub abundance was believed to be due to enhanced reproduction. However, the effects of climatic aridity and grazing on the sexual reproduction of shrubs in grassland remain largely unclear. In this study, we conducted field experiments with Caragana microphylla to examine the variation of sexual reproduction aspects (seed production, seed vigor, and sapling establishment) along a climatic aridity gradient (subhumid, semiarid, arid, and dry arid zones) and a grazing intensity gradient (fenced, mildly grazed, and severely grazed). We then quantified the population growth rate based on seed production and sapling establishment rates. Our objective was to evaluate whether sexual reproduction is the main mechanism for Caragana encroachment into grasslands. We found that climatic aridity decreased seed quantity and seed vigor but increased the sapling establishment rate of Caragana shrubs. Under ungrazed conditions, climatic aridity did not affect population growth rates, while under grazing conditions, increased aridity stresses reduced population growth rates. Grazing reduced seed production, sapling establishment, and population growth rates. Climatic aridity enhanced the negative effects of grazing on sexual reproduction, while grazing intensified the negative effects of aridity on the population growth of Caragana shrubs. In conclusion, climatic aridity, grazing, and their combined effects had negative effects on the sexual reproduction of Caragana shrubs. Therefore, sexual reproduction could not fully explain the increased abundance of shrubs with increasing aridity and grazing. Clonal reproduction might be of considerable importance for understanding the mechanism of shrub encroachment in grasslands.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of varying proportions of yak meat in feed on the growth of rats and provide a theoretical basis for selecting the optimal feed proportion suitable for rats. This study was designed as a one-variable experiment. Fifty male rats were divided into five groups. The ratios of yak meat to basal feed of rats in four dietary treatment groups were 2:8, 4:6, 6:4, and 8:2, respectively, while those in the control group were only provided a basal diet. In the feeding experiment, the body weights of the rats were recorded on Day 0 and subsequently in the first, second, third, and fourth weeks, along with quantities of feed intake. The body and tail lengths, as well as the waist circumference of the rats, were measured, and blood samples were collected in the fourth week for routine blood and biochemistry investigations. The rats in the 4:6 feed group had the best body condition. They had normal body and tail lengths, smaller waist circumferences, good posture, and were in better overall health than rats in the other groups. The results indicate that the 4:6 diet was optimal for enhancing rats' growth performance compared to the other diets.

AB  - In recent years, archaeology involved itself in solving one of the main challenges affecting our knowledge of the Visigoth period: the lack of finds. This has led to the study of a number of different types of finds, including faunal remains that, until very recently, had been overlooked. In this paper we present an archaeozoological study focusing on animal taxa identification, anatomical categorisation and the kill-off patterns of faunal remains from seven sites in the Tarraconensis region (north-east of the Iberian Peninsula) dating from the Late Roman period to the Early Middle Ages. It allows us to provide the first evidence of changes and continuities in herding practices in this area. The results indicate that ovicaprines, especially sheep, were the basis of animal husbandry, mainly for their meat, but also for their milk and wool. We also document the disappearance of the Roman period producer-consumer centre binomial pattern. We propose that this was due to the fact that both rural settlements and urban centres would have attempted to guarantee a diverse supply of animal products to be self-sufficient, and to generate some surpluses in order to pay taxes and/or to trade.

AB  - Enhanced soil nutrient availability often favours herbivore performance by bringing the carbon:nutrient ratio of plants closer to herbivore requirements. However, a surplus of nutrients can promote a too low carbon:nutrient ratio in plants, making them of poor quality for herbivores. In addition, increased soil nutrients can trigger cascading effects altering higher trophic levels, resulting in indirect costs for herbivores. Through experiments under three increasing fertilization levels (unfertilized, NPK-rich, and 2NPK-rich soils), we studied how the enhancement of soil nutrient availability, by modifying the C:N ratio of thistles, affects the performance and homeostatic response of the aphids, and the consequent ant attraction. Fertilized soils increased the biomass and reduced the C:N ratio of thistles, also increasing aphid abundance. The stoichiometric homeostasis of aphids was modulated through changes in honeydew production and composition; fertilization treatments reduced by more than half the quantity of honeydew secreted and lead to 2.5-6.4 times higher honeydew N concentration compared with the unfertilized treatment. In addition, in the highest fertilization treatment, the aphids increased the content of uric acid (a waste toxic compound involved in amino acid deamination) excreted in their honeydew. Aphid-infested thistles had the highest number of aphid-tending ants when they grew on intermediate rich-substrates. Ants selected honeydew with a lower C:N ratio (compared to unfertilized plants), but fewer workers patrolled plants with the highest fertilization treatment likely due to increased uric acid in the honeydew. We showed that enhanced soil nutrients brought plant C:N ratio closer to aphid requirements, enhancing their performance and promoting ant attendance. But a disproportionate increase in fertilization did not further improve aphid performance while it decreases the attraction of protective ants, which would make aphid populations more vulnerable to attack by natural enemies, inducing an ecological cost. This study highlights the complex role of bottom-up cascading effects triggered by increases in soil nutrient availability and the importance of evaluating not only the physiological and population cost and benefits of it but also the ecological ones; especially when it alters mutualistic interactions.

AB  - Nutrient contents in the organs and soil of the young and mature Camellia oleifera C. Abel were determined to study the demand and supply of nutrients for trees and soil, respectively. The young and mature C. oleifera forests were selected in the south suburb of Changsha, China. Results showed that the nutrient contents in the different tree organs of the mature forest in florescence period were in the order of leaf > flower > root > trunk > branch, and in the young forest were leaf > flower > branch > root > stem. In mature and young C. oleifera forests, the highest demand of macroelements in tree organs was for N and the lowest was for P. For microelements, the highest was for Mn and the lowest was for Cd. The soil nutrient supply in the mature and young C. oleifera forests consisted mainly the available N and K, and the available P in the least. The most macroelements were the total P and Ca, while the least was Mg. The nutrient demand of microelements was the highest for Fe and the lowest for Cd. The nutrient requirement of tree organs in mature and young C. oleifera forests was: young (2094.13 +/- 656.79 mg/kg) > mature (1763.31 +/- 419.27 mg/kg), while the soil nutrient supply was mature (2612.81 +/- 756.68 mg/kg) > young (2312.99 +/- 659.85 mg/kg). The nutrient content in the organs of the mature and young C. oleifera forest was high in the fructescence period as compared during the florescence period, while the soil nutrient supply was high in the florescence period than in the fructescence. Results could provide a scientific basis for the nutrition diagnosis and nutrition management of C. oleifera and other plants.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda is a newly invasive pest in China, often sharing the same feeding niche with native S. exigua. To clarify the competitive displacement, colonization and potential threat to crops by S. frugiperda, the cannibalism and predation behavior, feeding preferences, development and reproduction of both species under laboratory conditions, as well as the population dynamics and damage to maize plants in the field, were studied. Results found that food scarcity intensified interspecific predation between S. frugiperda and S. exigua, but the survival rate of 4th instar S. frugiperda was not significantly influenced (> 93%; P > 0.05). Although S. frugiperda exhibited less aggressive behaviors, its cannibalism coefficient and attack intensity were significantly higher than those of S. exigua (P < 0.05). Moreover, S. frugiperda showed a higher feeding preference for mechanically lethal insects when the maize leaf supply was insufficient. Additionally, a combined diet of maize leaves and lethal insects significantly increased their pupal weight and fecundity (P < 0.05). Field trials showed that when S. frugiperda and S. exigua co-occurred, the population of S. frugiperda at mature stage was similar to that after the intraspecific treatment, and seriously damaged maize plants. These results suggested that interspecific predation by S. frugiperda on S. exigua not only conferred an obvious advantage, but may also promote its development and reproduction, and facilitated its colonization in the invaded area. Our results provide an understanding of the rapid colonization mechanisms of S. frugiperda and will assist development of integrated management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary: Rodents, as the most abundant group of mammals, offer a unique opportunity to study the relationship between diet and host gut microecology. In this study, we focused on two species of the genus Myospalax in the Eurasian steppes in China: M. psilurus and M. aspalax. These specialized herbivorous rodents have adapted to a subterranean lifestyle and exhibit distinct dietary choices. Our study aimed to investigate how their diet composition is related to their gut microbial communities and whether there are unique indicator species for their gut microecology. Using 16S amplicon technology and macro-barcoding technology, we analyzed the gut bacterial communities and diet composition of the two zokor species. We found that M. psilurus had a higher diversity of gut microbial bacterial communities compared to M. aspalax. The two species also possessed different gut bacterial indicator species, with unique relationships between their diet and gut microbes. Our results provide new insights into the adaptation of zokors to long-term subterranean life and shed light on their cellulose degradation abilities and ecological niches. As the most abundant group of mammals, rodents possess a very rich ecotype, which makes them ideal for studying the relationship between diet and host gut microecology. Zokors are specialized herbivorous rodents adapted to living underground. Unlike more generalized herbivorous rodents, they feed on the underground parts of grassland plants. There are two species of the genus Myospalax in the Eurasian steppes in China: one is Myospalax psilurus, which inhabits meadow grasslands and forest edge areas, and the other is M. aspalax, which inhabits typical grassland areas. How are the dietary choices of the two species adapted to long-term subterranean life, and what is the relationship of this diet with gut microbes? Are there unique indicator genera for their gut microbial communities? Relevant factors, such as the ability of both species to degrade cellulose, are not yet clear. In this study, we analyzed the gut bacterial communities and diet compositions of two species of zokors using 16S amplicon technology combined with macro-barcoding technology. We found that the diversity of gut microbial bacterial communities in M. psilurus was significantly higher than that in M. aspalax, and that the two species of zokors possessed different gut bacterial indicator genera. Differences in the feeding habits of the two species of zokors stem from food composition rather than diversity. Based on the results of Mantel analyses, the gut bacterial community of M. aspalax showed a significant positive correlation with the creeping-rooted type food, and there was a complementary relationship between the axis root-type-food- and the rhizome-type-food-dominated (containing bulb types and tuberous root types) food groups. Functional prediction based on KEGG found that M. psilurus possessed a stronger degradation ability in the same cellulose degradation pathway. Neutral modeling results show that the gut flora of the M. psilurus has a wider ecological niche compared to that of the M. aspalax. This provides a new perspective for understanding how rodents living underground in grassland areas respond to changes in food conditions.

AB  - An alfalfa grassland landscape was divided into 36 plots during 2014 season in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan city in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of P.R. China. In these three times repeated experiments, treatment of habitat fragmentation was divided into two grades: continuity (H = 0.0) and fragmentation (H = 1.0), and their habitat loss rate was divided into 6 grades: 90, 80, 70, 50, 20 and 0%. Considering habitat loss 0% of the plot as the reference, as a result of sweeping net and visual methods, results showed that the flight distance of the Harmonia axyridis was much higher than that of the Hippodamia variegata both in fragmentation and continuous habitats. In the alfalfa landscape, H. axyridis moved more by flying, while H. variegata moved more by crawling. There was a threshold effect that affected the movement behavior of lady beetles between 70 and 100% of the habitat loss. The population of the two species of lady beetles in the continuous habitat was higher than that in the habitat fragmentation and was more obvious in 70 and 50% plots of the habitat loss. The dispersal rate of the two species of lady beetles inside plots was higher than outside of the experimental plots, which reflected the low diffusivity of the ladybeetle. Habitat fragmentation affected the dispersal, migration and construction of two species of lady beetles on different spatial scales by disturbing the spread of natural enemies and searching for prey.

AB  - Urban agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to significantly improve urban food security and feed the underprivileged when promoted. In Ghana, urban agriculture has several characteristics that distinguish it from traditional farming practices. However, climate change poses a significant threat to urban agriculture, as changing weather patterns can lead to droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that damage crops and animals. This study explored the characteristics of urban food crops and livestock production in the Wa township, Ghana. Mixed methods of data collection and analysis were employed. A sample of 362 urban households was administered survey questionnaires supplemented with 12 key informant interviews. Descriptive and content analysis were carried out, with the results presented in tables, graphs, and narratives. The study found that amidst climatic stressors, urban agriculture is characterized by the production of animals such as chickens, sheep, and goats and crops like maize, yam, beans, cabbage, and pumpkin. Land is acquired through purchasing, though other farmers obtain land from relatives and friends. There is a very strong relationship between residential class and the type of urban farming (Cramer's V = 0.291 > 0.25) and a moderate relationship between residential class and land acquisition type (Cramer's V = 0.108 > 0.10). The study concludes that urban farming is characterized by mixed farming coupled with crop diversification, which has implications for climate change adaptation measures. To adapt urban agriculture to climatic stressors, the study recommends that the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) should streamline agricultural policy interventions in urban agriculture to promote agriculture intensification.

AB  - In this study, we applied a new technique for vegetatively transplanting kelp Eisenia bicyclis to restore macroalgal habitats. We aimed to assess the restoration success of the E. bicyclis bed by comparing the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of macrobenthic consumers and their isotopic niches in artificial and control (barren ground) habitats. Except for the deposit feeding group, no significant differences were observed in isotopic values of the other feeding groups (suspension feeders, herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores) between the two sites. In contrast, our results showed wider isotopic niche indices for all feeding groups at the transplantation site compared to those at the control site, suggesting increased trophic diversity in the artificial habitat. Overall, these results indicate that the macroalgal bed created using the new method can play an ecological role in restoring functional properties of food web structures via trophic support of degraded coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The pathophysiology of many mood disorders is closely related to abnormal stress response associated with the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and cortisol overproduction. The hippocampus, a key structure of the limbic system responsible for both cognitive and emotional spheres, is selectively vulnerable to excess of glucocorticoids (GCs) inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The antiGC therapy of psychiatric diseases, in particular depressive disorders, may be a useful additional treatment. Among other approaches, targeting glucocorticoid receptors, abounded in the hippocampus, is regarded as highly promising. However, though the preclinical data provide fairly firm evidence to the concept of antiGC therapy for stress-related diseases, clinical studies still are at the proof-of-concept stage. Noteworthy, chronic GC excess is associated not only with mood diseases, but also with cognitive decline, metabolic disorders, diabetes. Potentially, antiGC (HPA axis modifying) therapy may alleviate affective symptoms, cognitive disturbances, GC and insulin resistance and adverse side effects of conventional drugs through beneficial effects on the hippocampus mitigating its dysfunction and neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and impairment of neurogenesis. Since stress/GC-associated neuroinflammation-mediated pathology of the limbic system and, specifically, the hippocampus, is a general feature typical for many brain diseases, the concept of antiGC therapy may be extended, tested and validated in a wider spectrum of cerebral pathologies.

AB  - The stability of milk proteins is affected by changes in the pH value of milk, the heating temperature, and the addition of calcium compounds or chelating agents, which can cause alterations in calcium distribution. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of the use of calcium citrate to manufacture fresh acid rennet cheese from high-temperature-pasteurized goat's milk (90 degrees C, 15 s) from the spring and autumn season and the effect of the calcium dose used on the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of the cheese. Autumn milk was found to be a richer source of total solids, confirming the effect of the production season on milk quality. The applied doses of calcium did not cause the denaturation of goat milk proteins and allowed pasteurization to take place at 90 degrees C for 15 s. The addition of calcium citrate resulted in a significant increase in the pH value of milk and cheese compared to the control sample. Adding 15 and 20 mg of Ca 100 g(-1) to milk as citrate had the most beneficial effect on increasing protein retention in cheese in both seasons, showing a rise from 1.33% to 2.40%. The production season significantly influenced the cheese yield. The control goat cheese from the autumn season showed a 6.85% higher yield compared to the spring cheese. An increase in cheese yield was also observed as the calcium dose of milk increased. The content of micro- and microelements in cheese was affected by the production season. The addition of calcium citrate to milk resulted in a significant increase in the calcium content of cheese-from 120.83 to 147.45 mg 100 g(-1) in the spring season and from 130.66 to 151.21 mg 100 g(-1) in the autumn season. Increasing the dose of calcium increased the hardness of cheese samples by 1.37 N in the spring and 0.90 N in the autumn. The organoleptic evaluation showed that adding calcium to milk did not significantly affect the organoleptic characteristics of goat cheese.

AB  - Parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) is a significant disease that affects small ruminant production. PGE is controlled exclusively by chemical anthelmintics but restricted by anthelmintic resistance. Hence, dependence on anthelmintics needs to be reduced. This study aimed to investigate the anthelmintic resistance status of a Dorper sheep farm while determining the phenotypic markers of resistance to PGE. Sheep that met the criteria of the Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) were divided into a control and four treatment groups of 11 to 13 animals per group. Faecal and blood samples at pre- and post-treatments were subjected to faecal egg counts (FEC), faecal culture, packed cell volume (PCV) and peripheral eosinophil counts (PEC). The data were analysed by Spearman rank correlation and two-way ANOVA. FECRT showed resistance towards albendazole, levamisole, fenbendazole and ivermectin which was predominated by Haemonchus contortus. Significant negative correlations were observed between FEC and PCV in control (r=-0.88, p<0.01), fenbendazole (r=-0.58, p<0.01) and ivermectin (r=-0.69, p<0.01) groups. Significant positive correlations were detected between FEC and PEC in control (r=0.95, p<0.01) and levamisole (r=0.56, p<0.01) groups. This study shows multiple anthelmintic resistance with promising resistant characteristics against PGE among sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary A combined geothermal heat pump and solar system (GHPS) was installed at a pig house to check the effects on electricity consumption, greenhouse gas emission (GHE), internal farm temperature, the concentration of noxious gases and growth performance. The GHPS heating system reduced energy consumption and CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the GHPS system effectively maintained the optimum temperature for pig growth inside the pigsty. Additionally, the artificial intelligence (AI)-based model 'gene expression programming (GEP)' was used to predict electricity consumption. This experiment evaluated the performance of a combined geothermal heat pump and solar system (GHPS). A GHPS heating system was installed at a pig house and a comparative study was carried out between the environmentally friendly renewable energy source (GHPS) and the traditional heating method using fossil fuels. The impact of both heating systems on production performance, housing environment, noxious gas emission, and energy efficiency were evaluated along with the GHPS system performance parameters such as the coefficient of performance (COP), inlet and outlet water temperature and efficiency of solar collector. The average temperature inside the pig house was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the GHPS heating system. Similarly, the outflow temperature was increased significantly (p < 0.05) than the inflow temperature. The results of COP and efficiency of the solar system also indicated that the GHPS is an efficient heating system. The electricity consumption and carbon dioxide gas concentration were also reduced (p < 0.05) in the GHPS system. This study also predicts electricity consumption using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model. The results showed that the proposed model justifies all the acceptance criteria in terms of the correlation coefficient, root mean square value and mean absolute error. The results of our experiment show that the GHPS system can be installed at a pig house for sustainable swine production as a renewable energy source.

AB  - Embryonic lethal mutations are arguably the earliest and most severe manifestation of inbreeding depression, but their impact on wild populations is not well understood. Here, we combined genomic, fitness, and life-history data from 5,925 wild Soay sheep sampled over nearly three decades to explore the impact of embryonic lethal mutations and their evolutionary dynamics. We searched for haplotypes that in their homozygous state are unusually rare in the offspring of known carrier parents and found three putatively semi-lethal haplotypes with 27%-46% fewer homozygous offspring than expected. Two of these haplotypes are decreasing in frequency, and gene-dropping simulations through the pedigree suggest that this is partially due to purifying selection. In contrast, the frequency of the third semi-lethal haplotype remains relatively stable over time. We show that the haplotype could be maintained by balancing selection because it is also associated with increased postnatal survival and body weight and because its cumulative frequency change is lower than in most drift-only simulations. Our study highlights embryonic mutations as a largely neglected contributor to inbreeding depression and provides a rare example of how harmful genetic variation can be maintained through balancing selection in a wild mammal population.
   Every time DNA is copied, mistakes happen. Most often, these mistakes, called mutations, are deleterious to the organism carrying them. In the worst case, embryonic lethal mutations can prevent an individual from being born in the first place. However, natural selection tends to remove such strongly deleterious mutations from populations very quickly, because when their carriers die early, the mutations disappear too. Unfortunately, especially in small populations, deleterious mutations sometimes spread to higher frequencies. This is due to genetic drift and the fact that deleterious mutations are usually recessive, so their full detrimental effects are only expressed if an individual inherits two identical copies of the mutation from their parents, causing the mutation to be homozygous.In this study, we explored the impact of embryonic lethal mutations in a small, wild population of Bronze Age sheep on the Scottish St. Kilda archipelago. Overall, we detected three semi-lethal mutations, which caused mortality in some, but not all embryos. Two of these mutations have decreased in frequency in the population over the last 25 years, and simulations show that this is partly due to natural selection rather than mere chance. Against our expectations, however, the third mutation has persisted in the population without signs of decrease, and we went on to explore why this is. We found that the mutation is linked not only to embryonic lethality but also to increased survival and body weight in lambs. This demonstrates that the same part of the genome can be subject to opposing forces of selection, which balance each other out and therefore cause the mutation to persist in the population. Overall, our study shows that embryonic mutations can prevent substantial numbers of individuals from being born in wild populations and explores the complicated evolutionary dynamics of deleterious mutations.

AB  - Zoonotic nematodes of the genus Trichinella are foodborne parasites that have a global distribution in wild carnivores and omnivores, with spillover and spillback into domestic livestock and people, with concomitant trade and health consequences. Historically, most human cases were linked to domestic pigs infected with Trichinella spiralis, but under current high biosecurity swine production in many countries, wildlife have become a more important source of human trichinellosis. The aim of this review is to update the global distribution of Trichinella species and genotypes reported in wildlife, as well as reported human outbreaks from the consumption of wildlife. Using several online databases and by "snowballing" references, hundreds of reports of Trichinella spp. in wildlife published between January 1991 and December 2023 provide an important update to the host and geographic range for each of the recognized 13 species/genotypes, grouped by continent. Surveillance effort was highest in Europe and North America, while Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America have had limited surveillance, in some instances with human cases serving as sentinels of transmission in a region. Dozens of human outbreaks are described, with wild boars (Sus scrofa) being the most frequently implicated wildlife species in human outbreaks globally. Bears are an important source of infection in North America, for wildlife tourism, and importation of bear meat has also been implicated in multicountry outbreaks. The largest study limitation was the dearth of molecular identification of larvae in both wildlife surveillance studies and human outbreaks, particulary in under-studied regions. We highlight the need for enhanced molecular epidemiological approaches to outbreaks of this important foodborne parasite, and emphasize the need for a One Health approach to manage Trichinella spp. which transmit among terrestrial and marine wildlife (including migratory birds), pigs, horses, and people, often across large geographic scales and borders.

AB  - While reliable estimates of species abundance distribution are required for wildlife management and are greatly needed at broad spatial scales, such information is scarce. In this context, the usefulness of spatial modelling as a tool for predicting game species relative abundance and distribution from hunting yield data was studied. Hunting yield data is affected by several factors related to species management, hunting regulations, and hunting efficacy and some doubts have been raised about the use or reliability of this data for large-scale modelling. Some years ago, Acevedo et al. (2014) calibrated five spatially explicit models (one per bioregion) by using hunting yield data for wild boar Sus scrofa (from hunting seasons 2006 to 2009) for approximately 60% of mainland Spain. After internal validation, the models were extrapolated to produce predictions of species relative abundance for the whole mainland country. Here, we reviewed these previous models to evaluate their predictive performance on new data (from hunting seasons 2014 to 2018) in areas where the models had been calibrated (interpolation areas) and also when projected into new ones (extrapolation areas). Our results showed that the previous models were able to forecast current general patterns of wild boar relative abundance with population growth rates equivalent to those reported by other authors, although differences between bioregions were observed. Performance on interpolation areas was higher than that obtained on extrapolation areas. Accuracy of model predictions decreased when fine resolution assessment at hunting ground level was carried out. Our results suggest that spatial models calibrated on hunting yields could be a good option to predict general wild boar relative abundance distribution patterns, although critical assessment is needed, since models can fail when they are extrapolated to areas for which no information is available and at fine scale resolution. These results represent a step forward in the use of hunting yields for describing ranges of species relative abundance at large spatial scales.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The study of gene expression at the transcriptome level provides rich information on the genes and metabolic pathways influencing relevant phenotypic traits. This study deals with the comparison of muscle transcriptome between two autochthonous pig breeds from Serbia (Mangalitsa and Moravka) as well as between Mangalitsa pigs fed a tannin-supplemented diet vs. a control one. The results provide a wide characterization of genes, pathways and potential regulatory mechanisms affecting muscle traits which differ among the experimental groups. The generated information improves the scientific knowledge on the cellular and metabolic basis of muscle growth, oxidative stability and fatness in pigs, and provides abundant candidate genes which could be responsible for phenotypic variation, and could be useful in future studies and selection approaches.
   This work was aimed at evaluating loin transcriptome and metabolic pathway differences between the two main Serbian local pig breeds with divergent characteristics regarding muscle growth and fatness, as well as exploring nutrigenomic effects of tannin supplementation in Mangalitsa (MA) pigs. The study comprised 24 Mangalitsa and 10 Moravka (MO) males, which were kept under identical management conditions. Mangalitsa animals were divided in two nutritional groups (n = 12) receiving a standard (control) or tannin-supplemented diet (1.5%; MAT). Moravka pigs were fed the standard mixture. All animals were slaughtered at a similar age; 120 kg of average live weight (LW) and loin tissue was used for RNA-seq analysis. Results showed 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) according to breed, enriched in genes involved in growth, lipid metabolism, protein metabolism and muscle development, such as PDK4, FABP4, MYOD1 and STAT3, as well as a relevant number of genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory activity (MT-NDs, NDUFAs among others). Oxidative phosphorylation was the most significantly affected pathway, activated in Mangalitsa muscle, revealing the basis of a different muscle metabolism. Also, many other relevant pathways were affected by breed and involved in oxidative stress response, fat accumulation and development of skeletal muscle. Results also allowed the identification of potential regulators and causal networks such as those controlled by FLCN, PPARGC1A or PRKAB1 with relevant regulatory roles on DEGs involved in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism, or IL3 and TRAF2 potentially controlling DEGs involved in muscle development. The Tannin effect on transcriptome was small, with only 23 DEGs, but included interesting ones involved in lipid deposition such as PPARGC1B. The results indicate a significant effect of the breed on muscle tissue gene expression, affecting relevant biological pathways and allowing the identification of strong regulatory candidate genes to underlie the gene expression and phenotypic differences between the compared groups.

AB  - Biochar amendment is becoming a promising technology for mining soil restoration. The addition of biochar can improve soil microbiological parameters related to soil quality, such as enzyme activities. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the effect of rabbit manure (RM) and two rabbit manure biochars prepared at two pyrolysis temperatures (300 and 600 degrees C) on the biochemical properties of two mining soils in the Portman area (Spain) in the presence or absence of vegetation. Soils were amended with the RM, the two biochars and a mixture of the rabbit manure and biochars (50/50 w/w) at a rate of 10% in a mesocosms experiment to study the changes in dehydrogenase, phosphomonoesterase, beta-glucosidase activities, geometric mean of enzyme activities (GMea) and soil microbial biomass (SMB). Changes in individual enzyme activities were not always consistent. However, when using the GMea as a measure of soil quality, our results showed an increase in the GMea (217-360 times) after the addition of rabbit manure to mining soils, while this increase was from 81-270 times following the addition of rabbit manure with biochar prepared at 300 degrees C. Therefore, the use of biochar prepared at low temperatures could be a promising direction for the improvement of soil quality and soil carbon sequestration.

AB  - The comparative analysis of the chemical composition and biological activity of extracts and proanthocyanidins (PACs) isolated from harvesting and pruning agro-waste of fruit shrub-trees (Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Aronia melanocarpa) and forest cleaning waste of non-fruit trees and shrubs (Alnus incana L., Alnus glutinosa and Salix caprea) of Northern Europe was carried out. Aronia melanocarpa and Hippophae rhamnoides L. biomass had the highest proanthocyanidins content (up to 12%) on dry biomass. Fruit trees-derived purified PACs which contained structures with higher polymerization degree had slightly higher antioxidant activity. Both fruit and non -fruit trees PACs can be successfully used in antimicrobial preparations and as antioxidants, and could be interchangeable in the compositions of the antimicrobial preparations, especially against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Salix caprea, which contained wider range of gallocate-chin subunits, and Alnus spp., which contained diarylheptanoids, had shown better anti-microbial activity against B. cereus. Non-fruit trees PACs are desirable in the preparations against C. albicans. PACs from Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Aronia melanocarpa inhibited biofilm forma-tion to 50%, but the extract from Hippophae rhamnoides L. showed the most significant MRSA biofilm growth inhibition (onto 80%). Preparations on the basis of waste biomass-derived compounds will contribute to sustainable pharmacy since their application will allow to diminish the use of antibiotics and to have less toxic side effects both for humans and the environment.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of fermented banana agro-waste silage (BAWS) in finishing diets for KHAPS pigs (Duroc x MeiShan hybrid). BAWS was produced via 30 days of anaerobic fermentation of disqualified banana fruit, pseudostem, and wheat bran, doubling crude protein content and generating short-chain fatty acids, as indicated by a satisfactory Flieg's score. Thirty-six pigs were assigned to control (0%), 5%, or 10% BAWS diets formulated to meet NRC nutritional guidelines. Over a 70-day period, BAWS inclusion caused no detrimental effects on growth performance, carcass traits, or meat quality; a transient decline in early-stage weight gain and feed efficiency occurred in the 10% group, while BAWS-fed pigs demonstrated reduced backfat thickness and increased lean area. Fore gut microbiome analysis revealed reduced Lactobacillus and elevated Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Terrisporobacter, Streptococcus, and Prevotella, suggesting enhanced fiber and carbohydrate fermentation capacity. Predictive COG (clusters of orthologous groups)-based functional profiling showed increased abundance of proteins associated with carbohydrate transport (COG2814, COG0561, COG0765) and stress-response regulation (COG2207). These results support BAWS as a sustainable feed ingredient that maintains production performance and promotes fore gut microbial adaptation, with implications for microbiota-informed nutrition and stress resilience in swine.

AB  - SMAD family member 1 (SMAD1) is phosphorylated and activated by the BMP receptors, which help regulate ovulation rate, cell growth, apoptosis, and development. Previously, the genome-wide associ-ation study revealed that it has been associated with fecundity in sheep. However, its effect on litter size has not been investigated in goats. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the level of SMAD1 mRNA expression in various tissues and to identify its polymorphisms and their association with litter size in Shaanbei white cashmere goat (SBWC). As a result, RT-qPCR analysis showed that SMAD1 was expressed in various tissues in female SBWC goats, including the ovary (P < 0.05). Importantly, the mRNA expression level in the ovaries of mothers of multi-lambs had a higher level than the mothers of single lambs (P < 0.05). Moreover, two InDels (18-bp and 7-bp) in intron 1 of SMAD1 were polymorphic among ten potential loci. Both 18-bp and 7-bp InDels were significantly correlated with litter size (P 1/4 0.014) and (P 1/4 0.0001), respectively. As shown by the chi-squared test, genotypic distributions of 18-bp and 7-bp were significantly distinct between single-lamb (P 1/4 0.02) and multi-lamb mothers (P 1/4 0.002). Our findings confirm that two InDels in SMAD1 were significantly associated with litter size and suggest that they could be used to improve fertility traits in goat breeding strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND Depression is a common psychological disorder, and traditional therapeutic drugs often result in side effects such as emesis, dry mouth, headache, dysentery and constipation. Probiotics and goat milk have garnered widespread attention for their ability to modulate immune function and regulate the endocrine system, and for their anti-inflammatory effects. In this work, the effects of Tibetan goat kefir on the behavior, immune status, neuroendocrine response and gut microbiological composition of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse models were evaluated. RESULTS The results indicated that Tibetan kefir goat milk significantly alleviated behavioral despair in mice. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that Tibetan kefir goat milk mitigated the inflammatory response in the mice and moderated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Meanwhile, chronic stress-induced gut microbial abnormalities were restored. In addition, the correlation between gut microbiota and nervous system was evaluated. CONCLUSION These results explained the potential mechanism of Tibetan kefir in the antidepressant effect on the CUMS model and enriched diets for depressed patients.

AB  - The production of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), the world's second most consumed beverage, is susceptible to extreme weather events. However, our understanding about the impacts of extreme temperatures and climate change on tea yields remains fairly limited. Here we quantify the historical and predict future fluctuations in tea yield caused by extreme temperatures in China, the largest tea producing country. We found that both heat and cold extremes were associated with significantly reduced tea yields. In the present climate, dominating cold extremes influence more than half of China's tea production, with a maximum of 56.3% reduced annual production. In the near future, we predict positive net impacts of climate change on tea yield in all study regions at both the 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming levels. Climate warming may diminish the negative impacts of cold extremes to 14%, especially at the current most affected northern tea growing regions (>28 degrees N). However, new areas of yield reduction by intensified heat extremes will emerge, up to 14%-26% yield losses estimated at the Yangtze River (similar to 30 degrees N) and southern China (<similar to 25 degrees N) regions. Although the Paris Agreement targets limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C, we expect up to 11%-24% heat-induced yield loss in Chongqing, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang. Increasing heat extremes pose the most challenging changes for tea production in China. Therefore, addressing the regional difference of extreme temperature shifts is urgent for adapting tea production to climate change.

AB  - The growth and development of pigs is determined by their genotype and environmental conditions (primarily the level of feeding), however, the number of works aimed at studying the complex influence of genetic and non-genetic factors in their interaction is currently insufficient. The purpose of our work was to estimate the effect of the MC4R genotype, feeding level and interaction of these factors on growth and backfat thickness of crossbred pigs and to investigate the possibility of correct-ing the melanocortin-4-receptor gene polymorphism effect by adjusting the ration. Studies were conducted on 50 gilts ob-tained by crossing sows of the large white breed with landrace boars. Experimental pigs at the "Maxi 2010" farm were weighed at birth, then at the age of 28 days (at weaning) and at the age of 4, 6, 8 months. Fat thickness was measured at the age of 4, 6, 8 months. Genetic studies were conducted in a certified laboratory of Institute of Pig Breeding and Agroindustrial Production. Analysis of 50 blood samples revealed that this group ofpigs had a sufficient level ofpolymorphism for research (Polymorphism Information Content was equil 0.35). The frequency of genotype distribution at the MC4R / SNP c.1426 G>A locus was 0.06 (AA) : 0.58 (GA) : 0.36 (GG). The type of feeding significantly influenced the live weight at the age of 4 months and the average daily gains of experimental pigs over the period of 28-120 days. Starting at the age of 6 months a significant effect of the interaction oforganized factors (feeding + genotype) was recorded. At the age of 6 months, a signifi-cant influence of both the genotype and the level of feeding on the backfat thickness was established. Animals with the GG genotype receiving a restricted feed ration had significantly lowerbackfat thickness. At the age of 8 months, the difference in backfat thickness between the group with the GG genotype (restricted feed ration) and the AG genotype (high level feeding) reached a value of 12.9% (2.0 mm). Animals with the AG genotype had the lowest performance and the greatest fat thickness underfeed limitation, which is important for raising young pigs for subsequent reproduction. Therefore, when selecting pigs to be used for further reproduction, the desired genotype is GG. In the future, it will be desirable to repeat the study on a larger number of pigs, so that the experiment involves a sufficient number of animals with the MC4R AA genotype for statistical processing.

AB  - Seeds of Brassicaceae produce a large diversity of beneficial and antinutritional specialized metabolites (SMs) that influence their quality and provide resistance to stresses. While SM distribution has been described in leaves and root tissues, limited information is available about their spatiotemporal accumulation in seeds. Camelina sativa (camelina) is an oilseed Brassicaceae cultivated for human and animal nutrition and for industrial uses. While we previously explored SM diversity and plasticity, no information is available about SM distribution and expression of related proteins and genes in camelina seeds. In this study, we used a multi-omic approach, integrating untargeted metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics to investigate the synthesis, modification, and degradation of SMs accumulated in camelina seed tissues (seed coat, endosperm, embryo) at six developmental and two germination stages. Metabolomic results showed distinct patterns of SMs and their related pathways, highlighting significant contrasts in seed composition and spatial distribution for the defense-related and antinutritional glucosinolate (GSL) compounds among camelina, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Brassica napus, three closely related Brassicaceae species. Notably, thanks to metabolomic and proteomic/transcriptomic techniques the variation in GSL spatial distributions was primarily driven by differences in their structure (metabolomics data) and transport (transcriptomic and proteomic data) mechanisms. Long-chain C8-C11 methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs were predominantly accumulated in the seed coat and endosperm, while mid- and short-chain C3-C7 methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs were accumulated in the embryo. Characterizing the spatial dynamics of seed SMs provides valuable insights that can guide the development of crops with optimized distribution of beneficial and toxic metabolites, improving seed nutritional profiles.

AB  - Simple Summary: Cryopreservation protocol induces reactive oxygen species formation and leads to a decrease in post-thawed sperm quality and fertilizing capacity. We investigated the effect of resveratrol and its optimal concentration on the quality of post-thawed boar semen and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). Our investigations showed that the supplement of 50-100 mu M resveratrol enhanced the quality of the post-thawed semen and decreased the MDA level. However, the maximum concentration of resveratrol (250 mu M) tended to decrease sperm motility, sperm viability, intact acrosomes, and mitochondrial membrane potential. The protective or cytotoxic effect of resveratrol on the quality of frozen boar sperm depends on the concentration of resveratrol and extender composition as well as limiting antioxidant uptake capacity in sperm.
   This study aimed to determine the effect of resveratrol and its optimal concentration on the quality of frozen-thawed (FT) boar sperm. Semen ejaculates were obtained from 13 Duroc boars aged between 1.5 and 3 years. The sperm sample was separated into 7 groups based on the concentrations of resveratrol in the freezing extender, which were 0 (control), 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 250 mu M, respectively. The sperm was frozen using liquid nitrogen vapor and thawed at 50 degrees C for 12 s. After thawing, total motility, progressive motility, viability, intact acrosomes, mitochondrial membrane potential and level of MDA were assessed. The supplementation of 50-100 mu M resveratrol improved the sperm motility and viability of FT sperm in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the 50 mu M resveratrol group was significantly more protective than the control group in terms of intact acrosome, mitochondrial membrane potential, and level of MDA (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, the detrimental effect of resveratrol was found at a concentration of 250 mu M. In conclusion, the addition of 50-100 mu M resveratrol to a freezing extender is the optimal concentration for enhancing the quality of cryopreserved boar sperm.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have emerged as a promising technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation. However, enhancing the electrochemical performance of MFC anodes remains a critical challenge. This study investigated the modification of carbon cloth anodes with different concentrations of cobalt acetate (denoted as Co-Ac 3, Co-Ac 5, and Co-Ac 10) for improving MFC performance. The anodes were comprehensively characterized using XRD, SEM, and elemental mapping techniques. XRD analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of highly crystalline cubic cobalt nanoparticles on the carbon cloth substrate. The electrochemical evaluation demonstrated the superior performance of the Co-Ac 5 anode, achieving a maximum power density of 107.27 mW m-2 and a remarkable 179-fold increase compared to the unmodified carbon cloth anode. The Co-Ac 5 anode also exhibited the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 93.3%. SEM imaging revealed the formation of biofilms on the anode surface and provided insights into the size and distribution of cobalt nanoparticles. The optimal performance of the Co-Ac 5 anode was attributed to the presence of embedded cobalt nanoparticles within the carbon fibers, facilitating efficient extracellular electron transfer and promoting biofilm formation. This study highlights the importance of optimizing nanoparticle size and distribution on carbon cloth electrodes to balance catalytic activity, microbial interactions, and electrochemical performance in MFCs for wastewater treatment and energy recovery applications.

AB  - To understand the causes and implications of an extinction event, detailed information is necessary. However, this can be challenging when working with poorly resolved paleontological data sets. One approach to increase the data resolution is by combining different methods. In this study, we used both radiocarbon and genetic data to reconstruct the population history and extinction dynamics of the woolly mammoth in northern Siberia. We generated 88 new radiocarbon dates and combined these with previously published dates from 626 specimens to construct Bayesian age models. These models show that mammoths disappeared on the eastern Siberian mainland before the onset of the Younger Dryas (12.9e11.7 ky cal BP). Mammoths did however persist in the northernmost parts of central and western Siberia until the early Holocene. Further genetic results of 131 high quality mitogenomes, including 22 new mitogenomes generated in this study, support the hypothesis that mammoths from, or closely related to, a central and/or west-Siberian population recolonized Wrangel Island over the now submerged northern Siberian plains. As mammoths became trapped on the island due to rising sea levels, they lived another ca. 6000 years on Wrangel Island before eventually going extinct ca. 4000 years ago.

AB  - Environmental samples are often used to classify the paratuberculosis status of cattle herds. The disease is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), predominantly through oral ingestion during infancy. In this explorative study, the presence of MAP was determined in the barn environment of a paratuberculosis-infected vaccinated dairy goat herd. A total of 256 bedding, dust, feed, and water samples were collected at eight time points and examined using culture and qPCR. Detection rates of both methods were compared, and factors determining MAP confirmation were identified. MAP was cultured from 28 bedding and one dust sample, while MAP DNA was detected in all materials (117/256). Samples from high animal traffic areas and those collected during the indoor season were more likely to yield positive culture and qPCR results. Cultivation of MAP from kidding pens indicated this area as a possible infection site. Dust proved to be the most suitable material for detecting MAP DNA, as bedding was for MAP culture. Environmental sampling was demonstrated to be an effective way to detect MAP in a dairy goat herd. qPCR results could confirm herd infection, while culture results provided insight into crucial areas for MAP transmission. These findings should be considered when designing farm-specific paratuberculosis control plans.

AB  - Background Ocular setariasis is an ectopic infection caused by a parasite under the genus Setaria. Adult worms belong to the Setariidae family and typically reside in the peritoneal cavity of ungulates. However, immature forms of these species may aberrantly migrate to the eyes of cattle, buffalo, goats, horses and several other hosts, leading to corneal opacity and blindness. Here, we have distinguished the Setaria digitata collected from both equine and buffalo hosts based on the morphology, molecular profiling of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (Cox3) and, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NAD1) genes. Methods and results A single filarial worm was collected from the eye of one equine and one bovine host. These worms were then processed for morphological examination and DNA isolation. Cox1, Cox3 and NAD1 genes were amplified using specific primers and subjected to custom sequencing. The sequences were then used for multiple sequence alignment, assessment of entropy, similarity and haplotype diversity analysis. Key morphological features confirmed the worms collected were male and female Setaria digitata from equine and buffalo hosts, respectively. Cox1, Cox3 and NAD1 gene sequence analysis showed a close association of S.digitata Indian isolates with its counterparts from Sri Lanka and China isolates. Conclusion The phylogram of bovine S. digitata sequences shows a close relationship to other equine S. digitata sequences, indicating the need for further in-depth studies on the prevalence of infection across various host species and intermediate hosts. Although the sequence results suggest that S. digitata is likely the causative agent of ocular setariasis in India, additional samples are needed to confirm this conclusion. Comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of S. digitata from both bovine and equine hosts is necessary to explore variations in host-parasite interactions. These findings will aid in future parasite identification, investigations into vector prevalence in India, and the development of control measures against ocular setariasis.

AB  - The involvement of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) co-transmitters ATP and norepinephrine (NE) in the suppressive effect of deep cooling on antibody production in the spleen was studied in Wistar rats. Specifically, we analyzed the effects of deep cooling (rectal temperature decreased by 3-4 degrees), iontophoretic administration of NE (1 mg/mL) and its SNS co-transmitter ATP (0.01 mg/mL), as well as intraperitoneal administration of the purinergic P2X receptor blocker PPADS, on the number of antibody-producing cells in the rat spleen in response to immunization with sheep red blood cells (RBCs). While deep cooling and ATP suppressed antibody production in the spleen by 43.2% and 53.5%, respectively, NE stimulated it by 93%. Normally, PPADS-induced blockade of P2X receptors stimulated antibody production by 100.3%. Against the background of P2X receptor blockade, the suppressive effects of ATP and deep cooling on antibody production was not manifested. Our results indicate opposite effects of NE and ATP on antibody production in the spleen, suggesting that deep cooling exerts its suppressive effect with the involvement of ATP through P2X receptors.

AB  - The impact of domestic dog and coyote depredation on livestock has received little attention in Mexico. We used livestock depredation insurance claims from 2017 to 2020 and landscape attributes to identify the magnitude of depredation and model the risk of depredation by domestic dogs and coyotes throughout Mexico using maximum entropy modeling. Combined livestock depredations by coyotes and domestic dogs comprised 50.3% of all livestock depredation claims in Mexico. Depredation by domestic dogs was associated with landscape attributes indicative of rural villages and subsistence livestock husbandry. More intensive or larger-scale agricultural land uses (e.g., farming, large ranching enterprises) were associated with coyote depredation, in particular increasing presence of small- to medium-sized livestock (i.e., sheep, etc.). Both domestic dogs and coyotes posed a risk of depredation across much of Mexico (i.e., 23% and 40% of Mexico with > 0.50 likelihood of depredation, respectively), with risk likelihood maps for each canid being similar (i.e., similarity indices = 0.75-0.84) for most risk levels but showing little similarity with respect to regions of high (> 0.70) and very high (> 0.90) likelihood of depredation (similarity = 0.38 and 0.19, respectively). By identifying areas of high depredation risk, our models provide a planning tool to facilitate allocation of resources such as insurance programs, identify areas that would benefit from additional mitigation programs, and provide guidance for managing landscape attributes to decrease risk and limit vulnerability of livestock to predation.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate associations of blood variables and urine variables with different residual feed intakes (RFIs) in growing Chuanzang black (CB) pigs. A total of 228 growing CB boars from 99 days were used. The same basal diet was offered ad libitum and individual feed intake and body weight were measured over a period of 181 d. The CB pigs were categorized based on their residual feed intake values, with six individuals each from the high and low ends selected and divided into two groups: the low residual feed intake group (LS) and the high residual feed intake group (HS). Serum and urine samples were collected at the end of the experiment for determination of metabolomics profiling. Results showed that there were significantly different metabolites in serum and urine of different RFI groups (fold-change, FC > 2.0 or FC < 0.5, and p < 0.05), and 21 metabolites were identified in serum and 61 in urine. Cluster analysis showed that 20 metabolites were up-regulated and one metabolite was down-regulated in serum; 44 metabolites were up-regulated and 17 metabolites were down-regulated in urine. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the differential metabolites of serum were enriched in linoleic acid metabolism, and the differential metabolites of urine were enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. The correlations between serum metabolites and urine metabolites indicated a significant positive correlation between all fatty acyls in serum metabolites and L-glutamate in urine. However, no compelling genetic or blood biomarkers have been found to explain the differences in RFI, suggesting multiple approaches to effective feed use in pigs. This study provides new insights into the subsequent assessment of RFI by metabolomics profiling, as well as the development of novel feed additives for the factors that will facilitate future research directions in CB pigs.

AB  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria are vital in biogeochemical cycles and can significantly affect both environmental and industrial processes, including biocorrosion. This study investigates the sulfate-reducing potential of various heterotrophic facultative bacteria isolated from crude oil samples collected at various points in a petroleum refinery, after a crude oil pipeline pigging operation. The samples were analysed to identify the microbial communities and their metabolic capabilities. Bacterial strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter ludwigii, Enterobacter hormaechei, Citrobacter braakii, Citrobacter freundii and Pantoea hericii were isolated from the crude oil samples using selective enrichment. Their sulfate reducing potential was assessed by measuring sulfide production and growth under various environmental conditions. Significant variability in sulfate-reducing activity among the isolated strains, with some exhibiting notably high reduction rates. Molecular identification via 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to characterize the strains and elucidate their phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, corrosion capacity of the most promising bacterial strain among those identified, E. cloacae on API 5L X65 pipeline material was analysed using the potentiodynamic polarization method. Under abiotic conditions, the corrosion rate was measured at 0.09 mm per year, with a corrosion current density of 1.69 x 10-5 A cm- 2. However, in the presence of facultative bacterium E. cloacae, the corrosion rate increased significantly to 0.23 mm per year, accompanied by corresponding Icorr value of 3.29 x 10-5 A cm- 2. This study contributes to a better understanding of the ecological roles of facultative sulfate reducing bacteria in industrial environments, especially within crude oil processing.

AB  - Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a microbiome-dependent gut disease in preterm infants in early life. Antibiotic treatment is a common intervention for NEC. How NEC lesions, with or without antibiotics, affect plasma metabolome was explored in this study. Formula-fed preterm pigs were used as a model for human NEC and treated with saline, parenteral or oral antibiotics (n = 15-17) for four days after delivery. Gut tissues were collected for evaluation of NEC-like lesions and plasma for metabolomic analysis by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR). Metabolites were annotated, quantified and subjected to statistical modelling to delineate the effects of NEC and antibiotic treatment. Presence of severe NEC lesions, not antibiotic treatment, was the main drive for plasma metabolite changes. Relative to other pigs, pigs with severe NEC lesions had higher levels of alanine, histidine and myo-inositol, and lower levels of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and isobutyric acid. Across NEC lesion states (healthy, mild, severe), antibiotics directly affected only a few metabolites (tryptophan, 3-phenyllactic acid). Together and independently, NEC and antibiotic treatment affected circulating metabolites in preterm pigs. Amino acids and plasma metabolites, partly related to the gut microbiome, may be helpful to monitor progression of NEC lesions after proper validation.

AB  - The harsh conditions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pose significant physiological challenges to local fauna, often resulting in gastrointestinal disorders. However, Tibetan pigs have exhibited remarkable adaptability to the high-altitude stress of the Tibetan Plateau, a phenomenon that remains not fully understood in terms of their gastrointestinal microbiota. This study collected 57 gastrointestinal tract samples from Tibetan pigs (n = 6) and plain black pigs (n = 6) with comparable genetic backgrounds. Samples from the stomach, jejunum, cecum, colon, and rectum, underwent comprehensive metagenomic analysis to elucidate the gut microbiota-related adaptive mechanisms in Tibetan pigs to the extreme high-altitude environment. A predominance of Pseudomonadota was observed within gut microbiome of Tibetan pigs. Significant differences in the microbial composition were also identified across the tested gastrointestinal segments, with 18 genera and 141 species exhibiting differential abundance. Genera such as Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera, Fusobacterium, and Mitsuokella were significantly more abundant in Tibetan pigs than in their lowland counterparts, suggesting specialized adaptations. Network analysis found greater complexity and modularity in the microbiota of Tibetan pigs compared to black pigs, indicating enhanced ecological stability and adaptability. Functional analysis revealed that the Tibetan pig microbiota was particularly enriched with bacterial species involved in metabolic pathways for propionate and butyrate, key short-chain fatty acids that support energy provision under low-oxygen conditions. The enzymatic profiles of Tibetan pigs, characterized by elevated levels of 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase, highlighted a robust fatty acid metabolism and enhanced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In contrast, the gut microbiome of plain black pigs showed a reliance on the succinate pathway, with a reduced butyrate metabolism and lower metabolic flexibility. Taken together, these results demonstrate the crucial role of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to high-altitude environments by optimizing carbohydrate metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production for efficient energy utilization. This study not only highlights the metabolic benefits conferred by the gut microbiota of Tibetan pigs in extreme environments, but also advances our understanding of the adaptive gastrointestinal mechanisms in plateau-dwelling animals. These insights lay the foundation for exploring metabolic interventions to support health and performance in high-altitude conditions.

AB  - The goal of limiting mean global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C, described in the Paris Agreement, depends upon urgent action to stabilize radiative forcing (RF). However, the contribution of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) to future RF is often obscured by the application of climate metrics, such as the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100). RF climate footprints are an alternative way of presenting emissions information relating to GHGs and other climate forcers. These footprints include RF from current emissions as well as the fraction of historical emissions that remain in the atmosphere. The profile over time can support the management of RF toward targets informed by climate stabilization goals. In a study involving Australian sheep production for meat, it was found that the sector's contribution to RF has plateaued in recent years at 0.64 mW m(-2), and is projected to reach the point of net zero increase in 2020, a status that could be described as "climate neutral". Further, on present emission trajectories, the sector's contribution to RF will decline to 0.50 mW m(-2) in 2049, which represents a contribution to climate cooling consistent with the Paris Agreement. RF climate footprints clearly articulate the diverse climate impacts of short and long-lived climate forcers, avoiding the policy ambiguity that can arise when different climate metrics and different arbitrary time horizons are chosen. This new RF framework, soon to be supported by an international (ISO) standard, has relevance in aligning food systems with the aspirations of the Paris Agreement. However, the challenge of stabilizing and managing RF downward is applicable to all sectors and organisations. Crown Copyright

AB  - Simple Summary The transformation of milk into cheese is a complex process influenced by various factors, including the breed of the sheep providing the milk. Our study focused on understanding how different Spanish dairy sheep breeds affect the quality and properties of milk intended for cheesemaking. We examined milk samples from four different breeds, analyzing their composition and how they coagulate, a key step in cheese production. We found that while there are some common patterns in how milk from these breeds coagulates, certain breeds have unique characteristics. Our research highlights the importance of considering breed selection in coagulation, offering insights that could lead to better cheese production techniques.Abstract The transformation of milk into cheese largely depends on the technological properties of the raw material, with breed being a crucial factor that influences both the composition and coagulation properties of the milk used for cheesemaking. This study uses canonical correlation analysis to explore the relationships between physicochemical traits and coagulation properties in milk from various Spanish breeds, aiming to identify both common and breed-specific patterns that impact milk technological aptitude. A total of 832 milk samples from Manchega, Assaf, Merino de Grazalema, and Merino de Los Pedroches breeds were analyzed. The milk characteristics investigated included pH, composition (fat, protein, lactose, total solids), and coagulation properties (curd firmness-A60, rennet clotting time-RCT, curd firming time-k20, and individual laboratory curd yield-ILCY). The results reveal a shared correlation structure across breeds and unique covariation patterns in some breeds that deviate from the general trend. While Assaf and Merino de Los Pedroches follow the common correlation pattern, Manchega and Merino de Grazalema exhibit distinct patterns. This research underscores the need for in-depth study and suggests that the dairy industry could benefit from shifting from the traditional focus on maximizing fat and protein for higher curd yields to considering technological traits for selective breeding.

AB  - Growth of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the most important farmed crustacean, has consistently been a focal point for breeders. Over the past decades, some candidate genes for shrimp growth have been identified. However, further research is needed to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanism of these genes. LvMmd2 was previously identified as a candidate gene that may inhibit the growth of L. vannamei. In this study, we analyzed the genotype and expression of the LvMmd2 gene in a breeding family and indicated its role as a growth-inhibiting gene. We found that LvMmd2 co-localized with its homolog LvPAQR3 at the Golgi apparatus. Using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and DUAL membrane system yeast two-hybrid (MbY2H), we indicated the interactions between LvMmd2 and LvPAQR3, LvPAQR3 and LvRaf1, as well as LvMmd2 and LvRho. These results suggest that LvMmd2 directly and indirectly regulates the Ras signaling pathway. Furthermore, we show that the LvMmd2 gene may indirectly affect the PI3K/AKT, insulin, and Hippo signaling pathways to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation via LvPAQR3 and LvRaf1. Through transcriptome and MbY2H analyses, we have also revealed the interaction between LvMmd2 and proteins involved in growth, immunity, protein transport, synthesis, and modification. These findings demonstrate the various molecular pathways through which LvMmd2 regulates L. vannamei growth. This study provides insights into the mechanism of shrimp growth regulated by Mmd2, enhances our understanding of LvMmd2 function, and highlights its potential application in shrimp breeding.

AB  - Some degree of circadian rhythm disruption is hard to avoid in today's society. Along, with many other dele-terious effects, circadian rhythm disruption impairs memory. One way to study this is to expose rats to day -lengths that are outside the range of entrainment. As a result, circadian processes and behaviors occur during phases of the light dark cycle in which they typically would not. Even brief exposures to these day lengths can impair hippocampal dependent memory. In a recent report, we created an unentrainable light dark cycle that was intended to resemble aspects of social jetlag. As predictable mealtime impacts circadian entrainment, in that report, we also created an unpredictable meal schedule with the idea that failure to entrain to a meal might afford a disadvantage in some instances. Both of these manipulations impaired retention in a spatial water plus -maze task. Using the same manipulations, the present study investigated their effects on acquisition in distrib-uted and massed spatial water plus-maze paradigms. As in other reports with unentrainable daylengths, acquisition was not affected by our lighting manipulation. Conversely, in accordance with our past report, un-predictable mealtimes had a harmful effect on hippocampal dependent memory. Notably, impaired acquisition in the distributed version, and impaired retention in the massed version. In tandem, these data suggest that failure to consolidate or retrieve the information is the likely culprit. The unpredictable mealtime manipulation offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of circadian entrainment on memory.

AB  - The highly persecuted African houbara (Chlamydotis undulata undulata) is thought to persist in Tunisia's arid-lands. Recent reports have, however, failed to observe the species and concluded that it was on the verge of extinction. We deployed camera-traps in three of Tunisia's national parks (NPs) that were sites for large scale habitat restoration and mega-herbivore reintroductions. Sampling was for 20,382 camera days in Dghoumes NP, 14,377 in Jbil NP and 4,006 in Sidi Toui NP. We report one observation of the African houbara in Sidi Toui NP and highlight the benefits of mega-herbivore conservation for the wider biodiversity of the region.

AB  - This study addresses the challenge of mitigating ammonia and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from stored pig slurry using chemical and biological additives. The research employs dynamic chambers to evaluate the effectiveness of these additives. Chemical agents (sulfuric acid) and biological additives (DAB bacteria) containing specific microbial strains are tested (a mixture of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus licheniformis, Nitrosomona europea, Nictobacter winogradaskyi, and nutritional substrate). Controlled experiments simulate storage conditions and measure emissions of ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide. Through statistical analysis of the results, this study evaluates the additives' impact on emission reduction. Sulfuric acid demonstrated a reduction of 92% in CH4, 99% in CO2, and 99% in NH3 emissions. In contrast, the biological additives showed a lesser impact on CH4, with an 8% reduction, but more substantial reductions of 71% for CO2 and 77% for NH3.These results shed light on the feasibility of employing these additives to mitigate environmental impacts in pig slurry management and contribute to sustainable livestock practices by proposing strategies to reduce the ecological consequences of intensive animal farming.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA), one of the non-steroidal estrogen mycotoxin, can cause male reproductive damage and genotoxicity in mammals. Testicular oxidative injury is an important factor causing male sterility. Testicular Sertoli cells are essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. At present, the mechanism of oxidative injury in dairy goat Sertoli cells after exposure to ZEA remains unclear. This study explored the effects of ZEA on oxidative stress and autophagy in dairy goat Sertoli cells. It was found that treatment of primary Sertoli cells with 25, 50 and 100 mu mol/L ZEA for 24 h can promote ROS production, decrease cell viability, antioxidant enzyme activity and mitochondrial membrane potential, induce caspase-dependent cell apoptosis and autophagy activity. ZEA-induced autophagy was confirmed by LC3-I/LC3-II transformation. More importantly, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment can remarkably inhibit ZEA-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy in Sertoli cells by eliminating ROS. In conclusion, this study indicates that ZEA induces oxidative stress and autophagy in dairy goat Sertoli cells by promoting ROS production.

AB  - The International Workshop for Ex-Situ Marine Teleost Nutrition and Health, hosted by Disney's Animals, Science and Environment in conjunction with the Comparative Nutrition Society, brought together over 50 animal experts and scientists representing 20 institutions to review current science and identify challenges of marine teleost nutrition and health. Invited speakers presented critical information and current research topics for areas of emphasis and expertise. Subject matter experts identified knowledge gaps and primary areas of focus to guide the scientific community's research efforts to improve the care of ex situ marine teleosts. The clinical medicine working group highlighted standardized approaches to ante- and postmortem sample collection, diet biosecurity and supplementation, advanced diagnostic methods, and expanded training in fish nutrition. Nutrition identified the creation of a husbandry and feeding management manual, comprehensive feeding program review and design, and specialty feeder/life stage nutrition as areas of focus, while animal husbandry focused on body condition scoring, feed delivery techniques, and behavioral husbandry topics. The physiology and chemistry and water quality working groups discussed components of the aquatic environment and their effects on fish health, including organic matter constituents, microbial diversity, disinfection, and managing microbiota. Finally, we reviewed how epidemiological approaches and considerations can improve our evaluation of aquarium teleost nutrition and health. The goals outlined by each working group and supporting literature discussion are detailed in this communication and represent our goals for the next 3 to 5 years, with the ultimate objective of the workshop being the production of a husbandry manual for marine teleost nutrition and health. Any scientists who feel that their experience, research, or interests align with these goals are invited to participate by contacting the authors.

AB  - The mesopelagic zooplankton community plays an important role in the cycling and sequestration of carbon via the biological pump. However, little is known about the physiology and ecology of key taxa found within this region, hindering our understanding of their influence on the pathways of energy and organic matter cycling. We sampled the eight most abundant zooplankton (Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Paraeuchaeta spp., Chaetognatha, Euphausia triacantha, Thysanoessa spp., Themisto gaudichaudii and Salpa thompsoni) from within the mesopelagic zone in the Scotia Sea during a sinking diatom bloom and investigated their physiological ecology using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopic signatures of nitrogen. Data suggest that the large calanoid copepods, C. acutus and R. gigas, were in, or emerging from, a period of metabolic inactivity during the study period (November 15th - December 15th, 2017). Abundant, but decreasing lipid reserves in the predominantly herbivorous calanoid copepods, suggest these animals may have been metabolising previously stored lipids at the time of sampling, rather than deriving energy solely from the diatom bloom. This highlights the importance of understanding the timing of diapause of overwintering species as their feeding is likely to have an impact on the turnover of particulate organic matter (POM) in the upper mesopelagic. The delta 15N signatures of POM became enriched with increasing depth, whereas all species of zooplankton except T. gaudichaudii did not. This suggests that animals were feeding on fresher, surface-derived POM, rather than reworked particles at depth, likely influencing the quantity and quality of organic matter leaving the upper mesopelagic. Our study highlights the complexity of mesopelagic food webs and suggests that the application of broad trophic functional types may lead to an incorrect understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Y-27632, as a pyrimidine derivative, is commonly used for low-temperature preservation of cell cytoskeleton. However, the Y-27632 small molecule has not yet been used in research on low-temperature preservation of goat semen. This study aims to address the issue of low temperature-induced loss of sperm motility in goats by using Y-27632, and explore the regulation of Y-27632 on goat sperm metabolism. We evaluate the protective effect of Y-27632 on the quality of low temperature-preserved goat semen by detecting goat sperm motility, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial activity, cholesterol levels, and metabolomics analysis. This study indicates that Y-27632 improves the preservation quality of goat sperm by protecting the sperm plasma membrane, enhancing sperm antioxidant capacity, and increasing D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism levels. The protective effect of Y-27632 on semen has also been confirmed through artificial insemination. The results of this study provide some new insights into the application of Y-27632 in low-temperature preservation of goat semen, and promote the application of Y-27632 in low-temperature preservation of semen. Y-27632, as a cytoskeleton protector, is commonly used for low-temperature preservation of cells. Goat sperm are prone to damage to the cytoskeleton under low-temperature conditions, leading to a loss of sperm vitality. However, the Y-27632 small molecule has not yet been used in research on low-temperature preservation of goat semen. This study aims to address the issue of low temperature-induced loss of sperm motility in goats by using Y-27632, and explore the regulation of Y-27632 on goat sperm metabolism. At a low temperature of 4 degrees C, different concentrations of Y-27632 were added to the sperm diluent. The regulation of Y-27632 on the quality of low temperature-preserved goat semen was evaluated by detecting goat sperm motility, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial activity, cholesterol levels, and metabolomics analysis. The results indicated that 20 mu M Y-27632 significantly increased plasma membrane integrity (p < 0.05), and acrosome integrity (p < 0.05) and sperm motility (p < 0.05), increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (p < 0.01), increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p < 0.05), decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p < 0.01), and significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The levels of ATP, Ca2+, and TC in sperm increased (p < 0.01). Twenty metabolites with significant differences were identified, with six metabolic pathways having a significant impact, among which the D-glutamic acid and D-glutamine metabolic pathways had the most significant impact. The artificial insemination effect of goat semen treated with 20 mu M Y-27632 was not significantly different from that of fresh semen. This study indicates that Y-27632 improves the quality of low-temperature preservation of sperm by protecting the sperm plasma membrane, enhancing sperm antioxidant capacity, regulating D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, and promoting the application of low-temperature preservation of semen in artificial insemination technology.

AB  - Given the importance of males as semen donors for artificial insemination (AI) and the high incidence of low birthweight piglets at commercial farms, the impact of birthweight on fertility in boars deserves special attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate testicular morphofunctional parameters and semen characteristics in different birthweight boars. Forty littermate males were selected at birth and divided into two experimental groups, according to birthweight: high (HW, birthweight ranging from 1.80 to 2.15 kg, n = 20) and low (LW, birthweight ranging from 0.75 to 1.10 kg, n = 20). At 170 days of age, a sub-set of 24 littermate boars (n = 12 HW and n = 12 LW) were randomly selected for semen collection, which was performed once a week, at a 15-day interval, during five weeks. At 300 days of age, boars were orchiectomized, and the testis processed for histological and molecular analyses. The HW group was heavier and presented larger testes compared to LW animals (P < 0.05). Despite that, birthweight did not significantly affect semen volume or sperm quality parameters (concentration, motility, vigor or morphology), although LW boars produced 38.2% fewer total sperm and 24% lower semen concentration, leading to 36.8% less inseminating doses. The histomorphometrical evaluation showed that seminiferous tubules diameter and germinal epithelium height were similar between experimental groups. However, LW boars presented shorter seminiferous tubules and, consequently, fewer Sertoli cells per testis (P 0.05). Even though plasma testosterone levels were equivalent in both birthweight groups, LW testis presented less androgen receptors (P < 0.05). Additionally, birthweight was positively correlated with total semi-niferous tubule length and number of Sertoli cells (P < 0.01), and with body and testis weights (P < 0.01). Taken together, even though adult LW boars showed no evident semen pathologies or spermatogenesis commitment, mature HW males have the potential to produce more spermatozoa, consequently more semen doses per ejaculate, being more valuable to an industry that relies on AI.

AB  - IntroductionGrowing evidence clearly demonstrates that maternal rodents exposure to sleep deprivation (SD) during late pregnancy impairs learning and memory in their offspring. Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly histone acetylation, are known to be involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We hypothesize that the cognitive decline induced by SD during late pregnancy is associated with histone acetylation dysfunction, and this effect could be reversed by an enriched environment (EE). MethodsIn the present study, pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to SD during the third trimester of pregnancy. After weaning, all offspring were randomly assigned to two subgroups in either a standard environment or an EE. When offspring were 3 months old, the Morris water maze was used to evaluate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory ability. Molecular biological techniques, including western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were used to examine the histone acetylation pathway and synaptic plasticity markers in the hippocampus of offspring. ResultsThe results showed that the following were all reversed by EE treatment: maternal SD (MSD)-induced cognitive deficits including spatial learning and memory; histone acetylation dysfunction including increased histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and decreased histone acetyltransferase (CBP), and the acetylation levels of H3K9 and H4K12; synaptic plasticity dysfunction including decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor; and postsynaptic density protein-95. ConclusionsOur findings suggested that MSD could damage learning ability and memory in offspring via the histone acetylation pathway. This effect could be reversed by EE treatment.

AB  - Insular gigantism is an evolutionary phenomenon whereby small animals become bigger on islands compared to their mainland relatives. The abundance of insular giant taxa in the fossil record suggests the presence of a universal "giant niche" present on islands, with resource limitation as a potential driver for this process. However, insular habitats are ecologically diverse, suggesting that island taxa adopt different survival strategies, including adaptations for foraging behaviors. Here, we used finite element analysis to evaluate insular feeding niche adaptations in some of the most extreme examples of insular gigantism: Mediterranean giant dormice. We calculated stress, strain, and mechanical advantage during incisor and molar biting for 3 extinct insular giant species (Leithia melitensis, Hypnomys morpheus, and H. onicensis), an extant giant (Eliomys quercinus ophiusae), and their extant non-giant mainland relative, the generalist-feeder Eliomys quercinus. Our results show that dietary adaptations vary between giant taxa on different islands, and can occur relatively rapidly. Furthermore, the functional mandibular morphology in some insular taxa indicate adaptations moving away from a generalist feeding strategy toward greater trophic specialization. We show that the "insular giant niche" varies between islands and across time periods, arguing against a universal ecological driver for insular gigantism in small mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary The Sox gene family is a set of specific transcriptional factor (TF) proteins, with a very similar sequence compared to the sex-determining region Y (SRY), related high-mobility group (HMG) box genes found in mammals. The Sox gene family is involved in many important developmental processes, including sex determination. In the current study, an in silico analysis was performed to provide insights into the evolutionary importance, mutations and gene duplication events of the buffalo Sox gene family. Based on our analysis, we found that the HMG domain was highly conserved throughout the Sox gene family. Mutational analysis revealed twenty non-synonymous mutations with potential detrimental effects on physiological functions in buffalo. The current study concluded that the buffalo Sox gene family was highly conserved throughout evolution, and the non-synonymous mutations identified could potentially be valuable for the selective breeding of buffalo. The Sox gene family constitutes transcription factors with a conserved high mobility group box (HMG) that regulate a variety of developmental processes, including sex differentiation, neural, cartilage, and early embryonic development. In this study, we systematically analyzed and characterized the 20 Sox genes from the whole buffalo genome, using comparative genomic and evolutionary analyses. All the buffalo Sox genes were divided into nine sub-groups, and each gene had a specific number of exons and introns, which contributed to different gene structures. Molecular phylogeny revealed more sequence similarity of buffalo Sox genes with those of cattle. Furthermore, evolutionary analysis revealed that the HMG domain remained conserved in the all members of the Sox gene family. Similarly, all the genes are under strong purifying selection pressure; seven segmental duplications occurred from 9.65 to 21.41 million years ago (MYA), and four potential recombination breakpoints were also predicted. Mutational analysis revealed twenty non-synonymous mutations with potential effects on physiological functions, including embryonic development and cell differentiation in the buffalo. The present study provides insights into the genetic architecture of the Sox gene family in buffalo, highlights the significance of mutations, and provides their potential utility for marker-assisted selection for targeted genetic improvement in buffalo.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a crucial factor in determining meat quality, yet yak meat is typically characterized by low IMF levels. The epigenetic mechanisms underlying IMF deposition, particularly the role of super-enhancers (SEs), remain poorly understood. RNA-seq identified 66 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and 56 DE pri-miRNAs in yak longissimus dorsi with varying IMF contents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed 1209 SE-associated pri-miRNA genes and 2709 SE-associated mature miRNA genes with distinct histone modifications. These SEs not only enhance the transcription of miRNA genes but also affect the processing and maturation of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). H3K27ac-marked SEs regulated key miRNAs, including miR-1991, miR-2284b, miR-2284 ac, and miR-2285ay. Enrichment of muscle-specific transcription factors within H3K27ac-enriched regions, including USF1, KLF4, SMAD, and ATF, suggesting their role in regulating miRNA expression and muscle function. Functional studies confirmed that miR-2285ay, a SEassociated miRNA, promotes yak adipocyte differentiation through a series of cell and molecular biology experiments. Dual-luciferase assays demonstrated the regulatory role of SEs in miR-2285ay expression through the enhancer activity of their constituent regions. Our study provides preliminary insights into the epigenetic regulation of intramuscular fat deposition and provides a reference for improving yak beef quality through genetic improvement in the future.

AB  - Urban areas with intense industrial activity and heavy traffic are among those most affected by increasing pollution levels. These areas experience a rise in air pollution, containing a complex mix of pollutants including particulate matter and potentially toxic elements. Trees located along urban and rural roadsides are used as environmentally sustainable tools for tracking and reducing air pollution impacts. In this study, the aim was to determine the variation of nickel (Ni) concentrations in the species Nerium oleander L., Salix babylonica L., Magnolia grandiflora L., Prunus laurocerasus L., Cercis siliquastrum L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Aesculus hippocastanum L., Platanus orientalis L., and Acer negundo L. based on plant organs and traffic density. In this study, plant materials collected from the city center of Trabzon/T & uuml;rkiye were used. The results indicate significant variations in Ni accumulation among species under different traffic densities based on average values. Differences in element concentrations have been observed both among the studied species and within the organs of the same species. Generally, the lowest Ni concentrations were observed in N. oleander (766.2 ppb), S. babylonica (935.7 ppb), and M. grandiflora (632.9 ppb), while the highest concentrations were recorded in R. pseudoacacia (3217.9 ppb) and A. negundo (3111.9 ppb). Therefore, R. pseudoacacia and A. negundo are considered suitable as bioindicator for Ni metal. These findings underscore the potential of plants to monitor heavy metal pollution from traffic and suggest that these species should be considered in environmental protection efforts.

AB  - Sheep caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) causes significant economic losses in the livestock sector by causing a loss in the quantity and quality of animal products and a loss in the breeding value of animals. Although the primary agent in CLA's etiology is Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, some other opportunistic microorganisms also play a role. Therefore, the control and treatment of CLA necessitates the identification of the relevant etiological agents. This study aimed to conduct an in vitro culture and molecular characterization (PCR analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing) of the bacteria involved in sheep CLA cases reported in the & Ccedil;ank & imath;r & imath; province of T & uuml;rkiye and determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the case isolates. In total, 82 (16.4%) of 500 sheep in five farms were diagnosed with CLA. Following the culture of the superficial abscesses samples, C. pseudotuberculosis was identified in 30 (36.59%) as a result of PCR, Pseudomonas spp. in 8 (9.76%), and Enterobacter cancerogenus in 1 (1.22%), as a result of 16S rRNA sequencing. These data revealed extensive heterogeneity among the Pseudomonas isolates, with hints of derivation from a common ancestry for some and phylogenetic similarity to isolates from Germany, Malaysia, and India. In contrast to the high susceptibility to cefoperazone and lincomycin, the high resistances of C. pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas spp. isolates to cephalothin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, amoxicillin, and bacitracin were remarkable. Based on these findings, it was concluded that for an effective treatment and control of ovine CLA cases, there is a need to consider the possible involvement of opportunistic bacteria other than the primary causative agent, C. pseudotuberculosis. It also contributed to increasing the country-specific sequence data and establishing new taxa from a universal perspective.

AB  - Bark stripping by mammals is a major problem in managed conifer forests worldwide. In Australia, bark stripping in the exotic plantations of Pinus radiata is mainly caused by native marsupials and results in reduced survival, growth, and in extreme cases death of trees. Herbivory is influenced by a balance between primary metabolites that are sources of nutrition and secondary metabolites that act as defences. Identifying the compounds that influence herbivory may be a useful tool in the management of forest systems. This study aimed to detect and identify both constitutive and induced compounds that are associated with genetic differences in susceptibility of two-year-old P. radiata trees to bark stripping by marsupials. An untargeted profiling of 83 primary and secondary compounds of the needles and bark samples from 21 susceptible and 21 resistant families was undertaken. These were among the most and least damaged families, respectively, screened in a trial of 74 families that were exposed to natural field bark stripping by marsupials. Experimental plants were in the same field trial but protected from bark stripping and a subset were subjected to artificial bark stripping to examine induced and constitutive chemistry differences between resistant and susceptible families. Machine learning (random forest), partial least squares plus discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and principal components analysis with discriminant analysis (PCA-DA), as well as univariate methods were used to identify the most important totals by compound group and individual compounds differentiating the resistant and susceptible families. In the bark, the constitutive amount of two sesquiterpenoids - bicyclogermacrene and an unknown sesquiterpenoid alcohol -were shown to be of higher levels in the resistant families, whereas the constitutive sugars, fructose, and glucose, as well individual phenolics, were higher in the more susceptible families. The chemistry of the needles was not useful in differentiating the resistant and susceptible families to marsupial bark stripping. After artificial bark stripping, the terpenes, sugars, and phenolics responded in both the resistant and susceptible families by increasing or reducing amounts, which leveled the differences in the amounts of the compounds between the different resistant and susceptible classes observed at the constitutive level. Overall, based on the families with extreme values for less and more susceptibility, differences in the amounts of secondary compounds were subtle and susceptibility due to sugars may outweigh defence as the cause of the genetic variation in bark stripping observed in this non-native tree herbivory system.

AB  - In order to protect and utilize the germplasm resource better, it is highly necessary to carry out a study on the genetic diversity of Camellia chekiangoleosa Hu. However, systematic research on population genetics analysis of the species is comparatively rare. Herein, 16 highly variable simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used for genetic structure assessment in 12 natural C. chekiangoleosa populations. The genetic diversity of C. chekiangoleosa was low (h = 0.596), within which, central populations (such as Damaoshan (DMS), Sanqingshan (SQS), and Gutianshan (GTS)) at the junction of four main mountain ranges presented high diversity and represented the center of the C. chekiangoleosa diversity distribution; the Hengshan (HS) population in the west showed the lowest diversity, and the diversity of the eastern and coastal populations was intermediate. C. chekiangoleosa exhibited a high level of genetic differentiation, and the variation among populations accounted for approximately 24% of the total variation. The major reasons for this situation are the small population scale and bottleneck effects in some populations (HS and Lingshan (LS)), coupled with inbreeding within the population and low gene flow among populations (Nm = 0.796). To scientifically protect the genetic diversity of C. chekiangoleosa, in situ conservation measures should be implemented for high-diversity populations, while low-diversity populations should be restored by reintroduction.

AB  - Pine Island Glacier (PIG), the largest glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, has contributed to over a quarter of the observed sea level rise around Antarctica. In recent years, multiple observations have confirmed its continuous retreat, ice flow acceleration and profound surface melt. Understanding these changes is crucial for accurately monitoring ice mass discharge and future Antarctic contributions to sea level rise. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the complex interactions between these variables to comprehend how they collectively affect the overall stability of the intricate PIG system. In this study, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing data and deep learning method to detect and analyze the spatio-temporal variations of surface melt, ice shelf calving, and ice flow velocity of the PIG from 2015 to 2023. We explored the correlations among these factors to understand their long-term impacts on the glacier's stability. Our findings reveal a retreat of 26.3 km and a mass loss of 1001.6 km2 during 2015-2023. Notably, extensive surface melting was observed, particularly in the 2016/2017 and 2019/2020 melting seasons. Satellite data vividly illustrate prolonged and intense melting periods, correlating with a significant retreat in the glacier's terminus position in 2019/2020. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of surface melting and the cumulative retreat of the ice shelf from 2017 to 2020 on the PIG shows a temporal relationship with subsequent significant changes in ice flow velocity, ranging from 10.9 to 12.2 m d-1, with an average acceleration rate of 12%. These empirical findings elucidate the intricate relationship among surface melt, ice flow velocity, and consequential glacier dynamics. A profound understanding of these interrelationships holds paramount importance in glacier dynamic changes and modeling, providing invaluable insights into potential glacier responses to global climate change.

AB  - The deleterious effects of aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) which are widespread at all stages of food production, on the reproductive system have been widely reported in males. However, it is still far from fully understood about the toxic effect and molecular mechanism after exposure to AFB1 in various testicular cells, especially Sertoli cells (SCs) which provide various energy materials and support to the developing germ cells as nurse cells. In this work, we examined the effects of AFB1 in dairy goat SCs on lactate production and autophagy, and the role of autophagy on AFB1-induced reduction in lactate production. Mechanistically, AFB1 destroyed the energy balance and reduced the secretion of lactate in dairy goat SCs (P < 0.01), resulting in a reduced level of ATP (P < 0.01) and phosphorylation of AMPK (P < 0.01). Subsequently, activated AMPK triggers autophagy by directly phosphorylating ULK1 (P < 0.05). The enhancement of autophagy partially reversed the AFB1-induced decrease in lactate secretion by promoting glucose utilization (P < 0.01) and increasing the expression of pro-teins related to lactate secretion in dairy goat SCs (P < 0.05) such as GLUT1, GLUT3, LDHA, and MCT4. Collectively, our study suggests that AFB1 inhibits the secretion of lactate which supply for germ cell develop-ment by damaging the "Warburg-like" metabolism of dairy goat SCs. Moreover, autophagy contributes to the resistance of glucose metabolism damage induced by AFB1.Data availability: All data generated or analyzed in this study are available from the corresponding authors upon request.

AB  - To ensure sustainable food production within agroecosystems, effective pest control is of utmost importance. One critical component of integrated pest management is biological control. The attraction, retention, and persistence of natural enemies within cropping systems are key factors for the success and effectiveness of biological control. Despite great efforts to attract and augment natural enemies in agroecosystems, little is known about the retention and persistence of their populations after they arrive at a crop field. Plant defensive traits play a critical role in shaping herbivore population dynamics, yet their impact on the structure of carnivorous arthropod communities and their contribution in boosting the success of biological control efforts remains understudied. Here, we discuss the role of plant defenses in retaining natural enemy communities by influencing the quality of herbivorous pests as prey for their natural enemies. These bottom -up effects of host -plant defenses on prey quality are often overlooked in the development of pest management strategies. However, these effects could serve as the foundation for novel applications of plant defenses in pest management.

AB  - Simple Summary: Small island environments can drive rapid changes in animal traits that provide an advantage for individuals attempting to capitalize on scarce resources. One such trait for lizards is bite force-individuals with stronger bites may be better able to access food that is hard to chew and/or guard access to food and territories from competitors. We introduced lizards to five small, uninhabited islets in Greece and tracked changes in the physical features and bite force of the lizards over several generations. We found changes in body size and bite force that suggested that competition was intense on these small islets; however, we did not see a consistent change in diet among these experimental populations. Our results suggest that competition is an important driver of changes in these traits, and changes in diet may be follow-on consequences. It remains to be discovered if diet is also a driver of these changes in other times of the year when food is especially limited. Some species can and do flexibly and rapidly change in response to changes in their environment.
   Resource-limited environments may drive the rapid evolution of phenotypic traits and ecological preferences optimizing the exploitation of resources. Very small islands are often characterized by reduced food availability, seasonal fluctuations in resources and strong unpredictability. These features may drive the evolution of phenotypic traits such as high bite forces, allowing animals to exploit a wider variety of the available resources. They may also lead to more generalist dietary patterns in response to food scarcity. However, the lack of predators and competitors on such small islands often also leads to high densities and the evolution of strong sexual dimorphism, which may also drive the evolution of bite force. Here, we take advantage of a unique replicated introduction experiment to test whether lizards introduced into very small islands alter their feeding ecology and use different resources, resulting in the evolution of a large body size, large head size and large bite forces. Our results show that three years after their introduction, the island lizards were larger and had greater bite forces and more pronounced sexual dimorphism. However, the diets were only marginally different between animals from the source population on a very large nearby island and those on the islets. Moreover, distinct differences in diet between animals on the different islets were observed, suggesting that the local environment is a strong driver of resource use. Overall, lizards with absolutely and relatively (adjusted for body size) large bite forces did eat larger and harder prey. Taken together, our data suggest that intraspecific competition is an important driver of the rapid evolution of bite force, which may allow these lizards to exploit the scarce and fluctuating resources on the islets. Whether or not lizards will evolve to include other types of food such as plants in their diet, facilitated by their large bite forces, remains to be explored in future studies.

AB  - Human-specific faecal contamination has been affecting surface water and is a threat to both the environment and public health due to its potential co-occurrence with pathogens. Extended studies were conducted to detect and quantify faecal contamination using microbial source tracking (MST) markers targeting bacteria and viruses. The prototypical crAssphage, a presumed Bacteroides-infecting phage discovered in 2014, showed superior specificity to human faeces and high abundance in untreated sewage water. This study evaluated the applicability of crAssphage markers, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064, as MST tools for detecting domestic sewage contamination in surface water in China. Validation tests based on domestic sewage and animal faecal samples demonstrated high sensitivity/specificity of 100%/96.7% for CPQ_056 and 100%/100% for CPQ_064 within the scope of this study, surpassing the performance of traditional Bacteroidales markers such as HF183 (100%/80.4% against sewage). MST markers targeting different hosts and validated in the Taihu watershed (CPQ_056, CPQ_064, BacUni, HF183 TaqMan, Pig-2-Bac, and GFD) were quantified in water samples collected from the inflow rivers of Taihu Lake in summer and winter 2020. The results showed the dominance of sewage/wastewater as the source of contamination in all faecal pollution. Spatial analysis revealed higher contamination levels in northwest rivers, which were those most impacted by human activities. There was also a diluting pattern downstream of some rivers. Correlations with water quality parameters indicated the co-occurrence of nutrient-related pollution and faecal contamination, particularly in areas with industrial, low-density residential, green space, and municipal service land uses. The findings established the efficacy of crAssphage markers in enhancing precision and accuracy in monitoring faecal contamination, offering valuable tools for policymakers and environmental managers.

AB  - Drought stress adversely affects the growth, yield, and quality of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.). Although strigolactones (SLs) are known to mediate drought adaptation in plants, their regulatory mechanisms in tea plants remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that exogenous SL application alleviated drought-induced symptoms by photosynthetic adaptation and mitigating the damage of cell membrane. Moreover, exogenous SL enhanced antioxidant response through regulating catechins metabolism in drought-sensitive cv. 'Huangjinya'. Notably, we identified CsD27 as a key SL-biosynthetic gene, whose expression level was negatively correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA), mechanistically linking its function in drought tolerance in tea plants. Overexpression of CsD27 enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis with decreased MDA content and increased survival rate under drought stress. These findings elucidate a dual SL-mediated mechanism that simultaneously enhances stress tolerance and preserves tea quality, which provide a potential target for molecular breeding in perennial crops.

AB  - Simple Summary Day length is a critical environmental factor for gonadal development in animals. However, related studies on male pigs are limited. The present study investigated the effects of different day lengths on behavior changes, growth parameters, testicular size, testosterone secretion, steroidogenesis proteins, and melatonin receptors in Meishan male pigs. The results indicated that a long day length (LDL, 14 h light/10 h dark, 14L/10D) could increase the lying time, decrease the exploring time, and increase the body height, chest circumference, testicular length, testicular weight, crude protein digestibility, and fecal testosterone and cortisol contents compared to a short day length (SDL, 10L/14D) in Meishan male pigs, accompanied by the changes in sex hormone synthesis proteins and melatonin receptor 1b (MT2), but with no change in melatonin receptor 1a (MT1). This suggests that the effect of day length on growth and gonadal development in male pigs may be conducted via MT2 and influence steroid synthesis and secretion in the testis, and proper day length should be provided in male pig breeding.Abstract Day length is a critical environmental factor for regulating animal growth and development. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different day lengths on the developmental changes of growth parameters, testicular sizes, testosterone secretion in Meishan male pigs, and steroidogenesis proteins and melatonin receptors. Fourteen Meishan male pigs (10 weeks (wks) of age) with the same parity, paired in litter and body weight (BW), were evenly allocated into a short-day-length group (SDL, 10 light/14 dark) and long-day-length group (LDL, 14 light/10 dark). After 12 wks of the experiment, the LDL-treated boars had more lying time and less exploring time. The LDL treatment led to significant increases in body height, chest circumference, testicular length, testicular weight, crude protein digestibility, and fecal testosterone at the 10th and 12th wks of the experiment, and cortisol at the 10th wk, compared to the SDL treatment, with no differences in the final BW, testicular width, and epididymis weight. Furthermore, the LDL treatment significantly increased the protein levels of melatonin receptor 1b (MT2), aromatase (CYP19), and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) in the testis, with no differences in the protein levels of melatonin receptor 1a (MT1), steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). The present study suggests that day length has an effect on the growth and gonadal development in male pigs maybe via MT2 and influences steroid synthesis and secretion in the testis. Therefore, proper day length should be considered in male pig breeding.

AB  - To meet growing demand for animal-based foods, livestock production has intensified to maximize output with limited resources and space. This has increased the spatial heterogeneity of livestock distribution, which has in turn caused severe nutrient loss and increased risk of antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic disease, and human exposure to disease and pollution. There is an urgent need for spatially explicit impact assessments, but current methods lack the resolution needed to accurately map fine-scale livestock distribution. Here we developed a mapping agricultural production systems (MAPS) model by fusing enterprise registration information (ERI), which can directly represent agricultural activities, with other currently available data to generate high-resolution mapping. Using an example of pig production in China, the global leading pig producer, we show that MAPS improves the accuracy of location/size estimates of livestock production systems by 12%-84%, illustrating a 44% underestimation of pig numbers in dense farming areas (>1,000 pigs/ km(2)) by existing methods. MAPS also reveals a spatial transfer of pig production from rural to peri-urban areas, implying more decoupled pig-crop systems in China. MAPS enables spatially explicit impact assessments to support sustainable planning of intensive livestock production systems that can alleviate nutrient loss and health risks.

AB  - To mitigate habitat fragmentation and roadkill, roads are increasingly equipped with wildlife fences and underpasses. However, the effectiveness of such fences in preventing road access for amphibians has not been tested under controlled conditions. In 2019 and 2020, we tested the efficacy of full panel fences of differing material, height, and shape (presence/absence of an overhang), to prevent road access for adult and juvenile amphibians. We selected five species according to locomotion mode: Natterjack toads (runners), European green toads (short-distance jumpers), agile frogs (proficient jumpers), American tree frogs (proficient climbers) and smooth newts (climbers). We found that Natterjack and green toads were unable to cross a concrete fence with a height of 13 and 24 cm, respectively. Addition of a 10 cm overhang reduced the height required to prevent crossing further to 10 and 17 cm, respectively. The ability of these less agile species to cross a certain fence height depended on body length. By contrast, jumping agile frogs and climbing tree frogs were not stopped by the greatest fence height tested (40 cm). However, addition of the overhang stopped the climbing tree frogs at a concrete fence height of 35 cm. An alternative metal fence (with overhang) was tested with some species and performed similar to the concrete fence (with overhang). Finally, the greatest concrete fence height passed by climbing juveniles was 20 cm (smooth newts). Hence, to stop amphibians from road crossing, we recommend the construction of durable (concrete or galvanized metal) and well-maintained fences with a minimum height of 40 cm with a 10 cm overhang.

AB  - Globally, due to climate change, urbanization, and the intensification of interactions between humans and animals, tick populations have increased, and areas where these arthropod vectors can develop and transmit diseases have expanded. Ixodidae ticks infect a wide variety of species and serve as major vectors for zoonotic pathogens of veterinary importance. This study aimed to identify and map ticks collected from boar tails in six Romanian counties. A total of 141 ticks were identified and differentiated on the basis of their morphological characteristics via stereomicroscopy and electron microscopy. Among the 141 ticks examined, five species, Ixodes ricinus, Haemaphysalis concinna, Haemaphysalis erinacei, Dermacentor reticulatus, and Dermacentor marginatus, were identified. The identification and mapping of ticks present on wild boars is beneficial for both veterinary and human medicine due to the pathogens they can transmit. The results of our study indicate that parasitism with different tick species in wildlife-in this case, wild boar-is present in the Romanian counties under study. This is one of the most recent tick identification and mapping studies. Tick parasitism represents a threat to the health of wild/domestic animals, and frequent monitoring is necessary.

AB  - Although evidence suggests the ubiquity of meso-and microplastics (MMPs) in mangrove forests, our knowledge of their bioavailability and risk on mangrove leaves is scarce. Here, we investigated MMP contamination concerning sub-merged mangrove leaves and herbivorous snails that mainly feed on them from the four mangrove forests located in Beibu Gulf, Guangxi Province, China. Results showed that the MMP abundance on the mangrove leaves ranged from 0.01 +/- 0.00 to 0.42 +/- 0.15 items cm-2, while it ranged from 0.33 +/- 0.21 to 6.20 +/- 2.91 items individual-1 in the snails. There were significant positive correlations between snails and leaves regarding the abundance of total MMPs and the proportions of MMPs with the same characteristics. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) that mainly derived from aquaculture rafts, accounted for a major component both on the leaves and in the snails in Shi Jiao (SJ). Both the detection frequency and percentage of larger EPS (2.00-17.50 mm) on the leaves in SJ were higher than other sites. Meanwhile, the detection frequency, abundance and percentage of larger EPS on the leaves had significant pos-itive correlations with those of micro-EPS in the snails. These findings suggested that mangrove leaves may represent a viable pathway for MMPs to enter the herbivorous snails. Larger EPS with higher frequency of occurrence on mangrove leaves were more likely to be encountered and ingested by snail considering its opportunistic feeding behavior. In ad-dition, 11 sensitive genes involved in the processes of metabolism, intestinal mucosal immune systems, and cellular transduction in the snails were significantly suppressed by MMP exposure, which may be potentially used as early bio-markers to indicate the biological effects of MMPs under realistic environmental conditions. Overall, this study pro-vides novel insights into the fate, sources, and biological effects of MMPs on mangrove leaves.

AB  - Through the transfer chain of surroundings from feed to the farmed-animals and ultimately the corresponding livestock and poultry products, people are exposed to large amounts of bisphenol analogues (BPs), such as rational emissions from manufacturing plants, feed packaging bags and food packaging contact. Some BPs have been reported to show certain toxicological effects, especially, estrogen and endocrine disrupting effect. With the increasing application of BPs, the problem is becoming more and more serious. We systematically studied the hormonal effects of 18 BPs and their effects on cell homeostasis and classical signaling pathways by using classical E-SCREEN assay, fluorescent probes and western blotting. The results confirmed the estrogen-like effect of 13 BPs and 6 BPs obtained high docking scores (Scores < -9.0) for the three receptors simultaneously with the main interactions of hydrophobic, hydrogen and pi-stacking of T-type bonds. BPAP regulates cells via apoptosis and steroid signaling pathway by intracellular ROS and mitochondrial followed the caspase pathway. BPE and BPS were involved in the classical NF-kappa B and Hippo signaling pathways. All data provides scientific basis for the safety risk assessment of endocrine disrupting and cellular homeostasis evaluation of BPs as chronic environmental pollution.

KW  - Multi-attribute entropy method

AB  - Circular agriculture is an efficient way to realize resource recycling because of coupling farming and agriculture. It also has impressive performance on decreasing the pollution issues in both industries. The proposed optimizing circular agriculture systems were mainly focus on nitrogen balance, which were single circular industrial chains. This paper aims to optimize the structure and scale of circular agriculture, i.e., reasonably select and allocate the quantity of planting and breeding to achieve carbon emission and maximize economic benefits for the circular farming system. Firstly, the carbon emissions and economic benefits of various major crops and livestock were calculated based on the relevant agricultural data from the China Statistical Yearbook. Integrating with the information of climate, arable land and livestock farms, the multi-attribute entropy method was introduced to choose the breeding species in the experimental area. Then, three circular agricultural systems were developed when the selected varieties were combined with different ways. Thirdly, considering nitrogen balance constraints, land bearing capacity constraints, feed supply, and other conditions, a coupled optimization model of circular agriculture was proposed to balance both carbon emission reduction and economic benefits. Simultaneously, a robust optimization method was borrowed to solve the coupled optimization model. The robust optimization method was to find the optimization problem's worst solution dealing with uncertainty. Results illustrated that among the three circular agriculture systems, the economic efficiency of the pig-corn-rice system was increased within the range of 25.4-38.5 percent and carbon emissions were reduced within the range of 5.9-6.7 tons, the economic efficiency of the pig-wheat-corn system was increased within the range of 9.7-10.1 percent and carbon emissions were reduced within the range of 14.9 to 18.5 tons, and the economic efficiency of the broiler-rice-corn system was increased within the range of 23.0-30.4 percent and carbon emissions were reduced within the range of 6.4-6.9 tons. Therefore, both economic benefits and carbon emission reductions of these three circular agriculture systems had been significantly improved.

AB  - Simple Summary To suppress or prevent boar taint, many strategies are available, e.g., surgical or immunocastration or different housing and feeding conditions. In Germany, male piglets may no longer be castrated without anesthesia until the 7th day of life for animal welfare reasons. The aim of this study was to reduce skatole and indole, two of the boar taint-causing substances, by the feeding of charcoal. A fat coating applied on charcoal could delay the unspecific adsorption of charcoal until entry to the large intestine where skatole and indole should be adsorbed since the fat coating is digested during its passage through the small intestine. In total, 18 piglets were divided into three feeding groups and were fed for 19 days with the control feed or with the control feed plus 2% charcoal or plus 4% charcoal coated with a fat layer. The skatole and indole concentrations were analyzed in chyme retrieved from the colon and caecum as these substances need to be adsorbed by charcoal in the intestine to prevent resorption into the bloodstream and accumulation in fat. The reduction in skatole and indole contents underlines charcoal's adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity was higher when the charcoal was coated. As charcoal reduced skatole and indole, feeding trials with adult boars are needed to observe the status of boar taint substances at the day of slaughter. To reduce the risk of boar taint, intact male piglets are immuno- or surgically castrated. One alternative is reducing skatole by adding skatole reducing or adsorbing substances to the boars' diet. Charcoal with a high capacity for adsorbing skatole and indole in vitro (tested before, data not shown) was fed to the boars to test the hypothesis that a fat coating prevents the unspecific adsorption of charcoal before entry into the large intestine while increasing skatole adsorption. Twelve male and six female weaning piglets with initial body weights of 7.74 +/- 0.75 kg were fed for 18 (or 19) days with either 2% pure (untreated) charcoal or 4% coated (50% charcoal + 50% fat-coating) charcoal or no charcoal. After euthanasia, skatole and indole were quantified in caecum and colon chyme. Skatole and indole contents in caecum chyme were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the group fed with coated charcoal (33 +/- 4.2, 7 +/- 2.8 mu g/g(DM), respectively) than in the group fed with pure charcoal (51 +/- 7.3, 14 +/- 3.0 mu g/g(DM)) or with no charcoal (73 +/- 12.6, 15 +/- 1.7 mu g/g(DM)). Similar effects were obvious for colon chyme. The results indicate that a fat coating of charcoal might prevent unspecific adsorption in the small intestine and might consequently lead to a higher adsorption capacity for skatole and indole in the large intestine, as skatole and indole concentrations in the chyme of caecum and colon were approximately 50% lower in the piglets who received coated charcoal.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was obtained by transesterification method from cattle, sheep, and chicken waste fats not utilized in the nutrition sector. Test fuels were formed by blending the biodiesel with diesel fuel in different proportions (10, 20, 30, 50, and 75%). The experiments were carried out at various engine load in an air-cooled, four-stroke, direct injection, single-cylinder diesel engine using the generated test fuels, 100% AFBD (AFBD100) and pure diesel (D100). For performance, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were evaluated, while carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and smoke were considered for emissions. Experimental results show that BTE increases up to 30% AFBD ratio and that more AFBD additions negatively affect BTE. Maximum BTE was achieved with AFBD10 at 3000 W load and an increase of 8.11% was determined compared to D100 at the same load. Conversely, while BSFC, CO2, and NOx raised with the usage of AFBD, smoke, HC, and CO emissions decreased. In the usage of AFBD-containing fuels, minimum BSFC, CO2, and NOx were obtained with AFBD10, while minimum smoke, HC, and CO were obtained with AFBD100. With the AFBD100 test fuel, smoke, HC, and CO emissions decreased on average by 41.82, 26.14, and 15.65%, respectively, compared to the D100.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are two major contributors to global disease burden. Amongst various causal factors, exposure to even low doses of environmental heavy metals, like arsenic, can induce anxiety and depression-like behaviour in mammals. Ingestion of arsenic, primarily through contaminated drinking water, severely disrupts the gut microbes, thereby inducing structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from arsenic-exposed mice to recipient healthy mice (As-FMT) enriched LPS-secreting Gram-negative bacteria and upregulated the expression of TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells. Consequently, inflammation, oxidative stress and compromised barrier integrity in the gut facilitated LPS translocation into the bloodstream and promoted systemic inflammation. The secretomes eventually affected the brain by activating microglia, altering neurotransmitter levels and reducing the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, contributing to appearance of pyknotic nuclei in dentate gyrus of hippocampus and emergence of anxiety- and depression-like behaviour. Luteolin, a flavonoid, devoid of any apparent side-effects, yet known for its antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, showed potential in alleviating the gut-brain toxic effects. However, its limited solubility and bioavailability pose challenges for its effectiveness, for which chitosan-conjugated luteolin gold nanoparticles (CH-LuAuNPs) were synthesized. Interestingly, where FMT from arsenic-treated mice to healthy mice showed deleterious effects in the transplanted mice, FMT from arsenic-treated mice coadministered with CH-LuAuNP attenuated As-FMT-mediated disruption of the gut-brain axis. This study highlighted the critical contribution of healthy gut microbiota in preserving neurobehavioural physiology, as well as underscored the potential therapeutic benefits of luteolin nanoparticles in ameliorating arsenic-induced gut dysbiosis and consequent mental disorders.

AB  - In 2019, there was an environmental catastrophe in Brazil, when more than 5000 tons of unknown origin crude oil invaded beaches and mangroves. Two years later, two monitoring areas were selected to study seahorses' offspring: Massangana River estuary (apparently healthy area) and Cocaia Island (affected area). Thirty-six reproductive events of Hippocampus reidi (Syngnathidae) couples from these two areas were monitored to analyze the offspring. At the apparently healthy area, no newborns with malformations were found. However, the offspring from Cocaia Island showed a mean of 19.73% (+/- 5.23) malformations in newborns. It is argued that the toxic/teratogenic effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have affected the population in two ways: directly through the induction of mutations in the germ cells of the species and through a drastic reduction of the population (bottleneck effect) whose density observed today recovered through consanguineous couplings, potentiating deleterious genotypes in the offspring.

AB  - Diet-mediated host-microbiota interplay is a key factor in optimizing the gut function and overall health of the host. Gaining insight into the biological mechanisms behind this relationship is fundamental to finding sustainable, environment-friendly feed solutions in livestock production systems. Here, we apply a multi-omics integration approach to elucidate sustainable diet-associated host-gut microbiota interactions in pigs and we demonstrate novel and biologically relevant host-microbe associations in the gut, driven by a rapeseed meal-based feed (RSF). Interestingly, RSF-diet promoted the abundance of segmented filamentous bacteria Candidatus Arthromitus that was associated with the maintenance of mucosal immunity in the ileum of pigs. In the colon, RSF diet affected host mRNA splicing functions, which may result in different host gene products, through host-microbiota associations, particularly with the Faecalibacterium population, and through the interaction of dietary components such as sinapic acid with the host cells. Moreover, telomere maintenance and organization functions that may determine the overall health of the host were upregulated and notably associated with Subdoligranulum population in the colon of RSF diet-fed pigs. This integrative multi-omics approach provides more insight into the diet-microbiota-host axis, and a better understanding of mechanisms and opportunities to find new strategies for modulating host health and potentially improving caloric and nutritional efficiency in animal production.
   Graphical AbstractThe most remarkable associations identified between bacterial groups or sinapic acid and host functional pathways in the ileum and colon of the rapeseed diet fed pigs, compared to control diet fed pigs. Bidirectional arrows indicate the associations between the variables (bacteria, sinapic acid, or functional pathways) identified by the multi-omics integration analysis. The upward arrows next to the variable names indicate the higher levels of these variables in ileum or colon of the RSF diet-fed pigs compared to the CON diet-fed pigs. Bacterial groups were shown in green circles, host functional pathways in purple circles, and sinapic acid in blue circle. Created by BioRender.com.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a health priority, which worldwide, mainly affects women. The consequences of IPV include several psychophysiological effects. These range from altered levels of hormones and neurotrophins to difficulties in emotion regulation and cognitive impairment. Mounting evidence from preclinical studies has shown that environmental enrichment, a form of sensory-motor, cognitive, and social stimulation, can induce a wide range of neuroplastic processes in the brain which consistently improve recovery from a wide variety of somatic and psychiatric diseases. To support IPV survivors, it is essential to ensure a safe housing environment, which can serve as a foundation for environmental enrichment-based interventions. However, some concerns have been raised when supportive housing interventions focus on the economic aspects of survivors' lives instead of the emotional ones. We thus propose a holistic intervention in which supportive housing is integrated with evidenced-based psychotherapies which could constitute an enriched therapeutic approach for IPV survivors.

AB  - Feed efficiency is a trait of interest in pigs as it contributes to lowering the ecological and economical costs of pig production. A divergent genetic selection experiment from a Large White pig population was performed for 10 generations, leading to pig lines with relatively low- (LRFI) and high- (HRFI) residual feed intake (RFI). Feeding behavior and metabolic differences have been previously reported between the two lines. We hypothesized that part of these differences could be related to differential sensing and absorption of nutrients in the proximal intestine. We investigated the duodenum transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles comparing overnight fasting with ad libitum feeding in LRFI and HRFI pigs (n = 24). We identified 1,106 differentially expressed genes between the two lines, notably affecting pathways of the transmembrane transport activity and related to mitosis or chromosome separation. The LRFI line showed a greater transcriptomic response to feed intake than the HRFI line. Feed intake affected genes from both anabolic and catabolic pathways in the pig duodenum, such as rRNA production and autophagy. Several nutrient transporter and tight junction genes were differentially expressed between lines and/or by short-term feed intake. We also identified 409 differentially methylated regions in the duodenum mucosa between the two lines, while this epigenetic mark was less affected by feeding. Our findings highlighted that the genetic selection for feed efficiency in pigs changed the transcriptome profiles of the duodenum, and notably its response to feed intake, suggesting key roles for this proximal gut segment in mechanisms underlying feed efficiency.

AB  - As a zoonotic pathogen, S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) can cause severe diseases in both pigs and humans, and develop resistance to antibiotics. Plant natural compounds are regarded as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Phillyrin is the major bioactive components of Chinese herbal medicine Forsythia suspensa. In this study, we explored the activity and action mechanism of phillyrin against SS2. The results showed that phillyrin could disrupt membrane integrity, destroy intracellular structures, and increase the exosmosis of DNA. Results of PCR revealed that phillyrin affected bacterial-virulence-related genes' expression levels. Meanwhile, phillyrin significantly decreased the adhesion activity, inhibited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion, and reduced biofilm formation of SS2 in Newborn pig trachea epithelial (NPTr) cells. Furthermore, phillyrin protected tight junction protein of NPTr cells from SS2. We reported that phillyrin (0.1 mg/kg) treatment after bacterial challenge significantly improved the survival rate, ameliorated pulmonary inflammation, and inhibited the accumulation of multiple cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha). Molecular docking showed that phillyrin had a good binding activity with the Ala88 and Asp111 of suilysin (SLY), one of the most important virulence factors of SS2. Collectively, phillyrin possesses antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, and is a promising candidate for preventing SS2 infection.

AB  - Simple Summary Zearalenone (ZEA) is a prominent feed contaminant worldwide, causing considerable financial losses in the livestock industry due to its estrogen-like effect. Although many reports have claimed that ZEA can interfere with the reproductive system of mammals, little confirmatory information is available. We used ZEA to treat goat granulosa cells (GCs) and found that ZEA could promote apoptosis and oxidative stress levels in GCs, inhibit cell proliferation and arrest the cell cycle. RNA-Seq was performed, which also showed that copper transport-related gene expression was altered, leading to copper accumulation in GCs. These findings provide a new perspective for research on the relationship between ZEA toxicity and copper accumulation Zearalenone (ZEA), also known as F-2 toxin, is a mycotoxin. Despite numerous reports of ZEA impairing livestock production performance and fertility, little information is available, including information about the mechanism underlying damage to cell metal ion transport. Copper, which is essential for cell survival as a metal ion, can consist of a variety of enzymes that facilitate abundant metabolic processes. However, the accumulation of copper in cells can have toxic effects. Here, we intended to determine whether ZEA could impair goat granulosa cells (GCs) and alter the cellular copper concentration. GCs were divided into a negative control (NC) group (cells cultured with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 8 h) and a ZEA group (cells cultured with 200 mu mol/L ZEA diluted in DMSO for 8 h). The results showed that ZEA could inhibit GC proliferation and impair cell viability. GCs showed significant increases in the apoptosis rate and oxidative stress levels, while their ability to synthesize estrogen decreased. In addition, RNA-seq results showed dramatic changes in the expression of copper transport-related genes. The expression levels of ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) and ATPase copper transporting beta (ATP7B) were significantly downregulated (p < 0.01), while the expression of solute carrier family 31 member 1 (SLC31A1) was not modified in the ZEA group compared with the NC group. In accordance with these trends, the copper concentration increased significantly in the ZEA group (p < 0.01). In summary, our results show that ZEA can negatively affect GCs and cause copper accumulation. This finding may provide a prospective line of research on the relationship between ZEA and the transport of copper ions in GCs.

AB  - With the increase of cadmium content in the environment, the losses caused by cadmium-induced intestinal diseases to animal husbandry are increasing year by year. However, most of the on-going research activities focus on zoonotic diseases rather than exploring the mechanisms of animal disease occurrence from an anthropogenic environmental perspective. In this study, stressed Hu sheep under cadmium environmental exposure were selected to explore the mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease development. 16 s, untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomic multiomics were used to analyze the changes of their intestinal tract and intestinal contents. The results showed that the beneficial microorganisms (s_Ruminococcus_sp) in the Cd group were significantly decreased and the potentially harmful microorganisms were significantly enriched, and the changes of these microorganisms affected the changes of metabolites (caprylic acid) to a certain extent, resulting in a decrease in fatty acids in the intestine. Due to the combined effect of cadmium ion and fatty acid reduction, the PPAR signaling pathway was inhibited, and the fatty acid transport and binding were further reduced, causing very serious damage to the intestine. We revealed for the first time the mechanism of intestinal injury in Hu sheeps under cadmium environmental exposure and provided new prevention and treatment methods of intestinal diseases under the environmental exposure to trace metals.

AB  - Environmental pollution, particularly that caused by heavy metals, is a significant global concern in the current period of globalisation and possess a substantial risk to human and animal health through food chain. There have also been reports of heavy metal contamination of cattle and buffalo milk from various parts of India, including Tamilnadu, the Mumbai suburbs, and Northern Gujarat. However, no research has been done to determine whether cow milk from the study area in the state of Odisha contains heavy metal residues. Residue of heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury and cobalt) in raw cow milk samples collected from three major cities of Odisha was studied. Arsenic was not detected in any of the milk samples. In the milk samples from Bhubaneswar, lead was detected higher than the permissible limit recommended by Codex standard and FSSAI, cadmium was detected close to the permissible limit recommended by Codex standard but below the limit recommended by FSSAI, cobalt and mercury were detected below the permissible limit recommended by Codex standard and FSSAI. In Cuttack and Puri, lead was detected close to the recommended permissible limit but other metals (viz. cadmium, cobalt and mercury) were below the recommended permissible limit. Among the three cities, heavy metals were detected highest in the milk samples from Bhubaneswar than Cuttack and Puri. Three of Odisha's largest cities-Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, and Puri-are rapidly becoming more urbanized and industrialized, with populations and automobiles increasing. This might contaminate water and soil, which would then poison the food chain. This could be the primary way that heavy metals enter the animal body, which would then contaminate milk and animal food. The Pb and Cd residues detected in cow milk from the study areas were alarming. It suggested that the cows reared by Goalas in these study areas do not produce environmentally safe and suitable milk for human consumption.

AB  - Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a zoophilic dermatophyte that can cause dermatophytosis in humans and animals. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as a promising agent to overcome the drug-resistance of T. mentagrophytes. Our findings suggest that cationic antimicrobial peptide (ACP5) not only possesses stronger activity against T. mentagrophytes than fluconazole, but also shows lower toxicity to L929 mouse fibroblast cells than terbinafine. Notably, its resistance development rate after resistance induction was lower than terbinafine. The present study aimed to evaluate the fungicidal mechanism of ACP5 in vitro and its potential to treat dermatophyte infections in vivo. ACP5 at 1 xMIC completely inhibited T. mentagrophytes spore germination in vitro. ACP5 severely disrupts the mycelial morphology, leading to mycelial rupture. Mechanistically, ACP5 induces excessive ROS production, damaging the integrity of the cell membrane and decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, causing irreversible damage in T. mentagrophytes. Furthermore, 1% ACP5 showed similar efficacy to the commercially available drug 1% terbinafine in a guinea pig dermatophytosis model, and the complete eradication of T. mentagrophytes from the skin by ACP5 was verified by tissue section observation. These results indicate that ACP5 is a promising candidate for the development of new agent to combat dermatophyte resistance.

AB  - Aminopyralid (2-pyridine carboxylic acid, 4-amino-3, 6-dichloro-2-pyridine carboxylic acid) is an auxin herbicide that has been used widely to control broadleaf weeds in pasture and hay fields. With no post-application withdrawal time, aminopyralid absorbed into forage material can contaminate compost feed stocks such as hay, grass bedding material, and manure. Composts derived from such feed stocks raises concerns about after-effect injuries to sensitive crops by residual aminopyralids. Biochar (BC) additive may affect the composting process and immobilizes organic pollutants. This study examined the effect of composting dairy manure/sawdust 1:1 mixture containing 10 ppb (wet) of aminopyralid with 0%, 2%, 4%, and 10% (w/w) BC levels on chemical and biological characteristics of compost, residual aminopyralid concentration, and intensity of plant injury to tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plants after composting in 140 L plastic rotary drum reactors for two 6-month cycles. Biochar addition decreased organic matter degradation and intensified reduction in residual aminopyralid levels in a dose-dependent manner. Composting with BC concentrated more N, P, and K, caused mild plant injuries, and increased the above ground biomass compared to the no BC incorporation. Addition of BC for composting aminopyralid-contaminated dairy manure can increase the phyto safety level of compost while enhancing the key fertilizer values.

AB  - In dairy grazing systems, livestock urine patches arc hotspots that contribute to global warming, both directly through nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and indirectly, through nitrate leaching. However, under warm-dry temperate environments, N2O emission factors (EFs) have not been thoroughly evaluated, accounting for the influence of urinary nitrogen (N) concentration and urine volume, and emissions measurement approach through different urine application methods. Here we quantified and compared N2O emissions and EFs on a moderately well-drained sandy loam soil from urine patches established in naturally expanding effective area (NEEA), representing urine volumes of 2, 3 and 4 L m(-2) (equivalent to urine -N loadings of 141, 211 and 282 kg N ha(-1)), and using the uniformly wetted area (UWA) with urine applied at 10 L m(-2) (709 kg N ha(-1)), under two different soil moistures (below field capacity, BFC; field capacity, FC).The results showed that cumulative N2O emissions in the NEEA urine patches were 0.36-0.52 kg N2O-N ha(-1) over 146 days (early-winter to late-spring). In the UWA urine patches, cumulative N2O emissions were 2.3 times higher at FC (1.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) than BFC (0.87 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). The EFs were similar between UWA (0.09%) and NEEA (0.07-0.10%) at BFC but were significantly higher (P < 0.05-0.1) in UWA (0.26%) than NEEA (0.09-0.16%) at Fc.The EFs in NEEA were not affected by urine-N loadings under BFC and FC, ranging between 0.07 and 0.16%.The relatively high versus low urine-N loadings in NEEA enhanced pasture herbage and N-uptake responses under both soil moistures. However, there were no differences in apparent N-use efficiency (ranging from 27 to 39%) across the treatments. The EFs observed in this study are much lower than the existing Australian cattle urine annual EF of 0.4%, and further examination to determine a more accurate EF for the industry is required.

AB  - When applied exogenously to plants, jasmonates [i.e., jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)] increase plant resistance against herbivores, and their use in pest management has been suggested. For integration into pest management programs, the benefits of the resistance induced by jasmonates must outweigh the costs of jasmonates on plant growth and yield. A previous field study in rice found that seed treatment with MeJA reduced densities of the rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus, but also reduced plant growth. Yields from MeJA plots were similar to yields from control plots. Because this study was conducted under field conditions with natural levels of pest populations, it was unclear whether effects on growth and yield were due to direct effects of MeJA treatment on the plant or due to lower reductions in rice water weevil densities. Therefore, the present study was designed to characterize the effects of JA and MeJA seed treatment on rice plant growth and yield in a pest-free environment under greenhouse conditions. Seed treatment with 2.5 mM JA and 2.5 mM MeJA enhanced resistance in rice plants to rice water weevils when plants were exposed to weevils 30 days after planting. Seed treatment with MeJA reduced seedling emergence and plant height at 4 and 14 days after planting, respectively, compared to JA and control treatments. However, numbers of tillers per plant at 45 days after planting and days to heading were unaffected by jasmonate seed treatment. Of four yield components (panicles per plant, filled grains per panicle, percent unfilled grains, and filled grain mass) that were measured, only filled grain mass was reduced by seed treatment. Plants grown from MeJA-treated seeds showed 31% lower grain masses compared to plants grown from control-treated seeds. Thus, the effects of seed treatment with MeJA on plant growth were stronger immediately post-treatment and subsided over time, such that plant growth mostly recovered 6 weeks after treatment. At maturity, MeJA may reduce one but not all components of yield. Despite similar effects on rice water weevil resistance, the negative effects of JA seed treatment on plant growth and yield were smaller compared to MeJA seed treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study explored the use of djulis (Chenopodium formosanum) extracts as a potential additive to improve boar sperm cryopreservation. The cryopreservation process can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), negatively affecting sperm quality. The research aimed to identify the optimal concentration of djulis extracts from unhulled seeds and stems for enhancing sperm quality during cryopreservation. Fresh semen from Taiwan indigenous boars was diluted with a modified cryoprotectant extender and supplemented with djulis extracts at different concentrations. The study assessed sperm motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and antioxidant properties post-thaw. Results showed that djulis extracts, particularly from unhulled seeds, improved sperm motility, with significant enhancements in total and progressive motility. The findings suggest that 1% djulis extract improves sperm quality, and further studies will focus on refining the optimal dosage for better cryopreservation results. The cryopreservation of boar sperm effectively extends its storage period but often leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, compromising sperm quality. Plant extracts, rich in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and flavonoids, have been shown to reduce ROS. Djulis (Chenopodium formosanum), also known as the "ruby of cereals", is nutritionally rich and holds potential as a cryoprotective additive. This study aimed to determine the optimal concentration of extracts from different parts of djulis, including unhulled seeds and stems, for effective boar semen cryopreservation. Fresh semen from Taiwan indigenous boars was diluted with a modified GLT-cryoprotectant extender containing glycerol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and trehalose. The experimental groups included DSS25, DSS50, DS25, and DS50-representing djulis unshelled seed at 25 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL, and djulis stem at 25 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL in distilled water, respectively-alongside a control group without additives. Post-thaw assessments included sperm motility, kinetic parameters, viability, acrosome integrity, and the antioxidant properties of djulis extracts, such as DPPH radical scavenging activity and total phenolic acid content. Results showed that total motility (TM) was significantly higher in the DSS25 (48.8 +/- 3.9), DSS50 (49.0 +/- 6.7), and DS50 (49.0 +/- 2.4) groups compared to the control group (31.3 +/- 4.8). Similarly, progressive motility (PM) was significantly improved in DSS25 (27.5 +/- 2.7) and DSS50 (26.8 +/- 4.1) versus the control (12.8 +/- 3.2). However, for straightness (STR), the control group (87.8 +/- 1.3) exhibited significantly higher values than the DS50 group (83.5 +/- 1.3) (p < 0.05). Viability and acrosome integrity showed no significant differences across groups. In conclusion, djulis extracts positively influence sperm motility and forward movement, with 1% djulis extract confirmed to enhance the quality of cryopreserved semen. Future research will focus on determining the optimal dosage of djulis extract for improved cryopreservation outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Tick-borne rickettsioses are emerging diseases that have become widespread in many European countries, particularly in those facing the Mediterranean basin. Although Rickettsia conorii was traditionally thought to be the most threatening species, in recent decades, thanks to the improvements in biomolecular tools, other zoonotic species have been identified, such as Rickettsia slovaca, the etiological agent of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT), as well as other neglected species. These pathogens are present in Italy, but few data are available. This research aimed to improve the epidemiological knowledge of rickettsial infections in tick and wild boar populations in the Euganean Hills Regional Park, an enclosed area in northeastern Italy. Both tick and wild boar blood samples were tested using biomolecular methods to detect and identify Rickettsia species. Only ticks tested positive, and Rickettsia slovaca was the most frequently detected species, showing a high prevalence, followed by Rickettsia monacensis and Rickettsia helvetica. These data highlight a non-negligible presence of these pathogens in northern Italy and outline that rickettsial infections deserve further investigation. Tick-borne rickettsiae are emerging pathogens that are becoming widespread in Europe. Rickettsiae are endemic in Italy, but epidemiological data are currently scarce. This study aimed to improve our knowledge about rickettsial infections in tick and wild boar populations. Blood and ticks were collected from 102 wild boars in 2010 and 2018. Ticks were also collected from the vegetation in the area. All of the samples were examined using real-time PCR targeting the gltA gene to detect Rickettsia DNA. Positivity was confirmed by PCR amplifying the gltA and/or ompB genes. A total of 254 ticks and 89 blood samples were analyzed. Zoonotic rickettsiae were detected in the ticks but not in the blood samples. Rickettsia slovaca (R. slovaca) was the most prevalent in ticks and was found in 23.7% of Dermacentor marginatus (D. marginatus) and in 3.4% of Ixodes ricinus (I. ricinus). Other zoonotic species were identified, such as Rickettsia monacensis, which was detected in 12% of I. ricinus ticks, and Rickettsia helvetica which was found in 3.4% of questing I. ricinus ticks and in 1.1% of D. marginatus collected from wild boars. This study highlights a high prevalence of zoonotic rickettsiae, particularly that of R. slovaca, in northeastern Italy. As rickettsioses are underreported and underdiagnosed in human medicine, both clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to this topic.

AB  - The objective of this project was to report the effects of season and age on conception rate amongst Italian Mediterranean Buffalo subjected to an Ovsynch/Resynch (O/R) reproductive management protocol. The study utilized nulliparous (heifers), primiparous buffalo cows (PBC) and multiparous buffalo cows (MBC). The primiparous and multiparous groups were subjected to the synchronization protocol throughout the entire year, but heifers were synchronized and inseminated only during the spring/summer seasons. The conception rate obtained following the OvSynch oestrus synchronization protocol, applied during spring, was 68.4% for heifers, 83.3% for PBC and 67.7% for MBC. The overall total conception rates following the complete O/R protocol were 84.27%, 94.4% and 79%. Conception rates achieved during summer were heifers 52%, PBC 47.2% and MBC 49%, whilst overall conception rates following the full O/R protocol were 72%, 69.8% and 58.2% respectively. In the autumn seasons, PBC conceived 58.9% and MBC 52.1% following initial Ovsynch, which improved to total overall conception rates of 87.5% and 78.7% following the full O/R protocol. Similarly, in the winter season, PBC experienced a conception rate of 47.5% following Ovsynch and 72.5% after a follow-up Resynch. MBC experienced 60.0% and 74.4% conception following Ovsynch and full O/R, respectively, during winter. Total conception rates during all seasons were quite acceptable following the O/R protocol. There was a significant decrease from spring to summer in conception rate for all parity groups, but heifers were not a severely affected as older buffalo cows. This finding agrees with that of other investigators indicating that heifer fertility is not as negatively impacted by long photoperiod and higher ambient temperature as that of older animals. The O/R protocol as utilized in this study is an effective means of reproductive management for dairy buffalo cows and is effective for improving fertility during out-of-season breeding.

AB  - Body size of organisms is often associated with physiological demands and habitat structure. Several theories and models have been proposed to explain body size trends across geographical space and evolutionary time. It is proposed that herbivores are larger due to their more voluminous digestive system, allowing a longer retention time of the digested material. Simultaneously, for carnivores, it is expected that the bigger the prey, the larger the predator. Additionally, some body size trends have been attributed to climatic variation across space and habitat structure. Bergmann's Rule proposes that larger endotherms inhabit colder areas, once a larger body size promotes better heat retention due to reduced surface/volume ratio. Similarly, aquatic endotherms are larger than expected, due to analogous physiological demands to endotherms living in colder environments. Here we tested whether body size of the Mustelidae clade can be explained by diet, habitat structure or environmental temperature. We performed phylogenetic regressions to assess the relationships between body size and the aforementioned predictors in 53 species of Mustelidae. We found that neither diet nor temperature were related to body size evolution. However, habitat was related to body size, with semi aquatic species being larger. Mechanisms involving thermal inertia, predation pressure, better quality resources close to water and bone density are hypotheses that suggest larger body sizes evolution in semi-aquatic vertebrates. We highlight the importance of considering widely accepted ecological traits for large groups, at lower taxonomic levels, in order to expand our understanding of the maintenance of these standards on different scales.

AB  - Traditional conceptual models of movement assume that animals have 'perfect knowledge' of their environments. Although strong selective pressure may optimize animals' abilities to select favourable habitat components, few, if any, are born with an innate understanding of their environments. That is, individuals need to learn about the distributions and qualities of resources available to them, and this is particularly true for long-lived animals that must cope with dynamic environments over the courses of their lives. Members of many species passively acquire information about their environments while performing other essential activities, such as acquiring food, maintaining territories or searching for mates. But growing evidence suggests that animals may move deliberately for the express purpose of acquiring information. One such behaviour that may benefit animals particularly is to scout for winter resources (i.e. a limiting period) during summer (i.e. a time of abundance) when movements are less costly. Here, we investigate a population of North American porcupines, Erethizon dorsatum, to test whether they display this behaviour. We compared summer and winter habitat use by porcupines using GPS data and radiotelemetry. We also monitored seasonal selection of winter habitat with the use of trail cameras. We examined selection of nutritional and structural characteristics to identify potential drivers of scouting behaviour. We found that porcupines randomly sampled winter habitat during summer and returned in winter to locations with greater structural complexity but not higher nutritional quality. This study provides evidence of animals deliberately moving during summer to gain information about winter resources. More broadly, we suggest that scouting may be a search behaviour that individuals use to inform selection of resources in limiting seasons. Future research should test for similar seasonal movement characteristics across taxonomic groups and ecoregions. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Nowadays, animal manure composting constitutes a sustainable alternative for farmers to enhance the level of nutrients within soils and achieve a good productivity. However, pollutants may be present in manures. This study focuses on the detection of environmental microplastics (EMPs) into composts, as well as on the assessment of their potential toxicity on the earthworm Eisenia andrei . To these aims, animals were exposed to two types of compost, namely bovine (cow) and ovine (sheep) manure, besides to their mixture, for 7 and 14 days. The presence and characterization of EMPs was evaluated in all the tested composts, as well as in tissues of the exposed earthworms. The impact of the tested composts was assessed by a multi -biomarker approach including cytotoxic (lysosomal membrane stability, LMS), genotoxic (micronuclei frequency, MNi), biochemical (activity of catalase, CAT, and glutathione- S -transferase, GST; content of malondialdehyde, MDA), and neurotoxic (activity of acetylcholinesterase, AChE) responses in earthworms. Results indicated the presence of high levels of EMPs in all the tested composts, especially in the sheep manure (2273.14 +/- 200.89 items/kg) in comparison to the cow manure (1628.82 +/- 175.23 items/kg), with the size <1.22 mu m as the most abundant EMPs. A time -dependent decrease in LMS and AChE was noted in exposed earthworms, as well as a concomitant increase in DNA damages (MNi) after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Also, a severe oxidative stress was recorded in animals treated with the different types of compost through an increase in CAT and GST activities, and LPO levels, especially after 14 days of exposure. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider these findings for agricultural good practices in terms of plastic mitigation in compost usage, in order to prevent any risk for environment health.

AB  - Camellia japonica, an evergreen ornamental plant in the Theaceae family, has a natural range that is now shrinking. This is evident by the fact that the species is on the verge of extinction in Laoshan Mountain (Qingdao), the northernmost area of China known to have a natural population of C. japonica. Little is known about the genetic diversity and relationships among cultivated and wild C. japonica populations. One hundred and eighty samples of six C. japonica populations were tested for genetic diversity with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers; these included three cultivated populations, two natural populations in Qingdao, and one natural population in Daqingshan. The average values of polymorphism information content (PIC), expected heterozygosity (He), and Shannon's information index (I) were 0.5849, 0.6385 and 1.3170, respectively, indicating that C. japonica has a high genetic diversity. The genetic diversities of the six populations in rank order were as follows: Daqingshan > Zhongshan Park > Changmenyan Island > Daguan Island > Botanical Garden > May Fourth Square. The geographical isolation of the islands had no significant influence on the genetic diversity of C. japonica. Clustering results showed that the six C. japonica populations could be grouped into three categories, and most populations were clustered according to their geographical origin and genetic background. These results also reconfirmed that the C. japonica (Naidong) population in Qingdao originated from Changmenyan Island. Genetic variation was highest within populations (89%), indicating that C. japonica can be protected at the population level. These findings will prove useful for the genetic analysis, protection, and horticultural use of C. japonica.

AB  - The paper aims to reconstruct the fluctuations of Dobrowolski Glacier, a tidewater glacier located in the inner position of the Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica), from the Little Ice Age (1400-1700) until the present. Measurements of the glacier's area and length were based on multitemporal satellite imagery and submarine glacial landforms. The glacier surface area variations between the Little Ice Age and 2014 A.D were estimated. Morainic banks and paleoglacial reconstructions provided evidence of fluctuations in the surface area of the glacier between PIG and 2014 AD. Therefore, four stages of analysis were established: Stage I (Part I) (1400 to 1700), Stage I (Part II) (1700 until the mid-20th century), Stage II (mid-20th century until the 1980s), Stage III (1980 to 2000), and Stage IV (2000 to 2020). The climate during the Little Ice Age triggered the last major glacial advance, and their grounding line position was recorded by an external and prominent morainic bank. After the major glacial advance position of the grounding line, the ice-margin has undergone higher retreat rates (stage I) as response to the warming trend and the loss of anchoring point. The stage II (Unit B) is recorded by distal and discontinuous morainal ridges and glacial lineations formed in the context of an active ice flow at a deeper point in the fjord. During stage III (Unit C) glacial lineations and steep slopes occur, while landforms are less preserved, revealing a fast shrinkage phase. Stage IV is characterized by discontinuous morainic ridges (Unit D), when the glacier presents the highest annual glacial area loss. Currently, the accelerated shrinkage may be linked to the loss of anchorage on seamounts (serving as pinning points) and increased warming. The U-shaped valley geometry has also influenced the glacier shrinkage processes and the redirection of glacial paleoflow during the last 300 years. The retreat rate to mid-20th century-2020 period is higher than Little Ice Age-mid -20th century period.

AB  - Simple Summary The occurrence of African swine fever has restricted the sustainable and healthy development of the hog industry and its ability to enhance the supply of pork, thus negatively impacting China's economic and social development. During 2018-2021, the resilience of China's hog industry improved due to the adjustments to the prevention and control mechanisms in African swine fever policy and the subsequent recovery of hog breeding and pork production. There are differences among the key factors influencing the resilience of the hog industry across different provinces and periods. These factors include the slaughter rate, carcass weight, mortality rate, culling rate, economic level, industrial structure, per capita consumption, scale level, resource carrying, etc. The aim of this study is to provide guidance for better prevention and mitigation of epidemic risks, thus promoting the high-quality development of the hog industry and meeting the nutritional needs of residents.Abstract African swine fever has damaged the foundation of China's hog industry, caused a serious decline in hog production, highlighted the contradiction between supply and demand in the pork market, and led to major economic and social impacts. The industrial resilience of 31 Chinese provinces to African swine fever shock and its spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics from 2018 to 2021 were measured in this study from the two dimensions of resistance and recoverability. Using Geodetector, the key factors influencing the resilience of China's hog industry were explored. The results showed that 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 represented the resistance and recovery periods of the hog industry under African swine fever shock, respectively, with poor resilience characterizing the resistance period and improved resilience characterizing the recovery period. At the early stages of the African swine fever outbreak, the hog industries in Tianjin, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Yunnan had robust resistance due to the slaughter rate, economic level, mortality rate, carcass weight, and culling rate in those areas. At the most severe stage of the outbreak, resistance was generally poor in all provinces due to the slaughter rate, per capita consumption, and scale level at the time. During the period of rapid recovery in hog production, the recoverability of each province was very strong due to the industrial structure, culling rate, economic level, and resource carrying capacity at that time. During the reasonable adjustment period of hog production capacity, the recoverability based on the breeding sow inventory in 13 provinces, including Henan, Shandong, and other large hog-breeding provinces, was negative due to the scale level, slaughter rate, per capita consumption, and resource carrying at that time. Taking measures to enhance the resilience of the hog industry, strengthen the prevention and control of hog epidemics, improve the monitoring and early warning mechanisms, and enhance the ability of the hog industry to cope with major animal epidemics is recommended.

AB  - Simple Summary Liaoning cashmere goat is a world-famous cashmere goat breed known for its stable genetic performance and high cashmere yield. This study investigated the relationship between certain body measurements, body weight, and cashmere yield in Liaoning cashmere goats using stepwise and factor score analyses in a multiple regression analysis. These results provide a standardized regression equation and reliable information on multiple trait considerations that should be taken to improve cashmere yield. To clarify the relationship and influence among the body circumference, body weight, and cashmere yield of Liaoning cashmere goat, aiming to provide the basis for the breed selection and germplasm identification of Liaoning cashmere goat. Liaoning cashmere goat is a well-known local cashmere goat breed in China and even in the world. It is famous for producing cashmere with superior quality and high yield. Cashmere yield, body measurements, and body weight are the primary indicators of cashmere goat breeding, but the correlation between them is not yet clear. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between certain body measurements, body weight, and cashmere yield in Liaoning cashmere goats using stepwise and factor score analyses in a multiple regression analysis. For this purpose, the body measurements (body slanting length (BSL), body height (BH), chest circumference (CC), pipe circumference (PC), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), hip breadth (HB), body weight (BW) and cashmere yield (CY)) of 200 (2-year-old) Liaoning cashmere goats were collected. Stepwise analysis of the results showed that body weight had the greatest direct effect on cashmere yield, followed by hip breadth, while chest circumference mainly affected cashmere yield indirectly. The results of factor score analysis showed that the independent variable can be represented by two factors, which explained 49.596% and 12.095% of the total variance, respectively. The factor scores used in the regression analysis explained 75.8% of the total variance in Liaoning cashmere yield. The above studies show that the growth traits of Liaoning cashmere goats are closely related to the cashmere yield. Growth traits should be considered important factors in breed selection, germplasm identification, and rearing.

AB  - Environmentally acquired chemical camouflage is a phenomenon, where a plant growing close to a strong volatile organic compound (VOC) emitter will adsorb and re-emit the VOCs produced by the neighbouring plant. The re-emitted volatile bouquet may resemble more the VOC composition of the neighbour than plant's own typical odour, and thus act as chemical camouflage against insect detection, potentially simultaneously providing associational resistance towards herbivory. We exposed a pest-sensitive horticultural crop, Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli) cv. Lucky, to the volatiles emitted by Rhododendron tomentosum [RT] twigs and assessed the host selection by ovipositing females and larval instars of the major caterpillar pest Pieris brassicae between RT-exposed and control plants. Potential impact of RT exposure on herbivore natural enemies was studied using behavioural tests with a parasitoid wasp Cotesia glomerata. P. brassicae females laid significantly less eggs and egg clusters were fewer on RT-exposed plants at both night-time (6 degrees C) and daytime (22 degrees C) temperatures. Larvae preferred leaves from control plants over RT-exposed plants at both temperatures. Preceding RT-exposure did not disturb orientation of parasitoid wasp Cotesia glomerata females towards B. oleracea plants damaged by its host P. brassicae. However, host-damaged control plants were favoured by the parasitoid over RT-exposed, host-damaged plants. Our results suggest that companion plant based chemical camouflage as a mechanism of pest suppression could be developed as an additional tool for the integrated pest management toolbox in agriculture.

AB  - Introduction The escalating threat posed by Aphis punicae to Punica granatum cultivation underscores the urgent need for sustainable, ecologically sound alternatives to chemical pesticides. This study employs a non-targeted analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by aphid-infested pomegranate (AIP), undergoing multitrophic interactions with natural enemies (Coccinella undecimpunctata) and mutualistic protectors (Tapinoma magnum). These VOCs are hypothesized to function as early biochemical markers of pest stress and semiochemical cues guiding insect behavior, offering potential integration into decision-support tools within integrated pest management (IPM) frameworks.Methods VOCs were non-destructively collected using open-loop stripping and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry under a metabolomics approach. Profiling was conducted across four ecological scenarios through integrated in-situ experimentation: (G1) AIP, (G2) AIP with ants, (G3) AIP with ants and ladybirds (24h), and (G4) AIP with ants and ladybirds (48h). Principal component analysis and heatmap clustering revealed scenario-specific VOC fingerprints.Results In the two-trophic AIP system, early plant stress responses included suppressed emissions of beta-farnesene and methyl salicylate, alongside elevated levels of caryophyllene, a compound often associated with herbivore activity. At 24h, under a tritrophic interaction, 4-heptanone, a key ant pheromone, was detected, suggesting a role in interspecies signaling or predator deterrence. After 48h, in the quadripartite trophic interaction, VOCs such as 1-ethyl-3-methylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, and 1-methyl-1H-imidazole became dominant, likely reflecting aphid-induced signaling affecting multitrophic dynamics. In the same interaction, elevated levels of six herbivore-induced plant volatiles (6-HIPVs), methyl salicylate, beta-caryophyllene, sabinene, limonene, pentadecane, and heptadecane, were observed, supporting indirect plant defense by attracting natural enemies. Bioassays showed that C. undecimpunctata exhibited significantly higher attraction to the mixture of 6-HIPVs compared to individual treatments with methyl salicylate or beta-caryophyllene. The mixture elicited the highest behavioral response, indicating a synergistic effect among volatiles and supporting their role in enhancing predator attraction.Discussion To transition from discovery to application, future research should focus on targeted analysis, compound-specific bioassays, optimized delivery systems, and open-field trials. Assessing these VOCs under varying agroecological conditions, along with evaluating economic feasibility, scalability, and regulatory pathways. This approach will be crucial for translating this chemical ecology framework into effective, climate-resilient IPM strategies tailored to the arid agroecosystems of the Taif and similar environments.

AB  - Aim. One of the important tasks in solving the problem of improving the efficiency of sheep breeding is the rational use of fodder lands in the North Caucasus and the South of Russia, a significant part of which is located in different natural and climatic conditions. The complexity of solutions lies in insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of farm animals, in particular sheep, to the ecological and geographical features of these regions. The purpose of this research was to study the genetic polymorphism of genes, the degree of genetic variability and immune status in sheep of different breeds, since genetic polymorphism is a measure of its adaptability and the hematopoietic function of blood is the basis of the life of the organism.
   Material and Methods. The genetic structure of the GH/Hae III, GDF9/AsplEI genes and immune status, was studied by the methods of genetic-statistical and immune analysis in sheep of different breeds kept in different climatic zones of Dagestan and the Krasnodar Territory.
   Results. As a result of DNA genotyping of the studied samples of sheep of different breeds, it was found that polymorphism of GH/HaeIII, GDWAsplEI genes is represented by three genotype variants: homozygous GH/HaeIII(AA), GH/HaeIII(BB); GDF9/AsplEI(AA), GDF9/AsplEI(GG); heterozygous GH/HaeIII(AB); GDF9/AsplEI(AG) and two alleles: A and B - of the GH/HaeIII gene; A and G - GDF9/AsplEI gene with different frequency of occurrence, respectively.
   Conclusion. For the first time, genetic variability has been studied in the context of the immune status of sheep populations of different breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and Krasnodar Territory. The information obtained about the role of the degree of genetic variability and the immune status of sheep of different breeds is answered in the formation of adaptive-compensatory mechanisms to specific conditions of the breeding environment. A deeper study of the adaptive characteristics of sheep of different breeds for their further improvement allows the use of molecular genetic and hematological methods.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find out the cause of copper deficiency in the Yudong black goats by investigating the mineral content of their habitat. We found that the root cause of this phenomenon was selenium deficiency in the habitat soil and then discovered ways to alleviate this symptom. This is extremely beneficial for further research on copper deficiency diseases in Yudong black goats. Due to the degradation of pasture and strict restrictions on grazing ranges in recent years, copper (Cu) deficiency in Yudong black goats has been occurring, mainly manifested as emaciation, anemia, loss of appetite and lack of spirit. To explore the main causes of Cu deficiency in Yudong black goats, 40 black goats (1 year old, 25.11 +/- 0.52 kg) were selected for this experiment; among them, 20 Yudong black goats with Cu deficiency from the experimental pasture were used as the experimental group, and 20 healthy Yudong black goats from the control pasture were used as the control group. In the pre-experiment, the mineral contents of the soil, forage, blood, and liver of black goats in both groups were determined, and in formal experiments, blood hematological, biochemical, antioxidant, and hemorheological parameters were analyzed. An experiment on the treatment of Cu deficiency in black goats was also conducted. This study showed that selenium (Se) levels in the soil, forage, blood, and liver from the experimental group were significantly lower than those from the control group (p < 0.01). The content of sulfur (S) in the forage was considerably higher than that of the control group (p < 0.01). The contents of Cu in the blood and liver from the experimental group were significantly lower than that from the control group (p < 0.01), and the content of S was considerably higher than that from the control group (p < 0.01). The blood hematology of the experimental group was affected, as evidenced by a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit value, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The immunity and antioxidant capacity of black goats in the experiment group were impaired to varying degrees, with significant decreases in ceruloplasmin, immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and substantial increases in malondialdehyde. In addition, the experimental group showed a decrease in blood viscosity as evidenced by the rise in high shear viscosity, low shear viscosity, erythrocyte rigidity index, erythrocyte aggregation index, and erythrocyte deformation index, and a decrease in plasma viscosity. In the treatment experiment, oral administration of copper sulfate solution was carried out on 10 black goats with Cu deficiency. All the Cu deficiency goats were cured, and the Cu content in their bodies rebounded. In summary, low Se soil caused an increase in S content in the forage, and Yudong black goats feeding on high S forage resulted in a decrease in Cu absorption, which led to a secondary Cu deficiency.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with cerebral amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau pathologies, but whether and how these factors differentially disrupt neural circuits remains unclear. Here, we investigated the vulnerability of memory and emotional circuits to A beta and tau pathologies in mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau or both APP/Tau in excitatory neurons. APP/Tau mice develop age- and sex-dependent A beta and phosphorylated tau pathologies, the latter exacerbated at early stages, in vulnerable brain regions. Early memory deficits were associated with hippocampal tau pathology in Tau and APP/Tau mice, whereas anxiety and fear appeared linked to intracellular A beta in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of APP and APP/Tau mice. Transcriptome hippocampal profiling revealed gene changes affecting myelination and RNA processing in Tau mice, and inflammation and synaptic-related pathways in APP/Tau mice at 6 months. At 9 months, we detected common and region-specific changes in astrocytic, microglia and 63 AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and BLA of APP/Tau mice. Spatial learning deficits were associated with synaptic tau accumulation and synapse disruption in the hippocampus of Tau and APP/Tau mice, whereas emotional disturbances were linked to A beta pathology but not synaptic tau in the BLA. Interestingly, A beta and tau exhibited synergistic detrimental effects in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus but they counteract with each other to mitigate LTP impairments in the amygdala. These findings indicate that A beta and tau pathologies cause region-specific effects and synergize to induce synaptic dysfunction and immune responses, contributing to the differing vulnerability of memory and emotional neural circuits in AD.

AB  - Context Asian elephant numbers are declining across much of their range driven largely by serious threats from land use change resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation. Myanmar, holding critical range for the species, is undergoing major developments due to recent sociopolitical changes. To effectively manage and conserve the remaining populations of endangered elephants in the country, it is crucial to understand their ranging behavior. Objectives Our objectives were to (1) estimate the sizes of dry, wet, and annual ranges of wild elephants in Myanmar; and quantify the relationship between dry season (the period when human-elephant interactions are the most likely to occur) range size and configurations of agriculture and natural vegetation within the range, and (2) evaluate how percentage of agriculture within dry core range (50% AKDE range) of elephants relates to their daily distance traveled. Methods We used autocorrelated kernel density estimator (AKDE) based on a continuous-time movement modeling (ctmm) framework to estimate dry season (26 ranges from 22 different individuals), wet season (12 ranges from 10 different individuals), and annual range sizes (8 individuals), and reported the 95%, 50% AKDE, and 95% Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) range sizes. We assessed how landscape characteristics influenced range size based on a broad array of 48 landscape metrics characterizing aspects of vegetation, water, and human features and their juxtaposition in the study areas. To identify the most relevant landscape metrics and simplify our candidate set of informative metrics, we relied on exploratory factor analysis and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Based on this analysis we adopted a final set of metrics into our regression analysis. In a multiple regression framework, we developed candidate models to explain the variation in AKDE dry season range sizes based on the previously identified, salient metrics of landscape composition. Results Elephant dry season ranges were highly variable averaging 792.0 km(2) and 184.2 km(2) for the 95% and 50% AKDE home ranges, respectively. We found both the shape and spatial configuration of agriculture and natural vegetation patches within an individual elephant's range play a significant role in determining the size of its range. We also found that elephants are moving more (larger energy expenditure) in ranges with higher percentages of agricultural area. Conclusion Our results provide baseline information on elephant spatial requirements and the factors affecting them in Myanmar. This information is important for advancing future land use planning that takes into account space-use requirements for elephants. Failing to do so may further endanger already declining elephant populations in Myanmar and across the species' range.

AB  - Peanut yield and quality are often threatened by soil degradation under continuous cropping. Biochar has been known to improve the soil microbial community and plant resistance. However, studies on its functions to reduce soil degradation losses and improve the peanut yield are limited. A field peanut experiment was conducted in an Alfisol soil and biochar was applied at a rate of 20 t ha-1 in 2022. The biochar was prepared from woodchip (WB) and maize straw (MB) feedstocks alone, as well as with co-composted biochar of the same feedstocks with pig manure labeled as WBSC and MBSC amendment, respectively. The conventional organic manure was applied as a control treatment (OM). All plots were base-fertilized with a mineral compound fertilizer of N-P2O5-K2O (16-16-16, %) at 600 kg ha-1. Topsoil (20 cm) and plant samples were collected at the time of peanut harvest. Soil quality, enzyme function, peanut growth traits, microbial abundance, and community composition were analyzed. Compared to OM, peanut yields increased by 22%, 23%, and 18% under WB, WBSC, and MBSC, respectively. The content of oleic acid increased by 4-5%, while the content of linoleic acid decreased by 7-9%, respectively, under biochar-compost treatments. However, biochar amendment alone showed non-significant changes in these fatty acids. The soil extracellular enzyme activity increased by 3.7-5.5% with biochar amendments and 6.4-10.1% with biochar-compost application. The enzyme activity ratio of hydrolase to non-hydrolase, of C cycling to N cycling, and of P cycling increased by 11.4-15.9%, 20.9-33.8%, and 14.7-23.5% under biochar amendments and by 20.5-25.0%, 17.4-39.0%, and 23.5-32.3% under biochar-compost, respectively. Overall, crop residue biochar enhanced peanut yield and quality by improving soil aggregation, enzyme functionality, and fungal community in line with the soil nutrient supply.

AB  - The resource-oriented utilization of agricultural solid wastes as biochar is eco-friendly and cost-effective, but the application of biochar for Cd-polluted soil remediation hindered by their efficiency and complicated field condition. This study used three types of raw materials i.e. oil tea (Camellia oleifera Abel) shell, reed straw, and urban sludge to prepare pyrolysis biochar. Meanwhile, a Cd highly resistant Proteus mirabilis Ch8 isolated from Robinia pseudoacacia L. rhizosphere was immobilized to form a biochar-bacteria composite for the remediation of Cd-polluted soil. The pyrolysis configurations and adsorption curves were studied and sludge biochar prepared at 700 degrees C was the most suitable for Cd adsorption which could be further accelerated to 79.97 mg g(-1) Cd adsorption concentration as sludge biochar-bacteria composite (CHB). After CHB treated the rhizosphere of R. pseudoacacia L. under Cd stress soil, it was shown that the CHB could synergistically (E-value > 0) enhance the Cd root enrichment level (BCF = 3.21), while soil Cd availability decreased by 78%, showing effective soil remediation potential. Further plant growth parameters indicated that plant biomass and photosynthesis level increased up to 2.25 and 2.34 folds compared to the untreated control. In addition, CHB largely improved the rhizosphere bacterial community diversity and functional species, with 13 types of rhizobia that might have N-fixing and growth promoting effects on plants. The study thoroughly explored how biochar interacts with microorganisms to improve Cd adsorption, enhance soil quality, and promote plant growth. By coupling biochar preparation configurations with enhanced Cd soil remediation efficiency, the study connects the utilization of waste biomass with the restoration of heavy metal. This highlights the potential of integrated biological and carbon-based technologies to address global environmental challenges.

AB  - Climate change has profound implications for the distribution of suitable habitats for woody species. In this study, we assessed the optimal distribution thresholds for twelve woody species on the Loess Plateau using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, incorporating sample points of tree species alongside relevant environmental variables. We analyzed the sustainability of potentially suitable zones and proposed a framework for selecting a regulatory model to establish the most suitable creation zones in response to future climate change. The results indicated that: (1) The distributions potentially suitable for Platycladus orientalis and Pinus tabuliformis were predominantly influenced by mean annual temperatures, whereas Pinus armandii and Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata exhibited optimal conditions at temperatures around -4 degrees C. Both Hippophae rhamnoides and Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii had suitable threshold precipitation levels exceeding 200 mm, with optimal thresholds surpassing 250 mm. (2) Most high-suitability zones for woody species across various future climate scenarios were primarily located in southern regions, including examples such as Betula platyphylla Sukaczev, Platycladus orientalis, Pinus sylvestris var. mongholica. Some of these high-suitability areas displayed insular and linear distributions, notably Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii, Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata, Salix cheilophila. (3) There was no southward shift in the northern boundary of the sustainability zones for any woody species across the different scenarios. Betula platyphylla and Salix babylonica exhibited the broadest distribution of sustainability zones. (4) The most suitable areas for the establishment of woody species were primarily found in the western, southern, and eastern regions, whereas the northern and central areas were less favorable for tree growth. Among the scenarios analyzed, SSP585 presents the most extensive distribution area. This study is expected to improve the distribution structure of woody species and the implementation of management policies.

AB  - Context. Electrical devices and power systems are the sources of EM-waves which propagate everywhere in the environment. Aims. The study aimed to determine whether EMF induced changes in the steroidogenesis of conceptuses and whether progesterone (P-4) may be a possible protectant against the effects of EMF radiation. Methods, The entire porcine conceptuses were collected during the peH-implantation period (days 15-16 of pregnancy), divided into fragments (100 mg) and treated in vitro with EMF (50 Hz or 120 Hz, 2 or 4 h exposure), and examined to determine of CYP17A1, HSD381, CYP19A3, and HSD1784 m RNA transcript and encoded protein abundance and the release of steroid hormones. Selected fragments of conceptuses were treated with P-4. Key results. In conceptuses incubated without P-4, EMF at 120 Hz decreased androstenedione (A(4)) and testosterone (T) release after 2 h and increased oestrone (E-1) release at 50 Hz and 120 Hz after 4 h exposure. In P-4-treated conceptuses, EMF (50 and 120 Hz, 4 h exposure) decreased CYP19A3 mRNA transcript abundance, and increased (120 Hz, 2 h exposure) oestradiol-17 beta (E-2) release. Conclusions. The EMF radiation alters androgen and oestrogen synthesis and release from the conceptuses of pigs during the peH-implantation period. The P-4 exerts protective effects on androgens and E-1 release but it sensitises the conceptuses when comes to the mechanism of oestrogen synthesis and release during EMF radiation.

AB  - Simple Summary This study evaluated the effects of Lonicera japonica and Radix Puerariae crude extracts as feed additives on finishing pigs. The results indicated diets supplemented with L. japonica and Radix Puerariae crude extracts improved growth performance, abundance of beneficial bacteria in feces, and digestibility of crude protein and total phosphorus in finishing pigs. These results suggest that Lonicera japonica and Radix Puerariae crude extracts could be a good feed additives for finishing pigs feeding. This study aims to investigate the influence of adding Lonicera japonica (L. japonica) and Radix Puerariae crude extracts and their mixture to the diet of finishing pigs on their fecal microbes and nutrient apparent digestibility. A total of 72 healthy Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred barrows without significant differences in body weight (93 +/- 2 kg) were selected and randomly divided into four groups (18 in each group). Three replicate pens per group (six pigs per pen) were used, and two pigs were evaluated for each pen. The groups were fed the following diets: control group (CON), basic diet; chlorogenic acid group (CGA group), basic diet + 1 kg/ton L. japonica crude extract; Pueraria flavonoid group (PF group), basic diet + 1 kg/ton Radix Puerariae crude extract; and mix group (Mix group), basic diet + 0.5 kg/ton L. japonica crude extract + 0.5 kg/ton Radix Puerariae crude extract. The following results were obtained: (1) At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria, Fibrobaeteres, and Kiritimatiellaeota were the main components of the fecal microbiota (top 5); the relative abundance of bacteria from phyla Firmicutes significantly increased in the Mix group than in the CON group (p < 0.05). At the genus level, Treponema_2, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, uncultured_bacterium_f_Lachnospiraceae, uncultured_bacterium_f_Prevotellaceae, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group were the main components of the fecal microbiota (top 5); the relative abundance of bacteria from genus Lactobacillus significantly increased in the Mix group than in the CON group (p < 0.05). Chao1 and Ace counts were significantly higher in group CGA than in the CON group and group Mix (p < 0.05). The alpha and beta diversities and the relative abundance of fecal microbes were higher in all test groups than in the CON group. (2) The protein digestibility was significantly higher in the CGA and PF groups than in the CON group, and the TP digestibility was significantly higher in the CGA than in the CON and Mix groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Lonicera japonica and Radix Puerariae crude extract supplementation in the diet significantly changed fecal microbiota and improved the protein and TP digestibility of finishing pigs.

AB  - The role of secondary metabolites (SMs) in Amaranthus plant defense is a poorly studied field. Different cultivars of amaranth have shown varying degrees of susceptibility to insect attack in the field, and previous research has discussed the potential role of these compounds as insect phagodeterrents. In this study, we measured the content of five hydroxybenzoic acids, three hydroxycinnamic acids, and three flavonoids in 30-days-old undamaged plants, over two consecutive years. In addition, we examined the impact of SM content in the leaves of amaranth cultivars on food preference and the rate of plant tissue utilization by the generalist insect Spodoptera frugiperda. In the first year, experiments were conducted using two cultivars: A. cruentus (1) and A. mantegazzianus (1), while the second-year experiments included three cultivars of A. hypochondriacus (a total of five cultivars). Our results showed that, under identical growth conditions and in the absence of stress, flavonoid content emerged as the most consistent trait for distinguishing between cultivars, with rutin being the key variable accounting for the observed variability. In contrast, the contents of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids exhibited significant variability among cultivars and between years. Additionally, we observed that high concentrations of phenolic acids in plant tissue correlated with lower rates of food utilization by S. frugiperda, without affecting preference indices. The potential defensive capabilities of these SMs for mitigating insect herbivory damage in amaranth crops are discussed in this work.

AB  - The relative contributions of adaptation and genetic drift to morphological diversification of the skulls of echolocating mammals were investigated using two horseshoe bat species, Rhinolophus simulator and R. cf. simulator, as test cases. We used 3D geometric morphometrics to compare the shapes of skulls of the two lineages collected at various localities in southern Africa. Size and shape variation was predominantly attributed to selective forces; the between-population variance (B) was not proportional to the within-population variance (W). Modularity was evident in the crania of R. simulator but absent in the crania of R. cf. simulator and the mandibles of both species. The skulls of the two lineages thus appeared to be under different selection pressures, despite the overlap in their distributions. Difference in the crania of R. cf. simulator was centered largely on the nasal dome region of R. cf. simulator but on the cranium and mandibles of R. simulator. It is likely that the size and shape of the nasal dome, which acts as a frequency-dependent acoustic horn, is more crucial in R. cf. simulator than in R. simulator because of the higher echolocation frequencies used by R. cf. simulator. A larger nasal dome in R. cf. simulator would allow the emission of higher intensity pulses, resulting in comparable detection distances to that of R. simulator. In contrast, selection pressure is probably more pronounced on the mandibles and cranium of R. simulator to compensate for the loss in bite force because of its elongated rostrum. The predominance of selection probably reflects the stringent association between environment and the optimal functioning of phenotypic characters associated with echolocation and feeding in bats.

AB  - In Africa, most protected forests are in densely human-dominated landscapes where human-wildlife conflict is intense. We documented farmer perceptions and responses to crop-raiding wildlife from Kibale National Park, Uganda. Crop raiding was mostly (95%) by baboons (Papio anubis) and elephants (Loxodonta africana). While the financial loss caused by baboons and elephants did not differ, elephants were perceived as more damaging. Guarding and trenches were perceived as the most effective deterrent strategies for baboons and elephants, respectively. Distance from the park boundary and household income were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of crop raiding. Distance from the park, household head age and the species that raided crops, influenced whether a household applied one or more deterrent strategies. Households headed by women or older adults were most vulnerable, experiencing greater losses to raiding. Patterns of human-wildlife conflict around Kibale forest are complex, but the extent of crop damage was mostly determined by distance from the park and farm socio-economic status and thus their ability to mitigate or deter raiding. Managing crop raiding requires collaboration between the park and affected farmers to ensure that mutually managed deterrent methods, such as trenching (elephants) and guarding (baboons), are effectively shared, applied and maintained.

AB  - The recognition of pig cough sounds is an effective way to monitor pig respiratory diseases which seriously affect healthy pig breeding. Due to the complexity of the pig-housing environment, achieving high precision cough recognition by relying only on a single feature or classifier is challenging. Therefore, in this study we investigated two fusion strategies, namely feature fusion and classifier fusion, to boost classification accuracy. For feature fusion, we improved the previously proposed feature fusion algorithm and selected better acoustic and image features for fusion. We also proposed a novel classifier fusion algorithm. In the algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained by the acoustic features and deep features were fused by soft voting for pig cough prediction. The sound data collected in the pig barn were used to validate the proposed methods. Our methods achieved a substantial classification rate of 97.47% and 99.20% for feature fusion and classifier fusion, respectively. The results demonstrate that our proposed fusion strategies can significantly improve the recognition accuracy of pig cough sounds.

AB  - Every year, the consumer demand for the quality of food products grows, and the question of the safety of feed components used to make animal food gains importance. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of guar meal, with different protein shares supplied in a diet, on the values of selected biochemical indices of dehydrated blood and liver of pigs. The pigs were divided into four groups. The animals in control group (1) were fed a diet containing soybean protein (SBM) as the main protein source. In the diets for experimental groups 2, 3 and 4, SBM protein was replaced with guar meal protein at 25%, 50% and 75% respectively. The material for the study came from 24 crossbred pigs that were fed the selected diets for 92 days. One week before expected slaughter, blood was drawn for biochemical analyses from the pigs in all groups. The use of a different protein source had no significant influence on changes in the investigated biochemical parameters in the blood of fattening pigs from the different experimental groups. The pigs were slaughtered accor-ding to the usual procedure in meat plants. Immediately after slaughter, sections of the liver were taken during carcass cutting. For the prepared specimens, a morphological assessment of the examined liver samples was made. Based on the investigations carried out and the results obtained, it can be concluded that the use of 50% and 75% guar meal protein as a substitute for SBM protein has negative effects on the pig organism. Most of the morphological changes were found in the livers of animals fed diets with a higher content of guar meal protein. The results of the study thus show that an evaluation of the biochemical indices in serum alone does not provide a complete picture of all changes in the organism of pigs under the influence of guar protein; only in combination with the results of the morphological examinations of the internal organs do they provide complete information about the health status of the animals.

AB  - Parasitic diseases are a major challenge for livestock in warm climates, causing significant economic losses, particularly in young animals. Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are highly prevalent, prompting us to investigate factors affecting the prevalence of endoparasites in pre-weaning calves in a warm, humid climate in Mexico. Fecal samples were analyzed to assess fecal egg count (FEC) dynamics and endoparasite prevalence. The prevalence of trematodes (Fasciola hepatica and paramphistomids) was determined on 12 beef cattle farms in the rainy season from May to September 2022 and July to November 2023. Nematode prevalence was monitored on four farms during 2022 and 2023. In addition, on one farm, the FEC was compared between dewormed and untreated groups. Coprocultures were conducted to obtain third-stage larvae for species identification based on morphology. The prevalence of F. hepatica was 12 % (77/640), while paramphistomids had a prevalence of 20.5 % (131/640). Trichostrongylids showed a prevalence exceeding 30 %, with maximum values reaching 93 %. The predominant species identified from coprocultures were Cooperia spp., Oesophagostomum spp., and Haemonchus spp. Dewormed calves exhibited similar nematode eggs per gram of feces (EPG) to the untreated group, and nematode EPG in calves tended to decrease with age. In conclusion, age, sex, and farm management practices influence the prevalence of nematodes and trematodes. Nematode prevalence exceeded 30 % for most of the year, while trematode prevalence ranged from 12 % to 20 %.

AB  - Peatlands represent an important part of the landscape of boreal western Canada, occupying some 365,157 km2. Sixty-three percent of these are minerogenous fens. Scattered among these fens are landscape features that have unique and distinctive patterns-pools and carpets (flarks) separated by raised linear 'strings'. These patterned fens harbor rare and uncommon species and serve as habitats for endangered wildlife (e.g., woodland caribou, whooping cranes). In this study, utilizing Google Earth Pro (1) we documented 1083 ribbed fens and 250 reticulate fens in the province of Alberta, Canada; (2) determined the regional variation in patterned fen occurrences; (3) described the various morphological forms of patterned fens; and (4) recognized these as six distinctive peatland site-types. Patterned fens are not randomly arranged on the landscape. Ribbed fens are concentrated on regional high elevational uplands and montane benchlands with morainal deposits, while reticulate fens are more numerous on low elevation plains with glacial-fluvial and glacial-lacustrine deposits. Patterned fens vary along minerotrophic vegetation and chemical gradients and have a complex set of morphological types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides base line information on the abundance and distribution of patterned fens in Alberta and associates morphological patterned fen types with environmental or geological characteristics. The digital files and maps provide a permanent record against which future change can be compared.

AB  - In the Western U.S., the prescribed burning of woody biomass in forests, mainly harvest slash, is the prevailing practice for in-woods fuel reduction and wildfire mitigation. Though these prescribed burns play an essential role in mitigating the wildfire risks, the resultant emission is a major air pollutants source that adversely affects air quality, negatively impacting human health. With an increased need for fire hazard reduction thinning, coupled with shrinking regional demand for lower quality biomass (pulpwood, hog-fuel, etc.), the volumes of unused biomass left on the forest floor as 'waste' will continue to grow. Reducing prescribed burns by utilizing this 'waste' biomass for alternate bio-based solutions (like bio-energy or bio-char) will enhance the economic feasibility of much-needed thinning operations and reduce uncontrolled emissions and related environmental and local health impacts.& nbsp;In this study, we simulate the increase in air pollutants due to additional prescribed fires in the Southwestern part of Washington State. Using the 'BlueSky smoke modeling system,' the study estimated the emissions associated with burning additional 726,000 dry t of residual biomass, which corresponds to a 30% increment from 2011. The burn was simulated over 29 days of the fall quarter and subsequently incorporated into the AIRPACT pollution transportation modeling system using the 2011 air quality and meteorological data as the baseline. The results showed that the ambient PM2.5 concentrations, due to the simulated pile burns, exceeded EPA's air quality standards on multiple days and in various locations across the Western part of the state, with two days reaching "very unhealthy " levels and one day reaching "hazardous " levels. By layering the census data on top of the pollution concentration data, the model estimated that, over the 29-day burn period, approximately 440,000 additional human days would be affected by higher than the EPA air-quality standards for ambient PM2.5 levels.

AB  - Many plant species are widely distributed and consequently are exposed to multiple abiotic factors and diverse herbivores, each of which may distinctly affect the magnitude of different defense traits. Alternative theories for optimal allocation to plant defense traits predict both positive and negative associations between magnitude of defense and resource availability. These predictions may apply even within species. This suggests potential for a single species' patterns of association of defense traits and resources to vary with both the type of defense and identity of resource, but relatively few studies have explored intraspecific variation in multiple defense traits along several resource gradients simultaneously. In order to address this gap, especially in an ecosytem dominated by large mammalian herbivores, we assessed relationships between multiple resources (rainfall, soil N, and soil P) and plant defense traits (prickle density, phenolics, and lignin content) using a widely distributed tropical savanna herb, Solanum incanum, growing in naturally occuring resource gradients within the Serengeti National Park. We found substantial intraspecific variation in all three defense traits across sites (n = 43). Variation in prickle density was positively associated with rainfall and soil P, but not soil N. In contrast to prickle density, phenolics and lignin were uncorrelated with all three resource gradients. This independent association of soil P with a carbon-based defense, prickle density, suggests potential for resources that are not components of defenses to influence allocation to defense traits. Such influence may reflect association between resource and herbivore abundance and/or preference. These varied patterns in resource-defense associations further emphasize the tremendous variation in anti-herbivore traits which may be influenced by different plant resources and highlight the need to consider multiple resource gradients in understanding evolution of plant traits.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) pollution in environment is toxic to birds. This study aimed to assess antagonistic effect of honokiol (HNK) on Cd-induced quail (Coturnix japonica) liver tissue damage and Cd-induced vacuolation in hepatocytes. We found that HNK alleviated Cd-induced liver pathological damage marked by elevated serum liver biochemical indica-tors, disordered antioxidant levels and trace elements in quails. HNK reduced Cd-induced liver cell apoptosis as assessed by western blotting and TUNEL staining. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes under transmission electron micro-scope revealed that Cd induced mitochondrial damage in addition to abnormal enlargement and increased vacuolar structure of cells. Mitochondrial damage and vacuolization were reduced in the HNK + Cd group. Cd induced an increase in the levels of endosomal/lysosomal-related genes, while HNK treatment reversed this effect. Finally, we demonstrated that vacuolation in buffalo rat liver 3A (BRL 3A) cells occurred primarily due to Cd-induced oxidative stress damage that reduces mitochondrial ATP content and indirectly led to dysfunction of ATP-dependent lipid kinase PIKfyve complex. In summary, we are the first to report that Cd induces abnormal enlargement of endosome/ lysosomes in quail liver cells and HNK alleviated this phenomenon by reducing mitochondrial damage and increasing intracellular ATP level. This study demonstrated the toxic effect of Cd pollution on birds and how HNK mitigated these effect at the cellular level. Overall, more research on Cd pollution and HNK use in animal husbandry is warranted.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The traditional sheep feeding system in Inner Mongolia, based on pasture grazing, is gradually transforming into a semi-grazing plus supplementation or feedlot approach, as grassland ecological protection becomes increasingly important. The fatty acid composition of the animals' tissues changes with transformation of the feeding system. However, the changes to blood fatty acid metabolites in sheep as a result of alterations to the feeding regimen are unknown. In this study, pasture feeding, pasture feeding plus corn supplementation, and barn feeding were carried out to explore the effects of feeding regimens on blood fatty acid composition and metabolic pathways of sheep using a metabolomic approach. The results revealed that compared to grazing, concentrate supplement feeding regimens, including either grazing plus supplements or feeding indoors, down-regulated blood n-3 PUFA biosynthesis and up-regulated blood inflammatory compound metabolism by n-6 PUFA. These data suggest that under different feeding regimens, an appropriate ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA in ruminant diets will contribute to increasingly high-quality animal production and improved immunocompetence.
   Feeding regimens influence the fatty acid composition of animal-derived products. However, there is limited information on the effect of feeding regimens on the blood fatty acid composition and metabolic pathways of ruminant animals. In this study, 30 Wujumqin sheep were randomly assigned to three groups, PF (pasture feeding), PSF (pasture feeding plus corn supplementation) and BF (barn feeding), to examine the effects of feeding regimens on blood fatty acid composition and metabolic pathways through a metabolomic approach. The results showed that the BF sheep had increased serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids levels, while the PF and PSF sheep had increased serum n-3 PUFA levels. Compared to the BF and PSF sheep that were fed ground corn, the PF sheep that only ate natural grass had up-regulated serum DHA levels. Meanwhile, blood metabolites from linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, including pro-inflammatory products (20-HETE, LTs, TX etc.) and anti-inflammatory products (LXB4, DHETs, HPETEs etc.) were elevated in the BF group. It was found that, compared to grazing, concentrate supplement feeding regimens, including either grazing plus supplements or feeding indoors, down-regulated blood n-3 PUFA biosynthesis and up-regulated the blood inflammatory compound metabolism by n-6 PUFA.

AB  - Increasing incidences of fatty liver in humans and animals worldwide is the leading cause of liver related morbidities. Currently, in the face of the growing global increase in fatty liver, and the necessity to explore new factors significantly affecting it, aquaporins (AQPs) have become the focus of interest for many researchers. AQPs are membrane integral proteins involved in the transport of water, glycerol and other small solutes. These are expressed in all tissues and play multiple roles under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Despite ongoing advancements in understanding the involvement of aquaporins in metabolic processes, there remains a notable lack of knowledge concerning cellular and subcellular localization of the AQPs in bovine tissues and organs. Understanding this could provide a new therapeutic target for metabolic syndromes such as fatty liver disease in bovine. In this study, AQPs in bovine liver, adipose tissue and gall bladder are examined using immunohistochemistry. AQP9 immunoreactivity is predominantly detected at the sinusoidal surfaces of hepatocytes. AQP8 is mostly intracellular and localized to the central vein and sinusoid, whereas AQP7 is found around the portal vein. Notably, AQP3 is observed in the bovine gall bladder and adipose tissue but not in the liver. In adipose tissue, AQP7 is also detected in the cytoplasmic membranes of adipocytes. AQPs in liver and adipose tissue were also studied using the western blotting technique. Higher AQP9 and AQP3 expression is observed in the liver and adipose tissue, respectively, indicating they are the dominant aquaporins in these tissues. This suggests they could be potential therapeutic targets for treating fatty liver disease and other metabolic disorders in bovine.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging environmental pollutants that pose a significant threat to wildlife within forest ecosystems. However, the quantity and types of MPs in wildlife forest habitats remain unclear. This study is the first to assess the distribution of MPs in the Amur tiger habitat of northeast China. Our results showed that MPs were detected in soil, water, atmosphere, forage plants, and ungulate and top predator feces within the forest ecosystem, respectively. The average diameter of all detected MPs was 44.99 +/- 34.80 mu m. The predominant polymers found in the samples were polyamide, polyvinyl chloride, and polyurethane. Certain sample types shared similar MP polymer type distributions, indicating potential links in their sources and transfer pathways. Consequently, these findings provide some new insights on the new pollution problem in Amur tiger forest habitats and prompt us to consider how to control and manage the MPs pollution sources in the tiger conservation.

AB  - This study aimed to synthesise and interpret stable isotopic data (delta 2H and delta 18O) from various sources to understand the isotope hydrology around coal mine operations in Elk Valley, B.C., Canada. The data, including precipitation, groundwaters, seeps, and mine rock drains, were used to construct a local meteoric water line (LMWL) for the Elk Valley, evaluate the spatiotemporal isotopic composition of its groundwater, and assess mine seepage and mine rock drain discharge. The study revealed a robust LMWL relation (delta 2H = 7.4 +/- 0.2 <middle dot> delta 18O - 4.3 +/- 4.1). The groundwater and seep data indicated a winter season bias and a north-south latitudinal gradient, suggesting rapid near-surface groundwater flow without significant post-precipitation evaporation. Porewater isotope samples from unsaturated mine rock piles (MRPs) showed site-specific evaporation patterns, potentially due to convective air flows or exothermic sulphide oxidation. This research revealed the influence of groundwater and meltwater on rock drain discharge. Based on evaporative mass balance calculations, MRPs seasonally contributed ca. 5 %(December base flow) and 22 % (snowmelt) to drain discharge. The findings underscore the value of stable isotope data collections in the Elk Valley to help better define and quantify the hydrology-hydrogeology, including a better understanding of evaporative conditions in MRPs.

AB  - Background Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is commonly considered as one of the most important limiting factors in the agricultural production. As a result, a large amount of N fertilizer is used to improve the yield in modern tea production. Unfortunately, the large amount of N fertilizer input has led to increased plant nitrogen-tolerance and decreased amplitude of yield improvement, which results in significant N loss, energy waste and environment pollution. However, the effects of N-deficiency on the metabolic profiles of tea leaves and roots are not well understood. Results In this study, seedlings of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze Chunlv 2 were treated with 3 mM NH4NO3 (Control) or without NH4NO3 (N-deficiency) for 4 months by sandy culture. The results suggested that N-deficiency induced tea leaf chlorosis, impaired biomass accumulation, decreased the leaf chlorophyll content and N absorption when they were compared to the Control samples. The untargeted metabolomics based on GC-TOF/MS approach revealed a discrimination of the metabolic profiles between N-deficient tea leaves and roots. The identification and classification of the altered metabolites indicated that N deficiency upregulated the relative abundances of most phenylpropanoids and organic acids, while downregulated the relative abundances of most amino acids in tea leaves. Differentially, N-deficiency induced the accumulation of most carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids in tea roots. The potential biomarkers screened in N-deficient leaves compared to Control implied that N deficiency might reduce the tea quality. Unlike the N-deficient leaves, the potential biomarkers in N-deficient roots indicated an improved stress response might occur in tea roots. Conclusions The results demonstrated N deficiency had different effects on the primary and secondary metabolism in tea leaves and roots. The findings of this study will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the N-deficient tea plants and provide a valuable reference for the optimized N nutrient management and the sustainable development in the tea plantations.

AB  - Study relevance: Vitex madiensis Oliv. is a plant widely used in traditional medicine by healers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The uses of this plant are already known and published but no toxicological investigations have been carried out on this plant to determine its safety.Aims: This study, conducted in April 2019, aimed to determine the toxicity profile of the aqueous extract of Vitex madiensis by determining its acute and sub-acute toxicities after oral administration in a male guinea pig model.Materials and Methods: For the acute toxicity, in adult guinea pigs, single oral administration of the aqueous extract of Vitex madiensis (1; 2; and 3 g/kg body weight) was administered, and general poisoning behaviors such as alopecia, abdominal bloating, weight loss, asthenia, convulsion, etc. was constantly monitored for 14 days. The oral lethal dose 50 was determined with the mortality rate by the Dragstedt and Lang method. In sub-acute toxicity, a daily single oral dose of Vitex madiensis aqueous extract 0.1 g/kg (human dose used in traditional medicine) and 1 g/kg (about the LD50) was used for 28 days.Results: The LD50 calculated was 1.4 g/kg with change in mobility behavior, weight loss, alopecia, asthenia, convulsion, and bloating of the abdomen. After 28 days of observation, the aqueous extract of Vitex madiensis induced significant changes in body weights. However, hematological, and biochemical parameters showed a significant decrease in ALT, AST, and creatinine levels suggesting disturbances of haemopoiesis, liver, and kidney functions. Conclusion: Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the aqueous leaf extract of Vitex madiensis has a moderated toxicity for single oral administration and could be dangerous for daily use of doses higher than those used in traditional medicine (0.1 g/kg). This would justify the nontoxic use of this plant under the traditional condition utilizations.(c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary In times of intensified livestock production, the search for methods that reduce stress, which has an adverse impact on the health and welfare of their animals, has become a challenge for breeders and producers. Therefore, the possibility of using various musical genres to alleviate stress in chickens, cattle or pigs was considered. It has turned out that choosing a musical item is extremely important, as it can positively affect the health and production performance of animals by increasing the feeling of relaxation. The time of exposure to sounds and their intensity are important as well, and some authors propose to also pay attention to the frequency of sound waves. Music therapy, which was previously more widely deployed among humans, is increasingly used for farm animals as an element of enriching their living environment. Current research shows the importance of sound waves' influence in animal production. Proper selection of the music genre, music intensity and tempo can reduce the adverse effects of noise and, thus, reduce the level of stress. It should be remembered, however, that silence is equally important and necessary for the welfare of animals. The paper presents literature findings regarding the influence of music on cattle, poultry and pigs. The welfare of animals, especially those kept in intensive production systems, is a priority for modern agriculture. This stems from the desire to keep animals healthy, to obtain a good-quality final product, and to meet the demands of today's consumers, who have been increasingly persuaded to buy organic products. As a result, new sound-based methods have been pursued to reduce external stress in livestock. Music therapy has been known for thousands of years, and sounds were believed to improve both body and spirit. Today, they are mostly used to distract patients from their pain, as well as to treat depression and cardiovascular disorders. However, recent studies have suggested that appropriately selected music can confer some health benefits, e.g., by increasing the level and activity of natural killer cells. For use in livestock, the choice of genre, the loudness of the music and the tempo are all important factors. Some music tracks promote relaxation (thus improving yields), while others have the opposite effect. However, there is no doubt that enriching the animals' environment with music improves their welfare and may also convince consumers to buy products from intensively farmed animals. The present paper explores the effects of music on livestock (cattle, poultry and pigs) on the basis of the available literature.

AB  - Additives are considered a promising approach to accelerate the composting process and alleviate the dissemination of pollutants to the environment. However, nearly all previous articles have focused on the impact of additive amounts on the reduction of HMs, which may not fully represent the main factor shaping HMs bioavailability status during composting. Simultaneously, previous reviews only explored the impacts, speciation, and toxicity mechanism of HMs during composting. Hence, a global-scale meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the response patterns of HMs bioavailability and compost parameters to different additives, composting duration, and composting factors (additive types, feedstock, bulking agents, and composting methods) by measuring the weighted mean values of the response ratio "[ln (RR)] " and size effect (%). The results revealed that additives significantly lessened HMs bioavailability by >= 40% in the final compost products than controls. The bioavailability decline rates were-40%,-60%,-57%,-55%,-42%, and-44% for Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Cd. Simultaneously, additives significantly improved the total nitrogen (TN) (+16%), pH (+5%), and temperature (+5%), and decreased total organic carbon (TOC) (-17%), moisture content (MC) (-18%), and C/N ratio (-19%). Furthermore, we found that the prolongation of composting time significantly promoted the effect of additives on declining HMs bioavailability (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, increasing additive amounts revealed an insignificant impact on decreasing the HMs bioavailability (p > 0.05). Eventually, using zeolite as an additive, chicken manure as feedstock, sawdust as a bulking agent, and a reactor as composting method had the most significant reduction effect on HMs bioavailability (p < 0.05). The findings of this meta-analysis may contribute to the selection, modification, and application of additives and composting factors to manage the level of bioavailable HMs in the compost products.

AB  - In the process of butt welding, achieving real-time monitoring of butt weld penetration is of great significance for improving forming quality. Currently, weld penetration detection methods based on weld pool vision are easily disturbed by arc lights. In this study, an innovative approach for butt weld penetration detection using infrared sensing and improved histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) is proposed. First, an improved HOG algorithm was studied to extract the temperature field distribution features of the welding heat-affected zone (HAZ) around the weld pool. Second, the feasibility of using the improved HOG feature to detect weld penetration was analysed, and a weld penetration detection model was established. Finally, the generalisation performance of the proposed weld penetration detection algorithm was confirmed, and the influence of the location and size of the detection area on the accuracy of the detection algorithm was analysed. The testing results indicate that the proposed detection algorithm exhibits high precision and excellent generalisation performance, and enhances the means of monitoring of butt weld penetration.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Although consumptive effects of predators have long been central to ecology, predation-risk effects have emerged as major components of predator-prey interactions. Both consumptive and predation-risk effects should vary with predator functional traits (e.g., hunting mode, gape size), where consumption rates and induction of morphological and behavioral defenses correlate with prey-specific predator threat. Ambush predators, in contrast with active predators, may face selection pressure to be cryptic to avoid detection by prey. Thus, ambush predators may change prey density through consumptive effects but have reduced or absent predationrisk effects. We performed two mesocosm experiments with free-roaming and caged predators to explore post-colonization interactions of the chemically camouflaged, large-gaped, ambush predator, pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus), active, large-gaped green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), and active, small-gaped golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), with larval gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) and mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum). We examined the consumptive and predation-risk effects of each predator on amphibian mortality, growth rates, tail morphology, and polyphenisms. Large-gaped pirate perch and green sunfish had strong, equivalent consumptive effects, but only the free-roaming active predator, green sunfish, suppressed the growth of survivors through risk-induced trait responses. Caged green sunfish induced much stronger non-consumptive mortality than pirate perch in gray treefrogs, an effect that was absent for mole salamanders; golden topminnows had intermediate effects. Tail defenses were a function of prey mortality and only manifested in free-roaming predator treatments, suggesting the necessity of predator attacks or conspecific alarm signals. Likewise, mole salamander polyphenism was unaffected by caged predators, whereas free-roaming green sunfish prevented all metamorphosis. Free-roaming golden topminnows increased the proportion of individuals remaining as larvae, and pirate perch increased the proportion of paedomorphs and metamorphs. Overall, the prey had positively correlated anti-predator responses across life stages, suggesting multicomponent defenses. Predator effects varied with functional traits with large-gaped predators having strong consumptive effects, but active predators causing stronger risk-induced changes in growth compared to cryptic ambush predators, which provides more evidence for chemical camouflage. Our results emphasize the role of hunting mode and gape size in determining consumptive and predation-risk effects, and that predation-risk effects cannot be reliably predicted from consumptive effects.

AB  - Simple Summary: Transport is an unavoidable and important part of livestock husbandry. Live sheep transport is a period of high risk to their welfare, and potentially a huge hidden economic loss due to the effects on their health and/or the quality of their carcasses. Public concern about livestock transport indicates that it is important to improve the welfare of animals being transported. Prolonged transport and pre-transport fasting may particularly stress sheep, as well as potentially adversely affecting subsequent growth and/or carcass quality after slaughter. We investigated the effects of different transport times and pre-transport feeding during summer on the welfare of transported sheep of the Dorper x Mongolian breed, which are typical of the region and may be tolerant of the high temperatures in the Inner Mongolian summer. We selected 4-month-old male sheep to conduct two transport experiments, measuring the relevant blood biochemical indicators to evaluate the level of animal welfare. We found that three hours transport, compared with one hour, reduced the nutritional status of sheep, and that 12 h fasting before transport reduced the sheep's nutritional status. Increased cortisol in sheep fed pre-transport may indicate that sheep are less stressed by the transport if they have been fasted. We therefore recommend that, during hot weather, sheep transport is confined to short periods. Regarding fasting, we recommend that sheep are not fasted for a long period beforehand, because of the decline in nutritional status. Transport is a high-risk time for sheep, especially if the distances are long and sheep are fasted for a long time beforehand. Two experiments were conducted to compare transport durations of 1 hour (1 h) and 3 hours (3 h) and the effects of feeding before transport using Dorper x Mongolian sheep, which are typical of the region and may be tolerant of the high temperatures in the Inner Mongolian summer. Thirty 4-month-old male sheep were randomly divided into two treatment groups, with 15 sheep/treatment in each experiment, to evaluate the effects on blood biochemical indicators, stress hormone levels, rectal temperatures, and antioxidant status of lambs in summer. In Experiment 1, the levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids after 3 h transport were significantly lower than after 1 h transport (p < 0.05). The levels of thyroxine and malondialdehyde in blood were greater after 3 h transport than 1 h transport (p < 0.05). Creatine kinase levels after 3 h transport tended to be lower than after 1 h transport (p = 0.051). In Experiment 2, the levels of urea and superoxide dismutase in the group fasted pre-transport was significantly lower than those of the group fed pre-transport (p < 0.05). The serum cortisol level in the pre-transport fed group was higher compared to the group fed pre-transport (p = 0.04). Total antioxidant capacity in the pre-transport fasted group tended to be lower compared to that in the pre-transport fed group (p < 0.0001). We conclude that the reduction in nutritional status of sheep transported for longer and without feed pre-transport suggests that transporting sheep in hot conditions in northern China after fasting for a long period should be restricted. However, a decrease in the stress induced by transport following fasting is worthy of further study.

AB  - It is important to prevent microbial contamination during liquid preservation of semen in pigs. We examined the effects of curcumin supplementation on the quality of porcine spermatozoa irradiated with ultraviolet-C (UV-C) at 228 nm. UV-C is used to disinfect gases and solid surfaces. In the first experiment, porcine semen was preserved with 0, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mu M curcumin under UV-C irradiation at 228 nm for 7 days at 15 degrees C. The irradiation did not affect the motility and viability of preserved spermatozoa but decreased the percentage of plasma membrane integrity of spermatozoa. Curcumin supplementation at 25 mu M significantly improved the plasma membrane and acrosome integrity of irradiated spermatozoa compared with spermatozoa preserved without curcumin (p <.05). In the second experiment, semen was preserved with or without 25 mu M curcumin with UV-C irradiation at 228 or 260 nm for 3 days at 15 degrees C. Curcumin supplementation increased the percentages of total motility, sperm viability and plasma membrane integrity of preserved spermatozoa at both irradiation wavelengths (p <.05). All quality parameters of 260 nm irradiated spermatozoa decreased compared to those of the other groups, irrespective of curcumin supplementation. The collective findings indicate that porcine spermatozoa can retain their viability even after continuous long-duration irradiation with 228 nm UV-C. Curcumin supplementation improves the quality of UV-C irradiated spermatozoa during semen preservation.

AB  - The Complejo Volcanico Dona Juana - Cascabel National Natural Park is located between the departments of Cauca and Narino in the southern Andean Region of Colombia. Due to the country's social challenges and the difficult access to the Dona Juana - Cascabel National Natural Park the biological knowledge concerning groups such as mammals, is based on studies prior to the park's declaration, reports from park rangers and residents. Between October 2017 and February 2018, eight trail cameras were set up in the Dona Juana - Cascabel National Natural Park and its buffer zone. We reviewed the information captured in these cameras and identified eight mammal species, three of which are new reports for the park. In total, 24 species were reported, including charismatic Andean species such as the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), and the Andean tapir (Tapirus pinchaque). The mammal diversity documented for the park is low (24 species) compared to other Andean areas. Further field work is necessary to complete the species inventories. Nevertheless, this research, to our knowledge is the first effort to study the medium and large mammals of the Dona Juana - Cascabel National Natural Park since its establishment in 2008.

AB  - Pollution by microplastics in natural and cultivated soils is an emerging issue of global interest. Microplastics may interfere with the soil structure, microorganism and invertebrate biodiversity, and related biological processes. Surprisingly, there is a poor understanding of how microplastics influence the interactions between members of different trophic levels. We investigated whether a high level of contamination (5% w/w concentration) with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics (<0.25 mm size) in soil interferes with the attraction of an insect herbivore towards a plant-soil system under short-term laboratory conditions. As a model system, we used the black fungus gnat Bradysia difformis (Diptera: Sciaridae), which is an important crop pest, and lentil (Lens culinaris), a host plant. Through one-way olfactometer bioassays, we recorded the female responses to plant-soil systems subjected to different combinations of HDPE exposures and watering regimes. Female residence time (i.e., the time spent in the olfactometer sector close to the stimulus) was higher when testing high watered (75.3% +/- 2.99) than low-watered, microplastic-free plant-soil systems (58.6% +/- 3.88). However, residence time was lower towards systems maintained 7 days with 5% HDPE (53.9% +/- 4.79) compared to HDPEfree (76.5% +/- 2.64) systems. Notably, the attraction of females towards HDPE-free systems compared to 5% HDPE was higher only under high watering regime. Attractiveness of 5% HDPE plant-soil system was restored when cues from fungal colonies were added (66.1% +/- 4.33). Here we demonstrated for the first time that microplastics alter the attraction of female fungus gnats towards a plant-soil system. Our results depict an extreme scenario with high HDPE (5%), which is occasionally found in soils close to industrial areas. Therefore it is still too early to derive strong conclusions for typical agricultural settings. However, if microplastic pollution increases in agricultural soils, possible interferences in the established soil-plant-herbivore communication mechanisms should be carefully considered.

AB  - Ectotherms are especially vulnerable to global warming due to their temperature-sensitive metabolic processes, impacting survival and reproductive success. Elasmobranchs, with slow life histories and low reproductive rates, may face amplified risks. In this study, we investigated two catshark species with distinct life traits and distributions: the Small-spotted Catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Nursehound (S. stellaris). Using newly calibrated bioenergetic models, we assessed changes in growth, sexual maturity, offspring production, and population dynamics under two CMIP6 climate scenarios projected for 2100: SSP2-4.5 (Middle of the Road) and SSP5-8.5 (Fossil-fueled Development), comparing these to historical data (1994-2015). Survival rates for early life stages remained similar under historical temperatures (80 %) and SSP2 (83 %) but dropped sharply under SSP5 to 33 % for S. canicula and 23 % for S. stellaris. Under both SSP2 and SSP5, S. canicula showed slight delays in maturation, yet the proportion of mature individuals ultimately exceeded historical levels in SSP2. Conversely, S. stellaris experienced progressively delayed maturation with warming. In SSP5, reduced growth, reproduction, and survival caused a population crash for S. stellaris, suggesting potential extinction. Our results reveal contrasting climate impacts on these species, underscoring the risk for late-maturing, low-fecundity, and narrowly distributed species. This emphasizes the urgency of conservation strategies tailored to mitigate their vulnerability to global warming.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of highly stable chemicals, widely used in everyday products, and widespread in the environment, even in pregnant women. While epidemiological studies have linked prenatal exposure to PFAS with atopic dermatitis in children, little is known about their toxic effects on skin development, especially during the embryonic stage. In this study, we utilized human embryonic stem cells to generate non-neural ectoderm (NNE) cells and exposed them to six PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), undecafluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), heptafluorobutyric acid (PFBA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBS)) during the differentiation process to assess their toxicity to early skin development. Our results showed that PFOS altered the spindle-like morphology of NNE cells to a pebble-like morphology, and disrupted several NNE markers, including KRT16, SMYD1, and WISP1. The six PFAS had a high potential to cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) by disrupting the expression levels of HED-relevant genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PFOS treatment produced the highest number (1156) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the six PFAS, including the keratinocyterelated genes KRT6A, KRT17, KRT18, KRT24, KRT40, and KRT81. Additionally, we found that PFOS treatment disturbed several signaling pathways that are involved in regulating skin cell fate decisions and differentiation, including TGF-13, NOTCH, Hedgehog, and Hippo signaling pathways. Interestingly, we discovered that PFOS inhibited, by partially interfering with the expression of cytoskeleton-related genes, the ciliogenesis of NNE cells, which is crucial for the intercellular transduction of the above -mentioned signaling pathways. Overall, our study suggests that PFAS can inhibit ciliogenesis and hamper the transduction of important signaling pathways, leading potential congenital skin diseases. It sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of early embryonic skin devel- opmental toxicity and provides an explanation for the epidemiological data on PFAS. Environmental implication: We employed a model based on human embryonic stem cells to demonstrate that PFOS has the potential to elevate the risk of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This is achieved by targeting cilia, inhibiting ciliogenesis, and subsequently disrupting crucial signaling pathways like TGF-13, NOTCH, Hedgehog, and Hippo, during the early phases of embryonic skin development. Our study highlights the dangers and po- tential impacts of six PFAS pollutants on human skin development. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of closely considering PFHxA, PFBA, PFHxS, and PFBS, as they have shown the capacity to modify gene expression levels, albeit to a lesser degree.

AB  - Simple Summary The energy required for fattening castrated Korean black goats was estimated using the correlation between metabolic energy intake per dietary body weight and average daily gain per dietary body weight. The Y-axis intercept value was the metabolic energy requirement for maintaining the lives of the fattening Korean black goats. It was calculated to be 108.76 kcal/kg BW0.75 (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.6036). Twelve adult (10 months old) castrated Korean black goats, with an average initial body weight of 24.98 +/- 3.7 kg, were used in this experiment to determine their maintenance energy requirements. Dry matter intakes (g/d, p = 0.945) were not affected by energy levels, but metabolic energy intake (kcal/d, p < 0.002) and average daily gain (g/d, p < 0.001) were significantly increased at higher energy levels. Nutrient digestibility was similar in the treatments, but crude fat digestibility increased with the addition of protective fat powder (p = 0.001). The energy required for fattening the castrated Korean black goats was estimated using the correlation between metabolic energy intake per dietary body weight and average daily gain per dietary body weight. The Y-axis intercept value was calculated to be 108.76 kcal/kg BW0.75 (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.6036), which was the metabolic energy requirement for maintaining the lives of the fattening Korean black goats. The estimated energy requirements of the black goat can improve specification techniques, such as the energy level and the amount of feed supply required for domestic black goats.

AB  - Plants readily communicate with their pollinators, herbivores, symbionts, and the predators and pathogens of their herbivores. We previously demonstrated that plants could exchange, relay, and adaptively utilize drought cues from their conspecific neighbors. Here, we studied the hypothesis that plants can exchange drought cues with their interspecific neighbors. Triplets of various combinations of split-root Stenotaphrum secundatum and Cynodon dactylon plants were planted in rows of four pots. One root of the first plant was subjected to drought while its other root shared its pot with one of the roots of an unstressed target neighbor, which, in turn, shared its other pot with an additional unstressed target neighbor. Drought cuing and relayed cuing were observed in all intra- and interspecific neighbor combinations, but its strength depended on plant identity and position. Although both species initiated similar stomatal closure in both immediate and relayed intraspecific neighbors, interspecific cuing between stressed plants and their immediate unstressed neighbors depended on neighbor identity. Combined with previous findings, the results suggest that stress cuing and relay cuing could affect the magnitude and fate of interspecific interactions, and the ability of whole communities to endure abiotic stresses. The findings call for further investigation into the mechanisms and ecological implications of interplant stress cuing at the population and community levels.

AB  - The environmental impact of livestock activities as Earth global warming is already well known. Therefore, the reuse of resources and products is addressed to reduce the damage caused by intensive livestock farming within a fossil fuel-based economy. Most studies related to sustainability correctly evaluate the processes' energy efficiency under human control but disregard the resources provided for free by nature. For these reasons, the Emergy Accounting (EMA) method is applied to evaluate the direct and indirect environmental support to milk production at regional (Campania Region, Italy) and local levels (buffalo farm within Campania Region), also comparing these results to available outcomes from scientific literature at different spatial scales. Therefore, this study aims to: (i) evaluate the resources consumption across scales from an environmental, donor-side perspective, (ii) suggest improvement options based on feedback use of resources, and (iii) test a calculation method to avoid double counting in complex systems. At the local level, a buffalo farm within Campania Region was evaluated from crop cultivation for feed purposes up to milk production according to three different scenarios for fodder production: (i) manure produced by livestock as fertilizer (closed-loop - circular model), (ii) manure purchased from the market with an integrative amount of chemical fertilizers (open loop), and (iii) chemical fertilizers only (linear model). EMA results applied to the regional level provide a Unit Emergy Value (with Labor & Service) of about 3.09E+07 sej g (-) (1), heavily affected by the emergy of feed production. The buffalo farm within Campania Region (local evaluation) proves to be the most efficient milk production system in terms of resource use; in contrast, the buffalo farm in Brazil is the most self-sufficient milk production system, compared to similar studies from Poland, Slovenia, and Northern Italy. The evaluation of the manure use scenarios (feedback within the system boundaries and purchase from the market) shows the importance of an appropriate assessment approach to overcome the methodological limitations of circularity evaluations. In conclusion, the transition to a sustainable future can be achieved by implementing circular patterns, which should be adequately evaluated to support the correct approach for public policies.

AB  - Nodulating leguminous and actinorhizal N-2-fixation pioneer plants are well-known drivers of primary succession as they may facilitate soil development and the growth of neighboring non-nodulating plant species as a result of their N-2-fixing capacity. However, recent studies have shown that some non-nodulating species may also obtain N through endophytic diazatrophs although the N-2-fixing capacity is relatively low when compared to the traditionally nodulating species. There remains limited understanding of how these two categories of N-2 fixing pioneer plant species (nodulating and non-nodulating) acquire recalcitrant resident soil phosphorus (P) pools and facilitate soil P cycling. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated whether pioneering plant species belonging to different functional groups, i.e., nodulating N-2-fixing species (leguminous Astragalus mahoshanicus and actinorhizal seabuckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides) and non-nodulating endophytic N-2-fixing willow species (Salix rehderiana), have distinct rhizosphere soil P chemistry when grown on barren deglaciated moraine. We also examined if plant-induced changes in soil P transformations are related to the relative abundance of microbial P transformation genes. Our results showed that pioneer plant colonization enhanced soil P cycling as indicated by higher concentrations of available P (Olsen-P), alkaline phosphatase activity, and abundance of key genes governing microbial P-cycling in rhizosphere soils compared to bulk soils. Among plant species, the astragalus and the willow had the greatest available P concentrations along with greater organic acid concentrations, total organic P transformation gene and organic P mineralization gene abundances. On the other hand, seabuckthorn had the lowest available P concentration and organic P mineralization gene abundance. The willow species, S. rehderiana, was the only plant studied that had greater total abundance of inorganic P solublization genes, gcd, ppk, as well as the organic P mineralization gene phoD than that found in bulk soil. Willow also had the greatest capability for releasing recalcitrant inorganic P in infertile barren moraine. These novel studies suggest that the nodulating N-2-fixing species were not categorically better than non-nodulating endophytic N-2-fixing species at accessing P as measured by soil available P concentrations in rhizosphere soils or microbial P transformation genes. This study provides new insights into potential mechanisms of ecosystem primary succession with broader implications for ecosystem management and restoration efforts.

AB  - Information on the sex- and individual-specific space use by a species elucidates demography, resource selection and individual life history. However, traditional field surveys often lack information on sex and individual identity, thereby not maximizing the potential of the effort put in. Recent advances in genetic non-invasive sampling provide cost-effective approaches to determine identity and sex from faecal DNA with high accuracy, which are advantageous for tracking individuals compared to field observations. Therefore, we describe the first single multiplex-based sex and individual identification protocol using faecal samples of the wild Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) collected from the vicinity of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand, India. We co-amplified fluorescence-labelled microsatellites (n = 5) and a Y chromosome-linked sex marker in four replicates from faecal DNA extracts (n = 149). The mean per genotype allelic drop-out rate was 0.11 +/- 0.02, while the false allele rate was 0.05 +/- 0.01. The mean null allele frequency across the markers was 0.15 +/- 0.02. We obtained 74.1% consensus genotypes across microsatellites and dropped samples with more than one-locus missing genotype from further analyses. The remaining dataset comprised 105 samples, 30.5% of which were females. We identified 51 unique individuals (25 males and 26 females) with a maximum of one-locus mismatch. With low genotyping error rates and adequate misidentification probabilities ( P-ID = 4.2 x10(- 4); P-IDSib = 3.0 x10(- 2)), the described panel provides a cost-effective method (US$ 18/sample) for molecular sexing and individual identification. Hence, the suggested multiplex panel would provide a thorough understanding of individual and sex-specific differences in habitat use across heterogeneous landscapes, facilitating effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Background and aims The intake of selenium, an essential element for animals and humans, in ruminants is largely determined by selenium concentration in ingested forages, which take up selenium mainly from soil. Ruminant excreta is a common source of organic fertilizer, which provides both nutrients and organic matter. This study aims to unentangle the unclear effect of applying different types of ruminant excreta in soils of different organic matter contents on selenium uptake by forage. Methods Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown in soils of different organic matter contents. Urine and/or feces collected from sheep fed with organic or inorganic mineral supplements, including selenium, were applied to the soils. The selenium in the collected samples were analyzed using ICP-MS. The associated biogeochemical reactions were scrutinized by wet chemistry. Results The application of urine and/or feces resulted in either the same or lower selenium concentrations in perennial ryegrass. The excreta type did not affect total selenium accumulation in grass grown in low organic matter soil, whereas in high organic matter soil, feces resulted in significantly lower total selenium accumulation than urine, which was attributed to a possible interaction of selenium sorption in soil and microbial reduction of Se. Conclusion This one-time excreta application did not increase, but further decrease in some treatments, selenium concentration and accumulation in the perennial ryegrass. Consequently, to increase ruminant selenium intake, supplementing selenium directly to animals is more recommended than applying animal manure to soil, which might drive selenium reduction and decrease selenium uptake by grass.

AB  - This study explores how elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels affects the growth and defense mechanisms of plants. We focused on Aristolochia contorta Bunge (Aristolochiaceae), a wild plant that exhibits growth reduction under elevated CO2 in the previous study. The plant has Sericinus montela Gray (Papilionidae) as a specialist herbivore. By analyzing primary metabolites, understanding both the growth and defense response of plants to herbivory under elevated CO2 conditions is possible. The experiment was conducted across four groups, combining two CO2 concentration conditions (ambient CO2 and elevated CO2) with two herbivory conditions (herbivory treated and untreated). Although many plants exhibit increased growth under elevated CO(2 )levels, A. contorta exhibited reduced growth with lower height, dry weight, and total leaf area. Under herbivory, A. contorta triggered both localized and systemic responses. More primary metabolites exhibited significant differences due to herbivory treatment in systemic tissue than local leaves that herbivory was directly treated. Herbivory under elevated CO2 level triggered more significant responses in primary metabolites (17 metabolites) than herbivory under ambient CO2 conditions (five metabolites). Several defense-related metabolites exhibited higher concentrations in the roots and lower concentrations in the leaves in response to the herbivory treatment in the elevated CO2 group. This suggests a potential intensification of defensive responses in the underground parts of the plant under elevated CO2 levels. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both abiotic and biotic factors in understanding plant responses to environmental changes. The adaptive strategies of A. contorta suggest a complex response mechanism to elevated CO2 and herbivory pressures.

AB  - IntroductionAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease that affects pigs and wild boars, with a mortality rate of up to 100% in susceptible animals. The virus has been circulating in Europe and Asia since its introduction in 2007. Initially, all studied isolates were identified as genotype II, but in 2021 genotype I was reported in China. Later in 2023, the first recombinant virus of genotype I and II was identified in China, with an isolate dating back to 2021, this was followed by the detection of 6 recombinant isolates in Vietnam.MethodsIn this study, an ASFV isolate from the Primorsky Region of Russia obtained from a domestic pig was analyzed by sequencing several genome markers as well as the full genome. Eight pigs were infected with the isolate to assess its virulence.ResultsVirus replication in cell culture showed hemadsorption, while sequencing of genome markers clustered the isolate into both genotype I and genotype II. The whole-genome sequence showed that the Russian isolate shared a 99.99% identity with recombinant isolates described earlier in China. Experimental animals developed ASF disease after the introduction of a low dose of the virus (10 HAU50) and died within 7 days post-infection, presenting an acute form of the disease.ConclusionThis is the first report on recombinant ASFV in Russia's territory. The results once again confirm the transboundary nature of the disease, demonstrating the vulnerability of the global pig industry underscoring the need for developing new ASF vaccines effective against recombinant strains and emphasizing the importance of continuous molecular monitoring to detect emerging threats promptly.

AB  - Access to an outdoor run improves the housing conditions of fattening pigs by an enlarged space allowance, access to different climatic conditions and environmental stimulation. One central conflicting issue regarding outdoor runs is the emission of harmful gases such as ammonia resulting from faeces and urine. However, by establishing appropriate functional areas in fattening pens, the area soiled by faeces and urine can potentially be reduced. Here, we investigated the usage of an outdoor run and the frequencies and locations of defaecation behaviour of fattening pigs kept in groups of ten in eight pens. Usage of the outdoor run was registered by scan sampling at the group level in three observation periods (pigs at 16, 19, and 22 weeks of age). Furthermore, in each pen, two focal pigs were individually marked and continuously observed for 24 h in each observation period to record defaecation behaviour. At the group level, the fattening pigs used the outdoor run mainly during the daytime between 06:00 h and 20:00 h. A total of 99.4% of defaecation events occurred in the outdoor run, most often in the corner next to the wall of the barn. On average, 11.08 ( +/- SD 3.06) defaecation events per pig per day were recorded, whereby the time of day significantly affected the relative frequencies of defaecation behaviour (GLMER, X12 = 4.11, P < 0.043). Fattening pigs defaecated more often during the daytime than during the nighttime. The number of daily defaecations decreased with age. In pens as used in our study, fattening pigs perform nearly all defaecations in the outdoor run and within a small area. This may enable technical possi-bilities to reduce ammonia emissions in pig pens with outdoor runs, such as regular cleaning of dunging areas by an automatic floor scraper.

AB  - The pig and poultry industries continue to grow across the world and together they provide the majority of meat consumed. The European Union (EU) in particular has the highest global relative meat production by monogastrics (i.e., pig and poultry). The fate of phosphorus (P) in pig and poultry farming was studied, accounting for P content in feed, animals, manure, soil, and runoff. P input from manure, and P offtake in crops receiving manure, were plotted against each other to arrive at "safe " P loading rates, in order to minimize soil P surpluses along the lines of the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel in their work with nitrogen (N). However, it was observed that it is the N/P ratio and the background soil P levels that determine whether a certain manure will end up producing surplus levels of soil P. Critical N/P weight ratios were derived over different crop P offtake rates when applying stored manure to croplands. At spreading rates of 170 and 250 kgN/ha/year and a crop P offtake of 15 or 30 kgP/ha/year, stored pig and chicken manure result in soil P surpluses. An important factor in determining effective N/P ratios is the plant availability of N in stored manure, which runs at around 47%, estimated from previously published results. The minimization of N losses to the atmosphere and to groundwater in housing, storage, and spreading of manure has a major impact on the N/P weight ratio of the manure that ends up on fields. In most cases, half of the ex-animal N content has been lost in stored or degraded manure, with N/P weight ratios running at two and less. Following only the EU Nitrates Directive, which allows for a maximum of 170 kgN/ha/year in NVZs (Nitrate Vulnerable Zones), will often result in soil P surpluses leading to runoff losses to adjacent water bodies. Therefore, for the pig and poultry industries to continue thriving, measures are required to better manage manure, including improved storage and spreading techniques, acidification, separation, struvite extraction and ammonia stripping of pig slurry, and drying and pelleting of poultry litter. This way, excess manure and derived biofertilizers from animal farms can find their way back into the commercial market, instead of ending up as legacy P in watersheds and coastal zones.

AB  - Early decision making in commercial livestock systems is key to maximising animal welfare and production. Detailed information on an animal's phenotype is needed to facilitate this, but can be difficult to obtain in a commercial setting. Research into the use of bio-logging on sheep to continuously monitor individual behaviour and indirectly inform health and production has seen rapid growth in recent years. Much of this research, however, has been conducted on small numbers of animals in an experimental setting and over limited time periods. Previous studies have also focused on ewes and there has been little research on the potential of biologging for collecting behavioural data on lambs, despite clear potential relevance for production. The present study aimed to test the feasibility of deploying accelerometers on a commercial sheep flock at a key point in the annual production cycle (lambing), to validate the viability of automated monitoring of sheep behaviour in a commercial setting. Also, we aimed to develop robust machine learning algorithms that can classify both the posture and physical activity of adult sheep and lambs. We used a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict: two mutually exclusive postures in ewes and lambs (standing and lying), achieving average accuracies of 83.7% and 85.9% respectively; four mutually exclusive activities in ewes (grazing, ruminating, inactive and walking), achieving an average accuracy of 70.9%; and three mutually exclusive activities in lambs (inactive, suckling, walking), achieving an average accuracy of 80.8%. These performance accuracies on large numbers of individuals afford the opportunity to provide a detailed understanding of the daily activity budget of ewes and lambs. Monitoring changes in daily patterns across the annual production cycle while capturing changes in environmental conditions such as weather, day length, terrain and management could reveal key indicator metrics that may inform production and health and provide early warning systems for key issues in commercial flocks.

AB  - The effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) on semen quality have been in the spotlight in recent years, though research results to date have been contradictory. The effects of RF-EMR amongst others depend upon frequency, and there is currently no literature concerning the influence of 5G frequencies on both DNA integrity and spermatozoa vitality in males. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 5G RF-EMR on sperm membrane integrity, mitochondrial potential, and DNA integrity of in vitro exposed semen of breeding boars. The study included semen samples of eight breeding boars of the Pietren breed and four breeding boars of the German Landrace breed, from 1.5 to 3.5 years in age. Freshly diluted semen of each boar was divided into a control (n = 12) and experimental group (n = 12). The samples of the experimental group were exposed for 2 hours to continuous RF-EMR at a single frequency (700 MHz, 2500 MHz and 3500 MHz) and an electromagnetic field strength of 10 V/m using a transverse gigahertz electromagnetic cell. Sperm DNA fragmentation was assessed using a Halomax (R) kit and sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial potential was assessed using a PI/SYBR-14 LIVE/DEAD viability kit with JC-1. A significantly higher proportion of spermatozoa with DNA fragmentation was found in exposed semen samples for all frequencies compared to the control group. The highest DNA damage was recorded in semen samples exposed to 5G RF-EMR at 2500 MHz (p < 0.01) and 3500 MHz (p < 0.05) vs. control semen samples. A significantly higher proportion of spermatozoa with damaged cell membrane and good mitochondrial potential was recorded in semen samples exposed with 3500 MHz. In vitro exposure of breading boar semen to 5G RF-EMR significantly increases the proportion of DNA fragmentation. The harmful effect of 5G RF-EMR on the proportion of spermatozoa with damaged DNA was frequency dependent. The 3500 MHz frequency displayed the most harmful effects due to significant impacts on DNA integrity and spermatozoa vitality indicators.

AB  - Study was designed with aim to determine varying levels of supplementary crushed rapeseed (CRS) a month before and two months after lambing on ewe's and lamb's performance in Salt Range sheep. Pregnant sheep (n = 12) were chosen and divided into 3 equal treatment groups. Ewes in control (T-0), T-1 and T-2 treatment groups were supplemented with CRS at 0, 25 and 50 g/d, respectively. Data of parameters were collected and analyzed through ANOVA technique using SAS 9.3 Portable and Sigma Plot Software under Completely randomized design. Weight gain of ewes was increased (P<0.05) substantially throughout period with CRS 25g/d and 50g/day but difference amongst treatment was not significant. The weight of the lambs at birth and 7(th) day age was increased (P<0.05) with CRS 25g/d and 50g/d as compared to control but no difference (P>0.05) was found between treatments. The higher survival rate of lambs (P<0.05) was found in CRS 25 g/d, followed by 50 g/d and then 0 g/d. Milk constituents; solid not fat, density, lactose, minerals and protein were increased (P<0.05) with increasing rate of dietary supplementation of CRS except fat percentage. In case of blood parameters, effect of dietary supplementation of CRS was found variable. It is concluded that 25 g/d CRS is an optimum dietary supplementation level a month before and two months after lambing for adequate weight gain and milk quality in terms of all constituents except fat percent in Salt Range ewes as rapeseed has gross energy 6420 kcal/kg and crude proteins 18.6% which plays an important role in nutritional and food applications. This dietary supplementation level in grazing ewes can also trigger better birth weight and survival rate in newly born lambs.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) is a swine disease associated with post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome, which causes a high economic impact on animal production. Recently, new evidence has suggested the increasing circulation of the PCV-2d genotype. We screened wild boar stools collected from several districts across Portugal during the 2018-2020 hunting seasons, for PCV-2 and genetically characterized detected strains. From a total 76 stool samples of wild boar tested, two sequences were obtained, both of the PCV-2d genotype, showing the presence of this genotype in Portugal for the first time. Monitoring wild PCV-2 reservoirs is important for both veterinary public health and economic reasons. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) is associated with several syndromes affecting swine, also known as porcine-circovirus-associated diseases, of which post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome stands out due to its high economic impact on swine production. Recent data suggest the increasing circulation of the PCV-2d genotype in several countries worldwide. To provide updated data on PCV-2 genotypes currently circulating in swine in Portugal, we screened wild boar stools collected from several districts across Portugal, during the 2018-2020 hunting seasons, for PCV-2 and genetically characterized detected strains. From a total of 76 stool samples of wild boar tested by PCR for the partial PCV-2 ORF2 gene, two sequences were obtained (2/76; 2.6%, 95% confidence interval: 0.032-9.18). Bidirectional sequencing showed that the sequences were 100% identical and both of the PCV-2d genotype, showing for the first time the presence of this genotype in Portugal. Monitoring wild PCV-2 reservoirs is important for both veterinary public health and economic reasons, since PCV-2 infection has a strong economic impact on the swine industry.

AB  - Controlling building carbon emissions (CEs) is key to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. Residential blocks are the main contributors of buildings' carbon emissions and intensity, and thus can be manipulated to achieve carbon neutrality. This work aimed to evaluate the building carbon emissions intensity (CEI) levels of residential blocks using Rhino and Grasshopper and to quantify the relationship between the block form parameters and a building's carbon emissions (CEs). Firstly, 48 cases were selected by stratified sampling, and they were classified by architectural typology. Secondly, the residential block morphological parameters and building carbon emissions were calculated. Thirdly, the relationship between the block form parameters and the building's CE was quantified using statistical methods. Lastly, low-carbon planning strategies for residential blocks under the target of carbon neutrality were proposed. The findings showed that the influence of the block form parameters on a building's CE was 31.66%. A building's shape factor has a positive influence on its CE, and the floor area ratio, building volume-site area ratio, and building height have negative influences on its CE. A building's shape factor, cover ratio, and surface-site area ratio synergistically impact its CE. The weight of a building's shape factor on its carbon emissions was 3.84 times that of its cover ratio and 4.46 times that of its surface-site area ratio. The technology workflow proposed in this study can provide data in support of carbon emissions assessments and low-carbon planning strategies for urban blocks in other cities in China and worldwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sperm mitochondria are the major site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and excess production during freezing-thawing process inflicts oxidative damages to spermatozoa. Buffalo spermatozoa are more prone to oxidative damage due to inherently more polyunsaturated fatty acids and low cholesterol to phospholipids ratio in the plasma membrane. A mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO was used in this study. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Mito-TEMPO incorporated semen extender on the post-thaw semen quality in buffalo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 ejaculates from three murrah buffalo bulls with >= 70% individual progressive motility were utilized for the study. Each semen sample was equally divided and extended with five groups: Group I (Control, without Mito-TEMPO addition); Group II (10 mu M Mito-TEMPO); Group III (50 mu M Mito-TEMPO); Group IV (100 mu M Mito-TEMPO); Group V (500 mu M Mito-TEMPO) to have 80x10(6) progressive motile sperm/mL of extender, filled and sealed in French mini straws (0.25 mL) and frozen following equilibration. The effect of Mito-TEMPO was assessed at fresh/post-dilution and postthaw stages by evaluating physico-morphological attributes and functional membrane integrity such as hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST). RESULTS: Initial progressive motility, viability, acrosomal integrity and HOS response was significantly (p<0.05) improved and sperm abnormality was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in extended semen with Mito-TEMPO (50 mu M) compared to control at post-thaw stage, although improvement was also observed at 10 and 100 mu M in post-thaw samples. CONCLUSION: Mito-TEMPO incorporated semen extender at 50 mu M concentration, could be part of a rationale for improving post-thaw semen quality in buffalo.

AB  - In this study, the influence of the living conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) fawns (wild vs. farmed) and effect of the category of free-living animals (fawns vs. does) on the fatty acid (FA) profile of the leg bone marrow was assessed. The composition of FAs in the deer bone marrow was determined by the gas chromatography method. In all groups, oleic acid (18:1 c9) was the most abundant in deer bone marrow and comprised of approximately 37% of total FAs. The bone marrow of young wild deer was characterized by a significantly (p < 0.001) higher fat content and saturated FAs proportion, while farmed fawns contained more moisture (p < 0.005) and fat-free dry matter (p < 0.001), as well as more monounsaturated FAs cis branched-chain FAs and monounsaturated FAs trans (p < 0.001). Although no significant (p > 0.05) differences were found between fawns, in terms of partial sums of PUFA, a significantly (p < 0.001) higher level of the sum of n-3 and n-6 FAs and more favorable n-6/n-3 ratio in the bone marrow of wild fawns were determined. In general, the legs of wild fawns were better prepared for wintering than farmed ones. In turn, comparing the category-related FAs composition in the bone marrow of free-living animals, a more favorable profile was observed in the adult (does) than in the young (fawns) animals, as the bone marrow of the wild does was characterized by significantly (p < 0.001) lower percentages of saturated FAs and a higher percentage of monounsaturated FAs cis.

AB  - Unsustainable food supply chains are sources of relevant environmental impacts and strongly contribute to the depletion of non-renewable resources. Ecolabelling is one of the measures for increasing market awareness of the sustainability of a product and encourage the implementation of low-input practices along the food production system. Made Green in Italy (MGI) scheme is an initiative based on the PEF method and aimed to reward Made in Italy products with high environmental profile. A screening study was conducted on four Sardinian dairy plants to develop an experimental MGI application on the hard sheep milk cheese supply chain, using Pecorino Romano PDO as reference product. Sheep milk phase resulted the main contributor for all relevant impact categories (over 94%). Benchmark score (1.33E-05 Pt) was calculated adding the normalized and weighted values of the 3 main relevant impact categories (Climate Change, Land Use and Water Scarcity). Three performance classes were defined considering the best and the worst values of life cycle processes: upper threshold was equal to 1.62E-05 Pt and lower threshold was equal to 1.17E-05 Pt. The relevant sheep milk impact highlighted the crucial role of sheep farming systems for improving the environmental footprint of the Pecorino Romano PDO.

AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus considered as a major threat for the global livestock economy. Since 1999, Tunisia has experienced several incursions of BTV, during which numerous cases of infection and mortality have been reported. However, the geographical origin and epidemiological characteristics of these incursions remained unclear. To understand the evolutionary history of BTV emergence in Tunisia, we extracted from Genbank the segment 6 sequences of 7 BTV strains isolated in Tunisia during the period 2000 to 2017 and blasted them to obtain a final dataset of 67 sequences. We subjected the dataset to a Bayesian phylogeography framework inferring geographical origin and serotype as phylodynamic models. Our results suggest that BTV-2 was first introduced in Tunisia in the 1960s and that since 1990s, the country has witnessed the emergence of other typical and atypical BTV serotypes notably BTV-1, BTV-3 and BTV-Y. The reported serotypes have a diverse geographical origin and have been transmitted to Tunisia from countries in the Mediterranean Basin. Interserotype reassortments have been identified among BTV-1, BTV-2 and BTV-Y. This study has provided new insights on the temporal and geographical origin of BTV in Tunisia, suggesting the contribution of animal trade and environment conditions in virus spread.

AB  - Oil tea camellia (Camellia spp.) is an important woody oil crop with a high nutritional and economic value. Whole-genome resequencing (WGR) technology can provide an in-depth understanding of the genetic background of this plant as well as a reference for breeding research, germplasm resource conservation, and genetic modification. In this study, we analyzed SNP and InDel variations in 49 individual oil tea camellia germplasm samples collected from five populations located in three provinces of China: Hainan, Guangdong and Guangxi. The samples were analyzed through WGR after the ploidy of the samples was determined through flow cytometry. A total of 239,441,603 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 23,510,374 high-quality insertion/deletion variation sites (InDels) were obtained. The distribution of SNPs and InDels in different functional regions differed significantly, with a high density of variations in non-coding regions, such as intergenic regions and introns, and a relatively low density of variations in coding regions. Transition was the main type of SNP variation. A population genetic diversity analysis revealed that the sampled oil tea camellia populations exhibited a high genetic diversity and extensive genetic variation. The genetic diversity of the oil tea camellia populations in the Hainan region was higher than inland regions. This study also determined the genetic diversity of and variations between octoploid and decaploid oil tea camellia in the tropics and between Hainan-based and inland oil tea camellia. Such findings provide a reference for the conservation of germplasm resources and the genetic modification of oil tea camellia.

AB  - The sustainable management of pig slurry (PS) in intensive farms is essential to reduce adverse environmental impacts and reduce the ecological footprint. If not managed properly, PS can release GHG/NH3 gases into the atmosphere and contaminate waters. This study evaluates the impact of an integral management system with physical and biological stages to mitigate the impact of PS. The system resulted in effective PS traceability, studying its physicochemical properties. The synergism in the whole system allowed a decrease in the most analyzed parameters during the autumn, spring, and summer. The pretreatment contributed significantly to obtaining an appreciable percentage of reduction in the constructed wetlands of SS (99-100%), COD (56-87%), TN (50-57%), and PO43- (88-100%). The emission values (g/m(2)/day) were 0-2.14 (CH4), 0-473.76 (CO2), 0-179.77 (H2O), 0-0.265 (N2O), and 0-0.195 (NH3), highlighting the raw, separated and manure fractions with the highest values. It is concluded that the system proves to be a practical, low-cost, and efficient technique for the treatment of PS. It significantly reduces the concentration of nutrients, and the intercepted byproducts can be valuable for application to the soil. In addition, the system effectively reduces GHG/NH3 emissions in decanted, purified, and wetland PS fractions.

AB  - The huge amounts of keratin-rich waste generated daily by various industries, slaughterhouses, and processing plants need to be properly managed. Most keratin degradation-related research focuses on keratin from bird feathers, but a vast minority focuses on keratin from sheep wool, which also presents a serious environmental problem. In this article, we describe the isolation, identification, and characterization of new keratinolytic microorganisms capable of sheep wool degradation from sheep wool and soil enriched with wool keratin. We isolated four bacterial species from the genus Bacillus (B. subtilis, B. altitudinis, B. mycoides, and B. wiedmannii), one streptomycete species Streptomyces coelicoflavus identified by whole genome sequencing, and a fungal species Aphanoascus reticulisporus. In some of the isolated microorganisms, we detected keratinolytic activity for the first time, and for most of them, the ability to degrade sheep wool has not been previously demonstrated. The keratinases of the new isolates are active in a wide range of temperatures (25-85 degrees C) and pH (6.0-10.0), so all isolates show great potential for further biotechnological use in industry and in various environmental and agricultural applications to reduce and recycle keratin-rich wastes such as sheep wool and waste woollen textiles.

AB  - Since heavy metals are toxic to herbivores and pathogens, the Elemental defence hypothesis suggested that metals accumulated in plants might serve as defence against herbivores and pathogen attacks. However, several studies have tested this hypothesis with regard to pathogen resistance are limited. Most existing studies used herbaceous species as study model while studies on tree species are still lacking. In this study, we used poplar as a study model, to investigate whether soil treatment with five different cadmium (Cd) concentrations can protect plants from artificial infection of a leaf pathogenic fungus. The results showed that the Cd concentrations accumulated in plant leaves were positively correlated with increasing Cd concentrations amended in the soil while negatively correlated with the disease severity index (DSI) of plants after pathogen infection. Additional partial correlation analysis indicated that the plant DSI was only significantly correlated with Cd concentration accumulated in plant leaves while plant growth parameters and other leaf substances showed no clear correlations. The in vitro toxicity test of fungal mycelium grown on a series of Cd concentrations amended in the artificial medium further showed that the mycelium growth decreased with increasing Cd concentrations contained in the medium, which confirmed the biological toxicity of Cd on this fungus independently of other organic defensive substances present in poplar leaves. In conclusion, our study supported the Elemental defence hypothesis and proved that even a lower accumulation of Cd in poplar plants can provide sufficient protection against leaf pathogen infection.

AB  - Recognizing rice seedling growth stages to timely do field operations, such as temperature control, fertilizer, irrigation, cultivation, and disease control, is of great significance of crop management, provision of standard and well-nourished seedlings for mechanical transplanting, and increase of yield. Conventionally, rice seedling growth stage is performed manually by means of visual inspection, which is not only labor-intensive and time-consuming, but also subjective and inefficient on a large-scale field. The application of machine learning algorithms on UAV images offers a high-throughput and non-invasive alternative to manual observations and its applications in agriculture and high-throughput phenotyping are increasing. This paper presented automatic approaches to detect rice seedling of three critical stages, BBCH11, BBCH12, and BBCH13. Both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were investigated the discriminative ability of the three growth stages. UAV images were captured vertically downward at 3-m height from the field. A dataset consisted of images of three growth stages of rice seedlings for three cultivars, five nursing seedling densities, and different sowing dates. In the traditional machine learning algorithm, histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs) were selected as texture features and combined with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to recognize and classify three growth stages. The best HOG-SVM model obtained the performance with 84.9, 85.9, 84.9, and 85.4% in accuracy, average precision, average recall, and F1 score, respectively. In the deep learning algorithm, the Efficientnet family and other state-of-art CNN models (VGG16, Resnet50, and Densenet121) were adopted and investigated the performance of three growth stage classifications. EfficientnetB4 achieved the best performance among other CNN models, with 99.47, 99.53, 99.39, and 99.46% in accuracy, average precision, average recall, and F1 score, respectively. Thus, the proposed method could be effective and efficient tool to detect rice seedling growth stages.

AB  - Trichomes are the epidermal appendages commonly observed on plant surfaces including leaves, stem and fruits. Plant trichomes have been well studied as a structural plant defence designed to protect plants against abiotic and biotic stressors such as UV rays, temperature extremities and herbivores. Trichomes are primarily classified into glandular and non-glandular trichomes, based on the presence or absence of a glandular head. The plant genus Solanum is the largest genus of family Solanaceae that houses similar to 3500 species of ecological and economic importance have a diverse set of trichomes that vary in density and morphology. However, due to the incomplete and contradictory classification system, trichomes have subjective names and have been largely limited to be grouped into glandular or non-glandular types. Through this study, we did a complete workup to classify and characterize trichomes on both adaxial and abaxial leaf surface of 14 wild and domesticated species of the genus Solarium. Using electron microscopy, statistical analyses and artistic rendition, we examined finer details of trichomes and measured their density and dimensions to compile a detailed data set which can be of use for estimating the variation in trichome types, and their density, with consequences for understanding their functional roles. Our study is the first of its kind that provides us with a better and well-defined classification, density and dimension analysis to complete the morphological classification of trichomes on both leaf surfaces of a diverse range of members in Solanum genus.

AB  - We designed a series of studies to investigate whether hypoxia (10% O-2) from 20% of incubation to hatching, or from 20 to 50% of incubation, affects cardiovascular function when juvenile American alligators reached an age of 4-5 years compared to juveniles that were incubated in 21% O-2. At this age, we measured blood flows in all the major arteries as well as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood gases in animals in normoxia and acute hypoxia (10% O-2 and 5% O-2). In all three groups, exposure to acute hypoxia of 10% O-2 caused a decrease in blood O-2 concentration and an increase in heart rate in 4-5-year-old animals, with limited effects on blood flow in the major outflow vessels of the heart. In response to more acute hypoxia (5% O-2), where blood O-2 concentration decreased even further, we measured increased heart rate and blood flow in the right aorta, subclavian artery, carotid artery, and pulmonary artery; however, blood flow in the left aorta either decreased or did not change. Embryonic exposure to hypoxia increased the threshold for eliciting an increase in heart rate indicative of a decrease in sensitivity. Alligators that had been incubated in hypoxia also had higher arterial PCO2 values in normoxia, suggesting a reduction in ventilation relative to metabolism.

AB  - Dairy goats experience metabolic stress during the peripartal period, and their ability to navigate this stage of lactation is related to the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases. Unlike dairy cows, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of changes in the plasma profiles of peripartal dairy goats, particularly using high-throughput techniques. A subset of 9 clinically-healthy dairy goats were used from a cohort of 96 primiparous Guanzhong dairy goats (BCS, 2.75 +/- 0.15). Blood samples were collected at seven time points around parturition (d 21, 14, 7 before parturition, the day of kidding, and d 7, 14, 21 postpartum), were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics and targeted lipidomics. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model revealed a total of 31 differential metabolites including p-cresol sulfate, pyruvic acid, cholic acid, and oxoglutaric acid. The pathway enrichment analysis identified phenylalanine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and citrate cycle as the top three significantly-altered pathways. The Limma package identified a total of 123 differentially expressed lipids. Phosphatidylserine (PS), free fatty acids (FFA), and acylcarnitines (ACs) were significantly increased on the day of kidding, while diacylglycerols (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG) decreased. Ceramides (Cer) and lyso-phosphatidylinositols (LPI) were significantly increased during postpartum period, while PS, FFA, and ACs decreased postpartum and gradually returned to antepartum levels. Individual species of FFA and phosphatidylcholines (PC) were segregated based on the differences in the saturation and length of the carbon chain. Overall, this work generated the largest repository of the plasma lipidome and metabolome in dairy goats across the peripartal period, which contributed to our understanding of the multifaceted adaptations of transition dairy goats.

AB  - Simple Summary Hunting dogs have been bred for centuries to assist people in their hunting activities. They possess excellent instincts and fitness. Evaluating the skills of hunting dogs is an important source of knowledge on how to use the hunting potential of dogs along with their training. Hunting trials consist of competitions that reflect different hunting situations. The results of the hunt trials of the boarhounds showed that there is a link between factors such as sex, age, breed group and breed and the performance of dogs. Boarhounds learn obedience easily, but they should practice other skills, such as tracking and announcing the game. Among different breed groups of boarhounds, the best performing ones were dachshunds. Boarhounds are hunting dogs bred for hunting wild boar, including terriers, dachshunds, and hounds. Hunt trials evaluate the individual hunting potential and trainability of the boarhounds in ten different competitions. The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing the hunt trials for boarhounds in a large cohort of hunting dogs. The analysis was conducted based on the results of hunt trials for boarhounds conducted in 2005-2015. The database contained 1867 individuals belonging to 39 breeds. Effects of sex, age, breed group, and breed were estimated by non-parametric analysis of variance. Sex influenced (p < 0.01) the total score, and in almost all competitions dogs performed better than bitches. Age affected (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) all competitions, indicating that the dogs perform better with age. The results analyzed by the breed group showed that the dachshunds performed better in courage (p < 0.01) and searching (p < 0.05). Breed influenced (p < 0.01) almost all scores except obedience and tracking on the lead. The best performing breed was Alpine Dachsbracke. In conclusion, all analyzed factors influenced the results of the hunt trials. The factors with the largest impact were breed and age, which reflect both the hunting potential and the level of training of the boarhounds.

AB  - Daylength, a seasonal and latitudinal variable, exerts a substantial impact on plant growth. However, the relationship between daylength and growth is nonproportional, suggesting the existence of adaptive mechanisms. Thus, our study aimed to comprehensively investigate the adaptive strategies employed by plants in response to daylength variation. We grew false flax (Camelina sativa) plants, a model oilseed crop, under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions and used growth measurements, gas exchange measurements, and isotopic labeling techniques, including 13C, 14C, and 2H2O, to determine responses to different daylengths. Our findings revealed that daylength influences various growth parameters, photosynthetic physiology, carbon partitioning, metabolic fluxes, and metabolite levels. SD plants employed diverse mechanisms to compensate for reduced CO2 fixation in the shorter photoperiod. These mechanisms included enhanced photosynthetic rates and reduced respiration in the light (RL), leading to increased shoot investment. Additionally, SD plants exhibited reduced rates of the glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) shunt and greater partitioning of sugars into starch, thereby sustaining carbon availability during the longer night. Isotopic labeling results further demonstrated substantial alterations in the partitioning of amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates between rapidly and slowly turning over pools. Overall, the results point to multiple developmental, physiological, and metabolic ways in which plants adapt to different daylengths to maintain growth.
   Plants adapt to varying daylengths through adjustments in growth, photosynthesis, carbon utilization, and metabolic flux.

AB  - Adverse weather conditions are important contributors to mortality in new-born lambs. Previous studies have shown variation between lambs in their ability to cope with circumstances of cold stress, and genetic selection could be a viable option for improving animal robustness. The Elsenburg Merino flock was divergently selected on number of lambs weaned (NLW). This resulted in divergent responses in reproduction and lamb survival. This study evaluated lamb vitality and mortality of positively selected H-Line relative to the negatively selected L-Line in response to cold stress. Traits included lamb rectal temperature (RT), surface temperature (ST), shiver score (SS), lamb vigor score (LVS), breaths per minute (BPM), mortality to three days of age (M3) and to weaning (TM). Cold stress was described by a chill index derived from daily rainfall, wind speed and ambient temperature, and represented as the mean of the one (CI), two (CI-2) or three (CI-3) days since parturition. Overall, HLine lambs had a higher neonatal RT and were less likely to succumb than L-Line contemporaries. In a significant (P < 0.05) interaction, the predicted RT of L-Line showed a non-linear decline with increased levels of CI-2, while H-Line lambs better maintained their core temperature. M3 was also affected by a significant interaction between CI-3 and selection line, further suggesting that observed lower mortality rates in the H-Line depends on H-Line lambs' improved ability to cope with stressful environments. Long term selection for NLW in the H-Line led to improvements in both adaptations associated with lower lamb losses. The continued recording of viability traits to produce larger datasets amenable to genetic analysis is recommended, specifically for rectal temperature.

AB  - Cutaneous scent glands secrete chemical signals for communication, a significant portion of which is to convey information about male reproductive status. This might be particularly important to animals with intraspecific variation in male reproductive activity, such as bears. Male brown bears mark trees with their scent secreted from back apocrine and sebaceous glands during the breeding season and thus might convey information about reproductive status. Therefore, we speculated that the development of scent glands in the back reflects reproductive performance. We investigated the effects of reproductive status on the development of scent glands in the back using contraception and explored relationships between reproductive parameters (testosterone levels, testis size, and spermatogenic scores) and the size of skin glands in the backs of intact male brown bears. During the breeding season, we sampled back and rump (control) skin, sperms by urethral catheterization, and blood under anesthesia from four male bears that were vaccinated with the contraceptive gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine and five others that were not (controls). The back sebaceous and apocrine glands were significantly smaller in bears vaccinated with than without GnRH vaccine, suggesting that these glands are associated with reproductive status. Testosterone levels were significantly and positively associated with the size of sebaceous glands, whereas none of the reproductive parameters were associated with the size of either sebaceous or apocrine glands. Mating opportunities increase testosterone production. The positive association between testosterone and sebaceous glands might mean that sebaceous glands in the back can secrete chemicals on demand for reproduction.

AB  - White-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), are the primary wildlife host for adult stages of blacklegged ticks (Acari: Ixodidae: Ixodes scapularis Say) and an important host for lone star ticks (Acari: Ixodidae: Amblyomma americanum Linnaeus), both of which are vectors of numerous tick-borne pathogens. The 4-poster passive deer treatment device is a topical, host-targeted method to control free-living tick populations and has been proven to successfully reduce tick abundance in several states. Aggressive behavior of white-tailed deer at concentrated feeding stations is hypothesized to interfere with the effective use of 4-poster devices and deer contact with acaricide applicators. We analyzed images collected by camera traps at 4-poster feeding stations deployed at 3 sites in Maryland and found a negative relationship between some aggressive interactions and contact with applicators. Our results emphasize the need for further investigation into whether deer social dynamics can impact 4-poster efficacy for tick control. This study serves as a reminder that intraspecific interactions are important to consider when using host-targeted acaricide approaches.

AB  - Distinguishing early domesticates from their wild progenitors presents a significant obstacle for understanding human-mediated effects in the past. The origin of dogs is particularly controversial because potential early dog remains often lack corroborating evidence that can provide secure links between proposed dog remains and human activity. The Tumat Puppies, two permafrost-preserved Late Pleistocene canids, have been hypothesized to have been littermates and early domesticates due to a physical association with putatively butchered mammoth bones. Through a combination of osteometry, stable isotope analysis, plant macrofossil analysis, and genomic and metagenomic analyses, this study exploits the unique properties of the naturally mummified Tumat Puppies to examine their familial relationship and to determine whether dietary information links them to human activities. The multifaceted analysis reveals that the 14,965-14,046 cal yr BP Tumat Puppies were littermates who inhabited a dry and relatively mild environment with heterogeneous vegetation and consumed a diverse diet, including woolly rhinoceros in their final days. However, because there is no evidence of mammoth consumption, these data do not establish a link between the canids and ancient humans.

AB  - The generation of adventitious roots (ARs) is the key to the success of cuttings. The appropriate environment for AR differentiation in tea plants is acidic. However, the mechanism is unclear. In this study, pH 4.5 was suitable condition for the differentiation of AR in tea plants. At the base of cuttings, the root primordia differentiated ARs more rapidly at pH 4.5 than pH 7.0, and nine AR differentiation-related genes were found to be differentially expressed in 30 days, the result was also validated by qRT-PCR. The promoter regions of these genes contained auxin and brassinosteroid response elements. The expression levels of several genes which were involved in auxin and brassinosteroid synthesis as well as signaling at pH 4.5 compared to pH 7.0 occurred differential expression. Brassinolide (BL) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) could affect the differentiation of ARs under pH 4.5 and pH 7.0. By qRT-PCR analysis of genes during ARs generation, BL and IAA inhibited and promoted the expression of CsIAA14 gene, respectively, to regulate auxin signal transduction. Meanwhile, the expression levels of CsKNAT4, CsNAC2, CsNAC100, CsWRKY30 and CsLBD18 genes were up-regulated upon auxin treatment and were positively correlated with ARs differentiation.This study showed that pH 4.5 was the most suitable environment for the root primordia differentiation of AR in tea plant. Proper acidic pH conditions promoted auxin synthesis and signal transduction. The auxin initiated the expression of AR differentiation-related genes, and promoted its differentiated. BL was involved in ARs formation and elongation by regulating auxin signal transduction.

AB  - The price of pork, as an important livelihood indicator in China, and its price fluctuations have a significant impact on the lives of residents and social stability. Therefore, it is vital to study the main factors that affect pork price fluctuations and implement targeted regulatory measures in a timely manner. In the context of the increasing number of pig epidemics and increased pork imports, it is necessary to consider the impact of pig epidemics and imported pork on pork price fluctuations, which can more accurately reflect actual pork price fluctuations in China. In this paper, a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model was applied to analyze the main factors affecting pork price fluctuations from the aspects of the pork price, supply and demand changes, and pig epidemic shocks. The results indicated that the impact of the pork price on pork price fluctuations was the largest, with the largest contribution rate, whereas the current month's pork price had a 29.60% impact on the pork price 18 months later. The supply factor that affected the pork price was the pig herd, with the current month's pig herd having a 34.85% impact on the pork price after 18 months. Imported pork had a relatively small structural impact on pork price fluctuations, with a positive impact in the first four months and a subsequent negative impact. However, pig epidemics mainly caused pork price fluctuations by changing the market relation between demand and supply, with the current month's epidemic depth index having a 9.78% impact on the pork price 18 months later. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended to focus on the monitoring and early warning of the pork price by analyzing big data, promoting large-scale farming, and strengthening the implementation of early prevention and control measures during disease outbreaks to stabilize pig herd and achieve a stable pork market supply and price.

AB  - BACKGROUND Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) cause widespread environmental and economic damage, and as a result are subjected to extensive control. Current management strategies have proven insufficient, and there is growing interest in use of toxicants to control invasive populations of this species. In 2017 a low-dose warfarin bait was federally approved for use in controlling wild pigs in the United States. However, no states have allowed use of this bait due to unanswered questions regarding welfare concerns, field efficacy, and non-target impacts.
   RESULTS All captive wild pigs fed 0.005% warfarin baits in no choice feeding trials succumbed in an average of 8 days from exposure. Behavioral symptoms of warfarin exposure included vomiting, external bleeding, abnormal breathing, incoordination, and limping. Postmortem examinations revealed hemorrhaging in organs and muscles, particularly the legs, gastrointestinal tract, and abdomen. Warfarin residues in tissues averaged 1.0 mg kg(-1) for muscle, 3.9 mg kg(-1) for liver, and 2.8 mg kg(-1) for small intestines. Field testing revealed wild pigs required extensive training to access bait within pig-specific bait stations, and once acclimated, exhibited reluctance to consume toxic baits, resulting in no mortalities across two separate field deployments of toxic bait.
   CONCLUSION Our results suggest wild pigs are susceptible to low-dose warfarin, and warfarin residues in pig tissues postmortem are generally low. However, although warfarin-based baits are currently approved for use by the US Environmental Protection Agency, further improvements to pig-specific bait delivery systems and bait palatability are needed, as well as additional research to quantify efficacy, cost, and non-target impacts prior to widespread implementation.

AB  - Social learning, information transmission and culture play vital roles in the lives of social animals, influencing their survival, reproduction and ability to adapt to changing environments. However, the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on these processes is poorly understood in free-living animals. To investigate the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on social learning and information transmission, we simulated individual removal from contact networks derived from long-term behavioural datasets. We simulate the effects of individual removal on network efficiency and social learning for three group-living species-yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). We reveal how removals of key network positions reduce network efficiency. However, groups with high levels of innovation may cope with changing social network structures. These findings highlight the importance of protecting key individuals to preserve group structure and the role of innovation in possibly mitigating the fitness costs of removals. Identifying and safeguarding individuals that drive innovation can reduce a group's susceptibility to anthropogenic threats and promote cultural resilience in social animals in a changing world. These emerging trends contribute to a growing understanding of the role of conservation interventions in protecting critical individuals in group-living animals.This article is part of the theme issue 'Animal culture: conservation in a changing world'.

AB  - Sperm quality is an important indicator to evaluate the reproduction ability of animals. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) participates in cell energy metabolism and reduces cell oxidative stress. However, the effect and regulatory mechanism of NMN on porcine sperm quality are still unknown. Here, 32 Landrace boars were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 8) and fed with different levels of NMN (0, 8, 16 or 32 mg/kg/d) for 9 weeks, and then serum and semen samples of the boars were collected to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of NMN in sperm quality. The results showed that the dietary NMN supplementation significantly increased sperm volume, density and motility (p < 0.05). Interestingly, NMN apparently improved the antioxidative indexes and increased the levels of testosterone (p < 0.05) in serum. Furthermore, NMN upregulated the protein levels of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), antioxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), but downregulated the protein levels of apoptosis in semen. Mechanically, NMN protected sperm from H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through SIRT3 deacetylation. Importantly, the SIRT3-specific inhibitor 3-TYP attenuated the antioxidation and antiapoptosis of NMN in sperm. Therefore, NMN exerts antioxidation and antiapoptosis to improve boar sperm quality via the SIRT3 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that NMN is a novel potential boar antioxidative feed additive to produce high-quality porcine semen.

AB  - Incidental mortality of marine birds in fisheries is an international conservation concern, including in Canada where globally significant populations of vulnerable diving species overlap with coastal gillnet fisheries. In British Columbia (BC), commercial salmon gillnet fishing effort was historically very high ( 200,000 days fished annually in the early 1950?s), and although this fishery has declined, over 6,400 days were fished annually in the 2006?2016 decade. Observations of seabird bycatch within the commercial fishery, however, are limited in both scope (comprising <2% of cumulative effort 2001?2016) and in time (being available only from 1995 onwards and only for a small number of areas). Using onboard fishery observer data from commercial, test and experimental fisheries (1995?2016), we developed two models to estimate the number of marine birds captured per set in sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and chum (O. keta) salmon gillnet fisheries employing a Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling (GLMM) approach in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with observer data post-stratified by fisheries management area and year. Using estimates of total commercial fishing effort (estimated number of sets, 2001?2016) we applied the models to extrapolate annual take for the main bird species (or groups) of interest. Multinomial probability estimates of species composition were calculated based upon a sample of 852 birds identified to species that were associated with sockeye or chum fisheries, enabling estimates (with CIs) of potential numbers of the mostly commonly observed species (common murres (Uria aalge), rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), and marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus)) entangled annually in commercial sockeye and chum salmon gillnet fisheries throughout BC. Conservative estimates of annual losses to entanglement were greatest for common murres (2,846, 95% CI: 2,628?3,047), followed by rhinoceros auklets (641, CI: 549?770) and marbled murrelets (228 CI: 156?346). Populations of all three of these alcids species are currently in decline in BC and entanglement mortality is a conservation concern. Gillnet mortality has been identified as a longstanding threat to marbled murrelet populations, which are recognized as Threatened in the Canada and the United States of America (USA). In addition, 622 (CI: 458?827) birds from 12 other species were estimated to be entangled annually. We conclude that cumulative mortality from incidental take in salmon gillnet fisheries is one of the largest sources of human-induced mortality for marine birds in BC waters, a conservation concern impacting both breeders and visiting migrants.

AB  - Since the efficiency of pig breeding largely depends on the reproductive ability of sows, one of the promising areas of research in animal husbandry is the study of factors whose correction can improve the fertility and quality of the offspring. Our work purpose was to investigate the effect of gilts' feeding level, MC4R genotype and interaction of these factors on the reproductive traits pigs after reaching puberty. The object of the study was crossbred pigs obtained as a result of the combination of sows of the Large White breed with boars of the Landrace breed. To carry out the research, the animals were divided into four groups that differed among themselves by the genotype of the melanocortin 4 receptor gene and the level of feeding of the experimental animals. To determine the genotype, the PCR-RFLP method was utilized. Genetic studies were conducted in a certified laboratory of the Institute of Pig Breeding and Agroindustrial Production. The reproductive capacity of the pigs was determined after receiving the farrowing by the following traits: piglets born alive per farrowing (animals), weight of litters of piglets at birth (kg), average weight of piglet at birth (kg), number of weaning piglets (animals), weight of litters of piglets at 28 days (kg), average weight of piglet at 28 days (kg), average daily gain of suckling piglets from 0 to 28 days (g). It was established that the traits of reproductive ability of crossbred Large White x Landrace pigs were affected by the interaction of genotype and feeding factors. When limiting the nutritional value of the daily diet, sows with the AG genotype outperformed those with the GG genotype by 1.2 piglets born alive per farrowing, by 3.0 kg for litter weight at birth, and by 0.1 kg for the average weight of a piglet at birth. The advantage of the AG genotype for average piglet weight at 28 days was even larger. Conversely, in conditions of a high level of feeding, animals with the GG genotype had higher productivity in terms of such traits as piglets born alive per farrowing - by 1.6 animals; weight of litters of piglets at birth - by 4.1 kg; for average weight of piglet at birth - 0.2 kg; by number of weaning piglets - 2.0 animals; by weight of litters of piglets at 28 days - 28.8 kg; for average weight of piglet at 28 days - 1.1 kg and for average daily gain from 0 to 28 days - 34.6 g. In the future, the goal is to develop a system of differentiated rationing of pigs' diets depending on their genotype.

AB  - Despite the fact that over a 100 anopheline mosquito species have been identified as human malaria vectors, little is known about ungulate malaria vectors. Consequently, we focused on investigating the bionomics and genetic characterizations of anopheline mosquitoes in goat malaria-endemic regions. We also attempted to screen for ungulate malaria potential vectors. A total of 1019 female anopheline mosquitoes were collected from six goat farms in four provinces of Thailand from 2020 to 2021. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified and subsequently confirmed using the mitochondrial DNA barcoding region-cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (MtDNA-COI), mitochondrial DNA-cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MtDNA-COII), and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (rDNA-ITS2) sequences. The current study reveals the genetic characteristics and distribution of nine mosquito species within the Anopheles and Cellia subgenera. Four dominant species, including Anopheles peditaeniatus, Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles vagus, and Anopheles aconitus exhibited significant intraspecific gene flow within their corresponding species. Although malaria parasites were not found in 126 mosquito pools, meaning more investigation is necessary, the current study adds to the existing DNA barcoding data collection and improves the current understanding of the genetic structure and distribution of anopheline mosquito species, which could be useful for effective control of mosquito-borne diseases.

AB  - Milk is one of the basic sources of nutrition. With the increasing incidence of allergies and the spread of knowledge about a healthy lifestyle, consumers are changing their eating habits, which partly leads to the reintroduction of goat's milk into the diet. This study aimed to evaluate and describe the genotypic and allelic structure of Slovak White Shorthaired goats for the CSN1S1 gene. For genotyping, PCR, AS-PCR and PIRA-PCR methods. The He and FIS were used for the description of the diversity of the population. Alleles E and F were the most frequent 0.3710 and 0.2944 respectively followed by B (0.1492) and A (0.1169). The less abundant allele was N with an occurrence of 0.0685. The most abundant genotypes were EF (0.2339), BE (0.1693) AN and EE with an occurrence of 0.1129 both. The White Shorthaired goat breed exhibits high values of heterozygosity (0.7661), polymorphism information content (0.6921), the effective number of alleles (3.7736) and level of possible variability realization (74.1%) for the CSN1S1 gene. The inbreeding level of the population represents a negative value (-0.0355), which indicates enough heterozygotes in the population.

AB  - Human-directed fear in extensively reared sheep is often high due to the aversive nature of common husbandry procedures and infrequent interactions with humans. This study investigated whether additional human expo-sure provided to weaned lambs reduced human-directed fear and behavioural reactivity. Ninety Merino lambs were either exposed to low or moderately stressful human exposure sessions, or had no additional human contact, and their fear responses and behavioural reactivity to humans, a startle stimulus and confinement were tested. Overall, the imposed interventions did not reduce behavioural reactivity during these tests, suggesting fear towards humans had not been altered.

AB  - Individual behavior varies for many reasons, but how early in life are such differences apparent, and are they under selection? We investigated variation in early-life behavior in a wild eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) population, and quantified associations of behavior with early survival. Behavior of young was measured while still in the pouch and as subadults, and survival to weaning was monitored. We found consistent variation between offspring of different mothers in levels of activity at the pouch stage, in flight initiation distance (FID) as subadults, and in subadult survival, indicating similarity between siblings. There was no evidence of covariance between the measures of behavior at the pouch young versus subadult stages, nor of covariance of the early-life behavioral traits with subadult survival. However, there was a strong covariance between FIDs of mothers and those of their offspring tested at different times. Further, of the total repeatability of subadult FID (51.5%), more than half could be attributed to differences between offspring of different mothers. Our results indicate that 1) behavioral variation is apparent at a very early stage of development (still in the pouch in the case of this marsupial); 2) between-mother differences can explain much of the repeatability (or "personality") of juvenile behavior; and 3) mothers and offspring exhibit similar behavioral responses to stimuli. However, 4) we found no evidence of selection via covariance between early-life or maternal behavioral traits and juvenile survival in this wild marsupial.
   We report evidence for consistent individual differences in behavior among eastern gray kangaroos. Behavioral variation was apparent at a very early stage of development (still in the pouch in the case of this marsupial), and between-mother differences could explain personality variation in juvenile behavior. In addition, mothers and offspring showed similar behavioral responses to stimuli. However, there was relationship between early-life or maternal behavioral traits and juvenile survival.

AB  - The analysis of population genetic structure and individual multilocus heterozygosity are crucial for wildlife management and conservation. Microsatellite markers have traditionally been used to assess these genetic parameters. However, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming increasingly popular. Our goal here was to determine to what extent SNPs can provide better insights than microsatellites into the overall genetic status and population genetic processes in the species. To this end, we genotyped 210 red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Spanish wild population with both 11 microsatellites and 31,712 SNPs. We compared parameters related to population genetic structure and individual multilocus heterozygosity obtained with both types of markers. Our results showed correlations between parameters measured using both microsatellites and SNPs, particularly those related to the level of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation. However, we found notably lower precision of microsatellites in measuring the distribution of genetic diversity among individuals. We conclude that microsatellites can be used to monitor the overall genetic status and detect broad patterns in red deer populations. Nevertheless, the greater precision of SNPs in inferring genetic structure and multilocus heterozygosity leads us to encourage scientists and wildlife managers to prioritize their use whenever possible.

AB  - Simple Summary
   As of now, the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis has not been utilized to identify biological processes and signaling pathways that are regulated in the boar postnatal testes. Our prior studies revealed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were significant for the morpho-functional status of testicular cells. Here, the pharmacological blockage of PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma or GPER was performed in ex vivo immature boar testes. The NGS results showed 382 transcripts with an altered expression. The blockage by the PPAR gamma antagonist markedly affected biological processes such as: drug metabolism (genes: Ctsh, Duox2, Atp1b1, Acss2, Pkd2, Aldh2, Hbb, Sdhd, Cox3, Nd4, Nd5, Cytb, Cbr1, and Pid1), adhesion (genes: Plpp3, Anxa1, Atp1b1, S100a8, Cd93, Ephb4, Vsir, Cldn11, Gpc4, Fermt3, Dusp26, Sox9, and Cdh5) and tube development (genes: Ctsh, Mmp14, Dll4, Anxa1, Ephb4, Pkd2, Angptl4, Robo4, Sox9, Hikeshi, Ing2, Loc100738836, and Rarres2), as well as the Notch signaling pathway. This was not the case for the PPAR alpha or GPER antagonists. Our observations suggested that PPAR gamma may be the principal player in the management of the development and function of boar testes during the early postnatal window. Moreover, due to a highly similar porcine gene expression pattern to human homologues genes, our results can be used to understand both animal and human testes physiology and to predict or treat pathological processes.
   Porcine tissue gene expression is highly similar to the expression of homologous genes in humans. Based on this fact, the studies on porcine tissues can be employed to understand human physiology and to predict or treat diseases. Our prior studies clearly showed that there was a regulatory partnership of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and the G-protein coupled membrane estrogen receptor (GPER) that relied upon the tumorigenesis of human and mouse testicular interstitial cells, as well as the PPAR-estrogen related receptor and GPER-xenoestrogen relationships which affected the functional status of immature boar testes. The main objective of this study was to identify the biological processes and signaling pathways governed by PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma and GPER in the immature testes of seven-day-old boars after pharmacological receptor ligand treatment. Boar testicular tissues were cultured in an organotypic system with the respective PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma or GPER antagonists. To evaluate the effect of the individual receptor deprivation in testicular tissue on global gene expression, Next Generation Sequencing was performed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 382 transcripts with altered expression. While tissues treated with PPAR alpha or GPER antagonists showed little significance in the enrichment analysis, the antagonists challenged with the PPAR gamma antagonist displayed significant alterations in biological processes such as: drug metabolism, adhesion and tubule development. Diverse disruption in the Notch signaling pathway was also observed. The findings of our study proposed that neither PPAR alpha nor GPER, but PPAR gamma alone seemed to be the main player in the regulation of boar testes functioning during early the postnatal developmental window.

AB  - Black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) rely on behavioral and dietary flexibility to survive in temperate latitudes at high-elevation habitats characterized by climate and resource seasonality. However, little is known about how elevation influences their behavioral and dietary flexibility at monthly or seasonal scales. We studied an isolated R. bieti population at Mt. Lasha in the Yunling Provincial Nature Reserve, Yunnan, China, between May 2008 and August 2016 to assess the impacts of elevation on feeding behavior and diet. Across our sample, R. bieti occupied elevations between 3031 and 3637 m above mean sea level (amsl), with a 315.1 m amsl range across months and a 247.3 m amsl range across seasons. Contrary to expectations, individuals spent less time feeding when ranging across higher elevations. Lichen consumption correlated with elevation use across months and seasons, with individuals spending more time feeding on this important resource at higher elevations. Leaf consumption only correlated with elevation use during the spring. Our results suggest that R. bieti do not maximize their food intake at higher elevations and that monthly and seasonal changes in lichen and leaf consumption largely explain variation in elevation use. These findings shed light on the responses of R. bieti to environmental change and offer insight into strategies for conserving their habitats in the face of anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Innovative conservation approaches are urgently needed to balance biodiversity conservation with human development. Safeguarding elephant populations often involves active management, leading to direct intentional, direct unintentional, and indirect consequences for animals, people, and ecosystems. Drawing from One Health and One Welfare principles, our study introduces a multicriteria framework for developing conservation strategies that enhance well-being across dimensions. This approach establishes priorities, acceptability zones, and One Well-being scores that guide decision making toward optimal outcomes. We applied our One Well-being framework to evaluate 12 elephant management interventions currently or historically used in South Africa. Examining data from 3306 instances of these interventions, including on-the-ground data, we assessed their relative impact on environmental, human, and animal well-being. Our analysis identified 250 consequences of these interventions, categorized as 58 direct intentional, 127 direct unintentional, and 65 indirect. Although most direct intentional consequences were beneficial (93.4%), the direct unintentional and indirect consequences were predominantly harmful (96.9% and 75.4%, respectively). Although most interventions improved environmental well-being, their consequences for animal and human well-being were less positive. This highlights a conflict among the three well-being dimensions, underscoring the importance of incorporating human and animal well-being into elephant management strategies. Recognizing the interconnected nature of these dimensions and aiming for multiple, mutually reinforcing gains is imperative. This iterative process helps address social-ecological vulnerabilities and risks while advocating for ethical conservation practices, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, and garnering broader support for conservation efforts. Our approach aligns with global goals for sustainable and equitable wildlife management outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep farming plays a prominent role in the agriculture and economy of tropical regions, including the Brazilian semi-arid region. Rural producers have adopted Mimosa tenuiflora hay as a feed option for sheep and goats due to its prevalence in these areas. However, it is important to point out that Mimosa tenuiflora hay contains tannins, compounds with antinutritional and astringent properties. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the interaction of natural tannins derived from legumes with a ruminal metabolism in terms of energy and water balance. The inclusion of Mimosa tenuiflora hay as a source of tannins in the diet of hair lambs can potentially have positive effects on animal consumption. This study aims to evaluate the effects of increasing tannin levels from Mimosa tenuiflora hay on the intake, digestibility, and balance of nitrogen (N), water, and energy in hair lambs. Thirty-two Santa Ines lambs, at an average age of 150 days and body weight of 26.75 & PLUSMN; 2.29 kg, were randomly assigned to four treatments in a completely randomized design. The treatments consisted of four diets: a control diet, tannin-free, and three diets with increasing levels of total tannin, 26.2, 52.4, and 78.6 g tannin/kg dry matter (DM). Including the total tannins in the lambs' diet led to a quadratic increase in the intake of nutrients, N-retention (g/day), water intake, water absorption and retention, energy intake, and energy excretion in feces and gases. However, the digestibility of crude protein, neutral and acid detergent fibers, and total carbohydrates decreased. It was observed that there is a correlation between the variable nutrient digestibility and N-ingested and the N-absorbed, N-urinary, and N-retained. However, the N-excreted in feces did not correlate with any of the variables studied. It is recommended to include 33 g/kg DM of total natural tannins from Mimosa tenuiflora hay in the diet of hair lambs, as it improves intake, energy balance, dietary N, and body water composition while reducing the excretion of N-urinary and gas emissions to the environment.

AB  - The conditions experienced by one plant generation can influence the growth of the offspring generation. These maternal effects can reduce performance of foliar-feeding insects, through accumulation of plant defences. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inhabit the roots of plants and are known to influence the performance of foliar-feeding insects. However, all published studies of the interactions between insects and AMF have taken place within one plant generation, but none across generations. Thus, in the present study, Senecio vulgaris plants were grown with or without aphids and AMF (termed 'induction events'), and seeds from each treatment were used to grow plants experiencing that same treatment over four successive generations, all grown in identical environmental conditions. Naive aphids were reared on Senecio plants whose parents had experienced 0, 1, 2 or 3 induction events. We found strong negative maternal effects of herbivory on aphid growth, which were not mitigated by the mycorrhiza. However, teneral weight and growth rate showed a gradual recovery; aphids reared on plants whose previous three generations suffered attack were similar in size to those at the beginning of the study. Herbivory had positive or negative effects on the mycorrhiza, dependent upon the number of previous generations suffering attack or having mycorrhizal associations. We conclude that the outcome of many insect plant fungal experiments is likely to have been influenced by and need to account for maternal effects of the parental plant's growth conditions.

AB  - Background Extracellular ATP (exATP) has been shown to act as a signal molecule for regulating growth, development, and responses of plants to the external environment. Results In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of exATP in regulating the stunted growth caused by repeated wounding. The present work showed that the repeated wounding caused the decreases in leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, and root length of Arabidopsis seedlings, while the exATP level was enhanced by the repeated wounding. Repeated application of exogenous ATP had similar effects on the plant growth, as the repeated wounding. Through the comparison of p2k1-3 mutant (in which T-DNA disrupted the gene coding P2K1, as exATP receptor) and wide type (WT) plants, it was found that the mutation in P2K1 decreased the sensitivity of plant growth to the repeated wounding and exogenous ATP application. Further works showed that the ibuprofen (IBU, an inhibitor of jasmonate biosynthesis) partially rescued the wound-induced growth degradation. In comparison, the P2K1 mutation partly rescued the wound-induced growth degradation, whereas this mutation failed to do so in the wounded seedlings treated with IBU, indicating that the role of exATP in regulating the growth degradation by repeated wounding could be linked to the JA signaling pathway. Conclusions In conclusion, these results indicate that exATP could be a regulator for the stunted growth of plants by repeated wounding.

AB  - Recently, biologists have become increasingly interested in cognitive variation among individuals and how it relates to differences in fitness. However, very few studies so far have studied the long-term repeatability and heritability of cognitive performance in wild animals. This is nevertheless crucial in-formation to fully understand the potential ecological and evolutionary impact of individual variation in cognitive performance. In 2019, we assessed exploration, problem solving and spatial and reversal learning in 66 Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii, then released them in seminatural enclosures consisting of either simple or complex habitat. One year later, we recaptured and retested the surviving lizards and their offspring to estimate the long-term repeatability and heritability of these behavioural and cognitive characteristics. We found that exploration and spatial learning were moderately repeat-able, but reversal learning only marginally and learning flexibility and problem solving not at all. Reversal learning ability declined over time in lizards kept in simple habitat, but not in those kept in complex habitats -suggesting habitat-dependent cognitive plasticity. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating (long-term) consistency in cognitive traits within a nonavian reptile. The combination of modest repeatability and low heritability does suggest that, within our study species, personality and cognitive variation among individuals and populations is mostly moulded by environmental effects.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Free-living species exhibit seasonal variation in various life history traits, including vital rates such as birth and death patterns. Different physiological mechanisms are thought to underlie the expression of life history traits that contribute to lifetime fitness. However, although the broad impacts of seasonality on life history traits and trade-offs is well established in many systems, the exact physiological mechanisms responsible for driving differences within and between individuals are poorly understood. Among them, molecular and physiological stress pathways, such as stress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and oxidative stress, have potential to mediate relationships between individual survival, reproduction and environmental seasonality. Here, we determine how different physiological markers of stress including faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs), heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio, two markers indicating oxidative balance including a marker of oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROM) and a marker of antioxidant defences (superoxide dismutase, SOD) and body weight vary in a large semi-captive population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) exposed to extreme seasonality (e.g. elevated temperatures). Individuals showed higher FCM levels and H/L ratios during cold season, indicating increased stress, and the lowest FCM levels during monsoon season and H/L ratios during hot and dry season, but we found no pattern in oxidative stress (ROM and SOD) levels. Hot season also associated with a decline in body weight. The present study shows how different physiological parameters (FCM levels and H/L ratio), molecular (oxidative stress) and body condition vary with seasonal changes, and how these parameters might allow individuals to adapt to such variations. Our results on an endangered long-lived species are crucial in indicating the most productive timing for conservation efforts, predicting how individuals cope with environmental changes, and allow for a more accurate representation of how animal physiology operates in nature.

AB  - The silicon carbide (SiC) layer in tristructural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles serves as a barrier to prevent the escape of fission products produced and not retained in the fuel kernel. The release of silver (Ag) is a concern due to the long half-life of the 110mAg isotope. However, accurately determining the fission gas release rate requires knowing the diffusion coefficient through the SiC layer. In this study, we leverage atomistic calculations of Ag diffusivity in SiC bulk and grain boundaries (GBs) to develop a mesoscale effective Ag diffusion coefficient (D-eff ) in SiC. Since GBs serve as pathways for Ag diffusion, D-eff is defined as a function of temperature and microstructure variables. In particular, the size of SiC grains in the direction perpendicular to diffusion is shown to significantly affect Ag diffusion. The prediction of the mechanistic, mesoscale approach falls within one order of magnitude of empirical values. The temperature and microstructure-dependent effective Ag diffusivity in SiC is implemented in the fuel performance code Bison with a correction factor to predict Ag release from AGR-1 TRISO fuel particles. We hereby quantify the impact of SiC grain size on Ag release and improve Bison's predictions.& nbsp;Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Determining animal distribution and density is important in conservation. The process is both time-consuming and labour-intensive. Drones have been used to help mitigate human-intensive tasks by covering large geographical areas over a much shorter timescale. In this paper we investigate this idea further using a proof of concept to detect rhinos and cars from drone footage. The proof of concept utilises off-the-shelf technology and consumer-grade drone hardware. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) to automate routine conservation tasks, such as animal detection and tracking. The prototype has been developed using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 and tested over a global system for mobile communications (GSM) network. The Faster-RCNN Resnet 101 architecture is used for transfer learning. Inference is performed with a frame sampling technique to address the required trade-off between precision, processing speed, and live video feed synchronisation. Inference models are hosted on a web platform and video streams from the drone (using OcuSync) are transmitted to a real-time messaging protocol (RTMP) server for subsequent classification. During training, the best model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.83 intersection over union (@IOU) 0.50 and 0.69 @IOU 0.75, respectively. On testing the system in Knowsley Safari our prototype was able to achieve the following: sensitivity (Sen), 0.91 (0.869, 0.94); specificity (Spec), 0.78 (0.74, 0.82); and an accuracy (ACC), 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) when detecting rhinos, and Sen, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00); Spec, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00); and an ACC, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00) when detecting cars.

AB  - Spiders play a crucial role in regulating herbivorous insect populations within both agricultural and natural ecosystems, and their life-history traits are significantly influenced by the nutritional profiles of their prey. This study evaluates the effects of three prey species-midges ( Tendipes sp.), fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster), and mealworm beetles ( Tenebrio molitor)-on the growth, survival, and reproductive success of the funnel-web spider Allagelena difficilis. We found that juvenile spiders fed a diet of midges and mealworm beetle larvae exhibited accelerated development and greater maturation, resulting in enhanced growth compared to those fed fruit flies. While the type of prey did not influence mating behavior or reproductive success, a diet of midges was associated with increased female longevity. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between the age at mating of male spiders and the likelihood of egg sac production by females, underscoring the importance of male age in spider reproduction. These findings enhance our understanding of spider ecology and suggest their potential role in sustainable pest management.

AB  - Productive and nutritional evaluations of native grasses are usually scarce, limiting their use in the feeding of herbivorous species. This study aims to determine the forage yield and nutritional value of native grasses from the floodplain "banks" ecosystem in the Colombian Orinoquia. Four native grasses (Paspalum plicatulum, Axonopus compresus, Axonopus purpussi, and Paspalum spp.) and a "control" grass (introduced Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato) were sown and sampled at 30, 40, and 50 days of age. On each sampling date, biomass production in a 1 m(2) frame was estimated, and the chemical composition was analyzed using near-infrared spectroscopy. Data analysis included repeated measures analysis, correlations, and multiple linear regression. The grasses' nutritional characteristics varied as follows: dry matter (DM, 0.9-2.5 ton/ha), crude protein (CP, 4.3-10.2%), neutral detergent fiber (NDF, 61-73.9%) ash (3.2-8.7%), and dry matter digestibility (DMD, 50.8-56.3%). P. plicatulum achieved comparable forage production to that of the "control" grass. A. purpussi, Paspalum sp., and P. plicatulum presented similar CP and ash contents, and a higher Ca:P ratio. Regression analysis indicated that DMD was affected by the CP and acid detergent fiber (ADF) levels. These native grasses constitute promising nutritional alternatives that must be considered in the region's livestock-production systems; however, detailed studies to evaluate animal performance and consumption are still required.

AB  - To date, leaf consumption in bats has not been considered 'true folivory' because bats chew bits of leaves, extract and swallow their juices, and discard their fibre. The term 'leaf fractionation' is used to distinguish this behaviour from true folivory, or the consumption of full leaves, such as exhibited by herbivores. For over three decades, it has been posited that the consumption of entire leaves - leaf fibre included - would require a digestive system incompatible with bats' ability to fly. Natural history observations can amend long-accepted assumptions, however. We observed a common Neotropical frugivorous bat consuming mature leaves in their entirety, without discarding any part. This anecdotal observation begs further investigation, opening the possibility for a shift in our current understanding of bat feeding behaviour. Because the consumption and digestion of whole leaves leave no readily observable trace (i.e., no dropped remains below the roost), this behaviour may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. While feeding exclusively on leaves remains unlikely in bats, our anecdotal observation reveals that true folivory does indeed take place. Our objective in publishing this observation is to invite research on the role of whole leaves in the diets of bats and their physiological implications. Exploring the effect of leaf consumption on potential self-medication is also paramount. Bats, long recognized for their spectacular dietary diversity, may now be known to feed not only on insects, fruit, nectar, pollen, vertebrates, and blood, but also on entire leaves.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) management is essential for food security. The North China Plain is an important food producing region, but also a hotspot of N losses to the environment. This results in water, soil, and air pollution. In this study, we aim to quantify the relative contribution of different crops and animals to N losses, by taking the Quzhou county as a typical example in the North China Plain. We developed and applied a new version of the NUtrient flows in Food chains, Environment, and Resource use (NUFER) model. Our model is based on updated information for N losses in Quzhou. Our results show that N losses to the environment from crop and animal production in Quzhou were approximately 9 kton in 2017. These high N losses can be explained by the low N use efficiency in food production because of poor N management. For crop production, wheat, maize, and vegetables contributed 80% to N losses. Ammonia emissions and N leaching have dominant shares in these N losses. Pigs and laying hens were responsible for 74% of N losses from animal production. Ammonia emissions to air and direct discharges of manure to water were the main contributors to these N losses. Effective reduction of N losses requires improving the nutrient management in crop (wheat, maize, vegetables) and animal (pigs, laying hens) production. Our work could support the Agricultural Green Development in the North China Plain. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pavlovian conditioning paradigms model the learned fear associations inherent in posttraumatic stress disorder, including the renewal of inappropriate fear responses following extinction learning. However, very few studies in humans investigate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in fear renewal despite its clinical importance. To address this issue, our lab designed a novel, immersive-reality Pavlovian fear acquisition, extinction, recall, and renewal paradigm. We utilized an ecological threat -a snake striking towards the participant -as the un-conditioned stimulus (US). Context and background were dynamic and included both visual and auditory cues that are relevant to everyday life. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral measures (US expectancy ratings), we examined the validity of this Novel paradigm in healthy adults (n = 49) and compared it to a Standard, well-validated 2D paradigm (n = 28). The Novel paradigm, compared to the Standard, was associated with greater hippocampal activation throughout the task. Participants who underwent the Standard paradigm, compared to the Novel, also displayed insula activation; however, this was not specific to stimulus or time. During fear renewal, the Novel paradigm was associated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation to CS+ (> CS-). Overall, we found that our Novel, immersive-reality paradigm, which features an ecologically relevant US, elicited greater corticolimbic activation. These results suggest that immersive Pavlovian fear con-ditioning paradigms paired with innately fearful stimuli may improve translatability of preclinical paradigms to clinical interventions for fear-based disorders.

AB  - A valorization process for fayalitic copper slags is presented. A primary copper slag is reduced via carbothermic reduction thus creating a pig iron phase and a secondary copper slag, which is used for glass fiber production. The carbothermic reduction is carried out with graphite pellets or carbon fibers as an alternative reduction agent in crucibles within a furnace using inductive heating. The experiments are prepared and evaluated using FactSage 8.1. Carbon is used with an excess of 10% of the calculated value. The effect of temperature variation and turbulence on the carbothermic reduction process are studied. Glass fiber drawing is realized manually after remelting the secondary copper slag. The threshold for successful glass fiber production lays at a FeOx content below 10 wt%. The produced pig iron phase as well as the resulting glass fibers are characterized, while their industrial applicability is discussed.

AB  - Plant quality can shape plant-insect interactions and plant secondary metabolites are known to play an influential role in mediating these interactions. Cannabinoids are a group of terpenophenolic compounds in Cannabis that have demonstrated negative effects on insect herbivores, yet specific mechanisms are currently not well understood. Insects can modulate their rate of growth, food intake, or production of frass (i.e., insect feces) to mitigate consumption of a diet with poor nutritional quality. Detoxification and nutritional enzymes are essential in performing these functions. To test how cannabinoids impact insect performance and enzymatic activity, we performed no-choice feeding bioassays on fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) with artificial diet spiked with different concentrations of CBD and measured fall armyworm growth, consumption, and frass production and analyzed detoxification and nutritional enzyme activities. We found that as CBD concentration increased fall armyworm growth and consumption decreased, but found no impact on digestibility or conversion efficiencies. Results from the enzymatic assays varied, but CYP450 and protease activity decreased, while glucosidase activity increased, as CBD concentration increased. Relationships among enzyme activities suggest that a reduction in protease activity might limit a detoxification response, by limiting amino acid availability needed for detoxification enzyme production, even though energy collection activity, via increased glucosidase activity, occurred. These outcomes suggest specific mechanisms by which CBD has a negative influence on insect herbivore performance.

AB  - Aroma is an important factor affecting the character and quality of tea. The improvement of aroma trait is a crucial research direction of tea plant breeding. Volatile terpenes, as the major contributors to the floral odors of tea products, also play critical roles in the defense responses of plants to multiple stresses. However, previous studies have largely focused on the aroma formation during the manufacture of tea or the comparison of raw tea samples. The mechanisms causing different aroma profiles between tea cultivars have remained underexplored. In the current study, a high-density genetic linkage map of tea plant was constructed based on an F-1 population of 'Huangdan' x 'Jinxuan' using genotyping by sequencing. This linkage map covered 1754.57 cM and contained 15 linkage groups with a low inter-marker distance of 0.47 cM. A total of 42 QTLs associated with eight monoterpene contents and 12 QTLs associated with four sesquiterpenes contents were identified with the average PVE of 12.6% and 11.7% respectively. Furthermore, six candidate genes related to volatile terpene contents were found in QTL cluster on chromosome 5 by RNA-seq analysis. This work will enrich our understanding of the molecular mechanism of volatile terpene biosynthesis and provide a theoretical basis for tea plant breeding programs for aroma quality improvement.

AB  - Efficient ketalization of glycerol and alkyl levulinate to high-value-added glycerol levulinate ketal (GLK) and insights into the catalytic mechanism are of great significance but remain challenging without a clear understanding of active sites. Herein, the ketalization of glycerol with methyl levulinate (ML) and ethyl levulinate (EL) to methyl glycerol levulinate ketal (MLK) and ethyl glycerol levulinate ketal (ELK) over USY molecular sieves was reported. Under the optimal conditions, the yields of MLK and ELK can reach 96%. A kinetic study indicated that the ketalization of alkyl levulinate and glycerol to GLK followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the activation energy for MLK synthesis (154.87 kJ<middle dot>mol-1) over USY(6) was lower than that of ELK (168.03 kJ<middle dot>mol-1) over USY(10). Density functional theory calculations revealed that AlOOH sites and Al3+ sites in USY exhibit identical catalytic activity during the synthesis of MLK (or ELK). Furthermore, the formation of an ether intermediate (IM2) from the acyl group of ML attacked by the GLY-terminated hydroxyl was the rate-determining step of MLK production on the AlOOH sites, while the intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate IM3 containing a carbocation to form ELK was the rate-determining step of EL ketalization on the Al3+ sites.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat waves experienced early in the lives of arthropods can affect their sensitivity to heat stress as adults. Thus, juvenile acclimation may influence fine-tuned predator-prey relationships since the two opponents respond differently to heat stress. Here, we exposed heat wave-acclimated and non-acclimated females of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to extreme and mild heat waves and assessed their reproductive performance on bean leaves. Additionally, ovipositing prey was exposed to predator cues during heat waves. Our results showed that juvenile acclimation decreased the tendency of both species to escape from the leaves, but younger and more fecund predator females left the leaves than prey females under extreme heat waves. Reproduction in both species increased under extreme heat waves but was not affected by juvenile acclimation. Additionally, predator cues lowered the oviposition rates of prey, but the effect was marginal compared to the strong positive effects of heat waves. Our results indicate that control of spider mites by P. persimilis may become less efficient under extreme heat waves, partly because the predators suffer more than their prey from high temperatures and partly because escaping predators risk dying before they find a suitable place to feed and oviposit. The thermal history of arthropod predators and their prey may affect their reproductive performance during heat waves. Thus, a matching juvenile and adult environment should be beneficial as it enables the individuals to acclimate to extreme conditions. Prey fecundity, however, is also affected by a second stressor, namely predation risk. Here, we assessed the impact of extreme and mild heat waves on the reproductive output of acclimated (juvenile and adult heat wave conditions are matching) and non-acclimated females of the biocontrol agent Phytoseiulus persimilis, a predatory mite, and its herbivorous prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, on bean leaves. Their escape and oviposition rates and egg sizes were recorded over 10 days. Additionally, ovipositing prey females were exposed to predator cues and heat waves. Acclimation changed the escape rates and egg sizes of both species, whereas fecundity was only influenced by the adult thermal environment via increased egg numbers under extreme heat waves. Acclimation reduced predator and prey escape rates, which were higher for the predator. Pooled over acclimation, both species deposited more but smaller eggs under extreme heat waves. Acclimation dampened this effect in prey eggs, whereas acclimation resulted in smaller female eggs of the predator. Prey deposited larger male and female eggs. Predator cues reduced prey oviposition, but the effect was small compared to the large increase gained under extreme heat waves. We argue that the success of predators in controlling spider mites during heat waves mainly depends on the fates of escaping predators. A permanent absence of predators may result in the numerical dominance of prey.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are intricate pathological conditions characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of neurons in the nervous system. As a result, researchers are increasingly focusing on strategies that use combinations of bioactive chemical compounds to convert other, more stable cell types into functional neurons. Chemical conversion has shown particular promise in astrocyte-only models; however, more realistic experimental systems include different cell types whose interactions may influence the response to chemical conversion. In this study, we investigated the effect of a multicomponent chemical cocktail on cells in mixed astro-neuronal cultures derived from the hippocampus of transgenic mice of the 5xFAD strain, a genetic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we recreated a model that simulates the reduction in ACE2 receptor activity observed in COVID-19 patients due to internalization of the receptor after it binds to the coronavirus, in order to study the consequences of chemical conversion upon disruption of this enzyme activity in the brain. Our results indicate that the increase in neuronal density and the emergence of new neurons following exposure to the conversion cocktail in complex multi-component cell systems is apparent at later time points in cultures derived from non-transgenic animals as well as in cultures derived from the 5xFAD mice. This may be due to the natural increase in astroglial levels during culture degradation. Notably, ACE2 inhibition significantly affects the morphology of individual astrocytes and neurons. When we evaluated the effects of the chemical cocktail, we observed that its efficacy was influenced by both the transgenic status of the culture and the timing of the conversion cocktail administration in relation to ACE2 inhibition. Cultures derived from transgenic animals were more sensitive to both the ACE2 inhibitor and the chemical conversion agents.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite scientific evidence and a ban by the European Union, antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are still commonly used in intensive pig production systems in many countries to decrease gastrointestinal problems and improve feed efficiency and growth. Concerns over the adverse effects of antibiotics on human health have led to a search for natural alternatives. Previous studies evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) CAM6, isolated from the Colombian Creole pig Zungo and registered in Genbank, on weaned piglets and sows during gestation-lactation. However, the effect of this probiotic strain on growing pigs is unknown. The results showed that oral administration of L. plantarum CAM 6 modified the weight of the digestive organs, the histomorphometry of the concentric layers, and the depth and width of the cecal crypts; decreased cecal lesions; and stimulated the growth of lactic acid bacteria (specifically autochthonous strains) without affecting the blood count compared to the control. These findings suggest that Lactobacillus plantarum CAM6 could be considered as an effective alternative to subtherapeutic antibiotics in growing pigs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration with L. plantarum CAM6 on the hematological profile, relative weight of digestive organs, and cecal traits in growing pigs. A total of 36 castrated male pigs [(Landrace x Pietrain) x Duroc] aged 49 to 139 days old were randomly assigned to 3 experimental groups with 12 animals per treatment. The treatments included a control diet without additives (CTRL), a positive control with subtherapeutic antibiotics (TRT1), and CTRL supplemented with 5 mL Lactobacillus plantarum CAM6 preparation providing 10(9) CFU/pig/day (TRT2). The TRT2 group showed a higher (p & LE; 0.05) small intestine length and the cecum relative weight compared to the CTRL group. Moreover, L. plantarum CAM6 supplementation promoted (p & LE; 0.05) increased thickness of the muscular and mucosal layers, as well as enhanced depth and width of the cecal crypts. The TRT2 group also showed well-defined crypts without lesions, while the CTRL and TRT1 groups exhibited congestion, lymphocytic infiltration in the crypt, and intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue atrophy, respectively. Additionally, TRT2 stimulated (p & LE; 0.05) the growth of the autochthonous cecal microbiota compared to other experimental groups. Overall, the results indicate that oral administration of L. plantarum CAM6 improved intestinal health and enhanced the growth of autochthonous cecal lactic acid bacteria and had no impact on the complete blood count in growing pigs.

AB  - The Russo-Ukrainian war has highlighted concerns regarding the European Union's (EU) energy security, given its heavy dependence on Russian natural gas for electricity and heating. The RePowerEU initiative addresses this challenge by targeting a significant increase in biomethane production (up to 35 billion m3 by 2030) to replace natural gas, aligning with the EU methane strategy's emission reduction and air quality improvement goals. However, the use of energy crops as biogas feedstock has raised land-use concerns, necessitating a policy shift towards alternative sources such as agro-residues, livestock manure, and sewage sludge. This study investigates the environmental impacts of using roadside grass clippings (RG) as an alternative feedstock for biogas production, focusing on selected regions in Northwest Europe (Belgium, Netherlands). The aim is to evaluate the environmental performance of RG as a mono- or co-substrate for biogas production, comparing it to the current practice of composting. Additionally, the study assesses the environmental impacts associated with biogas end-use in these regions. The results indicate that co-digestion of RG with pig manure offers a more environmentally friendly alternative compared to mono-digestion of RG or the existing composting practice. This finding is primarily attributed to the avoided emissions resulting from conventional pig manure management. Furthermore, in terms of climate change impacts concerning biogas end-use, the study identifies that combined heat and power (CHP) systems are preferable to biomethane recovery in regions with a natural gas-based electricity mix. However, for reducing fossil resource use, biomethane recovery emerges as the preferred option. By providing insights into the environmental performance of RG as a biogas feedstock and evaluating the impacts of different biogas end-use options, this study offers insights to policymakers for the development of sustainable energy strategies in Northwest Europe.

AB  - Following exposure to trauma, avoidance behavior can be protective but also contribute to severe symptoms and interfere with exposure-based therapy. Extinction of fear conditioning by exposure to the same environment or environmental cues that were present during the initial traumatic event but without including the aversive stimulus or stimuli is often used to study post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition characterized by an inability to suppress conditioned fear responses. A limitation of this paradigm is that one cannot avoid the context or cues associated with the initial traumatic event. In contrast, in the passive avoidance test, one can escape the environment associated with the aversive stimulus. Genetic factors might modulate the ability to extinguish fear memory. In this study, we compared the effects of distinct human apoE isoforms on the extinction of contextual fear and passive avoidance memory, as well as on subsequent activity levels, depressive-like behavior, and hippocampal levels of tau, in targeted replacement mice.

AB  - Napier grass is the most important perennial tropical grass native to Sub-Saharan Africa and widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, primarily as a forage crop for animal feed, but with potential as an energy crop and in a wide range of other areas. Genomic resources have recently been developed for Napier grass that need to be deployed for genetic improvement and molecular dissection of important agro-morphological and feed quality traits. From a diverse set of Napier grass genotypes assembled from two independent collections, a subset of 84 genotypes (although a small population size, the genotypes were selected to best represent the genetic diversity of the collections) were selected and evaluated for 2 years in dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons under three soil moisture conditions: moderate water stress in DS (DS-MWS); severe water stress in DS (DS-SWS) and, under rainfed (RF) conditions in WS (WS-RF). Data for agro-morphological and feed quality traits, adjusted for the spatial heterogeneity in the experimental blocks, were collected over a 2-year period from 2018 to 2020. A total of 135,706 molecular markers were filtered, after removing markers with missing values >10% and a minor allele frequency (MAF) <5%, from the high-density genome-wide markers generated previously using the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method of the DArTseq platform. A genome-wide association study (GWAS), using two different mixed linear model algorithms implemented in the GAPIT R package, identified more than 35 QTL regions and markers associated with agronomic, morphological, and water-use efficiency traits. QTL regions governing purple pigmentation and feed quality traits were also identified. The identified markers will be useful in the genetic improvement of Napier grass through the application of marker-assisted selection and for further characterization and map-based cloning of the QTLs.

AB  - Effective thermoregulation is important for mammals, particularly those that remain winter-active. Adjustments in thermoregulatory capacity in response to chronic cold can improve capacities for metabolic heat production (cold-induced maximal oxygen consumption, (V) over dotO(2)max), minimize rates of heat loss (thermal conductance), or both. This can be challenging for animals living in chronically colder habitats where necessary resources (i.e., food, O-2) for metabolic heat production are limited. Here we used lowland native white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and highland deer mice (P. maniculatus) native to 4300 m, to test the hypothesis that small winter-active mammals have evolved distinct cold acclimation responses to tailor their thermal physiology based on the energetic demands of their environment. We found that both species increased their (V) over dotO(2)max after cold acclimation, associated with increases in brown adipose tissue mass and expression of uncoupling protein 1. They also broadened their thermoneutral zone to include lower ambient temperatures. This was accompanied by an increase in basal metabolic rate but only in white-footed mice, and neither species adjusted thermal conductance. Unique to highland deer mice was a mild hypothermia as ambient temperatures decreased, which reduced the gradient for heat loss, possibly to save energy in the chronically cold high alpine. These results highlight that thermal acclimation involves coordinated plasticity of numerous traits and suggest that small, winter-active mammals may adjust different aspects of their physiology in response to changing temperatures to best suit their energetic and thermoregulatory needs.

AB  - Gaseous emissions from stored livestock manures and slurries are a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHG) and ammonia, accounting for more than 10% of all agricultural emissions in the US and EU. Nitrogen and carbon losses from these emissions reduce the utility of slurry as a fertiliser and as a feedstock for renewable energy generation. Slurry treatment technologies in the form of slurry additives represent an under-utilised means of reducing gaseous emissions and preserving the nutrient content of stored manures. A novel, reactive oxygen halide-based, temporal methanogenic inhibitor was tested on stored cattle slurry. Laboratory storage models were employed to replicate on-farm manure practices in a covered setting. Total gaseous emissions from slurry were reduced by up to 90% during storage. Different sources of reactive oxygen could be used to create a similar inhibition, where the breakdown products are not harmful to the environment or detrimental to the onward use of the slurry. Indeed, additive-treated slurry made a richer feedstock when anaerobically co-digested, increasing methane output by 17%. This proof of concept should now be assessed at farm-scale.

AB  - A detailed account of a variety of species foraging on Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides (Walbaum, 1792)) fisheries discards associated with a commercial fishing vessel in central Baffin Bay, Nunavut, Canada is presented. Species observed included three marine mammals: northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus (Forster, 1770)), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758), and a hooded seal (Cystophora cristata (Erxleben, 1777)), and two marine bird species: northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis (Linnaeus, 1761)) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus Gunnerus, 1767). Interspecies and intraspecies interactions were observed while species were in close proximity to the stern and starboard of a commercial fishing vessel confirming anecdotal reports from boat captains. Improved understanding of marine mammal and bird interactions with fisheries in the Arctic is required to accurately assess financial and ecological (i.e., bycatch) losses, potential for entanglement and to predict the likely impact on energy flow and transport of these resource subsidies throughout the Arctic marine ecosystem.

AB  - Oocyte maturation in culture is still the weakest part of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and coculture with somatic cells may be an alternative to improve suboptimal culture conditions, especially in the pig in which maturation takes more than 44 h. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a coculture system of porcine luteal cells (PLC) during in vitro maturation (IVM) on embryo development and gene expression. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured in vitro in TCM-199 with human menopausal gonadotrophin (control) and in coculture with PLC. IVF was performed with frozen-thawed boar semen in Tris-buffered medium. Presumptive zygotes were cultured in PZM for 7 days. The coculture with PLC significantly increased blastocysts rates. Gene expression changes were measured with a porcine embryo-specific microarray and confirmed by RT-qPCR. The global transcription pattern of embryos developing after PLC coculture exhibited overall downregulation of gene expression. Following global gene expression pattern analysis, genes associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis were found downregulated, and genes associated with cell cycle and proliferation were found upregulated in the PLC coculture. Canonical pathway analysis by Ingenuity Pathway revealed that differential expression transcripts were associated with the sirtuin signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, cytokines and ephrin receptor signaling. To conclude, the coculture system of PLC during IVM has a lasting effect on the embryo until the blastocyst stage, modifying gene expression, with a positive effect on embryo development. Our model could be an alternative to replace the conventional maturation medium with gonadotrophins with higher rates of embryo development, a key issue in porcine in vitro embryo production.

AB  - Intrasexual competition favours the evolution of pronounced individual identity and competitive ability badges. However, although olfactory signals play a role in territorial conflicts of many animals, the information content encoded in olfactory signals in the context of territorial conflicts is relatively unknown. Here, we used male great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros armiger, to explore whether olfactory signals from the forehead gland encoded reliable information about a signaller's individual identity, physical condition, dominance status and physiological quality. We did this by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the chemical composition of the gland exudate and by examining the relationships between the proportions of 24 volatile compounds and physical condition (body condition index), dominance status (David's score) and physiological quality (immunocompetence, hormonal levels and resting metabolic rate). The results showed that there were significant differences in the concentrations and categories of compounds between individuals. Moreover, the proportions of many compounds correlated with David's score and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Our results indicate that olfactory signals of H. armiger could transmit information about individual identity, dominance rank and physiological quality and may work as a reliable 'chemical ornament' for male-male competition.

AB  - Compost reactors, commonly used in experiments, industrial assays, and home residue treatment systems, have the potential to facilitate composting. Challenges persist in the realm of small-scale composting, encompassing facets such as temperature monitoring, homogenization of the compost mass, management of moisture with the control of leachate generation, and integration with a renewable energy source. This study assesses a pioneering composter prototype endowed with essential features to ensure a pragmatic and secure composting process. This includes the facilitation of remote access to temperature data via Bluetooth and a mobile application. Across successive trials, the scrutinized composter prototype consistently yielded reproducible outcomes, exhibiting a coefficient of variation below 25% for the majority of appraised parameters. In comparison to a conventional reactor, the decomposing residue mixture within the examined prototype manifested elevated temperatures (p < 0.05). Moreover, the tested prototype demonstrated C/N ratio lower than 20/1 within 45 days, a higher final nitrogen concentration, and enhanced germination of seeds that served as phytotoxicity bioindicators. Notably, the prototype needed 46.6% less space, offering improved leachate control, three times faster turning time, temperature monitoring, and reduced fly attraction.

AB  - Methionine is an amino acid necessary for the growth and development of all animals. Glutathione produced during methionine metabolism can reduce damage to cells caused by oxidative stress. Supplementing restricted amino acids in animals by scientific means will be beneficial to protein synthesis, which will affect the growth and development of animals and will bring huge economic benefits when applied to actual production and life. In this study, we collected three muscle tissues from 24 male Maiwa yaks, which were fattened for three months with different methionine concentrations in their diet. RNA-seq was performed to obtain expression reads. A total of 1116 editing sites were identified by at least two software; the editing site types were mainly T-to-C and A-to-G mutations. We found two significant RNA editing sites presenting high-risk editing types. One was located on the MSRA gene that regulates the reduction of methionine, and the other can make changes to the properties of encoded proteins. This provides further understanding of the mechanism of yak muscle tissue and regulation of gene expression after the addition of methionine to daily rations.

AB  - The current gut microbiome research relies on the fecal microbiome under the assumption that the fecal microbiome represents the microbiome of the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, there have been growing concerns about using feces as a proxy to study the gut microbiome. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the composition of microbiome and metabolites in the feces and at 14 different locations of GI tracts of genetically homogenous sibling pigs to evaluate the validity of using feces as a proxy to the whole gut microbiome. The composition of intestinal microbes constituting the gut microbiome at each intestinal content and feces and their metabolic compositions were thoroughly investigated through metagenome sequencing and an ultraperformance LC-MS/MS, respectively. The fluctuation in the composition of the microbiome in the stomach and the small intestine became stabilized from the large intestine to feces and was able to be categorized into 3 groups. The taxonomic alpha-diversities measured by ACE (abundance-based coverage estimator) richness and Shannon diversity indicated that the microbiome in the large intestine was much more diverse than those of the small intestine and feces. The highly independent intestinal microbes in the stomach and the small intestine became flourished in the large intestine and converged into a community with tightly connected networks. beta-Diversity analyses by NMDS plots, PCA, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering all showed that the diversities of microbiome compositions were lowest in feces while highest in the large intestine. In accordance with fluctuation of the composition of gut microbiome along with the GI tract, the metabolic composition also completely differed in a location-specific manner along with the GI tract. Comparative analysis of the fecal microbiome and metabolites with those of the whole GI tract indicated that fecal microbiome is insufficient to represent the whole gut microbiome.

AB  - Steel-concrete composite continuous bridges can take full advantage of concrete and steel, but in regions with hogging moments, cracking of the concrete deck is a big issue affecting the durability of bridges. In order to solve cracking problems within the hogging moment region, this study proposes a composite deck method using ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) and regular concrete (RC). In this way, the layers of UHPC and RC are composited to take advantage of the high tensile strength of UHPC materials to improve the anti-crack performance of the concrete deck within the hogging moment region. Four different specimens were designed to account for different layer thickness of UHPC. Bending experiments of the UHPC-RC composite deck were undertaken and a corresponding finite element model was established to study the behavior of the UHPC-RC composite deck. The regularity of crack development in different UHPC layer thicknesses was revealed, and the load-displacement results were compared to investigate the ultimate capacity of a steel-concrete composite bridge structure using a UHPC-RC composite deck. Finally, with consideration of material cost, a reasonable UHPC layer thickness suitable for the composite deck was obtained to provide a reference for the design of a UHPC-RC composite deck.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying tri-trophic interactions between insect herbivores, their host plants and natural enemies is an important aim in ecology. In the present study, the effect of urea fertilizer and vermicompost on a tri-trophic level cascade, comprising safflower, Carthamus tinctorius, safflower aphid, Uroleucon carthami and its primary parasitoid wasp, Praon yomenae, was investigated. Vermicompost increased the number of leaves, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, the total number of aphids and reduced the number of winged aphids and aphid load (Aphid load = number of aphids / plant fresh weight). Only two variables, plant phenol content and relative water content, were not significantly affected by vermicompost. Urea fertilizer had no impact on all variables except a significant effect on plant height. In another experiment, the effect of urea fertilizer and vermicompost on the wasp parasitoid was studied. The number of parasitoid mummies, mummification time, developmental time, the number of emerged adults, sex ratio, percentage of parasitism and hind tibia length was measured. Vermicompost had no significant effect on any of the measured parameters, but urea fertilizer increased the hind tibia length of the parasitoid. Vermicompost increased plant growth parameters and had an indirect and inhibiting effect on the safflower aphid itself. There was evidence of a bottom-up cascade to the third trophic level by adding fertilizers in this system: Urea fertilizer enhanced plant height but seemingly had no impact on the attacking herbivore. It is interesting that the effect of urea can be transferred to the third trophic level, that is parasitoid. This suggests that vermicompost could be used simultaneously with urea fertilizer, because urea fertilizer had a positive impact on the parasitoid and vermicompost had a positive impact on plant growth as well as the ability to reduce aphid load.

AB  - Simple Summary Different breeds of pigs vary greatly in their propensity for adiposity. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping host physiological responses. However, it remains unclear how the gut microbiota influences host growth, in particular adipogenesis. This study aimed to compare microbial profiles in the colons of two pig breeds. Sixteen 35-day-old piglets, including eight Large White (LW) piglets (a lean-type pig breed) and eight Ningxiang (NX) piglets (a fatty-type Chinese Indigenous pig breed), were fed the same diet for 105 days. NX pigs had higher intramuscular fat content than LW pigs (p < 0.05). According to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the relative abundances of the genera Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Parabacteroides, Christensenellaaceae_R-7_group and Ruminiclostridium were higher, whereas the abundances of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Prevotella, Subdoligranulum and Faecalibacterium were lower, in the colon of NX pigs compared to that of LW pigs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the microbiota of the two pig breeds clustered separately along the principal coordinate axis. Furthermore, functional prediction of the bacterial communities suggested higher fatty acid biosynthesis in NX pigs. NX pigs also exhibited lower concentrations of total short-chain fatty acids, propionate and butyrate in the colon (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that NX pigs exhibited higher intramuscular fat content and backfat thickness than LW pigs. The bacterial communities in the colon of NX pigs were also more diverse than those in the colon of LW pigs, which might be used as a potential metabolomics mechanism to research different breeds of pigs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive dilution of cattle semen with tris-based extender compromises certain sperm kinetic and functional traits following cryopreservation. OBJECTIVE: To study sperm functions of buffalo bulls under high dilution rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four ejaculates were harvested twice a week from four buffalo bulls, and diluted to sperm concentrations of 80, 60, 40 and 20 million/mL. Diluted samples were filled in straws, equilibrated at refrigeration temperature for 4 h, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sperm samples were thawed for evaluation of kinetic and functional attributes. RESULTS: Compared to 20 million/mL (million/mL) sperm sample, the total motility, progressive motility and rapid motility were reduced ( P < 0.05) in 5 million/mL sample. The proportion of live sperm were significantly ( P < 0.05) higher in 10, 15 and 20 million/mL samples than in 5 million/mL sample. The percentage of moribund sperm, dead sperm, and sperm with lipid per oxidation increased significantly ( P < 0.05) in 5 million/mL sample. CONCLUSION: The reduction of sperm concentrations to < 10 million/mL affects post -thaw Buffalo sperm kinetic and functional attributes.

AB  - Many angiosperms rely on vertebrates for seed dispersal via gut passage, an interaction that has been traditionally classified as a mutualism. The seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) framework provides a mechanistic approach to evaluate evolutionary and ecological characteristics of animal-mediated seed dispersal, by synthesising the quantity and the quality of the dispersal that a plant species receives from each of its animal dispersers. However, the application of the SDE framework has been largely restricted to plant-frugivore interactions, whereas animal-mediated seed dispersal results from plant-disperser interactions that cover a continuum from pure mutualisms to antagonisms. This biases ecological and evolutionary knowledge on plant-disperser interactions. Here, we propose an extended SDE framework ('eSDE') that allows comparing plant-disperser interactions in the full mutualism-antagonism continuum ranging from pure mutualisms (frugivores) to conditional mutualisms (scatter-hoarding granivores and folivores) and antagonisms (pure granivores). We present the eSDE framework, and use examples to illustrate how it can be applied to compare effectiveness among plant-disperser interaction types. Our initial comparison based on available data suggests that vertebrate species differ more in the number of seeds they deposit away from the mother plant (quantity), than in the effects such dispersal processes have on seed fate (quality). Scatter-hoarding granivores provide the most effective dispersal due to high removal rates, closely followed by frugivores due to high deposition rates. Folivores and pure granivores provide low quantity dispersal, but of high and moderate quality, respectively. These early comparative insights illustrate the necessity and usefulness of more standardized data collection protocols, for which we provide recommendations. Applying the eSDE framework can reveal broad-scale patterns across and within plant-disperser interaction types, which will advance our evolutionary understanding of plant-animal interactions. This will provide new insights into the consequence of anthropogenic impacts on vertebrate-mediated seed dispersal in a world in which plant-animal interactions are increasingly threatened.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease affecting farmed and free-ranging cervids. CWD is rapidly expanding across North America and its mechanisms of transmission are not completely understood. Considering that cervids are commonly afflicted by nasal bot flies, we tested the potential of these parasites to transmit CWD. Parasites collected from naturally infected white-tailed deer were evaluated for their prion content using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology and bioassays. Here, we describe PMCA seeding activity in nasal bot larvae collected from naturally infected, nonclinical deer. These parasites efficiently infect CWD-susceptible mice in ways suggestive of high infectivity titers. To further mimic environmental transmission, bot larvae homogenates were mixed with soils, and plants were grown on them. We show that both soils and plants exposed to CWD-infected bot homogenates displayed seeding activity by PMCA. This is the first report describing prion infectivity in a naturally occurring deer parasite. Our data also demonstrate that CWD prions contained in nasal bots interact with environmental components and may be relevant for disease transmission.
   Nasal fly bots from chronic wasting disease-infected deer carry relevant levels of prion infectivity. The parasites potentially deposit their infectious cargo in environmental components, as soil and plants exposed to CWD-infected bot homogenates display seeding activity.CWD prions can be detected in nasal fly bots using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique. Nasal fly bots carry relevant quantities of CWD prion infectivity as evaluated by mouse bioassays. Most of the CWD prions in nasal fly bots are located in their protective shells. CWD-contaminated nasal fly bots can deposit their infectious cargo in soils and contaminate plants. Nasal fly bots are potentially relevant vectors of CWD transmission.

AB  - Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant, plays a vital role in modulating sperm function, yet its protective impact on boar spermatozoa during liquid preservation at 4 degrees C remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of EGCG on boar semen preservation, and elucidate the potential mechanism. Multiple parameters including sperm quality, anti-oxidative status, protein phosphorylation levels, membrane receptor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathways were analyzed using computer-assisted semen analysis system, Western blot and molecular docking techniques. Results revealed that supplementation with EGCG, particularly with 10 mu g/mL, significantly increased sperm motility, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP content. Moreover, EGCG enhanced the antioxidant defenses of sperm through eliminating excessive reactive oxygen species. Intriguingly, the antioxidant property of EGCG partly prevented protein dephosphorylation, thereby indirectly enhancing protein phosphorylation. Additionally, the dopamine receptor (DRD2) was detected in boar spermatozoa and inhibition of DRD2 greatly prevented EGCG-caused enhancement of protein phosphorylation levels and sperm motility, suggesting the role of DRD2 in regulation of the beneficial effects of EGCG. Molecular docking results indicated that EGCG has favorable binding interactions with the active sites of DRD2, involving crucial hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, further suggesting that EGCG might directly interact with DRD2, mediate protein phosphorylation via activating the DRD2/cAMP/PKA pathway and thus boost sperm motility. The present study is the first to explore the interacting cell-surface receptor of EGCG on boar sperm and provides comprehensive insights into the protective mechanism of EGCG during hypothermic liquid storage.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study aimed to determine the effects of maternal dietary supplementation combining hydroxytyrosol and n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) from day 35 to day 100 of gestation on the fatty acid (FA) composition of the offspring tissues of the Iberian pig. No effects were found in the plasma FA composition of the dams but higher levels of n3-PUFA were found in the plasma and different tissues (muscle, liver, and brain) of the supplemented fetuses. These findings may have important implications for piglets' health and may offer guidance for achieving human dietary n3-PUFA recommendations. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is a major problem in pig production and different strategies, mainly maternal supplementation with different agents, are currently being studied. The combination of hydroxytyrosol and n3-PUFA seems to be a promising treatment to counteract IUGR, since the combination may help improve n3-PUFA composition and lower the inflammatory status of IUGR piglets. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of a maternal supplementation, from day 35 to day 100 of pregnancy, with linseed oil and hydroxytyrosol on the fetal FA composition. The results showed higher n3 levels, including eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA in the offspring from treated gilts, which showed lower n6-PUFA/n3-PUFA (n6/n3) ratios. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were also affected by treatment, especially in the muscle and brain. Thus, a maternal supplementation with linseed oil and hydroxytyrosol affected the fetal FA tissue composition, which could have implications in pig production due to the improvement of the piglets' health status.

AB  - Calcium cyanamide (CaCN2) has been used in agriculture for more than a century as a nitrogen fertilizer with nitrification inhibiting and pest-controlling charac-teristics. However, in this study, a completely new application area was investigated, as CaCN2 was used as a slurry additive to evaluate its effect on the emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases (GHG) consisting of methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. Efficiently reducing these emissions is a key challenge facing the agriculture sector, as stored slurry is a major contributor to global GHG and ammonia emissions. Therefore, dairy cattle and fattening pig slurry was treated with either 300 mg kg-1 or 500 mg kg-1 cyanamide formulated in a low-nitrate CaCN2 product (Eminex (R)). The slurry was stripped with nitrogen gas to remove dissolved gases and then stored for 26 weeks, during which gas volume and concentration were measured. Suppression of methane production by CaCN2 began within 45 min after application and persisted until the storage end in all variants, except in the fattening pig slurry treated with 300 mg kg-1, in which the effect faded after 12 weeks, indicating that the effect is reversible. Furthermore, total GHG emissions decreased by 99% for dairy cattle treated with 300 and 500 mg kg-1 and by 81% and 99% for fattening pig, respectively. The underlying mechanism is related to CaCN2-induced inhibition of microbial degradation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and its conversion to methane during methanogenesis. This increases the VFA concentration in the slurry, lowering its pH and thereby reducing ammonia emissions.

AB  - Engagement in play behaviour has been associated with the presence of positive affective states and, thus, proposed to be an indicator of positive animal welfare. However, the interpretation of play in animals remains challenging due to the complexity of motivating factors. Accordingly, we aimed to clarify whether Yorkshire x Landrace weaner pigs would engage more in play behaviour the more well-nourished they were by examining the effects of weight gain, feeding behaviour, and drinking behaviour on two types of play behaviour [locomotor-rotational play (LOC) and social play (SOC)]. In total, 24 litters [pigs/litter: (mean +/- SD) 13 +/- 2] raised under conventional husbandry conditions were included in this study. Each pig was manually weighed within 24 h of birth and on days -7, 0, 1, 2 relative to the weaning day (day 0) at approximately 26 days of age. All behavioural measures were registered via video at individual level. Visits to feeder and drinker were registered from 07:00 h to 21:59 h on days -1 and 1 using 2-min interval instantaneous sampling. The proportion of visits to each resource was calculated by dividing the number of scans visiting the resource by the total number of daily scans. The latencies to visit the feeder and drinker within the first 24 h post-weaning were continuously recorded. Both LOC and SOC were registered between 14:00 h and 22:00 h on days -1, 1 and 2. Both before and after weaning, heavier pigs spent more time performing LOC. Before weaning, heavier pigs spent more time per-forming SOC. Proportion of visits to the feeder positively related to LOC after weaning. On the day before weaning, the proportion of visits to the drinker positively related to LOC. No clear relationships between the latency to feed and drink after weaning and play behaviour were found. Our study supports the hypothesis that motivation to play is higher when animals are in more stable conditions, e.g., well-nourished, and healthier than under suboptimal conditions. However, the fact that the nutritional measures did not similarly affect LOC and SOC suggests that these two types of play behaviour may be differently affected by the weaning context and questions whether they have the same underlying motivation. This study represents a step toward the validation of play as a positive animal welfare indicator.

AB  - Low-density lipoproteins (LDL), quercetin (Q) and resveratrol (R) have been used for sperm preservation to improve sperm quality in different species. To evaluate the effects of LDL, Q and R during the cooling of boar semen. Fifteen boar semen samples were diluted in a BTS extender supplemented with the treatments: LDL at 6%, Q at 10 mu M (Q10), 30 mu M (Q30) and 50 mu M (Q50), or R at 10 mu M (R10), 30 mu M (R30) and 50 mu M. A control without supplementation was included. The semen was stored by cooling at 16 degrees C for 96 h. Every 24 h, sperm motility and kinetics were evaluated using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer (IVOS). At 24 and 96 h of cooling, functional membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi M) of sperm were evaluated by the hypoosmotic swelling test (HOST) an flow cytometry with JC-1 probe, respectively, LDL improved progressive motility of sperm during cooling. Likewise, LDL increased average path velocity (VAP) and straight-line velocity (VSL) and/or curvilinear velocity (VCL) during the first 48 h of cooling. The use of Q between 10 and 30 mu M caused a reduction in total motility, progressive motility and amplitude of the lateral head displacement during the entire cooling period, as well as a decrease in VAP, VSL and VCL at 96 h of cooling. LDL, Q10, Q30 and Q50 modulated mitochondrial activity by reducing high-Delta Psi M sperm at 0 and 96 h of cooling. During the cooling of the boar semen prior to artificial insemination, the parameters of sperm quality that could influence fertility decrease; however, the inclusion of antioxidants and additives that protect the plasma membrane, such as LDL, could mitigate the damaging effects on spermatozoa. It is concluded that LDL can improve the motility and kinetics of boar semen during cooling while it could modulating the sperm's mitochondrial activity. On the contrary, Q could alter the motility and kinetics of boar sperm during the cooling period.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx, an endangered species in Switzerland, faces major threats including traffic collisions, illegal killing, and low genetic diversity. However, the impact of trace element (TE) exposure on its conservation remains poorly understood. As a top predator primarily feeding on game species, this felid can be exposed to nonessential TEs, including lead and mercury, which can be toxic even at low concentrations. In addition, overexposure to or deficiency of essential TEs such as copper or zinc can cause adverse health effects. To address this gap, we analysed liver samples from 122 individuals archived in the Swiss national health surveillance program by measuring the concentrations of eight TEs: four non-essential TEs (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) and four essential TEs (copper, iron, selenium, and zinc). Concentrations were consistent with those reported in other free-ranging Lynx populations and remained below toxicity thresholds reported for mammals, while also being above deficiency levels for essential TEs. They varied with age for some TEs, but not with sex, time or environmental variables. Additionally, we used a body condition score to examine the relationship between TE concentrations and Eurasian lynx health. Lower body condition scores were associated with higher concentrations of both non-essential and essential TEs, likely reflecting poor health affecting TE accumulation rather than a direct toxic effect. Overall, our study suggests that the current TE exposure does not significantly threaten Eurasian lynx populations in Switzerland, providing new insights for conservation efforts and long-term health monitoring.

AB  - Leucoderma is a condition that affects the skin and hair of animals, causing depigmentation and acromotrichia. In buffaloes, this condition results in significant economic losses for the production chain due to its impact on the leather trade. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinicopathological aspects of leucoderma in buffaloes in the Amazon biome and describe the prophylactic treatment to control the disease. The study included 40 buffaloes, 16 males and 24 females, aged between 1 and 10 years, and were of the Murrah, Jafarabadi, Mediterranean, and Murrah x Mediterranean crossbreed breeds. The animals were raised without mineral supplementation. The clinical signs observed in the animals included acromotrichia and depigmentation, with varying degrees and distribution of skin lesions. Histological examination of the epidermis showed interrupted melanin production, mild dermal fibrosis, mild perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, and pigmentary incontinence. None of the animals had the genotype for albinism. After 120 days of mineral supplementation based on the use of copper sulfate, the clinical signs of leucoderma regressed. There was no predisposition by breed, sex, or age for the occurrence of the disease. The regression of skin lesions after proper mineral supplementation suggests that copper deficiency may be considered an important factor for the occurrence of leucoderma in buffaloes in the Amazon biome.

AB  - Simple Summary The fruit of Nitraria tangutorum (FNT), a medicinal, edible plant, contains a variety of bioactive ingredients with a number of biological functions. However, its effect on sheep is unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of supplementary FNT on serum biochemistry and the rumen bacteria in Hu rams. The results demonstrated that FNT could improve the immunity of sheep and increase the relative abundance of beneficial rumen bacteria. However, the rumen fermentation variables were not altered with supplementary FNT. The fruit of Nitraria tangutorum (FNT) is reputed to possess medicinal properties; however, its effect on sheep (Ovis aries) is unknown. The aim of this study was to fill this gap. In a 3 x 3 Latin square design, six 12-month-old rumen-fistulated Hu rams (56.2 +/- 8.26 kg; mean +/- SD) were penned individually and offered one of three levels of FNT, namely, 0 g/d (control; CON), 16 g/d (N-16), and 48 g/d (N-48). The concentration of serum immunoglobulin G increased linearly (p = 0.03) with an increasing intake of FNT. The serum concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the N-48 group was lower than in the CON group (p = 0.01) and decreased linearly with increasing FNT (p = 0.001). The concentration of serum lactate dehydrogenase tended to decrease (p = 0.07) linearly with an increase in FNT intake, while the concentration of glucose did not differ among groups (p = 0.14) but displayed a quadratic curve with an increase in FNT (p = 0.05). The rumen concentration of lipase decreased linearly with increasing FNT (p = 0.04). The rumen fermentation variables were not affected by FNT. The FNT intake increased the abundance of beneficial ruminal bacteria, such as Lachnoclostridium, Rhodocyclaceae, and Candidatus Arthromitus. Prevotella, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcus, Olsenella, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, and Quinella were the dominant bacterial genera in all treatments. We conclude that FNT can improve immunity and increase the relative abundance of beneficial ruminal bacteria in sheep.

AB  - In China, high-grain diets for ruminants due to forage scarcity cause metabolic disorders. Yeast culture promotes rumen health by stabilizing microbial composition and enhancing nutrition and immunity. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was mainly to investigate the effect of the addition of two different species of yeast culture on goat production performance, rumen fermentation profile, microbial balance, and immunity under high-grain conditions. The results indicated that the incorporation of yeast culture into a high-grain diet significantly enhanced the production performance of goats, augmented their immunity, and stabilized the rumen environment. However, different types of yeast cultures acted by different mechanisms. The results provide a reference for the rational application of yeast culture in production. It is a common practice among farmers to utilize high-grain diets with the intention of promoting ruminant growth. However, this approach bears the risk of inducing rumen disorders and nutrient metabolism diseases. Yeast culture (YC) showed advantages in ruminant applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding two different types of YC to high-grain conditions on production performance, rumen fermentation profile, microbial abundance, and immunity in goats. A total of 30 male goats with similar body condition were randomly distributed into 3 dietary treatments with 10 replicates per treatment as follows: basic diet group (CON); basic diet + 0.5% yeast culture 1 (YC1) group; basic diet + 0.5% yeast culture 2 (YC2) group. The trial lasted for 36 days. The results demonstrated that dietary YC supplementation led to an increase in the average daily gain and a reduction in feed intake and weight gain ratio in goats. It increased the apparent digestibility of crude protein, NDF, and ADF (p < 0.05). The serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha in the control group were significantly higher than those of the YC groups (p < 0.05). The serum concentrations of Immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG in the control group were significantly lower than those in the YC groups (p < 0.05). The rumen concentration of microbial protein (MCP) in the control group was significantly lower than that in the YC groups (p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between the concentration of IL-10 and Bacteroidota, Spirochaetota, and Succinivibrio, while there was a positive correlation between concentrations of IL-10 and Firmicutes. Nevertheless, discrepancies were observed in the impact of the two different types of YC on the physiological and biochemical indicators of the animals. The concentration of triglyceride in the YC1 group was significantly higher than that of the CON and YC2 groups, while the concentration of urea in the YC2 group was significantly higher than that of the CON and YC1 groups (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, the addition of YC2 to the diet significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidota and Fibrobacterota and significantly decreased Firmicutes compared to the control. At the genus level, the addition of YC1 to the HGD significantly reduced the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, while the addition of YC2 to the HGD significantly increased the relative abundance of Prevotellace-ae_UCG-001, Fibrobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG-003 (p < 0.05).
   The addition of YC significantly improved growth performance, increased nutrient digestibility, beneficially manipulated ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity, and improved immune function. The choice of yeast cultures can be customized according to specific production conditions.

AB  - Seventy-five percent of Madagascar is treeless C-4-grassland adapted to human-lit fire, which likely succeeded pre-human mosaics of forest, ericoids, grassy-woodlands and some smaller treeless-grasslands. In support of pre-settlement Malagasy grasslands having evolved with many grassland specialist faunal elements, Bond et al. (2022) cite "considerable overlap" in African and Malagasy hippo diets, and suggest time-scale hampered mammal radiation into treeless-grasslands. We find, however, that faunal elements referenced are predominantly habitat generalists (not grassland specialists), that African and Malagasy hippos occupy significantly different feeding-niches, and that despite shared Miocene timeframes, Malagasy non-arboreal mammals remained forest-adapted whilst species that share ancestry with them on the African mainland radiated into open habitats.

AB  - Sustainable intensification strategies seek to increase production while decreasing the environmental footprint of agricultural systems. In the Upper Mississippi River Basin, relay cropping of a winter oilseed crop between corn and soybean has gained interest for its potential to increase total yields and revenue while providing the environmental benefits of winter cover. In a six-year field study in central Iowa, a basic corn-soybean rotation was compared with a corn-winter camelina-soybean relay cropping system for crop yields, nitrate losses in drainage, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil. Despite filling a niche as an overwintering crop with the potential to assimilate soil nitrogen, nitrate loads in drainage were not reduced in the camelina relay cropping system. Over the course of the study, management changes to support the camelina crop tripled cumulative N2O emissions during the camelina-soybean phase, from 3.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the basic corn-soybean rotation to 12.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the camelina relay system. Most of the increased emissions in the camelina system were associated with peak emissions events following tillage and starter fertilizer application in the fall and during the spring thaw, which may point to risks of exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions during fall management of a relay crop. Corn and soybean yields were decreased in the relay cropping system by 9.8 % and 23.3 %, respectively, as a result of management changes to the system and interspecific competition. However, combined grain dry weight of soybean and the camelina oilseed crop were similar to the soybean yield in the basic corn-soybean rotation. These findings highlight the need for careful evaluation and optimization of sustainable intensification systems to ensure environmental and production goals are met.

AB  - Local adaptation to different host plants is important in the diversification of phytophagous insects. Thus far, much evidence of the local adaptation of insects with respect to host use at the physiological level has been gathered from systems involving less mobile insects and/or divergent hosts such as plants belonging to different families or genera. On the other hand, the prevalence of such local adaptation of insects with moderate or high dispersal ability to the intraspecific variation of herbaceous hosts is largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the occurrence and degree of local adaptation of the herbivorous ladybird beetle Henosepilachna pustulosa (Kono) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to its primary host, the thistle Cirsium boreale Kitam. (Asteraceae), through reciprocal laboratory experiments using beetles and thistles from three locations with a range of approximately 200 km. Concerning the larval developmental ability, obvious patterns of local adaptation to the thistles from respective natal locations were detected, at least in some combinations of beetle populations. Similar tendencies were detected concerning adult feeding acceptance, although the statistical support was somewhat obscure. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of local adaptation of insect species with moderate dispersal ability to conspecific herbaceous hosts is occasionally as strong as that involving less mobile insects and/or heterospecific hosts, indicating the potential of such cryptic local adaptation to promote ecological/genetic differentiation of phytophagous insect populations.

AB  - Limited information is available regarding the presence of tick-borne pathogens and their distribution within Ixodes species in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This study aimed to identify Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) in Ixodes ticks collected from domestic and wild animals and vegetation in different regions across Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 7438 adult ticks, including 4526 Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes canisuga, and Ixodes hexagonus, were collected. Real-time PCR screening of 450 pooled I. ricinus samples revealed a 22.1% infection rate with at least one pathogen. Rickettsia spp. (6.3%) were found in ticks from dogs, cats, and goats, Babesia spp. (3.1%) in ticks from dogs and cattle, A. phagocytophilum (8.8%) in ticks from dogs, goats, and cattle, and B. burgdorferi s.l. (3.4%) in ticks from dogs and cats. Mixed infections with B. burgdorferi s.l. and A. phagocytophilum, as well as B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp., were found in two pools of I. ricinus from dogs and cats, respectively. Additionally, co-infection with Rickettsia spp. and A. phagocytophilum was confirmed in three tick pools from dogs and goats. Each tick from these pooled samples was individually retested to confirm the presence of pathogens. In the examined pooled samples of I. canisuga (1) and I. hexagonus (6), none of the tested pathogens were detected. Our findings represent the first detection of Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., A. phagocytophilum, and B. burgdorferi s.l. in I. ricinus collected from domestic animals and vegetation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering the established infection rates, the detection of tick-borne pathogens in adult ticks collected from domestic animals and vegetation enriches the current knowledge of the presence of tick-borne pathogens at the local, regional, national, and broader levels.

AB  - Soil heavy metal pollution has become a major ecological and environmental problem and a serious threat to global food security. Organic fertilizer can not only improve soil quality and provide nutrients for plants but also reduce the harm of heavy metal ions to a certain extent, meaning it has become a current research hotspot in the field of heavy metal passivation. In this paper, a completely combined experimental design was used to compare the effects of five organic fertilizers [nutshell organic fertilizer (NOF), pig manure organic fertilizer (PMOF), sludge organic fertilizer (SOF), humus soil organic fertilizer (HSOF) and earthworm soil organic fertilizer (ESOF)] on available Cd in soil with different pollution levels at different dosages, and the passivation mechanism of soil Cd was preliminarily discussed. The results showed that all kinds of organic fertilizers were passivated by reducing the Cd availability, and their effects on the Cd availability of purple soil were closely related to the degree of soil pollution and the amount of organic fertilizers. The passivation effect of moderate Cd-contaminated soil was the best, which increased with the increase of organic fertilizer application rate, and the effects of NOF and SOF were the best. However, the passivation effect of organic fertilizers on soil Cd was the worst in mild Cd-contaminated soil, especially ESOF. The results of Cd morphological correlation analysis showed that Exe-Cd and FeMnOx-Cd in the soil had significantly positive contributions to available Cd, while Res-Cd showed significantly negative contributions. And in moderate Cd contaminated soil, Exe-Cd content decreased by 7.12%-28.50%, while Res-Cd content increased by 19.74%-65.81%. In addition, the content of available Cd in soil decreased first and then increased with time after adding organic fertilizer, and reached the lowest value at 15 days and stabilized after 60 days. The conclusion of this paper can provide a theoretical basis for the rational use of organic fertilizer to reduce the bioavailability of cadmium in Gray-Purple soil.

AB  - Electrical resistivity has been used as a noninvasive geophysical technique for locating clandestine graves and monitoring human decay within the subsurface. Detailed studies assessing resistivity anomalies due to soil disturbances and decay products associated with graves have relied on the use of proxies, such as pigs, with limited studies using real human cadavers and simulating a mass grave setting and none assessing the anomalies in 3D. In this study, we used time-lapse 2D and quasi-3D electrical resistivity distribution measured over an experimental mass grave and individual graves containing human cadavers to assess resistivity anomalies resulting from graves and the presence of decaying human remains in them. This study is part of a novel multidisciplinary mass grave experimental study with six graves consisting of a mass grave with six human cadavers, a controlled mass grave with none, three individual graves with one human cadaver each, and a control individual grave with none. Nine parallel resistivity transects which allow us to image these graves in their 3D context were acquired prior to excavation and 2 days, 1, 2, and 6 months after burial using a dipole-dipole electrode array, a unit electrode spacing of 0.5 m, and an interprofile spacing of 1m. The value of different electrode arrays and spacings in identifying the contrast between the graves was also assessed using forward models and field data. Soil sensors were installed at different locations in the graves to monitor soil electrical conductivity, moisture content, and temperature. The results of this study show an increase in electrical resistivity 2 days after burial in all graves with human remains and the control graves, which we attribute to increased soil aeration where disturbed pores are filled with air. The resistivity decreases thereafter in graves with human remains which we attribute to the formation of conductive leachates. This study validates the potential of electrical resistivity as a forensic search tool for locating both clandestine mass and individual graves and as a noninvasive monitoring technique to support human decomposition research.

AB  - Simple Summary The deleterious effects of heat stress and its induced stressors on health and intestinal integrity may compromise the performance of pigs. Their physiological and behavioral mechanisms to promote thermoregulation can potentially influence electrolyte losses and compromise digestive capacity. The varied response exhibited by pigs under different durations of exposure to high ambient temperature led to our study on pigs and (1) the effect of the duration of heat stress on the digestibility of some minerals, (2) the balance of major electrolytes, and (3) the alleviation capability of vitamins and micro-minerals supplemented in combinations and at higher levels than recommended for pigs. Our results revealed that heat stress alone did not affect the digestibility of the minerals studied. However, supplementation of high levels of vitamins and micro-minerals improved the digestibility of some minerals, including calcium, selenium, and zinc, despite the exposure of the pigs to heat stress. Heat stress caused a significant reduction in the plasma chloride concentrations of pigs, which indicated an imbalance. Vitamin and micro-mineral supplementation corrected this issue. Heat stress (HS) can have detrimental effects on intestinal integrity and can jeopardize the digestibility performance in pigs. With prolonged exposure to heat, some thermoregulatory processes in pigs are potential causes for electrolyte imbalance. The adverse effects of HS on mineral digestibility and electrolyte balance are not widely studied and information on its abatement through vitamin and micro-mineral supplementation in combinations above the recommended level in pigs is limited. The aim of this study is to research this area. Thirty-six Danbred hybrid barrows (65.1 +/- 2.81kg) were distributed among the four treatments (n = 9 per treatment): (1) thermo-neutral (19.5 +/- 0.9 degrees C, RH- 85.9 +/- 7.3%)+ control diet (TC) (NRC, 2012), (2) HS (28.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C, RH- 60.4 +/- 4.3%) + control diet (HC), (3) HS +diet with elevated levels of vitamins (vitamin E and C) and micro-minerals (Zn and Se) (HT1), and (4) HS + diet with further elevation of vitamins and micro-minerals (HT2). Plasma samples were collected on days 7 and 21 of the experiment to investigate electrolyte concentration. During the experimental period, feces samples were collected from pigs placed in digestibility cages (six pigs from each treatment) to investigate the digestibility of Ca, P, Na, Se, and Zn. HS did not decrease the digestibility of minerals, but elevated supplementation of the selected vitamins and trace minerals improved it significantly. HS caused a significant decrease of Cl- (p < 0.01) in plasma, indicating an imbalance. In conclusion, pigs can have some resilience against heat stress in terms of mineral digestibility.

AB  - Tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera) is an important edible oil woody plant with a planting area of over 3,800,000 hectares in southern China. Pestalotioid fungi are associated with a wide variety of plants worldwide along with endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes. In this study, symptomatic leaves of C. oleifera were collected from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hunan, and Jiangsu Provinces and pestalotioid fungi are characterized based on combined sequence data analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta tubulin (tub2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef-1 alpha) coupled with morphological characteristics. As a result, seven species were confirmed, of which five species are described as new viz. N. camelliae-oleiferae, P. camelliae-oleiferae, P. hunanensis, P. nanjingensis, P. nanningensis, while the other two are reported as known species, viz., N. cubana and N. iberica. Pathogenicity assays showed that all species except for P. nanjingensis developed brown lesions on healthy leaves and P. camelliae-oleiferae showed stronger virulence.

AB  - Giant rhinoceroids were once named as the largest land mammals ever imagined. They lived in Eurasia during the Eocene and the Oligocene, and they could have potentially lived in the area of present-day Helsinki, Finland. We, however, may never know this with certainty because not only have no fossil remains of those animals been found in what is now Finland, but nearly no terrestrial sediments from the Eocene or the Oligocene are known to have been preserved in the area. Paleogene sediments, which formed in southern Finland, were destroyed by the local river systems in the Neogene and by the subsequent glaciations in the Late Pleistocene. Here, we present an analytical argument about whether giant rhinoceroses, known as indricotheres, could potentially have lived in Helsinki. From the continental palaeogeography and palaeoclimate estimates concerning the palaeoecology of indricotheres, we conclude that they could potentially have lived here in the Oligocene, even if climatically, they would have been on the margin of their environmental tolerances. Considering their metabolism, the Helsinki area could have accommodated 3-21 indricotheres. From a climatic perspective, perhaps closer to three individuals could have lived here at a time.

AB  - Climatic shocks and economic insecurity challenge the wellbeing of livestock managers, globally. Scholars argue that ranchers pursue different economic strategies (herd composition and uses) because of the effects of variation in wealth on risk preferences. However, intergenerational wealth transfers and experiences of loss could also explain these outcomes. There are no tests comparing which of these interpretations more closely align with decisions ranchers employ. Accordingly, we examine how ranchers from rural Baja California Sur, Mexico adjust herd compositions and uses across varying economic (i.e. land security) and environmental conditions (i.e. drought vs non-drought years). Our results indicate 1) both socio-economic condition and intergenerational transfers are associated with herd composition - people on secure land and whose parents ranched cattle have more cattle, 2) herd composition influences consumption patterns - people focusing on goat production eat a greater percentage of their livestock relative to those with cattle regardless of ecological condition, 3) socioeconomic variation influences sales and maintenance under normal ecological conditions - people living on secure land place proportionally more livestock into sales, while the land insecure focus on maintenance, and 4) experience with drought-induced livestock losses, but not land security, explains variation in how people respond to an ecological shock - those experiencing larger losses place greater effort in keeping herds alive rather than sales, suggesting they become risk averse. Our results indicate that socio-economic variability influences risk preferences under benign ecological conditions; however, these preferences are flexible in the face of economic losses.

AB  - The extensive accumulation of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) owing to the large-scale production of edible fungi is causing environmental problems that cannot be ignored. Co-composting is a promising method for agricultural and animal husbandry waste disposal. In this study, the composition and function of microbial communities in the process of cattle manure-maize straw composting with SMS addition were compared through an integrated meta-omics approach. The results showed that irrespective of SMS addition, the predominant fungi were Ascomycota, while the dominant bacteria were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. High temperature promoted the evolution from Gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides, Proteobacteria) to Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinomycetes). The composting process was accelerated by SMS addition, and the substrate was effectively degraded in 14 days. Metaproteomics results showed that the dominant microorganism, Planifilum fulgidum, secreted large amounts of S8, M17, and M32 proteases that could degrade macromolecular protein substrates in the presence of SMS. Planifilum fulgidum, along with Thermobifida fusca and Melanocarpus albomyces, synergistically degraded hemicellulose, cellulose, and protein. In addition, the dominant microorganisms related to the initial raw materials such as Pichia, Lactobacillus in the microbial agent and Hypsizygus in SMS could not adapt to the high-temperature environment (>60 degrees C) and were replaced by thermophilic bacteria after 5 days of composting.

AB  - This research elucidates the potential of Lycium barbarum residue (LBR), a by-product rich in bioactive substances, as a dietary supplement in aquaculture, especially for herbivorous fish like grass carp. In a detailed 120day feeding trial, the impacts of varying LBR levels on juvenile grass carp were assessed, focusing on growth performance, survival rate, biochemical markers, and liver health. The study identified a 6% inclusion rate of LBR as optimal for enhancing survival and growth while mitigating hepatic lipid accumulation. Composition analysis of this diet revealed high concentrations of polysaccharides and flavonoids. Notably, the intake of LBR was found to enhance the antioxidant and immune-related enzymatic activities in the liver. Furthermore, it contributed to a reduction in hepatic fat deposition by decreasing the levels of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (T-CHO) both in the liver and serum. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver highlighted LBR's substantial influence on lipid metabolism pathways, including the PPAR signaling pathway, primary bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism, bile secretion, fat digestion and absorption, fatty acid degradation and fatty acid biosynthesis. Further, the expression level of genes pinpointed significant downregulation of fasn and dgat2, alongside upregulation of genes like pparda, cpt1b, cpt1ab and abca1b, in response to LBR supplementation. Overall, the findings present LBR as a promising enhancer of growth and survival in grass carp, with significant benefits in promoting fat metabolism and liver health, offering valuable insights for aquacultural nutrition strategies.

AB  - The effect of the probiotic Baykal EM-1 on some hematological and biochemical parameters of suckling pigs was tested in an experiment with 15 equalized by breed, origin, piglet age, farrowing sequence and litter size litters. A total of 154 pigs were included into the experiment, 82 pigs (8 litters) in the experimental and 72 pigs (7 litters) in the control treatment. The feed additive, a multi-purpose microbiological product containing a complex of living, useful microorganisms, Baykal EM-1, was added to the feed of the trial group, both to the feed of sows and piglets. The dosage was 10 ml/kg of feed, from the day 8th after birth to the day 35th at weaning of the pigs. On the day 35th, at weaning, blood samples were taken and hematological and biochemical parameters alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total protein level were tested. Through the whole experimental period, pigs were observed for clinical signs of diarrhea and a faecal scoring system was applied to indicate its presence and severity. A trend for a positive effect of adding the probiotic Baykal EM-1 on white blood picture in suckling pigs has been found, although not clearly demonstrated. Better biochemical status in piglets, consuming multi-strain probiotic (P < 0.01), was established. Elevated above reference values biochemical parameters in the control group were indicative of an existing, though not manifested, bacterial infection.

AB  - Vitrification of oocyte has become an important component of assisted reproductive technology and has important implications for animal reproduction and the preservation of biodiversity. However, vitrification adversely affects mitochondrial function and oocyte developmental potential, mainly because of oxidative damage. Rutin is a highly effective antioxidant, but no information is available to the effect of rutin on the mitochondrial function and development in vitrified oocytes. Therefore, we studied the effects of rutin supplementation of vitrification solution on mitochondrial function and developmental competence of ovine germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes post vitrification. The results showed that supplementation of vitrification solution with 0.6 mM rutin significantly increased the cleavage rate (71.6 % vs. 59.3 %) and blastocyst rate (18.9 % vs. 6.8 %) compared to GV-stage oocytes in the vitrified group. Then, we analyzed the reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial activity and membrane potential (z z P m), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+, 2 + , and annexin V (AV) of vitrified sheep GV-stage oocytes. Vitrified sheep oocytes exhibited increased levels of ROS and Ca2+, 2 + , higher rate of AV-positive oocytes, and decreased mitochondrial activity, GSH and z P m levels. However, rutin supplementation in vitrification solution decreased the levels of ROS, Ca2+ 2 + and AV-positive oocytes rate, and increased the GSH and z P m levels in vitrified oocytes. Results revealed that rutin restored mitochondrial function, regulated Ca2+ 2 + homeostasis and decreased apoptosis potentially caused by mitophagy in oocytes. To understand the mechanism of rutin functions in vitrified GV-stage oocytes in sheep, we analyzed the transcriptome and found that rutin mediated oocytes development and mitochondrial function, mainly by affecting oxidative phosphorylation and the mitophagy pathways. In conclusion, supplementing with 0.6 mM rutin in vitrification solution significantly enhanced developmental potential through improving mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis potentially caused by mitophagy after vitrification of ovine GV-stage oocytes.

AB  - The cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) is a significant pest of rapeseed (Brassica napus). Feeding by adult P. chrysocephala can cause severe leaf damage and larval infestation can reduce stem strength, both of which impact crop growth and development, causing substantial yield losses and economic damage. The structure of the agricultural landscape can regulate herbivorous pest populations through top-down and bottomup processes. This has shown promise in regulating the populations of other herbivorous pests, but remains relatively unexplored for P. chrysocephala. Here we investigate how the structure of the agricultural landscape influences P. chrysocephala abundance (pest pressure) and associated crop damage. We also examine the effect of the landscape on natural enemies and their ability to regulate P. chrysocephala populations. We show that P. chrysocephala populations are primarily regulated through bottom-up processes. We identify adjacency to another rapeseed crop and the total proportion of rapeseed grown in the landscape as key factors influencing beetle pressure, crop damage, and larval infestation, but find no effect of host crop proportions grown in the previous year at the examined scales up to 1 km surrounding focal crops. We also observe positive effects of crop heterogeneity and semi-natural habitat proportions on natural enemy abundance and diversity; however, these increases had no direct impact on P. chrysocephala. Bottom-up processes appear to contribute to herbivorous pest regulation by diluting beetles in the landscape, and could represent an important mechanism for sustainably managing pest populations by adapting the proportions and neighbourhoods of rapeseed crops at small to large spatial scales.

AB  - Birds that migrate from temperate areas to the Arctic to breed lose their strongest Zeitgeber of circadian organization when they cross the Arctic circle in spring - the 24h light-dark cycle. Under continuous daylight, diverse behavioral and physiological patterns have been detected in both free-ranging and laboratory animals. To better understand the evolution of plasticity in circadian clocks, it is essential to study behavioral and physiological rhythmicity in the context of a species' ecology. Employing a multifaceted approach, which included wildlife cameras, accelerometers, and noninvasive sampling of hormone metabolites, we investigated activity patterns and corticosterone rhythmicity in a migratory herbivore, the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis), during its Arctic breeding season on Svalbard. We found that females showed a combination of both ultradian and diel rhythmicity in nest recesses and sleep during incubation. In both parents, these rhythms in activity continued also during the gosling rearing phase. During molt, many geese aligned activity with the prevailing tidal rhythm. Barnacle geese showed weak diel rhythmicity in excreted corticosterone metabolites (CORTm). This suggests that while Arctic geese may adopt an alternative Zeitgeber during the Arctic summer to maintain a diel rhythm, ultradian rhythmicity remains essential, allowing the geese to flexibly adjust their rhythms to environmental conditions.
   Despite the continuous daylight of the Arctic summer, barnacle geese manage to keep rhythmic behavior. Arctic summers may pose a challenge to animals reliant on a day-night cycle. We found that migratory barnacle geese show short cycles (ultradian rhythms), daily patterns (diel rhythms) and even rhythms, which coincide with the tides, in their activity behavior. Contrastingly, stress hormones (corticosterone) showed only weak daily patterns. Our study underscores the flexibility in timekeeping mechanisms in Arctic species.

AB  - Seabird parents during chick rearing is hypothesized to regulate body mass to reduce flight costs and invest energy in current reproduction. Alcids have 2-4 times higher wing-loading and higher flight costs than other seabirds. In particular, rhinoceros auklets Cerorhincamonocerata (RHAU) carry the heaviest meals among alcids despite its medium-size, therefore, we expected that they might be more likely to keep their body mass small and within a narrow range during chick rearing. We examined between-breeding stage and interannual variations in RHAU body mass using 27-year monitoring data, then tested whether the interannual variation shown by the coefficient of variation (CV) in body mass during chick rearing was smaller than in other seabirds, and if their body lipid stores were smaller. RHAU during chick rearing have 15-20 g lower body mass, corresponding to 5-7% decrease of flight costs, than those during incubation. We found that CV of body mass in RHAU (1.4) was smaller than those of 10 other seabird species (1.7-7.5), while CVs in provisioning metrics, such as meal mass, chick growth, fledgling mass, and fledging success, were the largest or second largest. RHAU body lipid stores during chick rearing (3.8-4.0%) was also smaller than six other species (5.7-9.5%). Results suggest that chick-rearing RHAU maintained a narrow range of body mass with minimum body lipid stores, possibly because of their greater wing-loading and heavier meals. Such constraints on body mass regulation might affect their variable investment in their chicks under environmental variability, as shown large variation in provisioning metrics.

AB  - Exposure to heat stress (HS) detrimentally affects pig performance. This study explored whether a dietary phytogenic solution based on Capsicum spp. (PHY) could enhance the thermal tolerance of heat-stressed growing pigs. Forty-two individually housed pigs were randomly assigned to three treatments: thermoneutral pigs on a control diet (TN-C) and pigs subjected to HS fed the control diet either without (HS-C) or with supplemental PHY (HS-PHY). The TN-C group exhibited increased average daily gain (ADG) and feed intake (FI) compared to both HS-C (p < 0.01) and HS-PHY pigs (p < 0.05) and better feed efficiency compared to HS-C pigs only (p < 0.01). However, the HS-PHY pigs showed significantly higher FI (p < 0.01) and ADG (p < 0.05) compared to HS-C pigs. HS pigs displayed higher body temperatures (BTs) than TN pigs (p < 0.01), yet HS-PHY pigs experienced a lesser increase in BT compared to HS-C pigs (p < 0.05). Supplementation with PHY mitigated some effects of HS, increasing serum superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, reducing HSP90 expression in longissimus dorsi muscle, and elevating jejunal villus height compared to HS-C pigs (p < 0.05), reaching levels akin to TN-C pigs. Additionally, PHY supplementation resulted in lower serum urea levels than HS-C pigs (p < 0.01) and similar myosin gene expression to TN-C pigs (p > 0.1), suggesting enhanced amino acid post-absorptive utilization for lean tissue growth. In conclusion, dietary PHY supplementation partially offset the adverse effects of HS on pig performance by improving thermal tolerance.

AB  - Simple Summary The effects of prolonged protein deprivation on lipid metabolism in white adipose tissues and the gut microbiota of Shaziling pigs remain inadequately characterized. As an ideal obese model, the Shaziling pig is instrumental in studying obesity. This study was developed to examine the changes in lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota ecosystem induced by prolonged protein deficiency of Shaziling pigs and to explore the beneficial effects of low-protein diets for obesity management. After a 24-week trial, increased FABP4 mRNA abundance and PPAR gamma protein expression as well as decreased C/EBP alpha protein expression in dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissue and perirenal adipose tissue were achieved through a 20% reduction in the dietary protein level. At the same time, increased/decreased phosphorylation of AMPK alpha/mTOR were observed. Furthermore, reducing the protein level by 20% increased the relative abundance of the Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group in the colon at the genus level. In summary, our findings indicated that long-term reduction in dietary crude protein by 20% positively impacted the lipid metabolism of Shaziling pigs. Obesity is a matter of concern to the public. Abundant evidence has been accumulated that nutritional intervention is a promising strategy to address this health issue. The objective of this study is to investigate alterations in the lipid metabolism in white adipose tissues and the gut microbiota of Shaziling pigs challenged by long-term protein restriction. Results showed that compared with the control group, reducing the protein level by 20% (-20%) increased the mRNA abundance of FABP4 in white adipose tissues (p < 0.05). This occurred in conjunction with increases in PPAR gamma protein expression. Conversely, the protein expression of C/EBP alpha was reduced in the -20% group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the -20% group had increased/decreased phosphorylation of AMPK alpha/mTOR, respectively (p < 0.05). As for the colonic gut microbiota, a 20% reduction in the protein level led to increased Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group abundance at the genus level (p < 0.01). Collectively, these results indicated that a 20% protein reduction could modulate lipid metabolism and alter the colonic microbiota of Shaziling pigs, an approach which might be translated into a treatment for obesity.

AB  - Bone histology is a valuable tool for studying growth patterns and life history traits in animals. This study examines four Japanese sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations-mainland (Hokkaido and Chiba) and insular (Yakushima and Kerama Islands)-using femoral and tibial histology to investigate growth patterns and sexual dimorphism. Growth curves based on lines of arrested growth (LAGs) revealed slower growth rates in insular populations, supported by extensive parallel-fibered bone (PFB) development and reduced vascularity. Earlier external fundamental system (EFS) formation and epiphyseal fusion in mainland populations (three to four years) compared to insular populations (5.5 to 7.5 years) further support this finding. Sexual dimorphism was pronounced in mainland populations, with males exhibiting delayed EFS formation, epiphyseal fusion, and extensive bone remodeling than females. In contrast, the Kerama population showed no significant sex-related differences in remodeling, which may influence unique growth patterns. These findings highlight the influence of insularity, such as resource limitation and predator-free environments on life history traits, which could associate slower growth rates and delayed maturity in insular deer. This study underscores the utility of bone histology in understanding adaptive strategies of endemic and endangered mammals.

KW  - Wild Cervidae monitoring
AB  - Wild Cervidae(deer and their relatives) play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and are integral components of ecosystems. However, factors such as environmental changes and poaching behaviors have resulted in habitat degradation for Cervidae. The protection of wild Cervidae has become urgent, and Cervidae monitoring is one of the key means to ensure the effectiveness of wild Cervidae protection. Object detection algorithms based on deep learning offer promising potential for automatically detecting and identifying animals. However, when those algorithms are used for inference in unseen background environments, there will be a significant decrease in accuracy, especially in the situation that a certain type of Cervidae images are collected from single scene for algorithm training. In this paper, a two -stage localization and classification pipeline for Cervidae monitoring is proposed. The pipeline effectively reduces background interference in Cervidae monitoring and enhances monitoring accuracy. In the first stage, the YOLOv7 network is designed to automatically locate Cervidae in UAV infrared images, while implementing improved bounding box regression through the alpha-IoU loss function enables the network to locate Cervidae more accurately. Then, Cevdidae objects are extracted to eliminate the background information. In the second stage, a classification network named CA -Hybrid, based on Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Vision Transformer(ViT), as well as Channel Attention Mechanism (CAM) enhances the expression of key features, is constructed to accurately identify Cervidae categories. Experimental results indicate that this method achieves an Average Precision (AP) of 95.9% for Cervidae location and a top -1 accuracy of 77.73% for Cervidae identification. This research contributes to a more comprehensive and accurate monitoring of wild Cervidae, and provides valuable references for subsequent UAV-based wildlife monitoring.

AB  - Gunung (Mount) Talang is an active volcano in West Sumatra that has a number of Nepenthes species, including the endemic N. talangensis, but their ecology has been little been studied. This study found five species of Nepenthes growing in the protected forest area of Gunung Talang, namely N. bongso, N. inermis, N. pectinata, N. spathulata and N. talangensis. The population of N. talangensis is very small (23 individuals) and it grows sympatrically with N. bongso and N. inermis forming natural hybrids. Lithocarpus conocarpus, Camellia lanceolata, Syzygium acuminatissimum, Adinandra dumosa and Dehaasia sp. are the five most dominant tree species found in the Nepenthes habitat, while L. conocarpus and Podocarpus neriifolius had strong positive associations with N. talangensis. Growth rates of the five Nepenthes species were not significantly different, neither were foliar nitrogen (mean = 1.14%) or phosphorus concentrations (mean = 0.11%). We suggest that N. talangensis should be considered as Critically Endangered and outline some possible conservation actions.

AB  - Native to South America, Solanum viarum Dunal (tropical soda apple; Solanaceae) is naturalised in several countries globally. The plant is a major invader in the southern USA, but has minor weed status in South Africa. We investigated whether S. viarum has escaped natural enemy pressure or has recruited insect herbivores from the local Solanum flora, which are exerting some level of biotic resistance. Insect species richness and abundance and the resulting levels of herbivory were compared between plants from sympatric populations of S. viarum and the native Solanum dasyphyllum Schumacher and Thonning in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Foliage, floral material, and fruits were collected across seasons from 20 plants of each species and assessed in the laboratory. Despite no significant differences between the two species in the size of the sampled plants, S. viarum displayed significantly lower insect herbivore diversity and abundance and suffered significantly lower levels of damage to its photosynthetic and reproductive tissues. Five of the 11 specialist herbivore species recorded on S. dasyphyllum were associated with S. viarum, but in substantially lower numbers and in fewer samples. The flowerbud-galling moth Scrobipalpa sp. (Gelechiidae), which prevents fruiting in S. dasyphyllum, was absent on S. viarum and indicative of the negligible floral damage on S. viarum. Although the fruit of S. viarum were occasionally utilised by specialist herbivores, seed damage was similarly negligible. Due to its release from specialist natural enemies and with no evidence of biotic resistance, S. viarum may increase in weed status in South Africa.

AB  - We investigated the consequence of no-night environment (constant light, LL) on reproductive performance in zebra finches in the parent (P) and subsequent (F1) generation. As a measure of the overall effects on metabolic reproductive health, we monitored daily activity behaviour, recorded song and cheek patch size in males, and measured body size and hormone levels. As compared with controls under 12 h light:12 h darkness (12 h:12 h LD), both P and F1 pairs showed a compromised reproductive success, as evidenced by fewer fledglings and fewer viable offspring with longer fledging durations, and increased offspring mortality with three successive clutches under LL. The overall negative effect of the no-night environment was increased in the F1 generation. As compared with P pairs, F1 pairs had more failed nesting and breeding attempts, took longer to initiate reproduction, incubated fewer eggs, produced fewer viable offspring with longer fledging duration, and showed increased offspring mortality. Consistent with negative reproductive effects, P males showed significant changes in the motif duration and other spectral features of song, and both F1 and F2 males copied poorly the song of their parent under LL. Plasma corticosterone and sex hormone (testosterone in males and oestradiol in females) levels were significantly lower under LL. Daily plasma melatonin rhythm persisted but with a reduced amplitude under LL. These results demonstrate the importance of night in reproduction in a continuously breeding diurnal species, and give insight into the possible impact on physiology of animals whose surrounding environment is consistently losing the darkness of night.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.), which is considered an important cereal everywhere, is widely cultivated in different agroecological conditions. Throughout their phenological stages, maize crops are attacked by pests and diseases, and in Ecuador these phytosanitary problems are usually counteracted with applications of pesticides. I Iowever, knowledge of beneficial entomofauna is fundamental to guide pest management programs. As part of this objective, the Coccinellidae species present in maize fields in localities (Santa Ana, Colon, and Danzarin) in Manabi province were identified. In each zone, maize plants were sampled from 2018-2019. A total of 2,654 specimens belonging to 14 taxa were collected in this study, of which Cheilomenes sexmaculata, Cycloneda sanguinea, Hippodamia convergens, Hyperaspis arida, and Psyllobora confluens were found in all the studied areas. Hyperaspis arida and Diomus apollonia are reported for the first time in Ecuador.

AB  - Presynaptic scaffold proteins, including liprin-alpha, RIM, and ELKS, are pivotal to the assembly of the active zone and regulating the coupling of calcium signals and neurotransmitter release, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the liprin-alpha 2/RIM1 complex, revealing a multifaceted intermolecular interaction that drives the liprin-alpha/RIM assembly. Neurodevelopmental disease-associated mutations block the formation of the complex. Disrupting this interaction in cultured human neurons impairs synaptic transmission and reduces the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Super-resolution imaging analysis supports a role for liprin-alpha in recruiting RIM1 to the active zone, presumably by promoting the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RIM1. Strikingly, the liprin-alpha/RIM interaction modulates the competitive distribution of ELKS1 and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) in RIM1 condensates. Disrupting the liprin-alpha/RIM interaction significantly decreased VGCC accumulation in the condensed phase and rendered release more sensitive to the slow calcium buffer EGTA, suggesting an increased physical distance between VGCC and vesicular calcium sensors. Together, our findings provide a plausible mechanism of the liprin-alpha/RIM complex in regulating the coupling of calcium channels and primed synaptic vesicles via LLPS for efficient synaptic transmission and uncover the pathological implication of liprin-alpha mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - The drastic decline of Arctic sea ice due to global warming and polar amplification of environmental changes in the Arctic basin profoundly alter primary production with consequences for polar ecosystems and the carbon cycle. In this study, we use highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs), brassicasterol, dinosterol and terrestrial biomarkers ( n -alkanes and campesterol) in surface sediments to assess sympagic and pelagic algal production with changing sea-ice conditions along a latitudinal transect from the Bering Sea to the high latitudes of the western Arctic Ocean. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was also collected in surface waters at several stations of the Chukchi Sea to provide snapshots of phytoplankton communities under various sea-ice conditions for comparison with underlying surface sediments. Our results show that sympagic production (IP 25 and HBI-II) increased northward between 62 and 73 (degrees) N, with maximum values at the sea-ice edge in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) between 70 and 73 circle N in the southeastern Chukchi Sea and along the coast of Alaska. It was consistently low at northern high latitudes ( > 73 (degrees) N) under extensive summer sea-ice cover and in the Ice-Free Zone (IFZ) of the Bering Sea. Enhanced pelagic sterols and HBI-III occurred in the IFZ across the Bering Sea and in the southeastern Chukchi Sea up to 70-73 (degrees) N in MIZ conditions, which marks a shift of sympagic over pelagic production. In surface water SPM, pelagic sterols display similar patterns as chlorophyll a , increasing southward with higher amounts found in the Chukchi shelf, pointing to the dominance of diatom production. Higher cholesterol values were found in the mid-Chukchi Sea shelf where phytosterols were also abundant. This compound prevailed over phytosterols in sediments, compared to SPM, reflecting efficient consumption of algal material in the water column by herbivorous zooplankton.

AB  - Knowledge of living crinoids from Brazil is chiefly restricted to the contributions of Dr Luis Roberto Tommasi between the decades of 1950 and 1970. Herein we present an updated catalogue of the crinoids occurring along the Brazilian coast, including data on synonyms, type localities, type material, geographical distribution, bathymetric ranges, and occurrences of species along the coast. The data is based on an extensive revision of the literature and on a survey of several databases. A total of 20 species were catalogued, of which two are endemic (Phrixometra longipinna var. brasiliensis and Thaumatometra minutissima). According to information from the literature, P. longipinna var. brasiliensis represents an undescribed taxon. Although Brazil supports the greatest number of crinoid species in the Southwestern Atlantic, its crinoid fauna remains understudied and likely underestimated. Research on crinoids remains a subject of great potential, not only for taxonomy but also for other areas of knowledge.

AB  - Understanding the ways in which human groups use the environment for their survival is one of the main fields of study in Prehistory. Subsistence strategies, understood as the set of techniques, processes and activities through which human groups organise the tasks related to their survival, are a fundamental element for understanding the economic and sociocultural processes derived from these practices in the past. In this sense, archaeozoological and taphonomic studies are the main tool to reconstruct the ways in which our ancestors acquired, processed, consumed, and managed meat resources for their survival. In this research we examine the ways in which hunter-gatherer groups in the Spanish Cantabrian region exploited ungulates through a palaeoecological and palaeoeconomic analysis of a total of 32 archaeological levels at 19 sites dated between 20 and 17 ky cal BP. To this end, through research on faunal resources in this region, we will address the ways in which prey was acquired and transported, the age ranges, the seasonality of the captures and the nutritional energy contribution to the diet of the human groups, taking into account the cost of acquiring them, thus generating an updated view of subsistence strategies in the Cantabrian region.

AB  - Simple Summary Phytase and NSPase have been widely used to improve growth performance in swine by improving nutrient utilization. However, the effects of phytase and NSPase (beta-glucanase, xylanase, and beta-mannanase) with corn-soybean meal-based diets on the trace element deposition of pigs still remains unknown. In this study, the effects of phytase, beta-glucanase, xylanase, and beta-mannanase on the trace element deposition and intestinal health of growing-finishing pigs were compared. In conclusion, phytase and xylanase supplementation increased the zinc deposition in pigs. Additionally, the supplementation of NSPases may improve the gut health of pigs by modulating the intestinal morphology and microbiota. This study investigated the effects of supplementing phytase and non-starch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes (NSPases) to corn-soybean meal-based diet on the growth performance, trace element deposition, and intestinal health of growing-finishing pigs. Fifty pigs were randomly assigned into the control (basal diet), phytase (basal diet + 100 g/t of phytase), beta-mannanase (basal diet + 40 g/t of beta-mannanase), beta-glucanase (basal diet + 100 g/t of beta-glucanase), and xylanase (basal diet + 100 g/t of xylanase) groups. The results show that the supplementation of phytase and NSPases had no impacts (p > 0.05) on the growth performance of pigs. Compared with the control group, pigs fed with xylanase had higher (p < 0.05) Zn concentrations in the ileum and muscle and those fed with phytase had higher (p < 0.05) Zn concentrations in the ileum. Phytase and xylanase supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) fecal Zn concentrations in pigs compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, phytase, beta-mannanase, beta-glucanase, and xylanase supplementation up-regulated (p < 0.05) the FPN1 expression, whereas xylanase up-regulated (p < 0.05) the Znt1 expression in the duodenum of pigs compared with the control group. Moreover, phytase, beta-glucanase, and xylanase supplementation up-regulated (p < 0.05) the jejunal Znt1 expression compared with the control group. The intestinal morphology results show that the phytase, beta-mannanase, and xylanase groups had increased villus heights (VHs), an increased villus height-crypt depth ratio (VH:CD), and decreased crypt depths (CDs) in the duodenum, whereas phytase, beta-mannanase, beta-glucanase, and xylanase groups had decreased VH and VH:CD, and increased CD in the jejunum compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Pigs fed with exogenous enzymes had decreased bacterial diversity in the cecum. The dietary supplementation of NSPases increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and decreased spirochaetes (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, dietary NSPase treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the opportunistic pathogens, such as Treponema_2 and Eubacterium_ruminantium. Moreover, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014 and Lachnospiraceae were enriched in the beta-glucanase and beta-mannanase groups (p < 0.05), respectively. In conclusion, phytase and xylanase supplementation may promote zinc deposition in pigs. Additionally, the supplementation of NSPases may improve the gut health of pigs by modulating the intestinal morphology and microbiota.

AB  - Camellia drupifera is an important woody oil plant in South China, renowned for its seed oil that is rich in unsaturated fatty acids and possesses significant antioxidant, anti-cancer, and immune-enhancing properties. The low fruit-setting rate of C. drupifera is influenced by multiple factors, including flowering stage climate, flowering habits, pollination biology, soil conditions, and self-incompatibility. Among these, large-scale pure forest plantations are the primary cause of the low fruit-setting rate. Although previous studies have explored the impact of self-incompatibility on fruit-setting in C. drupifera, research on the dynamic changes of endogenous substances during the flowering stage in pure forest environments remains limited. Research findings indicate that tannase activity is relatively high in the pistils of C. drupifera, creating a favorable environment for pollen tube growth. Plant hormones such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cytokinin (CTK), gibberellin (GA), and ethylene (ETH) regulate the development and aging of floral organs through complex interactions. Specifically, high levels of IAA in the pistil promote pollen tube growth, while changes in ETH and ABA are closely related to the aging of floral organs. Under oxidative stress conditions, high levels of H(2)O(2 )in the pistil may contribute to self-incompatibility. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the floral organs during the flowering stage is significantly higher compared to peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), highlighting the critical role of SOD in regulating oxidative stress during this stage. This study provides new insights into the changes in endogenous substances in the floral organs of C. drupifera during the flowering stage. It offers theoretical references for understanding its sexual reproduction process and for the application of plant growth regulators to improve fruit setting.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar and is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The ASFV virion contains a long double-stranded DNA genome, which encodes more than 150 proteins. However, the immune escape mechanism and pathogenesis of ASFV remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a new binding partner of ASFV-encoded protein S273R (pS273R), which belongs to the SUMO-1 cysteine protease family. Further experiments demonstrated that ASFV pS273R-cleaved swine GSDMD in a manner dependent on its protease activity. ASFV pS273R specifically cleaved GSDMD at G107-A108 to produce a shorter N-terminal fragment of GSDMD consisting of residues 1 to 107 (GSDMD-N1-107). Interestingly, unlike the effect of GSDMD-N1-279 fragment produced by caspase-l-mediated cleavage, the assay of LDH release, cell viability, and virus replication showed that GSDMD-N1-107 did not trigger pyroptosis or inhibit ASFV replication. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism involved in the inhibition of ASFV infection-induced pyroptosis, which highlights an important function of pS273R in inflammatory responses and ASFV replication.

AB  - In this study, a composite material was synthesized through the co-pyrolysis of biochar doped with synthetic mordenite. The adsorption experiments conducted with BC@ASM on As(III) facilitated the determination of the optimal mass ratio of 20:1 (ASM: Yak dung) and a pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C. The adsorption properties of ASM and BC@ASM were examined through batch adsorption experiments and a range of characterization techniques. And the reaction mechanism was further elucidated by DFT calculations, revealing the essential difference in the adsorption of As(III) by ASM and BC@ASM. The adsorption kinetics of As(III) were found to align with both the pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models, while the isothermal adsorption was consistent with the Freundlich model. The maximum theoretical adsorption capacities were determined to be 371.9 mg/g and 449.6 mg/g, respectively. When the initial concentration of arsenite (As(III)) is 100 mg/L, the optimal dosage of synthetic mordenite is determined to be between 6 and 8 g/L, while the optimal dosage of the composite material ranges from 5 to 6 g/L. The composite material demonstrated significant resistance to fluctuations in pH. Within the pH range of 2-12, the removal efficiency is sustained between 78.3% and 88.7%. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity exhibited minimal sensitivity to the presence of anions such as chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and sulfate (SO42-) in the surrounding environment. In addition, BC@ASM facilitated the formation of arsenite-tannic acid complexes, which markedly improved its adsorption capacity for arsenite. In conclusion, the composite material presents a viable approach for addressing arsenic contamination in aquatic environments, while the foundational data offers a novel perspective for the remediation of metallic pollutants.

AB  - Tributyltin oxide (TBTO), an organotin compound, has been demonstrated to have toxic effects on several cell types. Previous research has shown that TBTO impairs mouse denuded oocyte maturation. However, limited information is available on the effects of TBTO exposure on livestock reproductive systems, especially on porcine oocytes in the presence of dense cumulus cells. In the present research, we evaluated the effects of TBTO exposure on porcine oocyte maturation and the possible underlying mechanisms. Porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes were cultured in maturation medium with or without TBTO for 42 h. We found that TBTO exposure during oocyte maturation prevented polar body extrusion, inhibited cumulus expansion and impaired subsequent blastocyst formation after parthenogenetic activation. Further analysis revealed that TBTO exposure not only induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation but also caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced intracellular ATP generation. In addition, TBTO exposure impaired porcine oocyte quality by disrupting cellular iron homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TBTO exposure impairs the porcine oocyte maturation process by inducing intracellular ROS accumulation, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, and disrupting cellular iron homeostasis, thus decreasing the quality and impairing the subsequent embryonic developmental competence of porcine oocytes.

AB  - Simple Summary In wildlife management, it is often necessary to capture live animals for resettlement or to collect biological samples. The method of trapping deer significantly affects the values of the vital parameters determining their welfare. This study provides hematological and serum biochemical intervals for physically captured free-ranging roe deer. The RBC, HCT, and Hb values were significantly lower in males than in females. These results may be helpful to create reference ranges for roe deer. This study presents the hematological and serum biochemical values of physically captured roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). The study material was blood sampled from roe deer captured with the use of a specialist trap mesh and no anesthesia. Blood samples were collected from 122 roe deer from January to April in 2016, 2017, and 2018 in the Lublin region of Poland. The hematological and biochemical variables were determined with results showing statistically significant differences between the mean values of RBC, HCT, and HB according to sex. Reference intervals should be more specific to the broad physical versus chemical capture categories.

AB  - The Anfinsen paradigm of representing a protein by a single conformer is challenged by the uncertainty predictions that come with AlphaFold models, which suggest a greater extent of disorder. Characterization of such conformation heterogeneity requires experimental approaches that do not depend on with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is such an approach. The double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique can access site-pair distance distributions in the 15-100 & Aring; range, directly informing on ensemble width. SDSL-EPR can be applied in cellular environments, and recent work indicates that protein disorder is even more pervasive than predicted by AlphaFold. This suggests that the Anfinsen paradigm should be replaced by an ensemble paradigm.

AB  - Simple Summary Microsatellite markers are widely used molecular markers for genetic studies, but choosing the right set involves a challenging trade-off between effectiveness and cost. The research aims to enhance the widely used ant colony optimization algorithm by integrating marker effectiveness indicators. By considering the genetic properties of the markers such as the polymorphic information content, the study seeks to determine the suitable way to select a reduced set of microsatellites. The approach addresses the accuracy-cost trade-off, aiding genetic assessments, breeding, and conservation efforts with cost-effective solutions. This research provides valuable insights into real-world genetic studies, including breeding programs and conservation initiatives.Abstract Microsatellites are polymorphic and cost-effective. Optimizing reduced microsatellite panels using heuristic algorithms eases budget constraints in genetic diversity and population genetic assessments. Microsatellite marker efficiency is strongly associated with its polymorphism and is quantified as the polymorphic information content (PIC). Nevertheless, marker selection cannot rely solely on PIC. In this study, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, a widely recognized optimization method, was adopted to create an enhanced selection scheme for refining microsatellite marker panels, called the PIC-ACO selection scheme. The algorithm was fine-tuned and validated using extensive datasets of chicken (Gallus gallus) and Chinese gorals (Naemorhedus griseus) from our previous studies. In contrast to basic optimization algorithms that stochastically initialize potential outputs, our selection algorithm utilizes the PIC values of markers to prime the ACO process. This increases the global solution discovery speed while reducing the likelihood of becoming trapped in local solutions. This process facilitated the acquisition of a cost-efficient and optimized microsatellite marker panel for studying genetic diversity and population genetic datasets. The established microsatellite efficiency metrics such as PIC, allele richness, and heterozygosity were correlated with the actual effectiveness of the microsatellite marker panel. This approach could substantially reduce budgetary barriers to population genetic assessments, breeding, and conservation programs.

AB  - Background Liaoning cashmere goat is recognized as a valuable genetic resource breed, with restrictions on genetic outflow in China. Hair follicle development in the cashmere goat is influenced by melatonin and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, the role of lncRNAs in facilitating melatonin-promoted cashmere growth remains poorly understood. Previous studies have identified a new lncRNA, lncRNA018392, which is involved in the melatonin-promoted proliferation of cashmere skin fibroblasts. Method Flow cytometry and CCK-8 assays confirmed that silencing lncRNA018392 negates the effects of melatonin on cell proliferation, and that proliferation was reduced when the gene CSF1R, located near lncRNA018392, was inhibited. Further investigation using a dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that lncRNA018392 could positively regulate the promoter of CSF1R. Results Results from RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) revealed that lncRNA018392 interacts with the transcription factor SPI1, with CSF1R being a downstream target gene regulated by SPI1. This interaction was confirmed by ChIP-PCR, which demonstrated SPI1's binding to CSF1R. Conclusions This study found that the melatonin-responsive lncRNA018392 accelerates the cell cycle and promotes cell proliferation by recruiting SPI1 to upregulate the expression of the neighboring gene CSF1R. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cashmere growth and for the molecular breeding of cashmere goats.

AB  - The overuse of chemical fertilizers and intensive cropping systems often results in soil quality degradation in the tropical and subtropical regions and affects cadmium (Cd) availability to crops. Therefore, studying the impact of agronomic managements on soil Cd adsorption and related mechanisms is critical for sustainable agriculture in tropical regions. Here, a three-year field experiment was conducted with five different agronomic managements [corn-pepper rotation with NPK fertilizers as control treatment (NPK), corn-pepper rotation with NPK fertilizers and sheep manure (NPKM), continuous corn cropping (CC), corn-pepper intercropping, and then rotation with green manure (CPGM), and corn-pepper rotation and then fallow (CPRF)]. The chemical characterization of bulk soils and soil aggregates from different treatments was performed and the isotherm adsorption experiments of Cd on different bulk soils and soil aggregates were conducted to investigate the effects of agronomic managements on characters of bulk soil and soil aggregates and subsequent effects on Cd adsorption. The results revealed that the maximum adsorption of Cd by bulk soil and various soil aggregates in the five treatments ranged from 0.235 to 0.627 and 0.222-1.360 mg g(-1), respectively. The change of maximum Cd adsorption with management was in the order of CPGM > CPPF > NPKM > CC > NPK, regardless of bulk soil and soil aggregates. Compared to the NPK treatments, total P and Fe contents were significantly increased in the bulk soil and various soil aggregates of the CPGM and CPRF treatments, respectively. Furthermore, SEM-EDS analysis implied that the micro-zone distribution of Cd in the bulk soil was closely related to P and Fe, especially in the CPGM treatment. Random forest model revealed that soil pH predominantly contributed to the Cd adsorption by both the bulk soil (8.7%) and 0.25-2.0 mm soil aggregates (10.8%) in the five treatments. However, the contribution of humic P, amorphous Fe oxide, labile inorganic P, labile organic P, and total P were significantly higher than soil pH for 0.053-0.25 mm and < 0.053 mm soil aggregates. Overall, corn-pepper intercropping with green manure rotation was promising for Cd immobilization by tropical soil because of the increased effective contents of P fractions and Fe oxides for Cd adsorption.

AB  - Software needs modifications and requires revisions regularly. Owing to these revisions, retesting software becomes essential to ensure that the enhancements made, have not affected its bug-free functioning. The time and cost incurred in this process, need to be reduced by the method of test case selection and prioritization. It is observed that many nature-inspired techniques are applied in this area. African Buffalo Optimization is one such approach, applied to regression test selection and prioritization. In this paper, the proposed work explains and proves the applicability of the African Buffalo Optimization approach to test case selection and prioritization. The proposed algorithm converges in polynomial time (O(n2)). In this paper, the empirical evaluation of applying African Buffalo Optimization for test case prioritization is done on sample data set with multiple iterations. An astounding 62.5% drop in size and a 48.57% drop in the runtime of the original test suite were recorded. The obtained results are compared with Ant Colony Optimization. The comparative analysis indicates that African Buffalo Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization exhibit similar fault detection capabilities (80%), and a reduction in the overall execution time and size of the resultant test suite. The results and analysis, hence, advocate and encourages the use of African Buffalo Optimization in the area of test case selection and prioritization.

AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) has been recently applied to measure lacrimal caruncle temperature non-invasively since this region is related to the sympathetic response, and it seems a promising technique that is able to infer negative emotions in sheep (e.g., fear). However, the scientific literature so far is limited in understanding whether a caruncle's temperature changes also in response to positive emotional states in sheep. Through classical conditioning, we aimed to assess how a positive or a negative event affects the physiological (lacrimal caruncle temperature measured with IRT and cortisol levels) and behavioral responses of sheep (ear position). Fourteen ewes from the same flock were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: positive (n = 7) and negative (n = 7). Each group was then trained through classical conditioning to associate a neutral auditory (ring bell) stimulus to an oncoming event: for the positive group, the presence of a food reward (maize grains), while for the negative one, the opening of an umbrella. After three weeks of training, before (at rest) and after (post-treatment), lacrimal caruncle temperature was non-invasively measured via IRT, and saliva samples were gently collected to measure cortisol levels. During treatment, sheep behavior was videorecorded and then analyzed using a focal animal sampling technique. At rest, the eye's lacrimal caruncle temperature was similar in both groups, while post-treatment, a significant increase was shown only in the negative group (t-test; p = 0.017). In the anticipation phase, sheep in the positive group kept their ears forward longer compared to those in the negative one (Mann-Whitney; p < 0.014), 8.3 +/- 2.1 s and 5.2 +/- 4.2 s, respectively. The behavioral response observed reflects a learnt association between a neutral stimulus and events with different emotional valence. Cortisol concentration slightly increased in both groups post-treatment. Our results confirm that IRT is a non-invasive technique that can be useful when applied to assess how positive and negative events may affect the physiological response in sheep.

AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for protein folding and activity, and the ability to recreate physiologically relevant PTM profiles on recombinantly-expressed proteins is vital for meaningful functional analysis. The ETS transcription factor ELK-1 serves as a paradigm for cellular responses to mitogens and can synergise with androgen receptor to promote prostate cancer progression, although in vitro protein function analyses to date have largely overlooked its complex PTM landscapes. We expressed and purified human ELK-1 using mammalian (HEK293T), insect (Sf9) and bacterial (E. coli) systems in parallel and compared PTMs imparted upon purified proteins, along with their performance in DNA and protein interaction assays. Phos-phorylation of ELK-1 within its transactivation domain, known to promote DNA binding, was most apparent in protein isolated from human cells and accordingly conferred the strongest DNA binding in vitro, while protein expressed in insect cells bound most efficiently to the androgen receptor. We observed lysine acetylation, a hitherto unreported PTM of ELK-1, which appeared highest in insect cell-derived ELK-1 but was also present in HEK293T-derived ELK-1. Acetylation of ELK-1 was enhanced in HEK293T cells following starvation and mitogen stimulation, and modified lysines showed overlap with previously identified regulatory SUMOylation and ubiquitination sites. Our data demonstrate that the choice of recombinant expression system can be tailored to suit biochemical application rather than to maximise soluble protein production and suggest the potential for crosstalk and antagonism between different PTMs of ELK-1.

AB  - Simple Summary Milk flow kinetics recording has been proven to be a valuable tool for milkability assessment in dairy animals. In this study, milk flow curves were recorded for Mediterranean buffaloes and Maghrebi she-camels and the effect of parity and lactation stage were tested. Results revealed that both buffalo and camel species have overall good milkability characteristics, with good milk production/milking and milk flow rates. Buffaloes had higher delayed milk ejection and a high prevalence of overmilking, resulting in longer milking time compared to camels. This study highlighted the need for good management practices to achieve a good milkability in both species.Abstract While considered as hard milkers, both buffaloes and camels are milked with equipment destined for dairy cows based on external morphological similarities with this species. This work aimed to study similarities and differences in milkability traits between Mediterranean buffaloes and Maghrebi she-camels and to evaluate the effect of parity and lactation stage. A total of 422 milk flow curves recorded with an electronic milkmeter (Lactocorder (R)) for both species were accessed. Milking characteristics including milk yield per milking, peak milk flow, average milk flow, duration of the main milking phase, duration of total milking, duration of various phases of milk flow, lag time and time to milk ejection, stripping yield, overmilking time and incidence of bimodal milk flow curves were evaluated for both species. Results showed that the values of milk yield per milking, duration of the main milking phase and duration of total milking were higher in buffaloes (3.98 +/- 0.10 kg; 4.07 +/- 0.11 min; 9.89 +/- 0.21 min, respectively) compared to camels (3.51 +/- 0.08 kg; 3.05 +/- 0.09 min; 3.76 +/- 0.09 min, respectively). However, camels had significantly higher peak and average milk flow (2.45 +/- 0.07 kg/min and 1.16 +/- 0.03 kg/min, respectively). Camels took significantly less time for milk ejection to occur. Only 15.49% of recorded curves were bimodal in buffaloes while 34.93% of bimodal curves were recorded for camels. Overmilking was significantly higher in buffaloes (3.64 +/- 0.21 min vs. 0.29 +/- 0.02 min). Parity and lactation stage had a significant effect on most studied milking traits suggesting the need for some particular practices with primiparous animals and animals at different levels of lactation for both species.

AB  - Feeding thermally oxidized lipids to pigs has been shown to compromise growth and health, reduce energy digestibility, and disrupt lipid metabolism. However, the effects of feeding oxidized lipids on amino acid metabolism in pigs have not been well defined even though amino acids are indispensable for the subsistence of energy metabolism, protein synthesis, the antioxidant system, and many other functions essential for pig growth and health. In this study, oxidized corn oil (OCO)-elicited changes in amino acid homeostasis of nursery pigs were examined by metabolomics-based biochemical analysis. The results showed that serum and hepatic free amino acids and metabolites, including tryptophan, threonine, alanine, glutamate, and glutathione, as well as associated metabolic pathways, were selectively altered by feeding OCO, and more importantly, many of these metabolic events possess protective functions. Specifically, OCO activated tryptophan-nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) synthesis by the transcriptional upregulation of the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan catabolism and promoted adenine nucleotide biosynthesis. Feeding OCO induced oxidative stress, causing decreases in glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, carnosine, and ascorbic acid in the liver but simultaneously promoted antioxidant responses as shown by the increases in hepatic GSH and GSSG as well as the transcriptional upregulation of GSH metabolism-related enzymes. Moreover, OCO reduced the catabolism of threonine to alpha-ketobutyrate in the liver by inhibiting the threonine dehydratase (TDH) route. Overall, these protective metabolic events indicate that below a certain threshold of OCO consumption, nursery pigs are capable of overcoming the oxidative stress and metabolic challenges posed by the consumption of oxidized lipids by adjusting antioxidant, nutrient, and energy metabolism, partially through the transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism.

AB  - Green agriculture faced challenges due to the shortage of efficient cadmium (Cd)-resistant plant growth- promoting bacteria (CdR-PGPB) and their low survival rate and activity during application. In this study, a diverse range of efficient CdR-PGPB were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Desmodium elegans, , especially those with high phosphate-solubilizing capabilities (272.87-450.45 mg L-- 1 ). Two highly efficient CdR-PGPB namely, XH1 and XH3 were loaded on to rice husk biochar (RHB) and pig bone biochar (PBB), labelled as RHBM and PBBM respectively. This study aimed to explore their effectiveness and mechanisms in promoting maize growth in a Cd-contaminated planting system. Results showed that PBBM performed best among all treatments. It significantly decreased soil phytoavailable Cd by 53.19 % and Cd content in maize shoot by 85.89 %. It also increased soil available phosphorus by 145.72 %, soil alkaline phosphatase activity by 76.34 %, maize shoot/root biomass by 47.06 %/67.98 %, Chlorophyll (a/b) content by 66.80 %/134.13 % and peroxidase activity by 171.96 %. These results were achieved through the synergistic action of efficient CdR-PGPB and PBB. Therefore, PBBM proved to be a promising and innovative application technique for sustainable agricultural development in Cd-contaminated farmland ecosystems.

AB  - Background and Aims: Coprophilous ascomycetes are saprobic organisms capable of degrading plant material that was not fully descomposed in the process of animal digestion. In the most recent global review, a total of 9666 records of ascomycetes were reported in 1376 excreta. For Mexico, during the 1970's 23 new species were described of the country, and to date the research of this group of fungi has not been carried out in depth. The objective of this study is to analyze the taxonomic diversity of fimicolous fungi from a xerophilous shrubland in the state of Hidalgo, including qualitative histochemical tests. Methods: Excreta samples were collected between 2023 and 2024. In the laboratory, they were placed in a wet chamber for two months so that the fruiting bodies could develop. The material was determined based on macro-and microscopic morphological characters. In addition, qualitative histochemical tests were carried out. The material was deposited in the herbarium ENCB. Key results: Twenty-nine species were determined in 19 genera, 14 families and four orders of Ascomycota, of which 16 are cited for the first time for the country. Moreover, Coprotus sangabrielensis is proposed as new to science and a taxonomic key is presented for the species in this study. Qualitative histochemical tests reveal that the fimicolous ascomycetes studied may contain alkaloids, terpenoids and polysaccharides. Conclusions: With the present study, the number of known species of coprophilous ascomycetes for the Mexican mycobiota was increased to 127. It is also the first study to consider histochemical tests in coprophilous fungi from Mexico, suggesting that the main metabolite groups are alkaloids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides, located mainly in asci and paraphyses, important for their use in future biotechnological applications.

AB  - Simple Summary Different species can harbor coronavirus, including domestic and wild animals. The Coroviridae family is composed of four genera, including Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Some domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in natural and experimental infections. The infection of animals is generally a consequence of close contact with COVID-19 patients. Among domestic animals, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in respiratory ex vivo organ cultures of domestic ruminants. In this context, there is no information about the role sheep can play in the spread of the infection. This study tested the antibody response in 90 serum samples from sheep from the pre-pandemic period and 336 serum samples from sheep from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed were seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first serosurvey in sheep to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Future investigations should analyze the epidemiological role of sheep in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the prevalence of infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the zoonotic causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a pandemic situation with millions of infected humans worldwide. Among domestic animals, there have been limited studies regarding the transmissibility and exposure to the infection in natural conditions. Some animals are exposed and/or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cats, ferrets and dogs. By contrast, there is no information about the susceptibility of ruminants to SARS-CoV-2. This study tested the antibody response in 90 ovine pre-pandemic serum samples and 336 sheep serum samples from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed was seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep. Our results suggest that it seems unlikely that sheep could play a relevant role in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is the first study to report the absence of evidence of sheep exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in natural conditions.

AB  - The impaired immune regulation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) disrupts T-cell homeostasis and alters the immunological environment in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the defective immune functions of BM-MSCs in patients with SLE remain unclear. Here, we report that BM-MSCs derived from MRL/lpr mice exhibit a diminished proliferative capacity, elevated levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and increased levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These BM-MSCs can increase splenocyte proliferation and upregulate the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR gamma t) in EL4 cells, which constitute a murine T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Furthermore, MRL/lpr mice treated with FICZ (an AhR agonist) displayed splenomegaly and exacerbated renal pathology, alongside increased levels of AhR, and inflammatory cytokines. Notably, BM-MSCs isolated from FICZ-treated mice also facilitated splenocyte proliferation and increased the ROR gamma t level in EL4 cells during coculture. Similar effects were observed when BM-MSCs were exposed to FICZ in vitro, but these effects were reversed by the administration of CH223191 (an AhR antagonist). Additionally, the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) was significantly increased in both MRL/lpr mice and FICZ-treated BM-MSCs. Importantly, verteporfin (a Hippo-YAP inhibitor) attenuated the elevated ROR gamma t levels in EL4 cells and the increased splenocyte proliferation. This study advances our understanding of SLE pathogenesis by pinpointing AhR as a pivotal modulator of the inflammatory response of BM-MSCs through the Hippo-YAP pathway in individuals with SLE. This novel insight not only enriches the current knowledge of SLE mechanisms but also highlights new potential therapeutic targets for SLE.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a mathematical model for Streptococcus suis, which is an epidemic by considering the moisture that affects the infection. The disease is caused by Streptococcus suis infection found in pigs which can be transmitted to humans. The patients of Streptococcus suis were generally found in adults males and the elderly who contacted pigs or who ate uncooked pork. In human cases, the infection can cause a severe illness and death. This disease has an impact to the financial losses in the swine industry. In the development of models for this disease, we have divided the population into 7 related groups which are susceptible pig compartment, infected pig compartment, quarantined pig compartment, recovered pig compartment, susceptible human compartment, infected human compartment, and recovered human compartment. After that, we use this model and a quarantine strategy to analyze the spread of the infection. In addition, the basic reproduction number R-0 is determined by using the next-generation matrix which can analyze the stability of the model. The numerical simulations of the proposed model are illustrated to confirm the results from theorems. The results showed that there is an effect from moisture to the disease transmission. When the moisture increases the disease infection also increases.

AB  - In some biogeographic regions, many threatened plant species occur in habitats that periodically experience bushfire. However, we currently have relatively little information on how important plant-animal and plant-fungus interactions are affected by these fires. For the threatened sexually deceptive orchid Caladenia tessellata we test whether pollination rate, frequency of florivory, and the species of mycorrhizae the plant associates with differ between burnt and unburnt sites. Interestingly, pollination rates were unaffected by fire, demonstrating that populations of the thynnine wasp pollinator can persist post-fire. However, there was a significant negative relationship between number of flowers in a population and pollination success, which is likely a by-product of a deceptive pollination strategy. Despite the presence of vertebrate herbivores, florivory rates were low in both burnt and unburnt sites. Caladenia tessellata associated primarily with the mycorrhiza Serendiptia australiana, regardless of fire history. While our results suggest resilience to a one-off summer fire for the ecological interactions that we measured, it would be interesting to investigate the effects of fire frequency and time of year. High reproductive rates in small populations of C. tessellata suggest these populations may be viable and that retaining them is a high priority for conservation.

AB  - In Italy, in ten years, the national production of sheep's cheese has gone from 60 thousand tons to almost 80 thousand tons at present, a sign of a lively dynamism of the sector mainly due to a growth in demand. The significant leap in production is accompanied by that of consumption and is mainly due to pecorino (fresh and seasoned), which, together with fresh ricotta, is gaining acceptance in the national and international markets. The objective of the paper is to examine, in a study area of southern Italy, consumer preferences for locally produced pecorino cheese near kilometer zero and the profit margins of the dairy companies producing pecorino. The interviews with consumers made it possible to explore purchasing preferences based on the reasons for choosing and the points of sale where consumers buy the cheese. The interviews with the manufacturing companies highlighted a different business organization of the single production units whose economic results show, despite the difficulties, the resilience of the companies. The company's net margins per quintal of processed milk are more or less satisfactory and supported by the positive interest of consumers. As for the latter, they show increasingly pushed trends towards the purchase of niche products at Km0, made with more sustainable production systems.

AB  - Microplastics occur widely in the terrestrial environment and they currently occur in organic fertilizers applied to agricultural land. However, there is little information available on the accumulation of microplastics in soils fertilized over the long term. Here, we investigate the characteristics of microplastics in both pig manure and soil following long-term manure application in an attempt to assess their accumulation and the potential risk to agricultural soils of repeated application of pig manure. Microplastics were separated from soil and pig manure samples using a sequential flow separation and flotation method. The abundances of microplastics were 16.4 +/- 2.7 and 43.8 +/- 16.2 particles kg(-1) in control plots (CK, no manure applied) and plots amended annually with pig manure for 22 years (PM), respectively. The microplastics (especially fragments) were significantly enriched in PM-amended soil compared with the control plots. The average annual abundance of microplastics was 1250 +/- 640 particles kg(-1) in manure. Interestingly, the type and polymer composition of microplastics were very similar in the soil and manure. Differences in color and particle size indicate that microplastics sourced from pig manure may be gradually weathered and degraded after incorporation into the soil. The average accumulation rate of microplastics in the agricultural soil with long-term application of pig manure was estimated to be 3.50 +/- 1.71 million particles ha(-1) a(-1). The microplastics in the manured soil displayed complicated weathered surfaces. The presence of carbonyl groups suggests that the weathered microplastics in soil may have the potential to adsorb contaminants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated two surgical sterilization techniques in free-ranging female capybaras (n = 21). The first group underwent uterine horn ligature (HL; n = 11), while the second was subjected to partial salpingectomy (S; n = 10). We assessed total operative time, incision length, the ease of identifying reproductive structures, the adequacy of exposure for surgical performance through flank or midline approaches, and the extent of abdominal viscera manipulation for each method. The HL method emerged as faster, with an average operative time difference of 16 minutes. In the S group, a flank mini-laparotomy over the ovarian topography facilitated easy exposure of the ipsilateral ovary and uterine tube, enabling ligature and partial resection of the uterine tube but not the uterine horn exposure. However, accessing the contralateral uterine tube without a bilateral incision was impractical, thus prolonging the total operative time due to the need for patient repositioning and new antisepsis procedures. Conversely, a post-umbilical approach for the HL method necessitated only one mini-laparotomy incision, offering ample uterine exposure for hysterotomy in pregnant females. Both methods involved minimal abdominal viscera manipulation and resulted in no fatalities or postoperative complications. Although direct comparison is limited by the distinct sterilization techniques and surgical approaches, this study underscores the challenges and surgical access of each method. Our findings endorse the HL technique as an effective contraception method for female capybaras to prevent the birth of seronegative offspring that could amplify Rickettsia sp., the causative agent of Brazilian spotted fever.

AB  - Reduction of conflicts arising from human-wildlife interactions is necessary for coexistence. Collisions between animals and automobiles cost the world's economy billions of dollars, and wildlife management agencies often are responsible for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions. But wildlife agencies have few proven options for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions that are effective and financially feasible at large spatiotemporal scales germane to management. Recreational hunting by humans is a primary population management tool available for use with abundant wild ungulates that often collide with automobiles. Therefore, we tested how well policies designed to increase human hunting of deer (longer hunting seasons and increased harvest limits) reduced collisions between white-tailed deer and automobiles along 618 km of high-risk roadways in Indiana, USA. We used a 20-y dataset that compiled >300,000 deer-vehicle collisions. Targeted recreational hunting decreased deer-vehicle collisions by 21.12 % and saved society up to $653,756 (95 % CIs = $286,063-$1,154,118) in economic damages from 2018 to 2022. Potential savings was up to $1,265,694 (95 % CIs = $579,108-$2,402,813) during the same 5-y span if relaxed hunting regulations occurred along all high-risk roadways. Moreover, license sales from targeted hunting generated $206,268 in revenue for wildlife management. Targeted hunting is likely effective in other systems where ungulate-vehicle collisions are prevalent, as behavioral changes in response to human hunting has been documented in many ungulate species across several continents. Our methods are attractive for management agencies with limited funds, as relaxed hunting regulations are relatively inexpensive to implement and may generate substantial additional revenue.

AB  - Wool is the critical textile raw material which is produced by the hair follicle of sheep. Therefore, it has important implications to investigate the molecular mechanism governing hair follicle development. Due to high cellular heterogeneity as well as the insufficient cellular, molecular, and spatial characterization of hair follicles on sheep, the molecular mechanisms involved in hair follicle development and wool curvature of sheep remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have made it possible to comprehensively dissect the cellular composition of complex skin tissues and unveil the differentiation and spatial signatures of epidermal and hair follicle development. However, such studies are lacking so far in sheep. Here, single-cell suspensions from the curly wool and straight wool lambskins were prepared for unbiased scRNA-seq. Based on UAMP dimension reduction analysis, we identified 19 distinct cell populations from 15,830 single-cell transcriptomes and characterized their cellular identity according to specific gene expression profiles. Furthermore, novel marker gene was applied in identifying dermal papilla cells isolated in vitro. By using pseudotime ordering analysis, we constructed the matrix cell lineage differentiation trajectory and revealed the dynamic gene expression profiles of matrix progenitors' commitment to the hair shaft and inner root sheath (IRS) cells. Meanwhile, intercellular communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells was inferred based on CellChat and the prior knowledge of ligand-receptor pairs. As a result, strong intercellular communication and associated signaling pathways were revealed. Besides, to clarify the molecular mechanism of wool curvature, differentially expressed genes in specific cells between straight wool and curly wool were identified and analyzed. Our findings here provided an unbiased and systematic view of the molecular anatomy of sheep hair follicle comprising 19 clusters; revealed the differentiation, spatial signatures, and intercellular communication underlying sheep hair follicle development; and at the same time revealed the potential molecular mechanism of wool curvature, which will give important new insights into the biology of the sheep hair follicle and has implications for sheep breeding.

AB  - Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is a parasite that poses a considerable threat to aquaculture and the ornamental fish industry, but with limited effective treatment options available. This study employed RT-qPCR to detect and analyze the expression changes of partial toll-like receptor (TLR) genes ( TLR1 and TLR21), ), adapter protein and signal transduction molecule genes ( MyD88 , TRIF, , NF-kappa B, kappa B , IRAK4, , and IRF3), ), and cytokines (IL IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-13, , CXC alpha and CXCR1), ), as well as complement C3 , in the skin, gill, fin, liver, head kidney and spleen of Rhinogobio ventralis under different infection conditions. Additionally, tissue sections and scanning electron microscopy were utilized to observe the pathological changes in the gills and fins of R. ventralis after infection with I. multifiliis. . The expression patterns of TLR-related DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in diseased wild fish were analyzed, revealing upregulation of TLR1, , TLR21, , MyD88, , NF-kappa B, kappa B , IRAK4, , TRIF, , IRF3, , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-13, , CXC alpha, CXCR1, , and C3 genes in various tissues, indicating that these genes may be involved in the immune response of R. ventralis to I. multifiliis infection. To further analyze the gene expression of sampled from the field, an artificial infection model of R. ventralis was established under laboratory conditions, with additional sampling from the skin and fins. These genes continued to show varying degrees of upregulation, but the results were not entirely consistent with those from Wudongde samples, which may be due to the more complex environment in the wild or differences in the degree of I. multifiliis infection in wild fish. The infection of I. multifiliis caused severe damage to the gills and fins of R. ventralis, , characterized by extensive secretions on the gill and fin surfaces, with the presence of attached I. multifiliis trophonts, including damage and loss of gill filaments, swollen gill lamellae, and deformed gill plates, as well as cell proliferation and necrosis of gill epithelial cells. This study sheds light on the role of the TLR signaling pathway in resisting I. multifiliis infection and its associated histopathological changes in R. ventralis, , providing valuable insights for the prevention and treatment of I. multifiliis infection in R. ventralis. .

AB  - Farmers in developing countries often work in challenging environments with poor infrastructure, marginal agricultural potential, and limited economic opportunities. These challenges are exacerbated when wildlife impact human livelihoods. Here, we analyze data quantifying the type and frequency of human-wildlife impacts within communal conservancies across Namibia and explore possible drivers of temporal and spatial variation of these data. A total of 112,165 human-wildlife impacts were reported between 2001 and 2019 at the national level, with livestock depredation the most common. Marked regional variation was however evident with crop raiding and attacks on humans more prevalent in the mesic North-East, and both livestock depredation and infrastructure damage highest in the arid north-western regions. Elephant, jackal, hyena, cheetah, and leopard (in descending order) were the species most frequently linked to reported damage. Distance to the nearest protected area and river, terrain ruggedness, conservancy size, and annual rainfall (amongst others) all had a significant impact on both the distribution and extent of human-wildlife impact reports. Reports did not vary significantly with years but were significantly influenced by average monthly rainfall. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of human-wildlife impacts at a national scale, in addition to their potential drivers, allows for the identification of conflict hotspots and the allocation of resources and expertise to mitigate them. Ultimately, mitigating negative interactions between people and wildlife will allow for the continued sharing of space and with that the sustainability of a model that has seen a dramatic increase in both the distribution and abundance of wildlife in Namibia.

AB  - In Jangsudae of Seoraksan National Park, South Korea, 14 mammal species have been listed, including ten medium- and large-sized species; additionally, this region is an important habitat for the endangered long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus). In this study, a camera trap survey was conducted over 103 monitoring days at 18 sites in Jangsudae to evaluate the minimum trapping effort (MTE) needed to detect the ten listed mammal species. The most photographed species were the longtailed goral, wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Asian badger (Meles leucurus), accounting for 77.1% (n = 366) of the total independent photographs. Long-tailed goral, the most frequently captured mammal species (44.8%), was captured at 17 camera sites (relative abundance index = 206.8). According to the rarefaction analysis, 1840 camera days (102.2 monitoring days at 18 camera sites) were required to photograph all ten resident species. Moreover, at least 1010 and 664 camera days were required to detect 95% and 90% of the ten residential species, respectively. MTE was evaluated in summer when wild species were highly detectable owing to their high activity. Future studies should evaluate MTE through one-year long-term monitoring that includes all four seasons, and compare the results with those of this study.

AB  - Investigations on heat stress induced transcriptomic changes is critical to characterization of candidate genes for thermal adaptability in livestock. Continues spells of high ambient temperature due to climate change has amplified reproductive dysfunctions, necessitating immediate attention. The present study aimed to explore the transcriptomic signature of heat stressed granulosa cells (GCs) and signalling pathways regulating their adaptability to thermal challenge. The GCs were collected from small follicles (3-6 mm) of pig ovary. The GCs primary culture was subjected to in vitro heat stress challenge at 42 OC for 6 h. RNA sequencing was conducted for heat stress (treated) and non-heat stress (control) groups using Illumina NextSeq2000 sequencing platform. The significant DEGs were selected using NOISeq R package with cut-offs, probability value >= 0.95 and log2 fold change >= 1. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted for exploring gene ontology enrichment, functional pathways, hub genes in protein-protein interaction network and functional clusters regulating cellular homeostasis and survivability during heat stress challenge. The analysis pipeline yielded a total of 12156 protein coding transcripts, which were expressed during heat stress challenge in GCs, out of which 4904 were differentially (prob. >= 0.95) expressed; 2936 were upregulated and 1968 were downregulated. The large number of DEGs and gene ontologies in the study specifies the concerted mechanisms involving multiple signalling pathways like MAPK, HIPPO, WNT, PI3-AKT, NFKB, NOTCH and many more operating in the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis. Thermal stress induced differentially expressed hub genes HSP90, HSPA8, HSPA5, TGFB1 and PPARG are key elements in stress, regulating multiple pathways and expression of transcription factors. The TNF signalling pathway, phosphatidyl inositol signalling system and DERL3 gene network linked ubiquitin-dependent endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation pathway, which regulates cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and estrogen synthesis, can be regarded as novel regulators involved in stress adaptation in pigs.

KW  - toxicity
AB  - Copper is an essential trace element but becomes toxic in overexposed animals. Sheep are the domestic species most prone to chronic copper poisoning, as a slight increase in the dietary concentration can lead to liver accumulation and the development of clinical signs in this species. Common sources of copper in the diet are feed additives and mineral supplements, which are commonly used in pigs and poultry. Recently, new copper supplements were registered for animal nutrition, including copper bilysinate. This study describes an episode of presumed chronic copper poisoning in Five Texel sheep, which were exposed to a compound feed containing copper bilysinate. Four weeks after the introduction of the compound feed into the diet, the first animal started to show typical clinical signs of chronic copper poisoning and died, followed by another animal a week later. Despite removing the compound feed from the diet, a third sheep died 3 weeks later. Two animals survived and fully recovered. Necropsy and histology showed characteristic gross and microscopical lesions typical of copper poisoning. The case report highlights the potential toxic effect of copper bilysinate in sheep.

TI  - Expression of nanobodies in Arabidopsis thaliana strengthens the absorption capacity of triclosan from growth media
T2  - PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
LA  - English
KW  - PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial disinfectant widely used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Due to the extensive usage of PPCPs, TCS inevitably entered the environment and pose harmful effects on the ecosystem. Phytoremediation is an attractive approach to remove TCS from the environment. In this study, a gene encoding the anti-TCS nanobody was transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) to enhance the absorption capacity of TCS. Nanobodies are small antibody fragments (ca. 15 kDa) derived from the variable domain of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies. We constructed two transgenic lines, the T-S-C line with nanobody expression throughout the plant and the T-S-P line with nanobody expression dominant in the roots, were constructed. The expression of nanobodies in A. thaliana alleviated the phytotoxicity of TCS. T-S-C and T-S-P exhibited significantly stronger tolerance to TCS toxicity than the wild type (WT), in either a solid medium system or a hydroponics system. Under the stress of TCS, the seedlings of both transgenic plants exhibited an increase in root length and fresh weight compared to those of WT. Moreover, in the presence of TCS, the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in transgenic plants were higher than those in WT. The concentration of TCS absorbed into the T-S-C and T-S-P plants from the solid medium increased by 50.0% and 24.1%, and from the hydroponics system increased by 55.6% and 38.0%, respectively, compared to those absorbed by WT. This study provides a proof of principle that transforming nanobodies into plants represents a novel technology to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation for environmental pollutants.

AB  - Studies of European trade have largely focused on bulk commodities, ignoring minor products. The Danish Soundtoll Registers Online (STRO) document the North-Baltic Seas maritime trade from the 16th century to the 19th. They are an untapped resource to understand the trade of plant products. Here, we present an overview of plants recorded in the STRO from 1497-1857, based on thousands of handwritten vernacular plant name variations in Danish. We found 264 plant products corresponding to 140 botanical taxa. We confirm previous findings regarding bulk goods, such as wood, wine, and (sub)tropical spices, but also uncover trade of wild food plants and herbal medicines. Notably dodder (Cuscuta spp.) and purging cassia (Cassia fistula L.) were traded as frequently as currently well-known plant-based commodities such as tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] Kuntze) and rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum L.). This indicates their former importance. Through the botanically identified dataset we present here, the STRO reveal the diversity of historical plant trade. We discuss what this overview adds to the understanding of historic plant trade in Europe and outline suggestions for future research that can be addressed using these data.

AB  - Termites are a significant pest of buildings, agriculture, and trees, and are mainly controlled by baiting. However, baiting systems are available for only lower termites (Rhinotermitidae) not for higher termites (Termitidae). Termite foraging behavior associated with baiting systems varies among species and families, and plays a significant role in baiting success. Here, foraging behavior of Odontotermes obesus (Blattodea: Termitidae: Macrotermitinae), a fungus-growing higher termite, was investigated relative to three bait-station sizes (small, medium, and large) containing different quantities of food. Significantly more workers recruited to large stations (470/station) compared to medium (246/station) and small (124/station) stations. Abundance of O. obesus in large and medium stations significantly positively correlated with relative humidity whereas negative but non-significant correlations were observed with temperature in large and medium stations. Total and continuous contacts with the stations increased with time and were greater in large stations. Station abandonment due to disturbance was significantly less in large stations (3%) followed by medium (9%) and small stations (20%). Our results suggest that large stations (approximate to 8 litres volume) work best for population management of O. obesus and other related fungus-growing higher termites.

AB  - Gut mycobiota are part of the gut microbiome, typically derived from the host diet and living environment. In this study, we examined the gut mycobiota of three snub-nosed monkeys: Rhinopithecus roxellana, R. bieti, and R. strykeri using next-generation amplicon sequencing targeting the fungal internal transcribed spacer. The alpha diversity indexes of gut mycobiota in R. bieti were significantly higher than R. roxellana and R. strykeri, the beta diversity indicated that R. roxellana and R. bieti had more similar feeding habits. Core mycobiota demonstrated commonalities among the three species and potentially associated with feeding habits. Mycobiota displaying significant differences exhibited the respective characteristics of the host, likely associated with the hosts' living environment. Among them, animal and plant pathogenic fungi and lichen parasites are potential threats to the survival of snub-nosed monkeys for their pathogenicity to both monkeys and their food plants. Functionally, fungal trophic modes and functional guilds revealed a strong association between gut mycobiota and host diet. We found a higher abundance and more significant correlations with lichen parasitic fungi in R. strykeri than the other two species, indicating potential threats to their foods. Accordingly, this study revealed the basic structures of gut mycobiota of three wild Rhinopithecus species and highlighted the associations between gut mycobiota and their feeding habits and living environments. Furthermore, due to the close connection between fungi and the environment, animals could ingest fungi from their diet; thus, we speculate that gut mycobiota may serve a role in environmental monitoring for wildlife.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the birth type on milk yield (MY), milk characteristics and milk somatic cell count (SCC) in two Turkish sheep breeds. In this study, 3.0-3.5 years old Karayaka (n=35) and Bafra ewes (n=45) were used. Animals were kept until their milk yield was reduced to 50 g/d. The lactation milk yields (LMY) of single and multiple bearing ewes in Karayaka and Bafra breeds were 99.48 +/- 9.66 and 126.01 +/- 10.75 kg (P<0.05), and 104.89 +/- 8.57 and 165.62 +/- 10.79 kg (P<0.05), respectively. Lactation lengths (LL) of single and multiple bearing ewes in Karayaka and Bafra sheep breeds were 114.89 +/- 1.95 and 110.92 +/- 1.07 and 131.25 +/- 1.54 and 131.70 +/- 2.99 d (P<0.01), respectively. The log(10)SCC in milk in Bafra ewes with single, twin and triplet + quadruplet were 5.21 +/- 0.15, 5.14 +/- 0.06 and 5.003 +/- 0.05 and single and twin bearing for Karayaka ewes were 4.94 +/- 0.06 and 5.04 +/- 0.07, respectively. The SCC (>= 7.5x10(5)) affected MY (P<0.05) and milk components (MC, P<0.01) significantly. With the increase in the number of sucking lambs in the Bafra breed, the SCC in the milk decreased (P<0.05), but not in Karayaka.

AB  - Our study aimed to investigate seasonal variation in the activity of arboreal and semi-arboreal mammals and investigate their overlap in temporal activity, as well temporal shifts in activity because of behavioural interference. In our camera trapping study in a fragmented landscape in south-eastern Australia, a total of ten arboreal and semi-arboreal species were found, with 35,671 independent observations recorded over 6517 camera trap nights. All species were found to be nocturnal; however, a notable number of daytime observations were made for several species (i.e. brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii; sugar glider, Petaurus breviceps; bush rat, Rattus fuscipes; brown rat, Rattus norvegicus). Seasonal variations in diel activity were observed through an increase in crepuscular activity in spring and summer for antechinus, sugar gliders, brown rats, brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula and ringtail possums, Pseudocheirus peregrinus. Diel activity overlap between species was high, that is 26/28 species comparisons had overlap coefficients (Delta) > 0.75. The species pair with the least amount of overlap was between southern bobucks, Trichosurus cunninghami and brown antechinus (Delta 4 = 0.66). The species pair with the most overlap was between the native sugar glider and introduced brown rat (Delta 4 = 0.93). When comparing the activity of sugar gliders in sites with low and high abundance of brown rats, sugar gliders appear to shift their activity relative to the brown rats. Similarly, behavioural interference was also observed between antechinus and sugar gliders, and when comparing sites of low and high abundance of sugar glider, antechinus had a shift in activity. Our work provides some of the first quantification of temporal patterns for several of the species in this study, and the first for a community of arboreal and semi-arboreal mammals. Our results indicate that some shifts in behaviour are potentially occurring in response to behavioural interference, allowing for coexistence by means of temporal partitioning.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a complex adipose tissue within skeletal muscle, appearing specially tissue heterogeneous, and the factors influencing its formation remain unclear. In conditions such as diabetes, aging, and muscle wasting, IMF was deposited in abnormal locations in skeletal muscle, damaged the normal physiological functions of skeletal muscle. Here, we used Longissimus dorsi muscles from pigs with different IMF contents as samples and adopted a method combining spatial transcriptome (ST) and single-nucleus RNA-seq to identify the spatial heterogeneity of IMF. ST revealed that genes involved in TGF-beta signaling pathways were specifically highly enriched in IMF. In lean pigs, IMF autocrine produces more TGF-beta 2, while in obese pigs, IMF received more endothelial-derived TGF-beta 1. In vitro experiments have proven that porcine endothelial cells in a simulated high-fat environment released more TGF-beta 1 than TGF-beta 2. Moreover, under obesity mice, the addition of TGF-beta after muscle injury abolished IMF production and slowed muscle repair, whereas TGF-beta inhibition accelerated muscle repair. Our findings demonstrate that the TGF-beta pathway specifically regulates these processes, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target for managing muscle atrophy in obese patients and enhancing muscle repair while reducing IMF deposition.

AB  - Background and aims Host-specific Epichloe spp. are endophytic fungal symbionts of pooid grasses that produce herbivore-deterring alkaloids and alter the host's metabolite and protein profiles. Early observations suggested that Epichloe may have negative allelopathic effects on neighbouring plant species, particularly Trifolium spp. clovers, but subsequent allelopathy experiments produced variable results. We examined two hypotheses: (1) Epichloe strains differ in allelopathic effect, and (2) Epichloe allelopathy negatively affects other plant species. Methods We performed a greenhouse experiment using root exudates from Lolium perenne L. hosting different E. festucae var. lolii (Latch, M.J. Chr. & Samuels) C.W. Bacon & Schardl strains to compare their allelopathic effects on native legumes and forbs. We then used meta-analysis to examine the evidence to date for allelopathic effects of Epichloe endophytes. Results We found little difference in effect among E. festucae var. lolii strains and very little evidence for negative allelopathic effects of Epichloe in cool-season grasses across a range of methodologies, target plant species, and response measures. Negative allelopathic effects were detected only for root hair measures, which were from a single study. Positive effects on biomass were found for some experimental subgroups, including legumes. However, the majority of response variables showed no evidence for Epichloe allelopathy. Conclusions Although there is currently little evidence for negative Epichloe allelopathic effects, our meta-analysis identified several research gaps. Experiments testing the functional belowground effects of Epichloe presence may help to determine its effects on non-host plant performance via plant-soil feedbacks.

AB  - We propose novel strategies for primate experimentation that are ethically valuable and pragmatically useful for cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatric research. Specifically, we propose Natural Laboratory Complex or Natural Labs, which are a combination of indoor-outdoor structures for studying free moving and socially housed primates in natural or naturalistic environment. We contend that Natural Labs are pivotal to improve primate welfare, and at the same time to implement longitudinal and socio-ecological studies of primate brain and behavior. Currently emerging advanced technologies and social systems (including recent COVID-19 induced "remote" infrastructures) can speed-up cognitive neuroscience approaches in freely behaving animals. Experimental approaches in natural(istic) settings are not in competition with conventional approaches of laboratory investigations, and could establish several benefits at the ethical, experimental, and economic levels.

AB  - Simple Summary Intensification of pig farming increases the profitability of farms but also leads to greater local environmental pressure from manure nutrient loss. There are various technologies for pig manure processing. Each technological solution provides specific nutrient content in the end-products (organic fertilisers, effluents, biogas, etc.). The methodology was developed for choosing proper technological solutions for pig farms with due account for the whole variety of combinations of production and natural and climatic conditions. It includes an accurate accounting for nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the manure processing and utilisation chain and considers the limiting factors of the farm and the end-product customer requirements. The methodology was applied to a large-scale pig farm in the Leningrad Region. The best suitable processing technology was identified demonstrating the total amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the end-products of 278.94 t per year. The developed methodology can serve as an effective tool to reduce manure nutrient loss and mitigate the adverse effect on the rural environment. The current trend towards larger pig farms increases their profitability but might harm animal welfare and the environment. More efficient pig manure management is a way to address this challenge. Available manure handling and utilisation systems may feature from 8 to 50% nutrient loss to the environment. Therefore, the proper choice of technological solutions is of high priority. In regard, the study developed a methodology including calculation, analysis and modelling techniques for the accurate accounting of manure amount, its fractions and their nitrogen and phosphorus content for different processing technologies with due regard to the limiting factors of the farm and the end-product consumer requirements. The methodology was applied to justify the best suitable processing technology for a large-scale pig farm in the Leningrad Region with 17,800 heads of pigs and 54,750 t of pig manure per year. The selected technology included manure separation into fractions, aeration and secondary sedimentation of the liquid fraction and passive composting of the solid fraction. It demonstrated the total amount of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the end-products of 278.94 t per year, with the 26% total nutrients loss on all technological stages, and specific capital and operating costs of USD 55.5 per ton of manure produced. The methodology was tested by comparing the calculated data and the data from previous surveys of 15 pig farms in Russia. The differences between the values were found from 0.9 to 12.5% in mass; 2.8 to 13.9% in N content and 1.7 to 9.9% in P content. The developed methodology supports planning the production of the manure-based end-products in a given amount and with target nutrient content, depending on different processing technological solutions, achieving both economic and environmental goals.

AB  - Silicon (Si) supplementation is known to cause the resistance of plants to insect herbivores. There is a lack of clarity regarding the methods by which silicon influences herbivore performance. We assessed different silicon concentrations (0, 125, 250 & 500 mg L-1) on Si accumulation, development and mandibular wear of insect herbivore, Mythimna separata on wheat. Higher Si concentrations decreased oviposition rates, weight gain, larval biomass and consumption rates in M. separata. On comparing with control, increased Si levels resulted in higher percent mortality, longer development and greater mandibular wear. Higher Si concentrations lead to abrasiveness and hardness of leaves and poor nutritional quality of the leaves which in turn affect the performance of herbivore. Thus, Si supplementation could be an alternative to insecticides and one of the potential ways of controlling insect pests in Integrated Pest Management Programs.

AB  - A bovine herd with a high prevalence of paratuberculosis (PTB) cohabiting with a population of pigeons was studied (2011-2020). After finding the disease in 2011, annual monitoring was performed in 2012-2014 by obtaining blood samples for ELISA and intradermal tuberculinization (IT) tests for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Positive animals were eliminated. PTB prevalence dropped from 10% to 0% but returned to similar values (9.5%) after 6 years without tests. In all animals, Ac values according to the optical density (OD) determined by ELISA increased each year and could be used to isolate herds close to the cutoff point to improve PTB control. Possible reservoirs were considered after evaluating the little success of the PTB control program, and the population of feral pigeons was studied. Specifically, 10% of the pigeon population (n = 13) was necropsied. Samples of intestine, feces, and foot skin for PCR study for MAP and samples of terminal intestine for histopathological analysis were taken. Eleven pigeons were PCR-positive against MAP, in the intestine (10/11), foot skin (3/11), and feces (1/11). The presence of MAP in pigeon feet could demonstrate its role as a mechanical disseminator of PTB, while the presence in pigeon intestine and feces could also suggest its role as a reservoir.

AB  - With the development of ecological irrigation area, a higher level of detection and control categories for weeds are currently required. In this article, an improved transfer neural network based on bionic optimization to detect weed density and crop growth is proposed, which used the pre-trained AlexNet network for transfer learning. Because the learning rate of the new addition layer is difficult to tune to the best, the weight and bias learning rate of the newly added fully connected layer is set with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bat algorithm (BA) to find the optimal combination on the small data set. Data are transported to the convolutional neural network (CNN) by collecting red-green-blue (RGB) and 5-band multispectral images of 3 kinds of weeds and 3 kinds of crops as data sets, through cutting, rotating, and other operations. Finally, 6 kinds of classifications are implemented. At the same time, a self-constructed CNN based on model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is proposed in order to realize the learning of neural networks with small sample and high efficiency, and its accuracy is verified in the test set. The neural networks optimized by two bionic optimization algorithms are compared with the self-constructed CNN based on MAML and histogram of oriented gradient + support vector machine (HOG + SVM). The experimental results show that the combination of learning rate through BA is the best, and its accuracy can reach 99.39% for RGB images, 99.53% for multispectral images, and 96.02% for a 6-shot small sample. The purpose of the classification proposed in this article is to calculate the growth of various plants (including weeds and crops) in the farmland. And various plant densities can be accurately calculated through the plant density calculation formula and algorithm proposed in this article, which provides a basis for the application of variable herbicides by experimenting in different farmlands. Finally, an excellent cycle of ecological irrigation district can be promoted.

AB  - Both dietary protein (N) and sodium (Na) are essential nutrients for invertebrate growth and reproduction. Field studies show that insects aggregate in areas with both high protein and sodium and their abundance is co-limited by these two essential nutrients, but the mechanism behind this aggregation is not well known. We examined a possible mechanism that dietary protein and sodium co-limit insect herbivore growth and reproduction. To test this mechanism, we conducted a feeding experiment examining the effect of these two nutrients by using artificial diets with two levels of protein and three levels of sodium on a generalist herbivorous cockroach Blaptica dubia. Elevated levels of dietary sodium interacted with low protein level to increase cockroach nymph relative growth rate during earlier instars. Female cockroaches always weighed more and had a higher relative growth rate than males regardless of dietary treatment. When compared between different dietary treatments, female cockroaches' relative growth rates were higher when fed with a high protein diet, while male cockroaches reached the final instar faster when fed with a high sodium diet. Cockroach reproduction was not affected by protein or sodium alone, but the combination of a high protein and high sodium diet resulted in the heaviest offspring. Our results suggest that both protein and sodium may be important for both the growth and reproduction of insect herbivores. The interaction of these two nutrients to improve cockroach growth and reproduction indicate a level of co-limitation.

AB  - Simple Summary Granulosa cells are critical components of the ovary that nurture germ cells and sustain oocyte maturation. Apoptosis of granulosa cells leads to follicular atresia, which in turn leads to female infertility. There are many reasons for the apoptosis of granulosa cells, one of which is apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. We found that quercetin could attenuate the effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress on granulosa cells by the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway. The results provide a novel strategy for inhibiting the apoptosis of granulosa cells. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a crucial role in granulosa cell (GCs) apoptosis, which is the main cause of follicular atresia. Quercetin (QC), a plant-derived flavonoid, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and other biological properties. However, whether QC can alleviate the effects of ER stress on buffalo GCs remains unknown. In this study, we constructed an ER stress model in buffalo GCs by using tunicamycin (TM) and pre-treated with QC to explore the effect of QC on cells under ER stress. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate (V-FITC), and the expressions of mRNA and related proteins involved in ER stress and apoptosis were detected via real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The results revealed that ER stress can cause apoptosis in GCs, whereas QC pre-treatment can prevent apoptosis caused by ER stress. After pre-treatment with QC, the expression levels of ER stress-related genes and proteins significantly decreased, pro-apoptotic genes were significantly down-regulated, and anti-apoptotic genes were significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, the results of Chop gene overexpression suggested that QC alleviated ER stress via the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway. In this study, we preliminarily elucidated that QC alleviates ER stress-induced apoptosis in buffalo GCs, and the results suggest a novel strategy for delaying follicular atresia by inhibiting GCs apoptosis.

AB  - Hippocampal dysfunction is associated with major depressive disorder, a serious mental illness characterized by not only depressed mood but also appetite disturbance and dysregulated body weight. However, the underlying mechanisms by which hippocampal circuits regulate metabolic homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Here we show that collateralizing melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) circuits in the ventral subiculum (vSUB), one of the major output structures of the hippocampal formation, affect food motivation and energy balance. Viralmediated cell type- and projection-specific input-output circuit mapping revealed that the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh)-projecting vSUBMC4R+ neurons send extensive collateral projections of to various hypothalamic nuclei known to be important for energy balance, including the arcuate, ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei, and receive monosynaptic inputs mainly from the ventral CA1 and the anterior paraventricular nucleus of thalamus. Chemogenetic activation of NAcSh-projecting vSUBMC4R+neurons lead to increase in motivation to obtain palatable food without noticeable effect on homeostatic feeding. Viral-mediated restoration of MC4R signaling in the vSUB partially restores obesity in MC4R-null mice without affecting anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Collectively, these results delineate vSUBMC4R+ circuits to the unprecedented level of precision and identify the vSUBMC4R signaling as a novel regulator of food reward and energy balance.

AB  - Preclinical evaluation of drugs in animals helps researchers to select potentially informative clinical laboratory markers for human trials. To assess the utility of animal thrombin generation (TG) assay, we studied the sensitivity of animal plasmas to triggers of TG, human Tissue Factor (TF), and Activated Factor XI (FXIa). Pooled human, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, bovine, sheep, and goat plasmas were used in this study. TF-or FXIa-triggered TG and clotting were measured via fluorescence and optical density, respectively. Thrombin peak height (TPH) and time (TPT), clot time (CT), and fibrin clot density (FCD) were all analyzed. The trigger low and high sensitivity borders (LSB and HSB) for each assay parameter were defined as TF and FXIa concentrations, providing 20 and 80% of the maximal parameter value, unless the baseline (no trigger) value exceeded 20% of the maximal, in which case, LSB was derived from 120% of baseline value. Normal human samples demonstrated lower TPH HSB than most of the animal samples for both TF and FXIa. Animal samples, except mice, demonstrated lower TPT LSB for FXIa versus humans. Most rodent and rabbit samples produced baseline TG in the absence of TG triggers that were consistent with the pre-activation of blood coagulation. FCD was not sensitive to both TF and FXIa in either of the plasmas. Animal plasmas have widely variable sensitivities to human TF and FXIa, which suggests that optimization of trigger concentration is required prior to test use, and this complicates the extrapolation of animal model results to humans.

AB  - BackgroundInvestigating the functional impact of genomic variants is essential to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind complex traits. This study compiled a comprehensive dataset of 1,817 whole-genome sequences from diverse pig breeds and populations, capturing the global pig genetic diversity.ResultsOur analyses first revealed 27,167 loss-of-function variants (LoFs), the majority of which also influenced gene expression and splicing, and enriched in genomic regions associated with complex traits in pigs. We further genome-wide annotated non-coding variants, and then focused on these resided in 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR). Although they had lower deleterious impact on protein sequence compared to coding variants, they enriched in promoters and exhibited functional consequences on gene expression and splicing and finally complex traits. We employed the Basenji deep learning model and ATAC-seq to predict the impact of these SNPs on chromatin accessibility in 13 pig tissues. SNPs with higher predicted scores demonstrated stronger effects on gene expression/splicing and complex traits-particularly average backfat thickness-compared to variants with lower scores.ConclusionsIn summary, our study provides a comprehensive catalog of genomic variants in both protein-coding and non-coding regions, and elucidated their functional consequences on epigenome, transcriptome, and complex traits in pigs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic diversity of the Nero d'Aspromonte (NA) pig population. NA is a subpopulation derived from the Apulo Calabrese (AC) breed that has been reared in total isolation within the Polsi area of Aspromonte, Calabria, Italy. NA is traditionally recognised and used by local farmers for the production of typical products. The growing interest in this subpopulation has led local farmers to create a cooperative to promote NA pig meat and help preserve the cultural heritage associated with this local population. A total of 40 NA pigs were included in our study and genotyped with the Illumina GGP Porcine array. Admixture, TreeMix, and run of homozygosity (ROH) analyses were performed to investigate genetic diversity within the NA subpopulation and its relationship with the AC breed and other Italian pig breeds. The NA population clearly originated from the AC breed. The lower inbreeding and average ROH size in NA compared to AC may indicate that NA differentiated from the original AC genetic pool with the contribution of admixture from other genetic backgrounds in addition to the effects of genetic isolation and genetic drift. The analysis of the genetic diversity of the NA subpopulation showcases the utility of genomic analyses to reconstruct the genetic history of local populations. A specific conservation program for this genetic resource may further support the sustainable development of local pig production systems based on traditional farming practices as a part of agricultural cultural heritage.
   We genetically characterised the Nero d'Aspromonte pig population using genomic data.Genomic characteristics of this population were compared with nine other Italian pig breeds.The results confirmed that Nero d'Aspromonte population originated from the Apulo Calabrese breed.An admixed genetic structure can be detected between Nero d'Aspromonte and Apulo Calabrese pigs.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emitted by livestock operations can be detrimental to human health. The storage of hog manure is a significant agricultural source of H2S emissions. H2S emissions from a ground-level Midwestern hog finisher manure tank were measured for 8-20 days each quarter over a 15-month period. After excluding 4 days with outlier emissions the mean daily emission was 1.89 g H2S m(-2) day(-1). Mean daily emission was 1.39 g H2S m(-2) day(-1) when the slurry surface was liquid and 3.00 g H2S m(-2) day(-1) when crusted. Emissions however were not significantly different whether the surface was liquid or crusted when differences in temperature were considered. Diurnal variation in emissions was not correlated with air temperature, water vapor saturation deficit, or wind speed when the manure surface was crusted but was positively correlated with these variables when the surface was not crusted. Daily H2S emissions were modeled according to two-film theory incorporating resistance approach with limited success. Additional emissions measurements with greater documentation of the manure liquid composition and crust characteristics are needed to assess the component transport resistances in the emissions model.

AB  - Musk secreted by male forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) musk glands is an invaluable component of medicine and perfume. Musk secretion depends on musk gland maturation; however, the mechanism of its development remains elusive. Herein, using single cell multiome ATAC + gene expression coupled with several bioinformatic analyses, a dynamic transcriptional cell atlas of musk gland development was revealed, and key genes and transcription factors affecting its development were determined. Twelve cell types, including two different types of acinar cells (Clusters 0 and 10) were identified. Single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing analyses revealed that seven core target genes associated with musk secretion (Hsd17b2, Acacb, Lss, Vapa, Aldh16a1, Aldh7a1, and Sqle) were regulated by 12 core transcription factors (FOXO1, CUX2, RORA, RUNX1, KLF6, MGA, NFIC, FOXO3, ETV5, NR3C1, HSF4, and MITF) during the development of Cluster 0 acinar cells. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment showed significant changes in the pathways associated with musk secretion during acinar cell development. Gene set variation analysis also revealed that certain pathways associated with musk secretion were enriched in 6-year-old acinar cells. A gene co-expression network was constructed during acinar cell development to provide a precise understanding of the connections between transcription factors, genes, and pathways. Finally, intercellular communication analysis showed that intercellular communication is involved in musk gland development. This study provides crucial insights into the changes and key factors underlying musk gland development, which serve as valuable resources for studying musk secretion mechanisms and promoting the protection of this endangered species.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) regulates mammalian ovarian follicle growth and maturation; however, its effect on luteinized granulosa cells (LGCs) in sheep ovarian follicles remains unknown. Here we explored the regulatory role of LGC functions and steroid hormone synthesis by BAMBI. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the sheep BAMBI gene sequence was relatively conserved. Sheep LGCs were strongly positive for BAMBI. LGC proliferation increased when BAMBI was silenced and decreased when BAMBI was overexpressed. After BAMBI overexpression, the expression of CASP3, CASP8, CASP9, and BAX significantly increased, whereas that of BCL2 and the ratio of BCL2/BAX expression decreased. The opposite was observed after BAMBI silencing. CDKN1A, CCND1, and CCND2 were downregulated with BAMBI overexpression and upregulated with BAMBI silencing. Expression of steroid hormone-related genes (CYP11A1, STAR, and 3BHSD), except CYP19A1, significantly increased after BAMBI overexpression. Moreover, estrogen and progesterone secretion increased after BAMBI overexpression and decreased after BAMBI interference. The effect of the exogenous addition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on GCs was similar to that of BAMBI overexpression. In conclusion, BAMBI can regulate the proliferation and steroid hormone synthesis of sheep LGCs, and BMP2 can affect LGCs as an activator of BAMBI. These findings provide a basis for further research on the physiological role of BAMBI.

AB  - BackgroundMost of Camellia oleifera forests have low fruit yield and poor oil quality that are largely associated with soil fertility. Soil physical and chemical properties interact with each other affecting soil fertility and C. oleifera growing under different soil conditions produced different yield and oil composition. Three main soil types were studied, and redundancy, correlation, and double-screening stepwise regression analysis were used for exploring the relationships between C. oleifera nutrients uptake and soil physical and chemical properties, shedding light on the transport law of nutrient elements from root, leaves, and kernel, and affecting the regulation of fruit yield and oil composition.ResultsIn the present study, available soil elements content of C. oleifera forest were mainly regulated by water content, pH value, and total N, P and Fe contents. Seven elements (N, P, K, Mg, Cu, Mn and C) were key for kernel's growth and development, with N, P, K, Cu and Mn contents determining 74.0% the yield traits. The transport characteristics of these nutrients from root, leaves to the kernel had synergistic and antagonistic effects. Increasing oil production and unsaturated fatty acid content can be accomplished in two ways: one through increasing N, P, Mg, and Zn contents of leaves by applying corresponding N, P, Mg, Zn foliar fertilizers, while the other through maintaining proper soil moisture content by applying Zn fertilizer in the surface layer and Mg and Ca fertilizer in deep gully.ConclusionSoil type controlled nutrient absorption by soil pH, water content and total N, P and Fe content. There were synergistic and antagonistic effects on the inter-organ transport of nutrient elements, ultimately affecting N, P, K, Cu and Mn contents in kernel, which determined the yield and oil composition of C. oleifera.

AB  - The history of forager subsistence strategies on the Tibetan plateau during the middle Holocene has been studied extensively, with valuable results from archaeozoology and archaeobotany being produced in recent years. However, changes to the resources collected by the foragers and the factors that influence them have rarely been discussed. Here we examine the differences and factors influencing charcoal identification and analysis results from both hand picking and flotation recovery methods at the Zongri site, revealing more accurately the use of firewood by the foragers and its relationship with climate change and the agricultural population. Our results show that there is a clear deficiency in tree taxa arising from hand picking, perhaps related to the quantity of charcoal collected and identified. The Zongri people mainly used nearby trees and shrubs, including Picea (spruce), Populus (poplar) and Hippophae (sea buckthorn). The material collected was dominated by green (living) wood, which might have been influenced by the farming culture in the adjacent area. The increasing use of Picea may be attributed to the selective collection of wood by the Zongri foragers, and not caused by climate change.

AB  - When animals move along well-established pathways, sensory cues along the path may provide valuable information concerning other individuals that have used the same route. Yet the extent to which animals use pathways as sources of public social information is poorly understood. Here we quantified the responses of wild African savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, to olfactory information along natural elephant pathways, habitual routes that link predictable critical resources in the environment. By monitoring the behaviour of elephants travelling on pathways in a predominantly male study population, we found that elephants were highly olfactorily responsive to pathway substrate. Lone travellers were more responsive than elephants travelling in groups, suggesting elephants without social companions may be more dependent on olfactory cues on pathways during navigation. Furthermore, by experimentally presenting olfactory cues on pathways we found that male African elephants exhibited focused olfactory responses to urine cues of same-sex conspecifics for at least 48 h from time of deposition, and that urine from adult elephants was more likely to elicit vomeronasal system responses than subadult urine. African elephants may therefore potentially be able to discern the age and maturity of individuals they can expect to encounter in the environment from remote urine cues on pathways. We suggest elephant pathways act as a public information resource, assisting navigating elephants via the depositing of urine and dung by previous travellers on the route. These results could help inform elephant management, which may manipulate olfactory information on pathways in high human-wildlife conflict areas, or could use olfactory urine cues to improve the efficiency of corridors that link protected areas for elephants.

AB  - In aquaculture, increasing dietary fat levels can help to spare expensive protein resources and reduce water pollution. In some fish species, such as herbivorous fish, limited tolerance to dietary fat has emerged as a key factor affecting aquaculture sustainability, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we investigated changes in juvenile grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella on growth, muscle metabolomics, and gut microbiota in response to dietary lipid levels. A total of 270 fish (33.28 +/- 0.05 g) were randomly assigned to three groups (triplicate) and fed isonitrogenous diets (30 % protein) with graded lipid levels (5 % control, 7 % and 9 % high-fat) for 8 weeks. Relative to the control, growth was enhanced at 7 % lipids but was significantly reduced at 9 % lipids (P < 0.05). The visceral and mesenteric fat ratios were elevated at 7 % and 9 % lipids and were highest at 7 % lipids (P < 0.05). Myocyte diameters were smallest in the control and largest at 7 % lipids (P < 0.05). Muscle metabolomics were significantly altered, at 7 %, the primary enriched metabolic pathways were lysine biosynthesis and glycine metabolism, while at 9 %, they were purine metabolism and taste transduction. Increasing lipid levels reduced the number of operational taxonomic units number and alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota. Bacteroidota abundance and phytuberin levels were significantly positively correlated at 7 % lipids; similarly Nakamurella abundance and guanosine levels showed a significant positive correlation at 9 % lipids (P < 0.05). Unclassified_f_Rhodobacteraceae abundance and acetic acid levels were negatively correlated at 9 % lipids (P < 0.05). Overall, Grass carp responded differently to varying dietary lipid levels. A moderate lipid increase (7 %) improved growth and affected amino acid metabolism, while excessive lipid levels (9 %) inhibited growth and altered muscle energy balance and nerve conduction. These effects were partly correlated with changes in the gut microbiota.

AB  - Uranium silicide (U3Si2) is a concept explored as a potential alternative to UO2 fuel used in light water reactors (LWRs) since it may improve accident tolerance and economics due to its higher thermal conductivity and increased uranium density. U3Si2 has been previously used in research reactors in the form of dispersion fuel which operates at lower temperatures than commercial LWRs. The research reactor data illustrated that significant gaseous swelling occurs as the fuel burnup increases. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the fission gas behavior of U3Si2 under higher temperature LWR operating conditions. In this work, molecular dynamics and phase-field modeling techniques are used to reduce the uncertainty in select modeling assumptions made in developing the fission gas behavior model for U3Si2 in the BISON fuel performance code. To support the implementation of a U3Si2 fission gas model in BISON, cluster dynamics simulations of irradiation enhanced Xe diffusion have been carried out. Similarly, MD simulations were used to predict the athermal contribution due to atomic mixing during ballistic damage cascades. By combining our results with literature DFT data for thermal equilibrium diffusion, Xe diffusivity has been described over a wide range of temperatures for in-reactor conditions. These lower length scale informed models are then utilized in the assessment of BISON U3Si2 modeling capabilities by simulating the ATF-1 experiments irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). Sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) are included as part of the assessment process to identify where further experiments and lower length scale modeling would be beneficial. The multiscale modeling approach utilized in this work can be applied to new fuel concepts being explored for both LWRs and advanced reactors (e.g., uranium nitride, uranium carbide).

AB  - Stenotaphrum secundatum is a premium turf grass in warm temperate and subtropical regions of the world and is the most important turf species in Australia based on the value of its production. A new disease called buffalo grass yellows (BGY) has become a problem on turf farms in Australia. We surveyed turf farms in New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia to determine whether panicum mosaic virus (PMV) and sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) were associated with BGY. PMV was only found on three farms, two located in the Hawkesbury Valley near Sydney and a third at Echuca, about 800 km to the southwest of the former location. SCMV was more prevalent, present in all major cultivars and states surveyed. We analyzed phylogenetic relationships for SCMV and found that isolates infecting S. secundatum in Australia belonged to three clades. The first included Australian isolates typical of the population of viruses circulating in Digitaria didactyla. The second included a single New South Wales isolate from S. secundatum 'SS100' that grouped with otherwise American isolates of SCMV recorded in S. secundatum and Saccharum officinale from Florida and Zea mays from Ohio. Finally, an isolate of SCMV from S. secundatum originating from a turf farm in South East Queensland grouped with viruses mostly infecting maize; this record is potentially the first maize-adapted strain of SCMV in Australia. Our study sheds light on the etiology of the BGY disease syndrome and invasion history of PMV and SCMV in Australia.

AB  - During domestication, lineages diverge phenotypically and genetically from wild relatives, particularly in preferred traits. In addition to evolutionary divergence in selected traits, other fitness-related traits that are unselected may change in concert. For instance, the selection of chili pepper fruits was not intended to change the structure and function of the leaf epidermis. Leaf stomata and trichome densities play a prominent role in regulating stomatal conductance and resistance to herbivores. Here, we assessed whether domestication affected leaf epidermis structure and function in Capsicum annuum. To do this, we compared leaf stomata and trichome densities in six cultivated varieties of Mexican Capsicum annuum and their wild relative. We measured stomatal conductance and resistance to herbivores. Resistance to (defense against) herbivores was measured as variation in the herbivory rate and larvae mortality of Spodoptera frugiperda fed with leaves of wild and cultivated plants. As expected, the different varieties displayed low divergence in stomatal density and conductance. Leaf trichome density was higher in the wild relative, but variation was not correlated with the herbivory rate. In contrast, a higher mortality rate of S. frugiperda larvae was recorded when fed with the wild relative and two varieties than larvae fed with four other varieties. Overall, although domestication did not aim at resistance to herbivores, this evolutionary process produced concerted changes in defensive traits.

AB  - Simple Summary: Swine production is a for-profit activity; however, most farms have deficient internal controls and empirical management and do not even know the cost of the market hog produced. Knowing the production cost of what will be commercialized is crucial for any process that involves business management, and in pig production, it is no different. However, the lack of a standard method and simple and easily accessible tools make it difficult for producers to organize the economic management of their businesses. In this sense, the present work aimed to develop a free and easy-to-use tool that calculates swine production costs and serves as a management tool in commercial properties.
   This paper aims to present a tool that offers pig producers a standard method to calculate and control their production costs and, consequently, provides the necessary information to guide strategic decision-making. Following these premises, a mathematical model to estimate swine production costs were developed using Microsoft Excel(R) software (version 2207). Case studies were used to assist in the characterization and construction of the model. Through the panel method, the tool was validated by professionals in the sector. Costs were considered according to the Neoclassical Economic Theory of Costs and allocated in the order of variable costs, fixed operating costs, and opportunity costs of capital and land. These costs together create the total cost. The model provides the total cost per batch, per market pig, per arroba, and per kilogram, which facilitates the interpretation of the results and economic evaluations of the system. The model is adaptable to different types of swine farming, as well as the consideration of all costs involved in the production system, whether explicit or implicit. The model developed has the potential to be used as a management tool in commercial swine production systems, assisting the producer in the decision-making process through the management and control of production costs.

AB  - Introduction Lead is the most used nonphysiological neurotoxic heavy metal in the world that has been indicated to interfere with the cognitive and noncognitive processes via numerous mechanisms. The neuroprotective effect of melatonin is well known, but the effect of its interaction with lead in the brain remains inconclusive.
   Objective To assess the therapeutic role of melatonin on cognitive deficit, anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in matured male Wistar rats exposed to a subchronic lead chloride (PbCl2).
   Methods Twenty male Wistar rats were blindly randomized into four groups (n = 5/group): group 1 to 4 underwent intragastric administration of physiological saline (10 ml/kg; vehicle), PbCl2 (50 mg/kg), melatonin (10 mg/kg) and PbCl2 + melatonin respectively for a period of 4 weeks during which neurobehavioral data were extracted, followed by neurochemical and histopathological evaluations.
   Results Exposure to PbCl2 reduced cognitive performance by increasing the escape latency and average proximity to the platform zone border, decreasing average path length in the platform zone, cognitive score, and time spent in probing. It raised the thigmotaxis percentage, time spent in rearing, number of pellet-like feces, and time spent in the dark compartment of a bright/dark box which are predictors of anxiety. It also induced depressive-like behavior as immobility time was enhanced. PbCl2 deranged neurochemicals; malondialdehyde, interlukin-1 beta, and tumor necrotic factor-alpha were increased while superoxide dismutase and acetylcholinesterase were decreased without remarkable alteration in reduced glutathione and nitric oxide. Administration of PbCl2 further disrupted neuronal settings of hippocampal proper and dentate gyrus. In contrast, the supplementation of melatonin reversed all the neurological consequences of PbCl2 neurotoxicity by eliciting its properties against oxidative and nonoxidative action of PbCl2.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that melatonin down-regulates neurotoxicant interplays in the brain systems. Therefore, this study suggests the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapy in neuropathological disorders/dysfunctions.

AB  - The experience of stress and the need to regulate emotions are pervasive in everyday life. Emotion regulation (ER) is particularly required under stress to facilitate successful adaptation and recovery. Importantly, a growing body of work has identified stress and ER deficits as transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology. This highlights the relevance of understanding how stress impacts ER to elucidate individual vulnerability to mental disorders. Stress alters cognitive and emotional functioning via stress hormones secreted by the two major stress systems: sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus-pituitary adrenocortical axis. This review aims to compile and synthesize empirical studies in humans investigating the effects of acute stress and stress hormones on ER. A systematic literature search yielded 14 relevant studies, 11 investigating acute stress effects and 3 examining the influence of pharmacological cortisol elevations on ER. The results of the stress studies are mixed revealing either impairing, beneficial or no effects at all. Cortisol administration mostly facilitated ER attempts. Notably, we detected timing differences in measuring ER performance relative to stress exposure that potentially reconcile divergent findings. Here, we propose the PRESSURE model (Predominant Stress System Underpins Regulation of Emotions) postulating that the direction and magnitude of stress effects on ER depends on the relative predominance of one stress system over the other. Additionally, sex-stress hormone interactions, stimulus intensity and ER strategy are discussed as possible moderators. Finally, we highlight limitations in current research and provide recommendations for future studies that will further advance our understanding of the intricate relationship between stress and ER.

AB  - The role of Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) in a range of sectors is being talked about. Over the years, people have tried to develop new farming techniques based on their experience and age old experiments for their farming operation. Assam consists of a large number of ethnic groups that have different ITKs relating to agricultural sector. The present study attempts to document the ITKs used by four major ethnic communities of Assam viz., Ahom, Mishing, Deori, and Karbi. Twenty respondents from each community were selected and data were collected by different Participatory Rural Appraisal tools from Sivsagar, Majuli and Karbi Anglong districts of Assam during 2020. Different ITKs such as, broadcasting goat's excreta on the standing crop of paddy to control hispa, dried leaves of 'Neem' kept with rice grains in for its insecticidal properties, etc were used in agriculture. Most of the identified indigenous practices were found to be of biological origin. The documented ITKs need to be scientifically validated to be recommended at the state level. The result of the study is expected to help in a technology blending programme for generation of low-cost, eco-friendly and location-specific technology by modifying already existing technologies. Further, the documented data might help in national-level data bank management on ITKs.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) posed a formidable challenge to sustainable development, with its prevalence expected to escalate, particularly within China's protected areas. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the economic and emotional impacts of the HWC between 2007 and 2019 in seven protected areas dedicated to the conservation of large carnivores and elephants in China. We first constructed a database for economic loss assessment through literature databases, news search engines, governmental local government websites and insurance company claim records. Economic losses were estimated by considering the market prices of crops, livestock, and property that were lost as a result of the HWC. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the change in sentiments of local residents due to HWC and their satisfaction with the financial compensation. The findings revealed a consistent annual increase in economic losses across the majority of protected areas and Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve suffered the greatest economic losses. Moreover, the primary wildlife species causing disturbances varied in different protected areas, specifically, wolf in Chang Tang, Qomolangma, Qilian Mountain, and Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve, wild boar in Hunchun and Wolong Nature Reserve, elephant in Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve. The local population exhibited the highest level of positive attitudes towards elephants (66.9 %), closely followed by wolves (60.2 %), whereas wild boars (67.3 %) evoke predominantly negative attitudes. As for diverse stakeholder groups, the most positive attitudes were observed among urban residents (93.1 %), followed by those residing in protected areas with no history of HWC incidents (73.1 %), those experiencing less than or equal to 5 incidents per year (57.7 %), and those facing more than 5 incidents per year (51.6 %). We also found that the satisfaction level of local residents to financial compensation in protected areas exhibited the most negative attitudes towards human life (23.6 %), followed by crop (44.3 %), property (55.6 %), and livestock (66.7 %). The livelihood and safety of local herders were seriously jeopardized by the damages inflicted by large carnivores and elephants, leading to a decline in their willingness to protect these animals, with most expressing dissatisfaction towards financial compensation. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the current economic losses and emotional fluctuations induced by the HWC was an essential prerequisite for effectively mitigating adverse impacts and attaining conservation objectives.

AB  - Research was carried out into the effect of partial and total fishmeal (FM) replacement by a vegetable and animal proteins blend, as well as the inclusion of microalgae in diets for gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.). Fish of 64 g on initial weight were fed until apparent satiation for 88 days. The control diet (FM100) contained FM as the main protein source, whilst in FM25, FM10 and FM0 diets, the FM was replaced 75%, 90% and 100%, respectively, by a proteins blend consisting of Iberian pig meal (IPM) and vegetable protein meals. FM0+ was similar to FM0 diet but included 50 g/kg of Isochrysis aff. galbana (T-Iso). Results obtained in the final bodyweight and the specific growth rate indicate that the FM25 and FM100 diets achieved similar performances. An improvement in growth performance and nutrient utilization was observed in the FM0+ diet with respect to the FM0 diet. The highest retention efficiencies of protein, energy and essential amino acids were found in FM100 and FM25 diets. In conclusion, up to 75% FM substitution by a vegetable and animal proteins blend in on-growing gilthead seabream is feasible, in addition, the inclusion of Isochrysis aff. galbana (T-Iso) improves the growth and retention efficiencies in a non-FM diet.

AB  - Crop damage caused by wild animals, particularly wild boars (Sus scrofa), significantly impacts agricultural yields, especially in maize fields. This study evaluates two methods for assessing maize crop damage using UAV-acquired data: (1) a deep learning-based approach employing the Deepness plugin in QGIS, utilizing high-resolution RGB imagery; and (2) a method based on digital surface models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR data. Manual visual assessment, supported by ground-truthing, served as the reference for validating these methods. This study was conducted in 2023 in a maize field in Central Poland, where UAV flights captured high-resolution RGB imagery and LiDAR data. Results indicated that the DSM-based method achieved higher accuracy (94.7%) and sensitivity (69.9%) compared to the deep learning method (accuracy: 92.9%, sensitivity: 35.3%), which exhibited higher precision (92.2%) and specificity (99.7%). The DSM-based method provided a closer estimation of the total damaged area (9.45% of the field) compared to the reference (10.50%), while the deep learning method underestimated damage (4.01%). Discrepancies arose from differences in how partially damaged areas were classified; the deep learning approach excluded these zones, focusing on fully damaged areas. The findings suggest that while DSM-based methods are well-suited for quantifying extensive damage, deep learning techniques detect only completely damaged crop areas. Combining these methods could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of crop damage assessments. Future studies should explore integrated approaches across diverse crop types and damage patterns to optimize wild animal damage evaluation.

AB  - Nutrient composition varies greatly across landscapes, influencing the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations. However, few studies have explored this pattern across multiple scales. We tested how nutrient limitation affects herbivore populations, from individual behavior to landscape-level dynamics, using the Australian plague locust Chortoicetes terminifera. Our study combined field populations and long-term survey data across their range. At the individual level, juvenile locusts selected a carbohydrate-biased intake target of 1 protein (p) to 2 carbohydrate (c) and exhibited the highest growth rates and shortest development times when fed artificial diets matching this 1p:2c ratio during their final juvenile instar. In the field, locusts exposed to protein-biased plants corrected their nutritional imbalance by initially selecting carbohydrate-heavy diets (up to a 1p:20c ratio). Over a week after removal from the protein-rich environment, they returned to the 1p:2c intake target once the deficiency was balanced. At the landscape level, locust outbreaks were negatively correlated with soil nitrogen and exhibited a non-linear relationship with soil phosphorus, peaking at approximately 4% phosphorus content. By disentangling the interaction between mean annual precipitation and soil nitrogen, using comprehensive locust surveys and remotely sensed soil and weather data spanning decades, we show how environmental factors drive population dynamics. This study integrates lab, field and remote sensing approaches, highlighting the importance of nutrient balancing across scales for herbivores. Specifically, we demonstrate that low-nitrogen environments promote locust outbreaks, likely by reducing plant protein-to-carbohydrate ratios. Incorporating soil quality data into locust plague forecasting models could significantly improve prediction accuracy.

AB  - The yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways serve as a model system for understanding how network interactions affect the way in which cells coordinate the response to multiple signals. We have quantitatively compared two yeast strain backgrounds YPH499 and sigma 1278b (both of which have previously been used to study these pathways) and found several important differences in how they coordinate the interaction between the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) and mating pathways. In the sigma 1278b background, in response to simultaneous stimulus, mating pathway activation is dampened and delayed in a dose-dependent manner. In the YPH499 background, only dampening is dose-dependent. Furthermore, leakage from the HOG pathway into the mating pathway (crosstalk) occurs during osmostress alone in the sigma 1278b background only. The mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p suppresses crosstalk late in an induction time course in both strains but does not affect the early crosstalk seen in the sigma 1278b background. Finally, the kinase Rck2p plays a greater role suppressing late crosstalk in the sigma 1278b background than in the YPH499 background. Our results demonstrate that comparisons between laboratory yeast strains provide an important resource for understanding how signalling network interactions are tuned by genetic variation without significant alteration to network structure.

AB  - The ability of SARS-CoV to infect different species, including humans, dogs, cats, minks, ferrets, hamsters, tigers, and deer, pose a continuous threat to human and animal health. Pigs, though closely related to humans, seem to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Former in vivo studies failed to demonstrate clinical signs and transmission between pigs, while later attempts using a higher infectious dose reported viral shedding and seroconversion. This study investigated species-specific cell susceptibility, virus dose-dependent infectivity, and infection kinetics, using primary human (HRECs) and porcine (PRECs) respiratory epithelial cells. Despite higher ACE2 expression in HRECs compared to PRECs, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and replicated in both PRECs and HRECs in a dose-dependent manner. Cytopathic effect was particularly more evident in PRECs than HRECs, showing the hallmark morphological signs of apoptosis. Further analysis confirmed an early and enhanced apoptotic mechanism driven through caspase 3/7 activation, limiting SARS-CoV-2 propagation in PRECs compared to HRECs. Our findings shed light on a possible mechanism of resistance of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it may hold therapeutic value for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Ruminant rumen plays an important role in the digestibility of cellulose, hemicellulose, starch and fat. In this study, the yaks under graze and stall feeding were chosen as the models of different rumen bacteria and intramuscular fat (IMF). The characteristics of IMF deposition, serum indexes in yaks were detected; the bacteria, metabolites in rumen was explored by 16S rRNA sequencing technology, untargeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer and gas chromatography, respectively; the transcriptome of longissimus thoracis was identified by RNA-Sequencing analysis. Based on above results, a hypothesis that yak IMF deposition is regulated by the combined action of microbiome-gut-brain and muscle axis was proposed. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and neurotransmitters precursors like acetylcholine produced in yak rumen promoted insulin secretion via central nervous system. These insulin resulted in the high expression of SREBF1 gene by gut-brain axis; SCFAs can directly arrive to muscular tissue via blood circulation system, then activated the expression of PPAR gamma gene by gut-muscle axis. The expression of lipogenesis gene SCD, FABP3, CPT1, FASN and ACC2 was accordingly up-regulated. This study firstly introduce the theory of microbiome-gut-brain/muscle axis into the study of ruminant, and comprehensively expounded the regulatory mechanism of yak IMF deposition.

AB  - BACKGROUND Production of goat's milk set-style yoghurt encounters challenges in achieving the texture characteristic for this type of product, primarily due to protein composition of this milk. This study evaluated the effects of using microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) concomitantly with starter culture in the production of goat's milk yoghurt - a method that has not been employed with this milk type until now- indicating the potential of the enzyme to change yoghurt's textural properties. Goat's milk set yoghurts were produced from milk heated at 72 degrees C/30 s and 90 degrees C/5 min, without (G72 and G90) and with mTGase (G72TG and G90TG) and starter culture addition. Protein profiles of goat's milks and yoghurts were also examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Yoghurts were evaluated for rheological properties, texture, microbiological and sensory profile over 2 weeks to study the influence of mTGase, pasteurization and storage.
   RESULTS The enzyme caused significant increases of storage moduli at the end of fermentation: 8.32 +/- 0.27 Pa (G90TG) and 2.89 +/- 0.18 Pa (G72TG) vs. 6.13 +/- 0.07 Pa (G90) and 1.27 +/- 0.18 Pa (G72) without enzyme. Lower loss tangent values indicated the enhanced elastic character of the gels with enzyme. Enzyme increased yoghurt's firmness from 49.69 +/- 2.61 g (G90) to 60.81 +/- 5.29 g (G90TG) after 1 day and from 58.21 +/- 0.53 g (G90) to 80.45 +/- 0.59 g (G90TG) after 15 days' storage. Enzyme improved starter bacteria survivability during storage of G72TG yoghurt.
   CONCLUSION mTGase can be used simultaneously with the starter culture to improve the rheological properties and texture of goat's milk yoghurt, without deteriorating effect on its flavour. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary The Tunchang pig is a local pig population in Hainan Province, China, known for its delicious meat. To develop effective conservation and utilization programs, we analyzed the genetic diversity, run of homozygosity (ROH) patterns, and the degree of inbreeding in Tunchang pigs using whole genome sequencing data. Our findings show that Tunchang pigs have high genetic diversity and we identified candidate genes associated with growth and meat quality traits. These results contribute to the sustainable conservation and utilization of Tunchang pigs.Abstract Tunchang pigs are an indigenous pig population in China known for their high tolerance to roughage, delicious meat, and fecundity. However, the number of Tunchang pigs has been declining due to the influence of commercial breeds and African swine fever, which could potentially lead to inbreeding. To assess the inbreeding level and the genetic basis of important traits in Tunchang pigs, our research investigated the patterns in "runs of homozygosity" (ROHs) using whole genome resequencing data from 32 Tunchang pigs. The study aimed to determine the length, number, coverage, and distribution model of ROHs in Tunchang pigs, as well as genomic regions with high ROH frequencies. The results of the study revealed that a total of 20,499,374 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1953 ROH fragments were recognized in 32 individuals. The ROH fragments in Tunchang pigs were predominantly short, ranging from 0.5 to 1 megabases (Mb) in length. Furthermore, the coverage of ROHs varied across chromosomes, with chromosome 3 having the highest coverage and chromosome 11 having the lowest coverage. The genetic diversity of Tunchang pigs was found to be relatively high based on the values of HE (expected heterozygosity), HO (observed heterozygosity), pi (nucleotide diversity), Ne (effective population size), and MAF (minor allele frequency). The average inbreeding coefficients of Tunchang pigs, as determined by three different methods (FHOM, FGRM, and FROH), were 0.019, 0.0138, and 0.0304, respectively. These values indicate that the level of inbreeding in Tunchang pigs is currently low. Additionally, the study identified a total of 13 ROH islands on all chromosomes, which in total contained 38,913 SNPs and 120 genes. These ROH islands included genes associated with economically important traits, including meat quality (GYS1, PHLPP1, SLC27A5, and CRTC1), growth and development (ANKS1A, TAF11, SPDEF, LHB, and PACSIN1), and environmental adaptation (SLC26A7). The findings of this research offer valuable perspectives on the present status of Tunchang pig resources and offer a reference for breeding conservation plans and the efficient utilization of Tunchang pigs in the future. By understanding the inbreeding level and genetic basis of important traits in Tunchang pigs, conservation efforts can be targeted towards maintaining genetic diversity and promoting the sustainable development of this indigenous pig population.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to analyze the taxonomic profile and to evaluate the functional effects of sheep FF cultivable microbiota on prepubertal lamb oocytes PLOs developmental potential. Ovarian FFs were recovered from slaughtered adult sheep via the aspiration of developing follicles and used for microbiota propagation. Bacterial pellets underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted culturomics, whereas cell-free supernatants were used as supplements for the in vitro maturation (IVM) of slaughtered PLOs. For the first time, bacteria presence in adult sheep FF was detected, with the first report of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (as a species) and Burkholderia cepacia (as a genus and species) in either animal or human FF. The short- and long-term effects of bacterial metabolites on PLO maturation and embryonic development were demonstrated. As short-term effects, the addition of FF microbiota metabolites did not affect the oocyte nuclear maturation and mitochondria distribution pattern, except in one of the examined supernatants, which reduced all quantitative bioenergetic/oxidative parameters. As long-term effects, one of them reduced the total cleavage rate after in vitro embryo culture (IVC). In conclusion, microbiota/bacteria are present in adult sheep FF and may influence reproductive outcomes in vitro. Future studies may reveal the beneficial in vitro effects using the microbiome from preovulatory follicles.

AB  - Several decades of rodent neurobiology research have identified a network of brain regions that support Pavlovian threat conditioning and extinction, focused predominately on the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Surprisingly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown inconsistent evidence for these regions while humans undergo threat conditioning and extinction. In this review, we suggest that translational neuroimaging efforts have been hindered by reliance on traditional univariate analysis of fMRI. Whereas univariate analyses average activity across voxels in a given region, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) leverage the information present in spatial patterns of activity. MVPA therefore pro-vides a more sensitive analysis tool to translate rodent neurobiology to human neuroimaging. We review human fMRI studies using MVPA that successfully bridge rodent models of amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC function during Pavlovian learning. We also highlight clinical applications of these information-sensitive multivariate analyses. In sum, we advocate that the field should consider adopting a variety of multivariate approaches to help bridge cutting-edge research on the neuroscience of threat and anxiety.

AB  - Pruning is an important strategy for increasing tea production. However, the effects of pruning on tea quality are not well understood. In this study, tea leaves were collected from Wuyi Mountain for both ionomic and metabolomic analyses. A total of 1962 and 1188 fresh tea leaves were respectively collected from pruned and unpruned tea plants sampled across 350 tea plantations. Ionomic profiles of fresh tea leaves varied significantly between pruned and unpruned sources. For tea plants, pruning was tied to decreases in the concentrations of mobile elements, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg), and dramatic increases in the concentrations of the immobile ions calcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), boron (B) and cobalt (Co). Clustering and heatmap analysis showed that pruning also affected tea leaf metabolism. Among 85 metabolites that were significantly impacted by pruning, 30 were identified through random forest analysis as characteristic differential metabolites with a prediction rate of 86.21%. Redundancy analysis showed that pruning effects on mineral nutrient concentrations accounted for 25.54% of the variation in characteristic metabolites between treatments, with the highest contributions of 6.64% and 3.69% coming from Ca and Mg, respectively. In correlation network analysis, Ca and Mg both exhibited close, though opposing correlations with six key metabolites, including key quality indicators 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 2-O-caffeoyl arbutin. In summary, large scale sampling over hundreds of tea plantations demonstrated that pruning affects tea quality, mainly through influences on leaf mineral composition, with Ca and Mg playing large roles. These results may provide a solid scientific basis for improved management of high-quality tea plantations.

AB  - Plant volatiles play an important role as cues for herbivorous insects in search of resources, mates, and oviposition sites in complex environments. The use of plant volatiles as attractants or repellents can be utilized to monitor and control pest populations. Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae, H & uuml;bner, 1808) is a highly destructive pest of cruciferous crops that has developed resistance to a variety of insecticides, making the management challenging. This study aimed to investigate the behavioral response of the pest to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiales: Lamiaceae, Linnaeus, 1753). We identified ten compounds from the rosemary using gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). We then subjected these compounds to ovipositional and olfactory bioassays. The results revealed that the moths were significantly attracted to seven compounds while being repelled by the others. In oviposition bioassays, linalool showed the greatest attractive effect at 69.97% (P < 0.001) at 15,000 mu g<middle dot>mL(-1), while eucalyptol exhibited the highest repellent rate at 47.11% (P < 0.01) at 1500 mu g<middle dot>mL(-1). In olfactory bioassays, beta-pinene showed high attractiveness at a concentration of 150 mu g<middle dot>mL(-1), with the attractive rate of 66.67% (chi(2) = 8.64, df = 1, P = 0.001). Eucalyptol again displayed strong repellent activity at 42.86% (chi(2) = 5.14, df = 1, P = 0.023) at a concentration of 1500 mu g<middle dot>mL(-1). Furthermore, these compounds elicited a dose-response from the moth in these bioassays. This study demonstrates the theoretical feasibility of using rosemary as an attractive crop in agricultural fields for the environmentally friendly management of beet armyworms. However, when VOCs are applied in the field, they often experience significant dilution, resulting in behaviors much less than those observed in the lab. Therefore, these compounds require testing in field settings to ensure their viability as a management strategy for insects.

AB  - Research on Satyrium nepalense var. ciliatum (Lindl.) Hook. f. has primarily focused on populations in Northwestern Yunnan, with limited studies on pollination syndromes and insect behavior. In addition, it is geographically limited in its breeding system studies. Here, pollination syndromes, florivory, and breeding systems of S. nepalense var. ciliatum from Liangwang Mountain (Central Yunnan, China) were investigated through field work, microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and parafin section. It was revealed that the pollination syndrome was possessing out-crossing, such as bright color, a developed rostellum, nectar glands in the spur, and food hairs at the lip base. The color and nectar attracted flower visitors, and florivory was observed. Some flower visitors pollinated their companion species. Ants were identified as floral visitors for the first time in Satyrium, although substantial pollination was not observed. Ants might be potential pollinators. S. nepalense var. ciliatum possessed a mixed breeding system, including selfing, out-crossing, and apomixis, with apomixis being predominant in nature. It is suggested that the pollination syndrome, florivory, and pollination competition would contribute to its mixed breeding systems, particularly leading to the occurrence of apomixis.

AB  - Rationale: Fear memory, a fundamental symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is improved by (2R, 6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R, 6R)-HNK) administration. However, the phase of fear memory in which the injected drug is the most effective at mitigating PTSD-like effects remains unknown. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of (2 R, 6 R)-HNK administration during three phases [acquisition (AP), reconsolidation (RP), and extinction (EP)] on PTSD-like behaviors in single prolonged stress (SPS) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC) rat models. The effects of VGF-inducible type of nerve growth factor (VGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and GluA1 on hippocampus (HIP) expression were also explored. Methods: SPS and CFC (SPSC) were used to establish a PTSD rat model. After lateral ventricle injection of 5 mu L (2 R, 6 R)-HNK (0.5 nmol). Anxiety-depression-like behaviors were assessed in rats by the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPMT). Situational fear responses were evaluated in rodents by freezing behavior test (FBT) test. In addition, GluA1, VGF, and BDNF were assessed in the hippocampus by Western blot assay (WB) and Immunohistochemistry assay (IF). Results: SPSC procedure induced PTSD-like behaviors. The SPSC group had decreased spontaneous exploratory behavior and increased fear response. The (2R, 6R)-HNK group showed improved SPSC-induced reduction in GluA1, VGF, and BDNF levels in the HIP. During RP, anxiety and fear avoidance behaviors were alleviated, and the protein levels of GluA1, VGF, and BDNF in the HIP were restored. In contrast, no significant improvement was noted during AP and EP. Conclusions: (2R,6R)-HNK modulates the VGF/BDNF/GluA1 signaling pathway in the hippocampus and improves PTSD-like behaviors during the reconsolidation phase of fear memory in rats, which may provide a new target for the clinical treatment and prevention of fear-related disorders such as PTSD.

AB  - Heatwaves are expected to become more frequent and directly exert major stress on plants. Warmer weather can also increase the frequency of biotic infestations. However, how biotic stress alters heat resistance and how interacting heat and biotic stresses alter volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions remain unclear. We studied how heat shock (45 celcius for 5 min) and Trialeurodes vaporariorum infestation alone and in combination affect foliage photosynthetic characteristics and VOC emissions in Origanum vulgare, right after heat stress through 48 h recovery. Heat stress alone decreased photosynthesis rate (A) but increased stomatal conductance (gs), emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles (LOX), benzenoids and terpenoids. Neither A nor VOC emissions recovered to pre-stress values at 48 h after stress application. Whitefly infestation reduced A and increased gs, and resulted in a moderate increase in terpene emissions, but inhibited constitutive LOX and benzenoid emissions. Heat stress applied on whitefly infestation reduced A and increased gs, and resulted in a much lower enhancement of LOX and terpene emissions. Photosynthetic characteristics fully recovered at 48 h after stress treatment. Our results suggest that under phloem-feeding insect herbivory, VOC emission responses to extreme temperature are highly desensitized and photosynthetic thermal tolerance is improved.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are recognised as an emerging environmental problem that needs to be carefully monitored. So far, MPs have been widely recorded in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Still, few studies have focused on MP occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems, although soils are suspected to be one of the main MP reservoirs. To test a non-invasive method for assessing MP contamination in terrestrial ecosystems, we analysed the pellets of a top terrestrial predator, the barn owl (Tyto alba). Sixty pellets were collected from three agricultural areas (20 pellets each) and analysed to assess both barn owl diet and MP content. Thirty-four MPs were confirmed by micro -Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (mu-FTIR) analysis in 33% of the pellets (min-max 1-5 MPs per pel-let). Most of the detected items were microfibres (88.2%). Polyethylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitrile and polyamide were the most abundant polymers. One of the three sites was significantly less contaminated. In the two sites with the highest MP occurrences, barn owl diet was characterised by predation on synanthropic ro-dents, particularly brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), which may indicate habitat degradation and increased expo-sure to MPs. Analyses also suggest that Savi's pine vole (Microtus savii) is the prey least at risk of MP contamination, probably due to its strictly herbivorous diet. We argue that the analysis of barn owl pellets may represent a cost-effective method for monitoring MP contamination in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The Kruger National Park (KNP) is regarded as the flagship ecotourism destination in South Africa. It showcases unique fauna and flora and natural features and as an ecotourism attraction it also hosts a number of facilities that cater to visitors' needs. One such facility is the Letaba Elephant Hall: a natural history museum located in the Letaba rest camp. The facility promotes education related to elephant biology, human-elephant relations, and conservation. Museums, require visitors to remain financially sustainable and to promote education and in the case of the Letaba Elephant Hall, to promote conservation. However, museums often have a negative connotation of being boring, with poor visitor engagement, and overly theoretical displays. These potentially poor experiences may influence visitor satisfaction, which, in turn, could affect the visitor's post-visitation intentions. This study adopted the theory of planned behaviour and the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm to conduct an exploratory quantitative survey to measure visitors' experiences and how those experiences might influence their intentions to revisit the Letaba Elephant Hall. A total sample of 163 was achieved and results were analysed descriptively, followed by the development of binary categorisations. Chi-square tests were used to test the identified hypotheses, followed by multiple logistic regression to determine whether any significant relationships between variables exist. Implications for conservation: The results provide an overview of the visitor profile and descriptive experience results, as well as an indication of significant relationships that exist between expectations, experiences, perceived quality, satisfaction, pleasure, and revisit intentions. Understanding who museum visitors are and managing their experiences are pivotal in ensuring that the efficient functioning of these facilities are carried out such as effective education, which in the case of the Letaba Elephant Hall, may result in authentic learning and the promotion of elephant conservation. The study provides insight into possible ways of enhancing the visitor experience at the Letaba Elephant Hall as a natural history museum, which could also be transferred to other similar interpretation centres in the KNP and other protected areas.

AB  - The parasitoid wasp Diadegma semiclausum Hellen (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) is an effective endoparasitoid for controlling the larvae of Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Fertilizer application can induce resistance mechanisms in plants against herbivores. In bottom-up effects, resistance-related signaling pathways triggered by fertilizers in plants may affect the fitness of natural enemies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of induced resistance by vermiwash on some fitness-related parameters of D. semiclausum, including immature survival, development time, reproduction, and life table parameters. The experiment was conducted in a standard climate chamber set at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, a photoperiod of 16 h light: 8 h dark, and 65 +/- 5% RH. The results showed that D. semiclausum developing within P. xylostella larvae reared on vermiwash-treated canola plants had a longer duration and lower survivorship of immature stages than those developing within P. xylostella larvae reared on untreated canola plants (control). Furthermore, the parasitoid females that emerged from the vermiwash treatment deposited fewer eggs compared to those emerging from the control treatment. The R-0 and r values of D. semiclausum were lower on the vermiwash treatment (9.96 offspring/female and 0.150 day(-1), respectively) compared to the control population (15.94 offspring/female and 0.198 day(-1), respectively). These results suggest that if vermiwash is sprayed on canola and P. xylostella larvae feed on the plant, it has the potential to adversely affect the population growth of D. semiclausum. Therefore, more care should be taken regarding the application of this fertilizer in D. semiclausum-based integrated pest management (IPM) programs.

AB  - In the past decades, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pig production in China have been increasing rapidly, which has become a huge challenge in fulfilling China's "carbon neutral" commitment. However, few studies have focused on reducing the GHG emissions from pig production in view of households' pork consumption. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial pattern of the GHG emissions from pig production in China in 2001-2020 through geographical information system, optimized the pig production in China, and estimated the potential GHG emissions reduction from pig production in China in 2020 through spatial analysis based on pork surplus or deficit. Results show that the temporal and spatial pattern of the GHG emissions from pig production and its proportion in the total GHG emissions from livestock production in China in 2001-2020 varied differently at the province level and conformed to the "Hu Huanyong Line" mode. The largest and smallest GHG emissions from pig production were 108.93 million tons (MT) in 2014 and 78.10 MT in 2020, respectively. The largest and smallest proportions of GHG emissions from pig production in the total GHG emissions from livestock production were 77.52% in Zhejiang in 2013 and 0.13% in Tibet in 2009, respectively. Moreover, a potential optimization scheme of pig production in China in 2020 was provided and a method of GHG emissions reduction from pig production is proposed. The results indicate that the total potential GHG emissions reduction from pig production on the basis of households' pork consumption could reach 35.21 MT, accounting for 45.09% of the total GHG emissions from pig production and 10.27% of the total GHG emissions from livestock production in China in 2020. These findings are useful in the spatial layout planning of pig production, agricultural GHG reduction, and global warming mitigation.

AB  - Simple Summary To achieve precision and intelligence in farming, automatic recognition and counting of goats are important and fundamental parts of the process of large-scale goat farming. Currently, many farms with low modernization use manual counting, which has the obvious shortcomings of low efficiency and difficulty in avoiding duplication and omissions due to the large population base and frequent counting needs of goats. In order to solve this problem in the farming process, an efficient and accurate goat counting method is urgently needed. In this study, we address the above problem by constructing an integrated deep learning model for automatic detection and counting of goats based on computer vision technology with the Chengdu Ma goat as the research object. It is worth noting that we have improved the model using a series of advanced and effective strategies to enhance the performance of the model. Experiments show that our method can achieve accurate automatic counting of goats in a practical breeding environment. The method is beneficial to the regionalized management of goat barns and can be applied to different goat species with high practicality. Goat farming is one of the pillar industries for sustainable development of national economies in some countries and plays an active role in social and economic development. In order to realize the precision and intelligence of goat breeding, this paper describes an integrated goat detection and counting method based on deep learning. First, we constructed a new dataset of video images of goats for the object tracking task. Then, we took YOLOv5 as the baseline of the object detector and improved it using a series of advanced methods, including: using RandAugment to explore suitable data augmentation strategies in a real goat barn environment, using AF-FPN to improve the network's ability to represent multi-scale objects, and using the Dynamic Head framework to unify the attention mechanism with the detector's heads to improve its performance. The improved detector achieved 92.19% mAP, a significant improvement compared to the 84.26% mAP of the original YOLOv5. In addition, we also input the information obtained by the detector into DeepSORT for goat tracking and counting. The average overlap rate of our proposed method is 89.69%, which is significantly higher than the 82.78% of the original combination of YOLOv5 and DeepSORT. In order to avoid double counting as much as possible, goats were counted using the single-line counting based on the results of goat head tracking, which can support practical applications.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of oxytocin as a cervical dilator, a study was carried out on nulliparous goats inseminated transcervically at the beginning of the breeding season. One hundred sixteen nulliparous goats with a mean live weight of 33.4 +/- 0.68 kg and an age of 13.7 +/- 0.37 months were used. The goats were exposed to active bucks of proven fertility for a period of 14 d in order to induce oestrus. One week later, the Ovsynch protocol was applied, which consisted of the application of 20 mg of gonadorelin (Day Zero), 0.075 mg of cloprostenol (Day 7) and of a second dose of 20 mg of gonadorelin applied on Day 9. Artificial insemination (AI) was performed 16 hr later. Three treatments were evaluated: T1 = 50 IU saline, T2 = 25 IU oxytocin; T3 = 50 IU of oxytocin, intravenously applied 10-15 min before AI. The time required to inseminate each treated goat from groups T2 and T3 was 49.56 and 56.25 s, respectively, versus 85.78 s needed for the goats from group T1 (p < .0001). In the T1 group of goats, the insemination catheter was inserted 2.1 cm into the cervical canal and in goats from groups T2 and T3 it reached 3.41 and 3.77 cm into the cervical canal, respectively (p = .02). Pregnancy rates and prolificacy (kids/doe) were higher (p = .02) for groups T2 (82.93%; 1.16) and T3 (76.92%; 1.21) respectively than for control goats (61.11%; 0.69). In conclusion, the intravenous administration of oxytocin led to greater dilation and depth of cervical penetration, obtaining higher pregnancy rates and prolificacy.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Creole animals are an important genetic resource due to their adaptation to adverse conditions, however, many of them have disappeared or have been reduced in number; therefore, their identification and preservation should be promoted. In the Mixteca zone of Oaxaca, Mexico, there is a group of creole sheep with physical differences with respect to the other known breeds. The objective of the present study was to determine the degree of differentiation among the individuals of the population of creole sheep and the similarities with other breeds, as well as to measure their level of conservation and consanguinity. It was found that there is a group of sheep which is different from the presently known breeds and that they do not present high degree of consanguinity, and thus may be considered a new breed. Therefore, it is proposed that they are identified as the Chocholteca Creole breed, in honor of the ethnic group which inhabits this region. The present study is very important because it discovers a new genotype of sheep, which amplifies the genetic diversity. Therefore, further studies are needed, given that they are a potential alternative of meat and wool.
   Creole sheep in Mexico have undergone crossbreeding, provoking the loss of genetic variability. The objective of the present study is to determine the intra-racial genetic diversity, the genetic relationship with other genotypes, and the populational substructure of the Oaxacan Creole sheep. Twenty-nine blood samples were obtained of Creole sheep of the Oaxaca Mixteca region in Mexico. A genetic analysis was made with 41 microsatellites recommended for studies of genetic diversity in sheep. An analysis was made of genetic diversity, populational structure, and genetic distance with 27 other sheep populations. The study found 205 alleles with a range of 2 to 9 by locus and an effective number of 3.33. The intra-racial analysis showed a moderate genetic diversity with values of expected heterozygosity of 0.686 and observed of 0.756, a mean polymorphic information content of 0.609, and a mean coefficient of consanguinity of -0.002. In interracial genetic diversity for the coefficients of consanguinity, the values were F-IS = 0.0774, F-IT = 0.16993, and F-ST = 0.10028, showing an elevated genetic distance with other creole breeds, but close to Argentine Creole, to another Creole of Mexico and the Spanish Merino. Its genetic structure showed that it does not have any populational subdivision nor mixes with the others analyzed. It is concluded that it is a distinct and isolated population and is proposed as the creole breed "Chocholteca" for its conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary This study is the first to assess the presence of micro-litter ingested by four species of marine mammals and two species of sea turtles, found stranded along the coastline of Samos Island, north-eastern Aegean Sea, Greece. Litter particles, identified as microplastics, were ubiquitous throughout all the digestive tracts analysed. This study suggests there is widespread microplastic contamination in marine megafauna in the study area, and proposes a method of standardisation to facilitate comparisons. This study is the first to assess the occurrence of micro-litter ingested by marine megafauna in the north-eastern Aegean Sea. A total of 25 specimens from four species of marine mammals, including dolphins and monk seals, and two species of sea turtles, found stranded along the coastline of Samos Island, Greece, were selected for the analysis. Litter particles, identified as microplastics (MPs), were ubiquitous throughout all sections of the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach and intestine) in all specimens. Overall, the MPs most frequently found were black fibres 0.21-0.50 mm in size. These results provide insight into the extent of micro-litter ingestion and contamination in marine vertebrates. Here we propose a method of standardisation to establish a baseline for marine taxa in this region of the Mediterranean Sea, where knowledge of the topic is still lacking.

AB  - One of the characteristic aspects of odour sensing in humans is the activation of olfactory receptors in a slightly different manner in response to different enantiomers. Here, we focused on whether plants showed enantiomer-specific response similar to that in humans. We exposed Arabidopsis seedlings to methanol (control) and (+)- or (-)-borneol, and found that only (+)-borneol reduced the root length. Furthermore, the root-tip width was more increased upon (+)-borneol exposure than upon (-)-borneol exposure. In addition, root-hair formation was observed near the root tip in response to (+)-borneol. Auxin signalling was strongly reduced in the root tip following exposure to (+)-borneol, but was detected following exposure to (-)-borneol and methanol. Similarly, in the root tip, the activity of cyclin B1:1 was detected on exposure to (-)-borneol and methanol, but not on exposure to (+)-borneol, indicating that (+)-borneol inhibits the meristematic activity in the root. These results partially explain the (+)-borneol-specific reduction in the root length of Arabidopsis. Our results indicate the presence of a sensing system specific for (+)-borneol in Arabidopsis.

AB  - The colonization and expansion of any plant species into a novel environment depend on its structural and functional characteristics. Therefore, developing better control measures for any invasive plant species requires examining and understanding the mechanisms underlying its reproduction and adaptation to the environment it invades. Recently, a novel exotic species Cylindropuntia rosea (DC.) Backeb. has been identified in Baljurashi, Al-Baha province, in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Reports suggest that this species may become invasive with the current rate of habitat expansion in Baljurashi. Although C. rosea is an important invasive species, most of its morpho-anatomical and physiological characteristics have not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the morpho-anatomical and related physiological adaptations of C. rosea in its new habitats in the southwestern highlands of Saudi Arabia. We observed that the species is well-equipped for invasion with traits to handle semi-arid conditions, including some morphological and anatomical features, CAM photosynthetic pathway, high growth rate, and highly effective defense mechanisms against herbivores and insects. These morphoanatomical and physiological characteristics contribute to the high invasiveness of this species in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic factors interact to influence phenotypic evolution; however, identifying the causal agents of selection that drive the evolution and expression of traits remains challenging. In a field common garden, we manipulated water availability and herbivore abundance across 3 years, and evaluated clinal variation in functional traits and phenology, phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation, and selection using diverse accessions of the perennial forb, Boechera stricta. Consistent with expectations, drought stress exacerbated damage from herbivores. We found significant plasticity and genetic clines in foliar and phenological traits. Water availability and herbivory interacted to exert selection, even on traits like flowering duration, which showed no clinal variation. Furthermore, the direction of selection on specific leaf area in response to water availability mirrored the genetic cline and plasticity, suggesting that variation in water levels across the landscape influences the evolution of this trait. Finally, both herbivory and water availability likely contribute to local adaptation. This work emphasizes the additive and synergistic roles of abiotic and biotic factors in shaping phenotypic variation across environmental gradients.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the indigenous sheep breeds that is primarily produced in Kenya under an extensive production system is the Red Maasai sheep. It has a reputation for being able to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. A common belief is that, when contrasted with the Dorper breed, it performs poorly in terms of growth traits. Therefore, to enhance their growth traits, the Red Maasai are randomly crossed with Dorper. In contrast, the Red Maasai sheep breed outperformed the Dorper sheep breed in this study in terms of post-weaning growth rate, once more demonstrating early resilience and adaptation to local environmental conditions independent of maternal influence. This comparative study aimed to evaluate genetic and environmental factors' effects on the growth traits of lambs in Dorper and Red Maasai (RedM) sheep breeds. The data analyzed contained the following measurements: birth weight (Bwt), weaning weight (Wwt), yearling weight (Ywt), birth type (single or twins), and details on each lamb's dam (dam ID and age) and sire. Except for the RedM, whose birth weight decreased with time, both breeds generally showed an increase in other growth weights across the study period, with yearly variations affecting both breeds. Additionally, analysis by a linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) showed that only breed as a factor significantly (p < 0.05) influenced birth weight; breed, sex, and birth type all significantly (p < 0.05) influenced weaning weight, whereas season, sex, and dam age significantly (p < 0.05) influenced yearling weight. The RedM breed outperformed the Dorper breed in post-weaning growth rate, demonstrating early resilience and adaptation to local environmental factors independent of maternal influence. Breed and non-genetic factors play a vital role in the growth of lambs, and the results of this study offer an opportunity for improved farm management under an extensive production system and selection for the conservation of the indigenous Red Maasai breed.

AB  - Fruit size can act as a physical barrier providing refuge for larvae of pest Anastrepha species against parasitoid attack. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of fruit size in six fruit species infested by Anastrepha larvae on the parasitism of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata after its augmentative release. About 1500 parasitoids were weekly released in disturbed wild vegetation patches. Fruit sampling was performed at the Coastal Lowlands of the Soconusco Region, southeastern Mexico, between June 2021 and October 2022. Overall, 310 ripe fruits belonging to grapefruit, creole mamey (large-size fruits), sweet orange, creole mango, wild guava (medium-size fruits), and wild hog plum (small-size fruit) were collected. The length, frontal width, lateral width and pulp thickness of all sampled fruits were measured. Such physical characteristics are indicators of the fruit size. Fruit collection was performed 48 h after release. Results indicated an inverse correlation between fruit size and parasitism, with a significant r(2) value higher than 75%. Host larvae in all fruits were parasitised only by D. longicaudata. The highest mean parasitism, which exceeded 90%, was recorded on hog plum and the lowest, below 20%, on Citrus spp. and mamey. Results corroborated the influence of host fruit size on parasitism levels by D. longicaudata regardless of its large-scale, open-field releases. Augmentative releases of D. longicaudata can be focused on wilderness areas with prevalence of medium-size to small-size Anastrepha host fruits. This would encourage long-term sustainable conservation of released parasitoid populations.

AB  - Background and Aims: The card & oacute;n ( Pachycereus pringlei ) is a columnar cactus emblematic of the Sonoran Desert, a region where free-range livestock grazing has been present for centuries, both in the Baja California peninsula and in Sonora. However, the effect of livestock on the population dynamics of the card & oacute;n is unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze whether the exclusion of livestock for nearly three decades had any observable effect on the recruitment probability of the card & oacute;n and on the relationship of the new recruits with two nurse legumes ( Olneya tesota and Prosopis articulata ). Methods: The presence and size of card & oacute;n and the two nurse legumes were recorded in transects. These were distributed under two conditions, with livestock presence and with 27 years of livestock exclusion, in plots established in an arid shrubland in the south of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. The study analyzed whether there were differences between these two conditions in (i) the recruitment probability of the card & oacute;n, and (ii) the association of new recruits with the nurse legumes. Key results: No differences were found in the recruitment probability between area with livestock and area with livestock exclusion. However, differences were observed in the association between recruited card & oacute;n individuals and nurse legumes, being positive in sites with livestock and absent in sites with livestock exclusion. Conclusions: The lack of differences in recruitment probability between conditions could be due to the influence of processes acting at spatio-temporal scales larger than those of our study. For example, the temporal scale, potentially multi-decadal, of card & oacute;n recruitment pulses or the spatial scale of activity ranges of pollinators, seed dispersers and consumers. Our results underscore the importance of spatio-temporal scale in studying the dynamics of long-lived species in arid regions.

AB  - During a survey of plant-inhabiting fungi and water niches from Korea, noteworthy fungi were collected; among them, two new species, Paracamarosporium noviaquum sp. nov. and Phyllosticta gwangjuensis sp. nov., are described based on morphology and multi-gene phylogenies. Paracamarosporium noviaquum was characterized by its production of 1-celled and 2-celled conidia, forming conidiomata on only potato dextrose agar medium. Phyllosticta gwangjuensis was characterized by conidia hyaline, ovoid to ellipsoid shape, rounded at both ends, containing numerous guttulae or with a single large central guttule. Additional species were identified as Cosmospora lavitskiae, Monochaetia cameliae, and Roussoella doimaesalongensis, which are reported as new record species from Korea. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of these taxa are provided herein.

AB  - Invasions by insect species that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture. Introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests can reduce invasive pest abundance and impact. Whether interactions between parasitoids and plant resistance are positive or negative depends on the detailed mechanisms. We studied the effects of susceptible versus resistant soybean and avirulent versus virulent soybean aphid on the parasitoids Aphelinus certus and Aphelinus glycinis, the first with a broad host range and the second with a narrow host range. Both parasitoid species parasitized virulent aphids at least as much as avirulent aphids on susceptible and resistant soybean. Aphelinus certus parasitized fewer avirulent aphids than virulent aphids on resistant soybean and fewer avirulent aphids on resistant versus susceptible soybean. The numbers of aphids parasitized by A. glycinis did not vary with the treatments. Emergence rates of parasitoid progeny were high for both parasitoids and did not vary with the treatments. Progeny sex ratios of the parasitoids did not vary with plant resistance or aphid virulence. However, for A. certus there was a small effect of the interaction between plant resistance and aphid virulence. Body masses of female and male progeny of A. certus did not vary with the treatments. However, body masses of female progeny of A. glycinis were larger on susceptible versus resistant soybean and on virulent versus avirulent aphids. Body masses of male progeny of A. glycinis were larger on susceptible versus resistant plants. Parasitism by A. certus is known to be density-dependent, and given that density-dependent parasitism has been found in several other species of Aphelinus, parasitism by A. glycines is very likely also to be density-dependent. Given the higher densities of virulent versus avirulent aphids on resistant soybean reported in the literature, these parasitoids should parasitize more virulent than avirulent aphids on resistant soybean and would limit the abundance of virulent soybean aphid if much of the soybean acreage had resistant plants. Little research has been published previously on the combined impacts of plant resistance and herbivore virulence on parasitoids. If our results hold true in other systems, plant resistance and biological control may be more compatible in suppressing herbivore virulence than has sometimes been proposed.

AB  - Learning to respond appropriately to novel dangers is often essential to survival and success, but carries risks. Learning about novel threats from others (social learning) can reduce these risks. Many species, including the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), respond defensively to both conspecific chemical alarm cues and conspecific anti-predator behaviours, and in other fish such social information can lead to a learned aversion to novel threats. However, relatively little is known about the neural substrates underlying social learning and the degree to which different forms of learning share similar neural mechanisms. Here, we explored the neural substrates mediating social learning of novel threats from two different conspecific cues (i.e. social cue-based threat learning). We first demonstrated that guppies rapidly learn about threats paired with either alarm cues or with conspecific threat responses (demonstration). Then, focusing on acquisition rather than recall, we discovered that phospho-S6 expression, a marker of neural activity, was elevated in guppies during learning from alarm cues in the putative homologue of the mammalian lateral septum and the preoptic area. Surprisingly, these changes in neural activity were not observed in fish learning from conspecific demonstration. Together, these results implicate forebrain areas in social learning about threat but raise the possibility that circuits contribute to such learning in a stimulus-specific manner.

AB  - Scientific sources and the IUCN reveal the decline in African Elephant populations, and new Redlist status for both the Forest and Savannah African Elephants. Efforts are ongoing to improve conservation of Forest and Savannah Elephants in Nigeria through engagement of local communities adjoining Protected Areas. This study investigates the willingness of local communities to co-create approaches that support elephants' conservation efforts. The study was carried out in Omo Forest Reserve, South - western, Nigeria and Yankari Game Reserve, North-eastern part of the country, for forest and savannah Elephants respectively. Mixed methods of questionnaires, outreaches, and youth engagement were used to collect data. The data was analyzed using simple averages, chi-square, and ANOVA tests. The study's findings reveal that 95.0% of participants agree that elephants should be protected. About 88.0% of the participants also agree that communities will benefit from elephant protection and 60.0% attribute the value of elephants to eco- tourism, while 45.0% for revenue generation. In addition, 41.0% of the participants have experience in co-creation approaches for wildlife conservation. Participants showed willingness and support to participate in elephant conservation efforts. Therefore, concerted efforts of co - creation approaches need to be further explored for sustainable elephant conservation efforts in Nigeria.

AB  - Nanoporous activated carbons synthesized from goat-weed (Ageratum Conyzoides) using single-step pyrolytic chemical-activation with ZnCl2 and H3PO4 at various ratios. Nano-textural properties of samples assessed through N2 adsorption/desorption, XRD, SEM, and FTIR. ZnCl2 activation led to a high microporosity and maximum surface-area of 1699 m2 center dot g-1 and total pore-volume of 1.23 cm3 center dot g- 1 (Zn/biomass ratio 1:1), while H3PO4 activation yielded 866 m2 center dot g- 1 and 1.24 cm3 center dot g-1, respectively (P/biomass ratio 1.5:1). The adsorption capacity of samples follows surface-area variations of samples. During treatment of hospital wastewater, ZnCl2activated carbon removed 90-93 % of pollutants, comparable to commercial carbon, while H3PO4-activated carbon removed 85-88 %. The adsorption mechanism of carbons during interaction with HWW contaminants was discussed to explain variation in removal efficiency.

AB  - Water is vital for mammals. Yet, as ephemeral sources can be difficult to find, it raises the question, how do mammals locate water? Elephants (Loxodonta africana) are water-dependent herbivores that possess exceptional olfactory capabilities, and it has been suggested that they may locate water via smell. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. To explore this, we performed two olfactory choice experiments with semi-tame elephants. In the first, we tested whether elephants could locate water using olfactory cues alone. For this, we used water from two natural dams and a drinking trough utilised by the elephants. Distilled water acted as a control. In the second, we explored whether elephants could detect three key volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly associated with water (geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, and dimethyl sulphide). We found that the elephants could locate water olfactorily, but not the distilled water. Moreover, they were also able to detect the three VOCs associated with water. However, these VOCs were not in the odour profiles of the water sources in our experiments. This suggests that the elephants were either able to detect the unique odour profiles of the different water sources or used other VOCs that they associate with water. Ultimately, our findings indicate that elephants can locate water olfactorily at small spatial scales, but the extent to which they, and other mammals, can detect water over larger scales (e.g. km) remains unclear.

AB  - Education has always been modified by employing different technologies to enhance the knowledge acquisition and performance of students. Virtual Reality (VR) along with the Game Industry is among those evolving technologies for educational applications. This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate an immersive VR-based Educational Game (IVREG) for learning topology relations. Topology relations are one of the fundamental topics which exist in Geospatial Information Science (GIS); due to the great capabilities offered by GIS, learning these basic topis is of great importance. A total of thirty-seven male middle-school students participated in this study. A total of four questionnaires were designed to evaluate the suitability of the proposed learning environment and its components at schools, particularly for learning geospatial topics. In conclusion, students found the IVREG useful and effective in classrooms. Additionally, the results showed that the components, namely the integrated pedagogical approach, gamification, and VR technology, were all suitable for being used at schools. On a final note, however, the study indicated that the immersion aspect of such learning environments should be enhanced in future studies.

AB  - Food systems and, to an extent, the pig sector are major contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. At the same time, significant amounts of waste are produced from the food sector. The aim of this study is to examine the implementation of circular bio-economy practices in the Greek pig sector to improve its environmental performance. More specifically, in collaboration with a pig farm in Northern Greece and a waste management company, the collection and processing of bakery by-products was organized to produce bakery meal (BM) to integrate it in the diets of fattening and growing pigs. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, the environmental performance of 20% BM inclusion in pig diets was examined in comparison with the conventional feedstock. BM experimentally replaced corn, wheat, barley, and soya bean from conventional feedstock. The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) was based on the yearly average values of feed and energy consumption to produce 1 kg of living weight of pig on the pig farm. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was conducted with SimaPro v3.5, using Recipe Midpoint Hierarchical v1.6. The LCIA calculations exhibited that BM inclusion in pig diets can lead to significant land occupation decrease, approximately 30%, which is mostly related to reduced wheat and soya beans. The reduction of cultivated croplands also led to reduced fertilizer and pesticide application, which improved marine eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity impact by 20% while it significantly reduced risks of human carcinogenic toxicity by 25%. Moreover, the Greek pig sector exhibited a 5% capacity for overall improvement of its environmental performance, which relies on minimizing logistics when the pig farm conducted collection and processing of by-products. A basic assumption of this study is the assessment of bakery by-product quantities in the wider region of the pig farm. The availability of by-products, based on the reported experience, was limited, and the reliability of the supply was frequently disrupted. As such, the supply chain model of the central hub for the collection and processing of bakery by-products is proposed as more efficient for regulating logistic challenges and availability.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study offers insights into the prenatal and postnatal maternal effects of feeding probiotics to pregnant sows from late-gestation through lactation on progeny immune status and stress responsiveness at birth, suckling, and through 14 days post-weaning. These results provide evidence that the neonate's immune system and stress responsiveness can be modulated in utero by feeding sows probiotics during gestation. Some immune parameters are also affected through the suckling period. Moreover, the progeny's immune status and cortisol profiles were differentially affected by weaning stress, and these effects were apparent up to 14-days post-weaning. These results suggest that it is plausible to affect the progeny's immune status and stress responsiveness in response via feeding the sow probiotics for 60 days. The study aimed to investigate and characterize the maternal effects of feeding Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boularddii (Scb) to sows from late-gestation through lactation on progeny cortisol, immune status, and stress responsiveness from birth to 14 days post-weaning. Eighty-four piglets were born to sows fed control (CON) or probiotic (PRO) boluses twice daily for 59 days. Blood samples were obtained at birth and 24 h later to assess prenatal effects; 7, 14, and 21 day-of-age to assess potential developmental effects; and at 24 h, 7, and 14 days post-weaning to assess the effects of weaning stress on immune and cortisol responses. Pigs born to PRO sows had less robust cortisol response and enhanced immune parameters at birth and 24 h later, indicating less stress. In response to weaning, pigs born to and nursed by PRO sows displayed unique cortisol and immune profiles than CON pigs. These results indicate that feeding sows Scb probiotics during late gestation reduces stress responsiveness to farrowing stress while increasing immune cell populations. Pigs nursed by PRO sows had a more robust initial cortisol response and enhanced neutrophil function and B-cell lymphocyte proliferation in response to weaning stress. These data imply it may be possible to maternally alter immune and stress responses in utero and during suckling in the short-term and up to 14 days post-weaning. However, more research is needed to optimize this strategy.

AB  - Ascorbic acid functions as an antioxidant and facilitates other biochemical processes such as collagen triple helix formation, and iron uptake by cells. Animals which endogenously produce ascorbic acid have a functional gulonolactone oxidase gene (GULO); however, humans have a GULO pseudogene (GULOP) and depend on dietary ascorbic acid. In this study, the conservation of GULOP sequences in the primate haplorhini suborder were investigated and compared to the GULO sequences belonging to the primates strepsirrhini suborder. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the conserved GULOP exons in the haplorhini primates experienced a high rate of mutations following the haplorhini/strepsirrhini divergence. This high mutation rate has decreased during the evolution of the haplorhini primates. Additionally, indels of the haplorhini GULOP sequences were conserved across the suborder. A separate analysis for GULO sequences and well-conserved GULOP sequences focusing on placental mammals identified an in-frame GULO sequence in the Brazilian guinea pig, and a potential GULOP sequence in the pika. Similar to haplorhini primates, the guinea pig and lagomorph species have experienced a high substitution rate when compared to the mammals used in this study. A shared synteny to examine the conservation of local genes near GULO/GULOP identified a conserved inversion around the GULO/GULOP locus between the haplorhini and strepsirrhini primates. Fischer's exact test did not support an association between GULOP and the chromosomal inversion. Mauve alignment showed that the inversion of the length of the syntenic block that the GULO/GULOP genes belonged to was variable. However, there were frequent rearrangements around similar to 2 million base pairs adjacent to GULOP involving the KIF13B and MSRA genes. These data may suggest that genes acquiring deleterious mutations in the coding sequence may respond to these deleterious mutations with rapid substitution rates.

AB  - Birds' bills are their main tactile interface with the outside world. Tactile bill-tip organs associated with specialized foraging techniques are present in several bird groups, yet remain understudied in most clades. One example is Austrodyptornithes, the major seabird clade uniting Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels) and Sphenisciformes (penguins). Here, we describe the mechanoreceptor arrangement and neurovascular anatomy in the premaxillae of Austrodyptornithes. Using a wide phylogenetic sample of extant birds (361 species), we show that albatrosses and penguins exhibit complex tactile bill-tip anatomies, comparable to birds with known bill-tip organs, despite not being known to use tactile foraging. Petrels (Procellariidae, Hydrobatidae and Oceanitidae) lack these morphologies, indicating an evolutionary transition in bill-tip mechanosensitivity within Procellariiformes. The bill-tip organ in Austrodyptornithes may be functionally related to nocturnal foraging and prey detection under water, or courtship displays involving tactile stimulation of the bill. Alternatively, these organs may be vestigial as is likely the case in most palaeognaths (e.g. ostriches and emu). Ancestral state reconstructions fail to reject the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of Austrodyptornithes had a bill-tip organ; thus, tactile foraging may be ancestral for this major extant clade, perhaps retained from a deeper point in crown bird evolutionary history.

AB  - Liquid storage of turkey semen without the loss of fertilizing ability is of practical interest to the poultry industry. However, fertility rates from liquid-stored turkey semen decline within a few hours. A clear cause of the decline in spermatozoa quality remains unidentified. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to monitor the dynamics of proteomic changes in spermatozoa during 48 h of liquid storage by 2-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. A total of 57 protein spots were differentially expressed between fresh and stored spermatozoa; 42 spots were more and 15 were less abundant after 48 h of semen storage. Raw proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD043050. The selected differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blotting and localized in specific spermatozoa structures by immunofluorescence, such as the head (acrosin and tubulin alpha), midpiece (acrosin, aconitate hydratase 2, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and tail (tubulin alpha). Most of the DEPs that changed in response to liquid storage were related to flagellum-dependent cell motility, energy derivation through oxidation of organic compounds and induction of fertilization, suggesting the complexity of the processes leading to the decrease in stored semen quality. The damaging effect of liquid storage on spermatozoa flagellum manifested as more microtubule proteins, such as tubulins and tektins, most likely formed by posttranslational modifications, tubulin alpha relocation from the tail to the sperm head, which appeared after 48 h of semen storage, and decreases in fibrous shelf proteins at the same time. Motility could be affected by dysregulation of Ca2+-binding proteins and disturbances in energy metabolism in spermatozoa flagellum. Regarding sperm mitochondria, DEPs involved in energy derivation through the oxidation of organic compounds indicated disturbances in fatty acid beta oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle as possible reasons for energy deficiency during liquid storage. Disturbances in acrosin and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase zeta may be involved in rapid declines in the fertility potential of stored turkey spermatozoa. These results showed the complexity of the processes leading to a decrease in stored semen quality and broadened knowledge of the detrimental effects of liquid storage on turkey spermatozoa physiology.

AB  - BACKGROUNDMultispecies natural enemy assemblages may be more successful in suppressing herbivorous pests compared to low-diversity communities, especially when natural enemies complement each other regarding the niches they exploit. Orius predatory bugs are omnivorous biological control agents used in horticulture, and are widely associated with the control of flower thrips. However, species within the Orius genus may differ significantly in biological characteristics, such as size, thermal development requirements, induction of diapause, degree of omnivory, and within-plant distribution. In this study, we explored the differences in within-plant preferences and pest-control efficacy against foliar and flower pests of the predators Orius laevigatus, O. majusculus and O. minutus.RESULTSIn oviposition experiments with Gerbera jamesonii plants, we found that O. laevigatus preferred ovipositing in the flower calyx, while eggs of the other two Orius species were mainly found in the leaves. Similarly, in a greenhouse trial where gerbera plants were infested with both the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis and the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, O. laevigatus was the most effective predator against the flower thrips, but the least effective against whiteflies. When O. laevigatus was combined with O. minutus, the best control of both pests at the same time was observed.CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that the use of Orius predators for pest control may be further exploited and that species combinations that complement each other may expand the range of pests successfully controlled by anthocorids.

AB  - Small populations of endangered species risk losing already eroded genetic diversity, important for adaptive potential, through the effects of genetic drift. The magnitude of drift can be mitigated by maximising the effective population size, as is the goal of genetic management strategies. Different mating systems, specifically those leading to reproductive skew, exacerbate genetic drift by distorting contributions. In the absence of an active management strategy, reproductive skew will have long-term effects on the genetic composition of a population, particularly where admixture is present. Here we examine the contrasting effects of conservation management strategies in two ex situ populations of the Critically Endangered eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli), one managed as a semi-wild population in South Africa (SAx), and one managed under a mean-kinship breeding strategy in European zoos. We use molecular data to reconstruct pedigrees for both populations and validate the method using the zoo studbook. Using the reconstructed pedigree and studbook we show there is male sex-specific skew in both populations. However, the zoo's mean-kinship breeding strategy effectively reduces reproductive skew in comparison to a semi-wild population with little genetic management. We also show that strong male reproductive skew in SAx has resulted in extensive admixture, which may require a re-evaluation of the population's original intended role in the black rhino meta-population. With a high potential for admixture in many ex situ populations of endangered species, molecular and pedigree data remain vital tools for populations needing to balance drift and selection.

AB  - Introduction: After decades of debate on the origin of turtles, it is now widely accepted that they are diapsid reptiles originating in the Permian from a terrestrial ancestor. It seems that the initial development of the structures that will later form the unique turtle bony shell took place as a response to a fossorial lifestyle. However, the earliest stem turtle with a fully complete plastron, Odontochelys semitestacea from the Late Triassic (lower Carnian) of China, is somewhat controversially interpreted as an aquatic or even a marine form, raising the question of the environment in which the completion of the plastron happened.
   Methods: Here, we analyzed the stable carbon, oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta S-34) of bones from two specimens of Odontochelys along with bones and teeth of two associated specimens of the marine ichthyosaur Guizhouichthyosaurus tangae.
   Results and discussion: We first show that delta O-18 values of Odontochelys are incompatible with a terrestrial lifestyle and imply a semi-aquatic to aquatic lifestyle. Isotopic results also demonstrate that the aquatic environment of Odontochelys was submitted to a strong marine influence, therefore excluding the possibility of a strict freshwater aquatic environment. Additionally, an unusual carbon isotope composition shows that O. semitestacea was herbivorous, probably consuming macrophytic algae in coastal zones like the extant green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) or the marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) do.

AB  - Life underground often leads to animals having specialized auditory systems to accommodate the constraints of acoustic transmission in tunnels. Despite living underground, naked mole-rats use a highly vocal communication system, implying that they rely on central auditory processing. However, little is known about these animals' central auditory system, and whether it follows a similar developmental time course as other rodents. Naked mole-rats show slowed development in the hippocampus suggesting they have altered brain development compared to other rodents. Here, we measured morphological characteristics and voltage-gated potassium channel K(v)3.3 expression and protein levels at different key developmental time points (postnatal days 9, 14, 21 and adulthood) to determine whether the auditory brainstem (lateral superior olive and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body) develops similarly to two common auditory rodent model species: gerbils and mice. Additionally, we measured the hearing onset of naked mole-rats using auditory brainstem response recordings at the same developmental timepoints. In contrast with other work in naked mole-rats showing that they are highly divergent in many aspects of their physiology, we show that naked mole-rats have a similar hearing onset, between postnatal day (P) 9 and P14, to many other rodents. On the other hand, we show some developmental differences, such as a unique morphology and K(v)3.3 protein levels in the brainstem.

AB  - Livestock predation can pose socio-economic impacts on rural livelihoods and is the main cause of retaliatory killings of carni-vores in many countries. Therefore, appropriate interventions to reduce livestock predation, lower conflict and promote coexistence are needed. Livestock guarding dogs have been traditionally used to reduce predation, yet details regarding the use of dogs, espe-cially the number of dogs per herd effectively required, are rarely studied. In this study, we assessed how the number and presence of guarding dogs in a herd can reduce livestock losses to leopard and wolf in corrals at night and on grazing grounds in day-time. Using systematic interview surveys (2016-2019), we documented sheep/goat losses per attack (predation rates) from 139 shepherds across 32 villages around Golestan National Park, Iran. We analysed the effects of the number of dogs, presence of dogs, presence of shepherds, seasons, corral quality, livestock number, dog size, distance to villages and distance to reserve on predation rates using generalized linear models. For the leopard model, dog presence significantly decreased (beta = -1.80, 95% confidence interval -2.61 to -0.81) predation rates during day-time to 1.41 individuals per attack. For wolf attacks in corrals at night, predation rates significantly decreased (beta = -0.29, -0.54 to -0.04) with increasing dog numbers. Also, shepherd presence (beta = -0.56, -1.10 to -0.10) and herd size (0 = -0.36, -0.60 to -0.12) significantly reduced predation rates. In the wolf day-time model, shepherd presence significantly decreased (beta = -0.93, -1.74 to -0.10) predation rates. Our study suggests that (1) using dogs can reduce, but not eliminate, predation by leopards during day-time; (2) with every additional dog, predation rates by wolves in corrals at night are likely to decrease on average by 25.2%; and (3) the presence of shepherds in corrals at night and during day-time can reduce predation rates.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a protected species in Kazakhstan. Little is known about the parasitofauna of these mammals. Therefore, the focus of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and species diversity of Eimeria spp. infection in the Volga-Ural Saiga antelope population. In June 2023, 104 Saiga antelope fecal samples collected from the district of Zhanibek, located in the province of West Kazakhstan were evaluated using microscopic and molecular techniques. Based on coprovoscopy results, Eimeria spp. Oocysts were present in 22 samples (21%). The four fecal samples containing the largest numbers of Eimeria spp. Oocysts per 10x field were selected for further genetic analysis. DNA extraction, nested PCR amplification, and sequencing were performed on 91 clones, with 80 clones forming a distinct clade and exhibiting genetic similarity to MT801034 Eimeria sp. Voucher HY3. These clones possibly represent an Eimeria specific to Saiga antelopes and gazelle that has previously been morphologically described as Eimeria elegans (Svanbaev, 1979), underscoring the importance of further research into parasitic infections in this protected species.

AB  - Large carnivores have been largely extirpated from Southeast Asia due to deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and poaching. Estimating the density of endangered carnivore populations, and identifying relationships between species occupancy and both environmental and anthropogenic factors, is essential for effective conservation planning. Recently, the IUCN conservation status of the Indochinese leopard (Panthera pardus delacouri) was upgraded to "Critically Endangered. " We surveyed Kweekoh Wildlife Sanctuary in Kawthoolei, an area administered by the Karen ethnic group in eastern Myanmar, to quantify (1) leopard population density using spatially explicit mark-resight (SMR) models, (2) leopard occupancy as influenced by important ecological variables, and (3) potential differences in activity between melanistic and spotted leopard morphs. Leopard density was estimated to be 1.39 +/- SE 0.22/100 km(2). Leopard occupancy (psi = 0.43; 95% credible interval: 0.26-0.67) increased further from roads, at relatively higher elevations, and in areas with higher relative abundance of wild boar. Leopard activity was cathemeral, with higher activity during night hours, and significant overlap (delta = 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.96) between melanistic and spotted morphs. However, melanistic leopards were more active during twilight hours than spotted individuals whose activity did not significantly vary throughout the day. Indochinese leopard density estimates in Kweekoh were among the lowest reported from Southeast Asia. Leopard occupancy was highest in the sanctuary's core areas, suggesting the presence of negative anthropogenic impacts along the sanctuary borders. We suggest our low density estimates warrant immediate and decisive conservation action, including better protection for leopards, their habitat, and their prey.

AB  - This study investigates the Mid-Pleistocene paleoenvironment and dietary behaviour of ancient herbivores in the South African central interior, today part of the semi-arid Kalahari savanna. Analyses were undertaken of carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotopes in tooth enamel carbonate of twelve fossil herbivore species from Layers 4b and 4a, associated with Earlier Stone Age (ESA) and transitional ESA-Middle Stone Age (Fauresmith) industries respectively, at the archaeological site of Kathu Pan 1. The data are compared with other Eearly to Mid-Pleistocene herbivore assemblages located in the central interior, namely Cornelia-Uitzoek, Wonderwerk Cave and the Florisbad Spring.
   Results indicate that the median delta C-13 values for all ungulate taxa at Kathu were >-4 parts per thousand, indicating predominantly C-4 based diets, although in certain taxa, some individuals included a significant C-3 component in their diet. The delta O-1(8) values of most species at Kathu were relatively low, suggesting a cooler and/or wetter climate. Carbon isotope evidence for C-4 dominated habitats at Kathu, but with a larger C-3 component amongst grazers than today, resembles the other Early to -Mid-Pleistocene assemblages in the region. Similarly, delta O-18 values for Kathu supplement existing evidence that the region was substantially wetter than in modern times.

AB  - Argyrosomus japonicus is arguably South Africa's most important estuarine recreational and small-scale fishery species. Although juvenile A. japonicus predominate in estuarine environments, where catch-and-release angling is common, limited C & R studies have taken place. The aim of this study was to use angler-behaviour to robustly examine the physiological stress response, reflex impairment and short-term (12-36-hour) survival of A. japonicus following C & R angling. Observations of estuarine recreational angling informed three air exposure treatments based on minimum (10 s), mean (75 s) and maximum (240 s) observed times, for use in a controlled angling experiment. Based on a prior laboratory study, blood sampling was delayed 30-40 min post-capture to allow for peak accumulations of lactate and glucose. Long air exposure (240 s) predicted significantly higher blood glucose concentrations (ANOVA, p = 0.03) than short (10 s) exposure. Similarly, both long (p = 0.01) and moderate (75 s; p = 0.01) air exposure significantly predicted elevated blood lactate concentrations, when compared with short exposure. In terms of physical impairment, long air exposure (240 s) had a significant negative influence on the reflex response (cumulative link model, p = 0.01) of A. japonicus. An observed short-term mortality of 7.7% was primarily attributed to hooking injury. To reduce significant physiological and physical stress, it is proposed that anglers should aim to reduce air exposure times to below the observed mean of 75 s, and ideally to 10 s. For relevant and meaningful future C & R studies, we propound the incorporation of angler behavioural assessments, and the investigation of physiological stress responses, prior to designing field studies.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) is a proven breeding technology which has been widely used in pig reproduction. Low temperature can cause very serious damage to pig sperm below 15 degrees C and the situation is even more serious at lower temperature. Besides, the preservation of pig sperm is mainly carried out at 17 degrees C because of its outstanding performance in pig reproduction. However, the accumulation of a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the preservation process is the main reason for the deterioration of sperm quality. In our research, by adding different concentrations of hydroxytyrosol to the diluent during the storage of pig sperm at 17 degrees C, we compared them with the traditional diluent to study the sperm motility, the cumulative amount of ROS, the extent of sperm membrane damage, the sperm acrosome integrity, the sperm DNA damage and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, T-AOC, SOD, GSH-PX, MDA) to evaluate the effect of hydroxytyrosol on the sperm quality during storage. We used proteomics sequencing technology to monitor difference in sperm protein between the control samples and the addition of 120 mu mol/L hydroxytyrosol samples (optimum concentration) after three days storage. Ultimately, we selected the control samples and the addition of 120 mu mol/L hydroxytyrosol samples to test the effect of AI. The results of our research showed that during storage of pig sperm at 17 degrees C, the sperm quality and antioxidant capacity of the hydroxytyrosol-treated samples significantly improved (HT 120 mu mol/L) (P < 0.05). Proteomics sequencing analysis proved that the addition of 120 !Imola. hydroxytyrosol treatment samples had potential value in improving sperm quality. The significant increase in sow pregnancy rate and piglet birth weight proved that hydroxytyrosol had important practical value in pig reproduction. Based on our results, we demonstrated that the addition of hydroxytyrosol to the diluent could improve the quality of pig sperm and the efficiency of AI. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the preferential expression of one allele over the other and contributes to Berkshire and Asian Tibetan pigs to characterize 2 ASE classes: imprinting (i.e., the unequal expression between parental alleles) and sequence dependent (i.e., unequal expression between breed-specific alleles). We examined 3 transcript types, including protein-coding genes (PCGs), long noncoding RNAs, and transcripts of unknown coding potential, across 7 representative somatic tissues from hybrid pigs generated by reciprocal crosses. Results: We identified a total of 92 putative imprinted transcripts, 69 (75.00%) of which are described here for the first time. By combining the transcriptome from purebred Berkshire and Tibetan pigs, we found similar to 6.59% of PCGs are differentially expressed between breeds that are regulated by trans-elements (e.g., transcriptional factors), while only similar to 1.35% are attributable to cis (e.g., promoters). The higher prevalence of trans-PCGs indicates the dominated effects of trans-regulation in driving expression differences and shaping adaptive phenotypic plasticity between breeds, which were supported by functional enrichment analysis. We also found strong evidence that expression changes mediated by cis-effects were associated with accumulated variants in promoters. Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive map of expression regulation that constitutes a valuable resource for the agricultural improvement of pig breeds.

AB  - Herbivorous insects can have their reproductive potential influenced by the quality and species of host plants they feed upon. The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an invasive pest of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) within its introduced range. As adults, EAB must feed upon foliage to sexually mature. We compared the influence of 4 North American ash species on EAB via foliage feeding to assess impacts on female lifespan and reproductive metrics. We fed 136 female EAB, 34 in each foliage group, either black, green, tropical, or white ash throughout their adult life. We performed daily inspections for adult mortality, oviposition, and egg hatching. We found that the mean female lifespan, fertility rate, and mean egg development time were not affected by the ash species. Potential and realized fecundity each increased with summed female group lifespan (days), but this rate differed among ash species. Consequently, there was a statistically significant interaction effect of the summed female group lifespan and the host foliage. Green ash-fed EAB laid (2.94 +/- 0.86 eggs/female days) and hatched (1.67 +/- 0.59 eggs/female days) the most eggs, more than double the rates of EAB feeding on black (1.39 +/- 0.48 laid and 0.75 +/- 0.30 hatched eggs/female days) and white (1.08 +/- 0.35 laid and 0.65 +/- 0.22 hatched eggs/female days) ash. Adults feeding on green ash resulted in the greatest EAB fecundity suggesting that the presence of green ash may promote population growth and provide a pathway to overwhelm other ash species nearby.

AB  - While increased foliar photosynthesis is well documented across many plant species in response to diverse modes of herbivory, the compensatory ability of photosynthetically active reproductive structures is unknown. To address this, we partially defoliated basal florets in seed heads of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.), an exotic Eurasian perennial bunchgrass widely distributed across North American sagebrush steppe. We followed direct and indirect responses by tracking post-clipping photosynthesis in clipped basal and unclipped distal florets, respectively, and comparing these to similar florets on unclipped seed heads. Compensatory photosynthesis was apparent 24 h after clipping; over the pre-anthesis period, clipped basal floret photosynthesis was + 62%, stomatal conductance was + 82%, and PSII photochemical yield was - 39% of unclipped controls. After anthesis, intact florets distal to clipped florets had modestly higher photosynthetic rates compared to controls, while basal floret rates did not differ between treatments. Compensatory photosynthesis reduced intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE; photosynthesis/stomatal conductance) 68-40% below controls over pre- and post-anthesis periods, respectively. Specific mass (dry mass/area) of clipped florets was - 15% of controls, while florets distal to these had specific mass 11% greater than distal or basal florets on unclipped seed heads. These results suggest damaged basal florets provided carbon to unaffected distal florets. This could explain crested wheatgrass's ability to produce viable seeds under conditions limiting to native bunchgrasses, and presents a novel mechanism germane to the development of convergent drought- and grazing-tolerance traits important to arid and semi-arid rangeland plant community resilience to climate variability.

AB  - Intraguild interactions are known to trigger competition among phytophagous insects that depend on the same food source, which may have implications on natural enemy performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that intraguild interactions between the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, and the South American tomato pinworm, Phthorimaea absoluta on the host plant tomato would affect performance of the pinworm ectoparasitoid Bracon nigricans. In oviposition bioassays, P. absoluta females significantly laid more eggs and were attracted to tomato plants infested with T. vaporariorum than uninfested plants. Additionally, T. vaporariorum infestation decreased B. nigricans parasitism on P. absoluta larvae and attraction to tomato plants. In coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) recordings, antennae of P. absoluta and B. nigricans females detected 18 and 15 components, respectively from the herbivore-induced volatiles, which were identified by GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and terpenes. In dose-response behavioral assays, P. absoluta and B. nigricans responses varied with the composition and concentration of blends and individual compounds tested. Whereas P. absoluta was attracted to GLVs and terpenes, B. nigricans avoided most of these chemicals, especially the GLV (E)-2-hexenal and terpenes & delta;-3-carene, and (E)-caryophyllene. The results suggest that herbivore intraguild interactions can influence the behavioral ecology and performance of natural enemies which may have evolutionary significance. Also, these specific GLVs and terpenes can be exploited in the management of P. absoluta.

AB  - The transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) between animals, their environment, food and humans is a complex issue. Previous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models indicate that extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistant bacterial populations may be self-sustaining through horizontal and vertical gene transfer, even in the absence of antimicrobial pressure. However, models focusing purely on the biochemical aspects fail to incorporate the complicated host population dynamics which occur within a farm environment. Models of disease transmission within commercial farm environments can provide further insight to the on-farm transmission dynamics of AMR between animals and their environment, as well as predict the effect of various on-farm interventions. Here, we present a risk assessment which predicts the likelihood that slaughter-aged pigs would carry resistant bacteria after a single introduction of ESBL E. coli on commercial pig farms. We incorporate outputs from a PKPD model which explores the complex host/gastrointestinal bacteria interplay after antimicrobial treatment; with an on-farm model of bacterial transmission. The risk assessment is designed to be adaptable for the simultaneous transmission of multiple bacteria and resistant strains. We predicted that after introduction onto a pig farm, ESBL E. coli bacteria are likely to persist on the farm for more than a year, leading to a high batch prevalence (39.4% slaughter pigs, 5th and 95th percentiles: 0.0-57.5) and high faecal shedding. A comparison of different farm management types suggested that all-in-all-out housing was a protective measure for both prevalence in slaughter-aged pigs and faecal shedding rates. We applied two main interventions at the farm level, an enhanced cleaning and disinfectant (C&D) protocol and isolation of pigs in sick pens for the duration of their antibiotic treatment. Both interventions were able to reduce the number of pigs shedding more than 2 log10 ESBL E. coli from 18.7% (5th and 95th percentiles: 5.9-30.4) in the baseline scenario, to 7.2% (5th and 95th percentiles: 0.0-21.5) when an enhanced C&D protocol was applied, 0.1% (5th and 95th percentiles: 0.0-0.3) when sick pens were used and 0.1% (5th and 95th percentiles: 0.0-0.3) when a combination of enhanced C&D plus sick pens was used. Both scenarios also reduced the prevalence in batches of pigs going to slaughter. This effect was largest when sick pens were used, where 75% of batches had 0% positive pigs. The results suggest that a single introductory event is sufficient to cause a substantial risk of carriage in slaughter-aged pigs. Further quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) are needed to consider the onwards risk posed to later parts of the food chain.

AB  - Human crop production has benefitted from developments in the use of natural and formulated chemical substances to control pathogens and insect herbivores. However, numerous adverse effects of exposure to these chemical substances, pesticides, have been documented in a variety of nontarget organisms. Of particular concern are the negative impacts of pesticide exposure on agriculturally important insect pollinators. While the general effects of pesticides on pollinator health have garnered much interest, the potential role of certain pesticide classes has historically been poorly understood and investigated. Despite their ubiquity in the foraging environment, fungicides were traditionally deemed to be safe for pollinating insects based on low toxicity outcomes in standardized assessments by regulatory agencies. Recently, multiple studies have dispelled this traditional designation by demonstrating numerous sublethal and lethal outcomes for pollinators exposed to various fungicides. Here we provide an overview of the historical underpinnings of fungicide development and application, as well as trends in the implementation of regulatory measures. We discuss exposure routes and the prevalence of fungicides in the environment. Finally, we explore the growing body of literature revealing negative effects of exposure including the specific mechanisms by which fungicides act on non-target pollinators, including fungicide synergisms with other pesticide classes, pests, pathogens and phytochemicals, and fungicide-induced behavioural alterations.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify and prioritize deer-vehicle crash (DVC) hotspots using five years of crash data. This study applied Bayesian spatiotemporal models for the identification of the DVC hotspots. The Bayesian spatiotemporal model allows to observe area-specific trends in the DVC data and highlights specific locations where DVC occurrence is deteriorating or improving over time. Census Tracts (CTs) were used as the geographic units to aggregate DVC, land use, and transportation infrastructure related data of Minnesota (MN) for the year 2015 to 2019. Several tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the hotspot identification methods. The result showed that Type-I spatiotemporal interaction model (Model-2) outperforms other four space-time models in terms of predicting DVC frequency in CTs and hotspot identification performance test measures. Results showed that forest area, vegetation, and wetland percentages were positively associated with DVC frequency, whereas the percentage of developed land use was negatively associated with DVC frequency. The findings of this study suggest that the deer population plays an important role in DVCs, which indicates that deer population management is necessary to minimize the DVC risks. Using the final Type-I spatiotemporal interaction model, 65 "High-High " CTs were identified, where both the posterior mean of the decision parameter (potential for safety improvement) and the area-specific trend were higher. The distribution of the identified hotspots showed that the risk of DVCs was more in suburban areas with mixed land use conditions. These CTs represent high-risk zones, which need immediate safety improvement measures to reduce the DVC risks. As DVC can occur at any roadway segment location, DVC hotspots information is important for safety engineers and policymakers to implement area specific countermeasures.

AB  - Host plant use in Lepidoptera has been a primary focus in studies of ecological specialization, and multiple factors are likely to be involved in shaping the evolution of diet breadth. Here, we first describe the Salient Aroma Hypothesis, suggesting that the availability of chemical information, particularly host-associated aromas, plays a critical role in shaping dietary specialization. According to the Salient Aroma Hypothesis, herbivores active during periods when chemical information is abundant, particularly during the daytime hours when plant aromas are hypothesized to be more prevalent, are more likely to evolve specialized diets. First, with meta-analysis, we show that plants release more diverse and abundant volatile compounds during daylight hours, increasing the availability of chemical information. We found that diurnal Lepidoptera tend to have specialized diets, while nocturnal species are more generalized, consistent with the prediction of the Salient Aroma Hypothesis. We further observed that morphological differences in the antennae of female Lepidoptera are correlated with variation in diet breadth and diel activity patterns, indirectly supporting the Salient Aroma Hypothesis. While multiple factors influence host plant specialization, the Salient Aroma Hypothesis offers a useful framework linking chemical information availability (e.g. plant volatiles) and ecological specialization.

AB  - BackgroundThe Changthangi sheep thrive at high altitudes in the cold desert regions of Ladakh, India while Muzaffarnagri sheep are well-suited to the low altitude plains of northern India. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of pulmonary adaptation to diverse environments by analyzing gene expression profiles of lung tissues through RNA sequencing.Methods and resultsFour biological replicates of lung tissue from each breed were utilized to generate the transcriptomic data. Differences in gene expression analysis revealed discrete expression profiles in lungs of each breed. In Changthangi sheep, genes related to immune responses, particularly cytokine signaling, were significantly enriched. Pathway analysis highlighted the activation of NF-kB signaling, a key mediator of inflammation and immune response. Additionally, the gene network analysis indicated a strong association between cytokine signaling, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and NF-kB activation, suggesting a coordinated response to hypoxic stress in lungs of Changthangi sheep. In Muzaffarnagri sheep, the gene expression profiles were enriched for pathways related to energy metabolism, homeostasis and lung physiology. Key pathways identified include collagen formation and carbohydrate metabolism, both of which are crucial for maintaining lung function and structural integrity. Gene network analysis further reinforced this by revealing a strong connection between genes associated with lung structure and function.ConclusionsOur findings shed light on the valuable insights into gene expression mechanisms that enable these sheep breeds to adapt to their respective environments and contribute to a better understanding of high altitude adaptation in livestock.

AB  - Semen proteins play an important role in male reproductive performance and sperm fertilization ability and can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate male fertility. The role of cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3) in male reproduction remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of CRISP3 in the reproductive performance of boars. Our results showed that the CRISP3 protein content was significantly and positively correlated with boar fertility, sow delivery rate, and litter size. CRISP3 is highly expressed in the bulbourethral gland of adult boars and is enriched in the seminal plasma. It is localized in the post-acrosomal region of the sperm head and migrates to the anterior end of the tail after capacitation. The CRISP3 recombinant protein did not affect sperm motility and cleavage rate, but it significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors IL-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 and the protein expression of IL-alpha and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells, indicating that CRISP3 has an immunomodulatory function. In conclusion, our study suggests that semen CRISP3 protein levels positively correlate with reproductive performance, which may be achieved by regulating immune responses in the female reproductive tract.

AB  - Cross-cultural collaboration between Yawuru Country Managers (Rangers) and WWF-Australia ecologists led to new detections of the Spectacled Hare-wallaby (SHW), (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) in the west Kimberley region of Western Australia where it was presumed to be locally extirpated. This collaboration relied on the expertise of the Yawuru Country Managers to select specific locations for targeted field surveys and resulted in the confirmation of SHW on the Yawuru IPA for the first time in a decade. Subsequent remote camera trap surveys over a larger area included collaboration with two additional neighbouring Indigenous ranger groups, Karrajarri and Nyikina Mangala. These surveys investigated the spatial and temporal relationship between SHW and other mammals which may threaten (e.g., feral Cat [Felis catus], Dingo [Canis familiaris dingo]) or compete (e.g., Agile Wallaby [Macropus agilis]; Cattle [Bos taurus]) with them. We found a negative relationship between SHW and cat activity, suggesting that cats may limit the activity or abundance of SHW. Temporal portioning was evident between SHW and both Cattle and Agile Wallaby suggesting that SHW may avoid times when these species are most active. Further, we found a negative relationship between SHW occurrence and distance to fire scar edge burnt in current or previous fire season. This edge habitat is likely important to SHW because they may require recently burnt areas to forage and dense unburnt areas to shelter. This project highlights the benefits of cross-cultural research and monitoring partnerships with Indigenous rangers as active observers and managers of their traditional lands.

AB  - The response to buck effect (BE) was studied in Beni Arouss goats during anoestrus (AS) and breeding season (BS). Prior to AS, bucks were exposed to artificial long days during 75 days followed by a natural photoperiod. Goats of group 1 were treated for 11 days with 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) combined to 300 IU of eCG and 50 mu g of cloprostenol injected 48 h prior to FGA-removal. Goats of group 2 and 3 were subjected to the same treatments, but eCG injection was replaced by a sexually active buck introduced 0 (group 2) or 48 hours (group 3) before FGA-removal. During the AS, 77% of goats induced by the BE showed an oestrus at [60-74] hr following FGA-removal for group 3 and [71-77] hr for group 2 (p < .05). In group 1, 77% of goats displayed an LH surge [24-40] hr after FGA-removal and 67% developed a luteal phase, but no LH surge or luteal response was detected in groups 2 and 3. During the BS, oestrus response reached 100% in goats synchronised with the BE ([22-68] hr in groups 2 and 3). In all groups, 84% of the goats displayed an LH surge at [30-70] hr post-treatment and 69% displayed luteal phase within 3-8 days post-treatment. After 11-15 days, the occurrence of ovulations followed by normal luteal phase was raised in all groups (91%). It was concluded that photostimulated bucks failed to induce and synchronise ovulation in goats previously treated with 20 mg of FGA and 50 mu g of cloprostenol during anoestrus.

AB  - The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is one of the most vital components of mucosal immunity that plays a pivotal role in mediating transcytosis of polymeric immunoglobulin (pIg) on epithelial surfaces for protection against invading pathogens. Herein, we cloned the full-length cDNA of Pelodiscus sinensis pIgR, designated as P. sinensis pIgR, made of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1848 bp, molecular weight of 68.2 kDa and estimated isoelectric point of 7.00. The deduced P. sinensis pIgR sequence had a leader peptide, extracellular region containing four immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig like domains), transmembrane and intracellular regions comparable with other vertebrates. P. sinensis pIgR contained four Ig like domains that corresponded with mammalian D1, D3, D4 and D5 similar with reptile and avian Ig like domains. It had 40 potential phosphorylation sites, four putative N-glycosylation sites and several motifs resembling mammalian pIgR motifs. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between P. sinensis pIgR with avian and reptile pIgRs. P. sinensis pIgR basal levels were higher in the esophagus, small intestine and intestinnum crissum than in other organs of health turtles. Intragastric delivery of LPS and Aeromonas sobria led to significant upregulation of P. sinensis pIgR in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. A polyclonal anti- P. sinensis pIgR antibody produced in rabbit reacted with the recombinant P. sinensis pIgR protein expressed in Escherichia coli in Western blot. These studies demonstrate the existence and immune response of P. sinensis pIgR to stimulation in mucosal organs in Chinese soft-shelled turtles.

AB  - Type of feed is an important consideration in herbivore colony management, yet limited studies report on the effects of diet on common conditions such as urolithiasis in guinea pigs. Urolithiasis is a well-documented cause of lower urinary tract disease in guinea pigs, with calcium carbonate uroliths reported as the predominant calculi formed in the guinea pig urinary tract. A calcium-rich diet has been suggested as a risk factor for of urolithiasis, with numerous commercially available guinea pig diets formulated for adults avoiding ingredients that are higher in calcium. Due to the high incidence of urolithiasis in our strain 13/N guinea pig colony, we conducted a prospective control study following the implementation of dietary changes aimed at improving overall urinary tract health and reducing risk factors for urolithiasis, thus improving colony welfare. A control group was kept on the original ad libitum alfalfa hay-based pellet diet with restricted loose timothy hay (control diet, 14 juveniles and 24 adults). An experimental group was placed on a portioned, 1 oz daily, timothy hay-based pellet diet with ad libitum loose timothy hay (experimental diet, 21 juveniles and 23 adults). Juveniles and adults were followed for a total of 14 and 26 wk, respectively. Longitudinal blood and urine samples were collected to evaluate blood chemistry and urinary parameters, along with weight and body condition scores to assess general health. Overall, dietary changes did not improve parameters associated with improved urinary tract health or reduced risk of urolithiasis; feeding strategy was not found to meaningfully affect calcium crystalluria, urine protein, urine specific gravity, or renal values. These data support alfalfa hay-based pellet or timothy hay-based pellet, when fed with loose timothy hay, as viable options and suggest that practices aimed at reducing dietary calcium by reducing pelleted diet portions are insufficient to mitigate risk factors for urolithiasis in guinea pigs.

AB  - Aerobic composting is a sustainable and effective waste disposal method. However, it can generate massive amounts of ammonia (NH3) via volatilization. Effectively reducing NH3 volatilization is vital for advancing aerobic composting and protecting the ecological environment. Herein, two crystal types of MnO2 (alpha-MnO2 and 8-MnO2) are combined with biochar (hydrochar (WHC) and pyrochar (WPC), respectively) and used as conditioners for the aerobic composting of chicken manure. Results reveal that alpha-MnO2 (34.6%) can more effectively reduce NH3 accumulation than 8-MnO2 (27.1%). Moreover, the combination of WHC and MnO2 better reduces NH3 volatilization (48.5-58.9%) than the combination of WPC and MnO2 (15.8-40.1%). The highest NH3 volatilization reduction effect (58.9%) is achieved using the combination of WHC and 8-MnO2. Because the added WHC and 8-MnO2 promote the humification of the compost, the humic acid to fulvic acid ratio (HA/FA ratio) dramatically increases. The combination of WHC and 8-MnO2 doubled the HA/FA ratio and resulted in a net economic benefit of 130.0 RMB/t. Therefore, WHC and 8-MnO2 co-conditioning can promote compost decomposition, improving the quality of organic fertilizers and substantially reducing NH3 volatilization.

AB  - Domestic cats were derived from the Near Eastern wildcat (Felis lybica), after which they dispersed with people into Europe. As they did so, it is possible that they interbred with the indigenous population of European wildcats (Felis silvestris). Gene flow between incoming domestic animals and closely related indigenous wild species has been previously demonstrated in other taxa, including pigs, sheep, goats, bees, chickens, and cattle. In the case of cats, a lack of nuclear, genome-wide data, particularly from Near Eastern wildcats, has made it difficult to either detect or quantify this possibility. To address these issues, we generated 75 ancient mitochondrial genomes, 14 ancient nuclear genomes, and 31 modern nuclear genomes from European and Near Eastern wildcats. Our results demonstrate that despite cohabitating for at least 2,000 years on the European mainland and in Britain, most modern domestic cats possessed less than 10% of their ancestry from European wildcats, and ancient European wildcats possessed little to no ancestry from domestic cats. The antiquity and strength of this reproductive isolation between introduced domestic cats and local wildcats was likely the result of behavioral and ecological differences. Intriguingly, this long-lasting reproductive isolation is currently being eroded in parts of the species' distribution as a result of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The contamination of the environment by some veterinary medicines and their impact on wild animals is of increasing concern. However, there is a lack of information about their residues in wildlife. The sentinel animals most commonly used for monitoring the level of environmental contamination are birds of prey, and information on other carnivores and scavengers scarce. This study examined the livers from 118 foxes for residues of a range of 18 veterinary medicines (16 anthelmintic agents and 2 metabolites) used on farm livestock. The samples were collected from foxes, primarily in Scotland, shot during legal pest control activities conducted between 2014 and 2019. Closantel residues were detected in 18 samples, and the concentrations found ranged from 6.5 mu gkg(-1) to 1383 mu gkg(-1). No other compounds were found in significant quantities. The results show a surprising frequency and level of closantel contamination, raising concerns about both the route of contamination and the potential impacts on wild animals and the environment, such as the potential for significant wildlife contamination to contribute to the development of closantel-resistant parasites. The results also suggest that red fox (Vulpes vulpes) could be a useful sentinel species for detecting and monitoring some veterinary medicine residues in the environment.

AB  - Water scarcity and the excessive use of chemical fertilizers are the key destructive factors that negatively affect the quantity and quality of crops. Chitosan nanoparticles (Cs-NPs) and biofertilizers (BFS) have been shown to alleviate the effects of drought stress on plants, but information is scant on the effect of their co-addition on minimizing the effects of drought stress on plants. This study investigated the effect of the combined application of nanoparticles and biofertilizer to improve drought tolerance in camelina (Camelina sativa L.). The experimental design was constituted by a split plot arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 16 treatments and three replications. The main factor was the cultivation in rainfed and supplementary irrigation conditions. Subplots were assigned to eight fertilizer sources, including no fertilizer (control), complete chemical fertilizer (CHF), biofertilizer (BFS), chitosan nanoparticles (C-S-NPS), 50% CHF+ BFS, 50% CHF+ C-S-NPS, BFS+ C-S-NPS, and C-S-NPS+ BFs + 50% CHF. The results showed that the highest antioxidant enzyme activity, total soluble proteins, phenolics, and flavonoid content were recorded by the treatment of C-S-NPS+ BFS+ 50% CHF in rainfed conditions. The highest photosynthesis pigments and total soluble sugar content were observed in supplementary irrigation conditions along with C-S-NPS+ BFS+ 50% CHF. The application of C-S-NPS+ BFS+ 50% CHF in rainfed and supplementary irrigation conditions increased camelina grain yield by 53.76 and 78.95% versus the control plants, respectively. The C-S-NPS+ BFS+ 50% CHF treatment mitigated the adverse effects of the limited water supply on the physiological, biochemical, and yield traits of camelina. These findings revealed that the combined application of C-S-NPS+ BFS+ 50% CHF can be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizers to improve crop production sustainability.

AB  - Most trees emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) continuously throughout their life, but the rate of emission and spectrum of emitted VOCs become substantially altered when the trees experience stress. Despite this, models to predict the emissions of VOCs do not account for perturbations caused by biotic plant stress. Considering that such stresses have generally been forecast to increase in both frequency and severity in the future climate, the neglect of stress-induced plant emissions in models might be one of the key obstacles for realistic climate change predictions, since changes in VOC concentrations are known to greatly influence atmospheric aerosol processes. Thus, we constructed a model to study the impact of biotic plant stresses on new particle formation and growth throughout a full growing season. We simulated the influence on aerosol processes caused by herbivory by the European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) feeding on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and mountain birch (Betula pubescens var. pumila), respectively, and also fungal infections of pedunculate oak and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens) by oak powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides) and poplar rust (Melampsora larici-populina), respectively. Our modelling results indicate that all the investigated plant stresses are capable of substantially perturbing both the number and size of aerosol particles in atmospherically relevant conditions, with increases in the amount of newly formed particles by up to about an order of magnitude and additional daily growth of up to almost 50 nm. We also showed that it can be more important to account for biotic plant stresses in models for local and regional predictions of new particle formation and growth during the time of infestation or infection than significant variations in, e.g. leaf area index and temperature and light conditions, which are currently the main parameters controlling predictions of VOC emissions. Our study thus demonstrates that biotic plant stress can be highly atmospherically relevant. To validate our findings, field measurements are urgently needed to quantify the role of stress emissions in atmospheric aerosol processes and for making integration of biotic plant stress emission responses into numerical models for prediction of atmospheric chemistry and physics, including climate change projection models, possible.

AB  - Chemical cues play important roles in predator-prey interactions. Semiochemicals can aid predator foraging and alert prey organisms to the presence of predators. Previous work suggests that predator traits differentially influence prey behavior, however, empirical data on how prey organisms respond to chemical cues from predator species with different hunting strategies, and how foraging predators react to cues from potential competitors, is lacking. Furthermore, most research in this area has focused on aquatic and aboveground terrestrial systems, while interactions among belowground, soiling-dwelling organisms have received relatively little attention. Here, we assessed how chemical cues from three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), each with a different foraging strategy, influenced herbivore (cucumber beetle) and natural enemy (EPN) foraging behavior. We predicted these cues could serve as chemical indicators of increased predation risk, prey availability, or competition. Our findings revealed that foraging cucumber beetle larvae avoided chemical cues from Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (active-foraging cruiser EPNs), but not Steinernema carpocapsae (ambusher EPNs) or Steinernema riobrave (intermediate-foraging EPNs). In contrast, foraging H. bacteriophora EPNs were attracted to cues produced by the two Steinernema species but not conspecific cues. Notably, the three EPN species produced distinct blends of olfactory cues, with only a few semi-conserved compounds across species. These results indicate that a belowground insect herbivore responds differently to chemical cues from different EPN species, with some EPN species avoiding prey detection. Moreover, the active-hunting EPNs were attracted to heterospecific cues, suggesting these cues indicate a greater probability of available prey, rather than strong interspecific competition.

AB  - Odorant receptors (ORs) are essential for plant-insect interactions. However, despite the global impacts of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) as major herbivores and pollinators, little functional data are available about Lepidoptera ORs involved in plant-volatile detection. Here, we initially characterized the plant-volatile-sensing function(s) of 44 ORs from the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, and subsequently conducted a large-scale comparative analysis that establishes how most orthologous ORs have functionally diverged among closely related species whereas some rare ORs are functionally conserved. Specifically, our systematic analysis of H. armigera ORs cataloged the wide functional scope of the H. armigera OR repertoire, and also showed that HarmOR42 and its Spodoptera littoralis ortholog are functionally conserved. Pursuing this, we characterized the HarmOR42-orthologous ORs from 11 species across the Glossata suborder and confirmed the HarmOR42 orthologs form a unique OR lineage that has undergone strong purifying selection in Glossata species and whose members are tuned with strong specificity to phenylacetaldehyde, a floral scent component common to most angiosperms. In vivo studies via HarmOR42 knockout support that HarmOR42-related ORs are essential for host-detection by sensing phenylacetaldehyde. Our work also supports that these ORs coevolved with the tube-like proboscis, and has maintained functional stability throughout the long-term coexistence of Lepidoptera with angiosperms. Thus, beyond providing a rich empirical resource for delineating the precise functions of H. armigera ORs, our results enable a comparative analysis of insect ORs that have apparently facilitated and currently sustain the intimate adaptations and ecological interactions among nectar feeding insects and flowering plants.

AB  - Croceous glands are visible structures defined by their rounded shape and yellowish color. They have great taxonomic importance, being used to delimit the Timutua section, one of the 14 sections of the subgenera Polygala, genera Polygala, the most representative of the family Polygalaceae, with about 120 species recorded in Brazil. However, detailed information about the nature of croceous glands is still missing. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the origin, structure, and function of the croceous glands in the floral structures, fruits, leaf blades, and stems of Polygala adenophora. Samples of P. adenophora at different developmental stages (flower buds, fully developed flowers and fruits), as well as stems, and leaves collected from the 1(st), 3(rd), 6(th), and 9(th) nodes were obtained from a coastal area in Para state, Brazil. The samples were fixed in FAA(50) or buffered neutral formalin and submitted to light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Histochemical tests were carried out for lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds. Our results showed that the croceous glands are secretory cavities and ducts of schizolysigenous origin, present since the beginning of the development of vegetative and reproductive organs. The cavities and ducts produce a lipophilic compound consisting of essential oils and lipids. We hypothesize that this exudate possibly has a protective function, acting against pathogen and herbivore attacks.

AB  - Herbivorous insects are extraordinarily diverse, yet are found in only one-third of insect orders. This skew may result from barriers to plant colonization, coupled with phylogenetic constraint on plant-colonizing adaptations. The plant-penetrating ovipositor, however, is one trait that surmounts host plant physical defences and may be evolutionarily labile. Ovipositors densely lined with hard bristles have evolved repeatedly in herbivorous lineages, including within the Drosophilidae. However, the evolution and genetic basis of this innovation has not been well studied. Here, we focused on the evolution of this trait in Scaptomyza, a genus sister to Hawaiian Drosophila, that contains a herbivorous clade. Our phylogenetic approach revealed that ovipositor bristle number increased as herbivory evolved in the Scaptomyza lineage. Through a genome-wide association study, we then dissected the genomic architecture of variation in ovipositor bristle number within S. flava. Top-associated variants were enriched for transcriptional repressors, and the strongest associations included genes contributing to peripheral nervous system development. Individual genotyping supported the association at a variant upstream of G alpha i, a neural development gene, contributing to a gain of 0.58 bristles/major allele. These results suggest that regulatory variation involving conserved developmental genes contributes to this key morphological trait involved in plant colonization.

AB  - The paper aims to analyse the life cycle of sheep milk cheese production, to investigate supply chain of cheese and to suggest improvements for minimizing the environmental impacts associated with this agri-food product. The functional unit chosen was 1 kg of sheep milk cheese. Modelling of the production process was performed based on real data obtained from a cheese production company in Romania. Two methods (CML and ReCiPe), included in GaBi software, were used for the environmental impact assessment. The following impacts: abiotic depletion potential elements, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, global warming potential, human toxicity potential (included in CML method) and climate change, fossil depletion, freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial acidification (included in ReCiPe method), were calculated. Results highlighted that energy production and diesel consumption are the main activities which contribute to the environmental impacts associated with cheese product. Emissions from diesel production and consumption contribute to global warming potential with 11.70% and 82.36%, respectively. Wastewater treatment mainly contributes to freshwater eutrophication with 43.58%, followed by raw milk production (37.52%), diesel production (12.34%) and others. The results of this study showed that the values for most impact categories decrease when the energy is obtained by renewable sources compared to the energy produced by conventional procedures. It was concluded that, in order to reduce the environmental impacts associated with sheep cheese production, the energy used in the process needs to be more environmentally friendly.

AB  - Parabronema skrjabini is a spirurid nematode occurring in the abomasum of ruminants. The parasite's developmental cycle involves insects such as Lyperosia titillans as the intermediate host; the adult worms may cause gastric congestion, ulceration of the mucosa, and reduced weight. The present study uses scanning electron microscopy to describe the morphological features of adult P. skrjabini obtained from the abomasum of sheep. Male and female worm length measured 15 and 36-38 mm, respectively. In both sexes, the mouth was widest dorsoventrally and had 2 lateral pseudolabia each with 2 cephalic papillae and an amphid. The anterior end had dorsal and ventral cuticular shields and 6 horseshoe-shaped cordons. At the anterior end, an excretory pore was located on the ventral side. In addition, 2 lateral ciliated cervical papillae and a single lateral ala were observed. In the female, the vulva was near the anterior end of the body, and the tail end was curved dorsally with a bluntly conical tip and 2 phasmids near its extremity. The male posterior end was coiled spirally, had small caudal alae, interrupted longitudinal ridges, 4 pairs of precloacal papillae, a double papilla near the cloaca, 2 pairs of postcloacal papillae, and 2 phasmids. The shape, size, and arrangement of precloacal and postcloacal papillae were different. Furthermore, 4 pairs of sessile papillae were seen near the phasmids, which were also different in shape and size, but similar in arrangement. The spicules were very unequal and dissimilar.

AB  - Simple Summary The Chinese tree shrew, a squirrel-like mammal, has been widely used as a laboratory animal in biological research. However, the low survival rate of the pups has seriously hindered the establishment of inbred lines of this species and further limited its wider use. We found a milk substitute appropriate for artificial rearing of Chinese tree shrew pups independent of any obvious adverse effects on their survival, health, and reproductive performance compared to those of the maternally reared pups. The successful optimization of a milk substitute for the artificial rearing of Chinese tree shrew pups may increase the availability of this experimental animal. The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has the potential to replace the use of non-human primates in biomedical research. To increase the availability of this species, we have undertaken the ambitious task of establishing inbred lines of the Chinese tree shrew; however, we have been hindered by a low survival rate of inbred pups. Here, we report our artificial rearing (AR) of Chinese tree shrew pups using four different milk substitutes: the formula described by Tsang and Collins (milk TC) and three commercially available milk substitutes intended for possums (milk A and milk C) and for guinea pigs (milk B). We compared the effects of these milk substitutes and maternal milk on the daily milk consumption, growth performance, and survival of the pups. We also assessed the life span and reproductive performance of the F-1 individuals given the best milk substitute as compared to the maternally reared (MR) pups. Milk B was found to be appropriate for AR. Pups fed with milk B had a high survival rate at the weaning age compared to those fed with the other milk substitutes. The AR pups fed with milk B had a life span similar to that of MR pups. AR females fed with milk B had an earlier age of the first reproduction, a larger number of litters, and a higher rate of survival of the offspring at the weaning age compared with the MR females. The successful optimization of a milk substitute for AR of Chinese tree shrew pups will undoubtedly facilitate the wide usage of this experimental animal.

AB  - Concerns regarding biological risk in environment have garnered increasing attention. Manure has been believed to be a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soil. Nevertheless, the profile of microbial contamination including ARGs, virulence factor genes (VFGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs) in different manure-amended soils remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted the systematic metagenomebased study to explore changes in resistome, VFGs and HBPs in soils treated by frequently-used manures. The results revealed that many manure-borne ARGs, VFGs, and HBPs could be spreaded into soils, and their diversity and abundance were significantly different among chemical fertilizer, pig manure, chicken manure, cow dung and silkworm excrement application. A total of 157 potential HBPs accounting about 1.33% of total bacteria were detected. The main ARGs transferred from manures to soil conferred resistance to vancomycin and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin. The series analysis revealed positive co-occurrence patterns of ARGsHBPs, VFGs-HBPs and ARGs-VFGs. Microbial contamination were more serious in pig manure and silkworm excrement sample than in the other samples, implying the usage of these two manures increased the risk of HBPs and dissemination of ARGs. This study confirmed the prevalence and discrepancy of resistome, VFGs and HBPs in different manure-amended soils.

AB  - Successful male reproduction depends on healthy testes. Autophagy has been confirmed to be active during many cellular events associated with the testes. It is not only crucial for testicular spermatogenesis but is also an essential regulatory mechanism for Sertoli cell (SCs) ectoplasmic specialization integrity and normal function of the blood-testis-barrier. Hypoxic stress induces oxidative damage, apoptosis, and autophagy, negatively affecting the male reproductive system. Cryptorchidism is a common condition associated with infertility. Recent studies have demonstrated that hypoxia-induced miRNAs and their transcription factors are highly expressed in the testicular tissue of infertile patients. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) is a heat-shock protein family member associated with cellular antioxidant defense and anti-apoptotic functions. The present study found that the HO1 mRNA and protein are up-regulated in yak cryptorchidism compared to normal testes. Next, we investigated the expression of HO1 in the SCs exposed to hypoxic stress and characterized the expression of key molecules involved in autophagy and apoptosis. The results showed that hypoxic stress induced the upregulation of autophagy of SCs. The down-regulation of HO1 using siRNA increases autophagy and decreases apoptosis, while the overexpression of HO1 attenuates autophagy and increases apoptosis. Furthermore, HO1 regulates autophagy and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Germplasm collection and conservation requires many efforts and resources. Core collection construction could both conserve genetic diversity and improve conservation efficiency. This study investigated the genetic diversity of tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] collected from four regions of Rucheng using 14 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and constructed a core collection set. A phylogenetic tree and population structure were conducted. A core set of 28 tea plants, approximately 10% of 279 tea plant individuals, was constructed to capture the samples' maximum genetic diversity. Compared to the original collection, the retention rates of Na, I, Ho, He, MAF, and PIC in the core collection were 106.4%, 118.8%, 103.1%, 112.2%, 68.1%, and 113.1%, respectively. The significance of core germplasm lies in identifying and conserving a set of representatives, diverse, and genetically advantageous genetic resources to support subsequent genetic improvement and breeding efforts. It could serve as a foundation for conserving valuable genetic materials and identifying loci associated with important horticultural traits, thereby empowering the development of new tea cultivars with enhanced efficiency. Furthermore, this approach contributes to optimizing breeding strategies, accelerating the selection process, and ensuring the sustainability of tea plant genetic resources for future generations.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FS) are one of the most common types of convulsive disorder of early childhood and they can be classified into simple and prolonged depending on the duration. Nowadays, simple FS have a good prognosis but there is controversy about the outcome of prolonged FS. In a previous work using an animal model of prolonged FS, we showed that hiperthermia-induced seizures (HIS) evoked fine motor coordination impairment and gait disturbances in adolescent rats in a process in which seemed to be involved modulation of the cerebellar adenosinergic system. The aim of the present work was to verify whether the effect was maintained in adulthood. To this end, neonatal rats (PD 12) were exposed to HIS and after 48 days (PD 60) they were assayed on balance beam and footprint tests. Animals were sacrificed 53 days after HIS and adenosine A1 and A2A receptor signalling pathways were studied in cerebellar plasma membranes by using radioligand binding assays and by measuring the activities of 5 '-nucleotidase and adenylyl cyclase. Results obtained revealed that adult rats exposed to HIS showed gait disturbances and motor impairments. Besides, animals exposed to hyperthermic insult showed an increase in adenosine A2A receptor functionality and 5 '-nucleotidase activity. Surprisingly, the functionality of the adenosine A1 receptor resulted significantly changed causing stimulation instead of inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These results showed that the effect of prolonged FS at the early age also persist in adulthood suggesting on must pay attention to FS in children.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis is a tool in assessing the maternal origin, phylogeny, and population structure of domestic animals. The Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pig is a creole breed that comes from the descendants of Iberian pig introduced to Ecuador by the Spanish conquerors. This creole population represents important reservoirs of genetic diversity that are very essential to preserve; however, the introduction of new breeds of pigs has displaced this creole pig from Ecuador to the background. The objective of the mitochondrial DNA analysis was to identify the Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pig populations, their origins, and their maternal lines. For this study, DNA samples from 34 Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pigs were used, with the animals belonging to seven rural regions of Ecuador. The haplogroup network suggested that the Pillareno creole pig population can be grouped into a single haplotype and that it belongs to the European pig clades. The genetic relationship between the Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole and the European pigs, particularly the Iberian pigs from Spain, can be used to establish of an official breeding program for the conservation and valuation of these creole populations, with this genetic mitochondrial analysis potentially providing a better approach for the rescue of the Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pig populations.
   Domestic pig breeds reached America on the second Columbus trip; from this date, Iberian pig genetic resources were disseminated throughout the continent, forming diverse creole breeds. These Ecuadorian Creole pigs are important for food production but have been genetically eroded since the introduction of transboundary breeds. In this study, we sought to characterize this erosion more thoroughly through mitochondrial DNA D-Loop analysis of Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pigs from seven regions of Ecuador. To allow comparison, we also included in our analysis sequences from wild species, commercial lines, and domestic pigs, which were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. Creole pigs' population showed overall moderate Hd values and low pi values, and a negative value of Tajima's D was observed. The greatest differentiation from the Ecuadorian Pillareno Creole pigs was observed between Asian wild and Asian domestic pigs. The haplotype analysis revealed three different phylogenetic clades (A, E I, and E II) and 65 haplotypes. Ecuadorian Creole populations were grouped into nine haplotypes for Clade E I and E II, which have not previously been reported for Creole Pillareno populations. Our analysis indicates that in the establishment of Creole Pillareno pigs, individuals most likely separated from the Asian pig population and appear to be genetically influenced by European and Iberian populations raised in Spain.

AB  - Limited studies have addressed the effects of multi-strain probiotics on gut microbiota and their influence on meat traits in pigs. Thus, this study investigated the impact of including a commercialized multi-strain probiotic product (SYN) (SYNLAC-LeanAd) into the dietary regimen of crossbred Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc (LYD) pigs. The study spanned a duration of 22 weeks, from weaning until slaughtering, during which the carcass traits, meat quality, and fecal microbiota profile were compared to those of pigs fed diets with or without an antibiotic growth promoter (AGP). The results demonstrated that the inclusion of SYN significantly improved meat quality parameters, including marbling score, tenderness, and intramuscular fat (p < 0.05) in comparison to pigs fed with AGP. The analysis of fecal microbiota revealed that SYN inclusion increased the populations of Clostridiaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae compared to the control and AGP groups. Additionally, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis predicted that the amino acid and lipid metabolism pathways were facilitated in pigs from the SYN group. These findings suggest that the inclusion of SYNLAC-LeanAd has the potential to positively impact the fecal microbiota profile, which in turn may lead to improved carcass traits and meat quality in commercial crossbred pigs.

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate two experimental diets based on olive cake supplied during the growth period as an alternative to the restricted feeding applied in the production of Iberian pigs fattened with acorn (Montanera system).
   Area of study: Southwest of Badajoz, Spain.
   Material and methods: 44 Iberian pigs were divided in three diet groups: 1) control (C) group (n=15), 2) dry olive pulp (DOP) group, fed a compound feed elaborated with olive pulp (n=14), and 3) wet crude olive cake (WCOC) group, fed a compound feed and olive cake silage supplied ad libitum (n=15). Subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken and backfat thickness and longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) area were measured. In addition, quality traits (intramuscular fat percentage, color, pigment content, water holding capacity and shear force) were measured in LTL. Backfat fatty acid profile and intramuscular fat were also analysed.
   Main results: Significant differences were observed between groups for most of the fatty acids in backfat at 95 kg but differences were of lower magnitude at 160 kg and affected only to C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C20:1 and Sigma SFA. Otherwise, lower values for red color and myoglobin content and higher for thawing water losses were observed for DOP pigs. The WCOC did not affect the analysed quality traits.
   Research highlights: Experimental diets did not have an important impact on growth, carcass composition or meat quality. Therefore, WCOC dietary treatment could be an interesting alternative that could reduce the undesirable effects of feed restriction.

AB  - Coordination of respiration and swallowing is critical for survival in infant mammals and changes throughout infant maturation. Infants show sensorimotor feeding responses to changes in physical properties of nipples. Commercial nipples are promoted as improving aerodigestive coordination. However, it is unknown how nipple properties influence coordination of respiration and swallowing. Furthermore, how infant-nipple interactions change throughout maturation is not well understood. We designed and manufactured four silicone nipples of the same shape that varied in two parameters: nipple opening diameter and nipple stiffness. We used our validated infant pig model to test the impact of nipple parameters on aerodigestive coordination throughout ontogeny. We recorded videofluoroscopy and simultaneous chest plethysmography on six infant pigs at age 7 and 17 days when feeding on each of the four nipples presented in a randomized order. We measured the time between a swallow and the closest inspiration, and the length of the respiratory cycles during feeding. Larger nipple opening diameter resulted in shorter delay between swallow and onset of inspiration regardless of stiffness or pig age. In young pigs, respiratory cycle length was shorter when feeding on nipples with large diameter openings. In older pigs, there was a nipple-stiffness interaction such that respiratory cycle length increased with opening diameter in soft nipples but decreased with opening diameter in hard nipples. Nipple opening diameter has a pervasive effect on swallow-breathing coordination in freely feeding infants, but infant maturation modifies responses to nipple properties.

AB  - Learning and decision-making are greatly influenced by context. When navigating a complex social world, individuals must quickly ascertain where to gain important resources and which group members are useful sources of such information. Such dynamic behavioural processes require neural mechanisms that are flexible across contexts. Here we examine how the social context influences the learning response during a cue discrimination task and the neural activity patterns that underlie acquisition of this novel information. Using the cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we show that learning of the task is faster in social groups than in a non-social context. We quantify the neural activity patterns by examining the expression of Fos, an immediate-early gene, across brain regions known to play a role in social behaviour and learning (such as the putative teleost homologues of the mammalian hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and medial amygdala/BNST complex). We find that neural activity patterns differ between social and non-social contexts. Taken together, our results suggest that while the same brain regions may be involved in the learning of a cue association, the activity in each region reflects an individual's social context.

AB  - A comprehensive stress assessment is vital in understanding the impact of the pre-slaughter procedure on animal welfare. The transportation and handling process was commonly reported to cause stress in animals. This research utilises electroencephalography (EEG) as an alternative stress indicator to nonpainful acute stress measurement. EEG has been proved to be instantaneous and sensitive with specific results. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the stress level of goats subjected to two different transportation duration and the effect of lairage based on their EEG activities and blood parameters changes. Eighteen adult male goats were divided into two transportation stress groups based on the transport duration: the two-hour (TS2) and six-hour (TS6) groups. Then, each group was then again divided into three smaller groups according to the lairage duration, which was three-hour (L3), sixhour (L6), and overnight (L12) groups. Blood was sampled before transport, after transport, and during slaughter while EEG was recorded before transport, after transport, after lairage, and during slaughter. Results revealed that there was a significant decrease in beta wave activity compared to baseline in TS2 goats (P < 0.05) after transportation, whereas no significant difference was detected in the TS6 goats. At the same time, goats from the TS2 group showed increase in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to that in TS6 goats. Together with the observed cortisol concentration, these findings showed that the TS6 goats were fully adapted to the transportation stress while the TS2 goats were still under stress. As for the lairage duration, it was observed that the TS2L3 goats showed lower EEG activities than the values obtained after two-hour transportation, while lower EEG activities were found from the TS6L6 goats after six-hour transportation. Therefore, it can be concluded that threehour lairage was adequate to lower the impact of two hours transportation stress, whereas six-hour lairage was required to reduce the impact of six hours transportation stress. Finally, it was also found that the TS6L3, TS6L6, and TS6L12 groups took a long time to die after slaughter than the TS2L3, TS2L6, and TS2L12 goats based on the time their EEG activity reached isoelectric.

AB  - Previous studies showed that aphid performance was compromised on Brassica nigra infected by root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans, Pp), but less, or positively influenced by root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) infection. These experiments were on single-species nematode infections, but roots can be infected naturally with several nematode species simultaneously. We performed greenhouse assays to assess the effects of single [Meloidogyne incognita (Mi) or Pp] and concurrent (MP) nematode infections on aphid performance. Using targeted and untargeted profiling of leaf and phloem metabolomes, we examined how single and concurrent nematode infections affect shoot metabolomes, and elucidated the possible consequences for aphid performance. We found that the metabolic response to double-infection is different from that to single-species infections. Moreover, Mi and Pp infections triggered discrete changes in B. nigra leaf and phloem metabolic profiles. Both Pp and MP infections reduced aphid survival, suggesting that the biological effect could primarily be dominated by Pp-induced changes. This concurred with increased indole glucosinolates and hydroxycinnamic acid levels in the leaves, in particular the putative involvement of salicylic acid-2-O-beta-d-glucoside. This study provides evidence that concurrent infection by different nematode species, as is common in natural environments, is associated with distinct changes in aboveground plant metabolomes, which are linked to differences in the survival of an aboveground herbivore.
   Concurrent infection of Brassica nigra by two different nematode species led to distinct changes in leaf and phloem metabolomes, which was linked to differences in aphid survival.

AB  - The composting process is important in the recycling of organic wastes produced in agriculture, food, and municipal waste management. This study explored the suitability of using waste vinegar residue (WVR) as an amendment in poultry litter (PL) composting. Four treatments, including poultry litter (CK), poultry litter + vinegar residue (VR), poultry litter + vinegar residue + lime (VR _ Ca) and poultry litter + vinegar residue + biochar (VR_B), were conducted. During a 42-day composting period, the dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, as well as the physicochemical properties and abundances of the bacteria and fungi of the feedstock were tracked to examine the potential barriers in the co-composting of WVR and PL. Compared to those of the CK, using a WVR amendment lowered the pH, increased the electrical conductivity significantly at the early stage, resulted in a strong inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth and delayed the thermophilic period of poultry litter composting while significantly reducing NH3 and N2O and GHG (CO2-e) emissions. A preadjustment of the WVR with alkaline biochar or lime lengthened the thermophilic period and increased the germination index (GI) by alleviating the inhibitory effect of the WVR on bacterial and fungal growth during composting. However, such preadjustment might reduce the mitigation effect on NH3. In conclusion, WVR can be recycled through co-composting with poultry litter, and the additional mitigation of N losses and N conservation can be achieved without halting compost quality.

AB  - The atmospheric increase in N2O is mainly derived from N fertilisation in agriculture, and improved emission estimates are needed for effective mitigation. This study presents first estimates of country-specific N2O emissions from synthetic and liquid organic fertilisers in Denmark. Representative crop rotations were established in four locations across Denmark to provide a realistic context for the estimation of N2O emissions, i.e., a dairy farm rotation in Western Denmark, dairy and pig farm rotations in Southwestern Denmark, and an arable rotation in Eastern Denmark. The four sites were light-textured and typical for Northern Europe, whereas rainfall varied considerably among sites and years. A randomised block design was used, and all crops were represented in triplicate each year with monitoring of N2O emissions between April 2020 and March 2022. Spring barley was part of all rotations, and here three synthetic fertilisers (NS, NPK and urea ammonium nitrate) and eight organic fertilisers (three cattle slurries, three pig slurries and two digestates) were applied in 1 m2 plots at either two or four sites in order to compare N2O emissions from the same N fertiliser materials under contrasting site conditions. Identical methodologies for management, fertiliser application, and N2O measurement and flux calculation, were used at all sites to ensure comparability. Manually operated chambers were used for N2O flux measurements. The continuous monitoring indicated a strong seasonal pattern across all four sites with the main part of N2O emissions during spring. The side-by-side comparison of several N sources at four sites in two years showed for synthetic fertilisers an average N2O emission factor for the spring period of 0.15% (95% C.I.-0.17 to 0.37%, n = 16), and for liquid organic fertilisers (pig and cattly slurries, and digestates) an average of 1.02% (95% C.I. 0.75 - 1.30%, n = 44). The higher N2O emissions from organic fertilisers, which was significant at each of the four sites, is in opposition to new N2O emission factors recently proposed in a refinement of the IPCC methodology for national inventories. The conflicting results are discussed with reference to region-specific site conditions and fertiliser types, and in particular the predominance of soils with a low clay content, and of liquid manure management, may explain the deviations from global estimates. A comparison of annual and spring N2O emissions indicated a difference in the order of 0.1 - 0.2% of the N input (n = 8), and the feasibility of estimating N2O emission factors based on emissions during the growing season only is discussed.

AB  - Pig manure could be an effective fertilizer source for soil, but with high concentrations of xic elements. It has been shown that the pyrolysis method could largely reduce the environmental risk of pig manure. However, the comprehensive analysis of both toxic metals immobilization effect and environmental risk of pig manure biochar applied as a soil amendment is rarely addressed. To address the knowledge gap, this study was carried out with pig manure (PM) and pig manure biochar (PMB). The PM was pyrolyzed at 450 degrees C and 700 degrees C, the corresponding biochar was abbreviated as PMB450 and PMB700, respectively. The PM and PMB were applied in a pot experiment growing Chinese cabbage (Brassica rape L. ssp. Pekinensis) with clay-loam paddy soil. The application rates of PM were set at 0.5% (S), 2% (L), 4% (M) and 6% (H). With the equivalent mass principle, PMB450 and PMB700 were applied at 0.23% (S), 0.92% (L), 1.84% (M), 2.76% (H), and 0.192% (S), 0.7% (L), 1.4% (M), 2.1% (H), respectively. Parameters of Chinese cabbage biomass and quality, total and available concentrations of toxic metals in soil, and soil chemical properties were systemically measured. The main results of this study showed that compared with PM, PMB700 was more effective than PMB450, which induced the highest reductions of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd contents in cabbage by 62.6%, 73.0%, 43.9%, and 74.3%, respectively. Both PM and PMB increased the total contents of metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd) in soil, and PMB decreased the mobility of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd at high application rates (>= 2%). Treatment with H-PMB700 reduced CaCl2 extractable Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd by 70.0%, 71.6%, 23.3%, and 15.9%, respectively. For Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd fractions with BCR extraction, PMB treatments, especially PMB700, were more effective than PM in decreasing the available fractions (F1 +F2 +F3) at high application rates (>= 2%). Overall, pyrolysis with high temperature (e.g., 700 degrees C) could significantly stabilize the toxic elements in PM and enhance PM's effect on toxic metals immobilization. The marked effects of PMB700 on toxic metal immobilization and cabbage quality improvement might be attributed to high ash contents and liming effect.

AB  - The operation of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) has influenced the wetland ecosystems downstream, thereby affecting the distribution of habitats suitable for waterbirds. However, dynamic studies on habitat distribution under different water regimes are lacking. Here, using data from three successive wintering periods representing three typical water regimes, we modelled and mapped the habitat suitability of three waterbird groups in Dongting Lake, which is the first river-connected lake downstream of the TGP, and a crucial wintering ground for waterbirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The results showed that the spatial pattern of habitat suitability varied among the wintering periods and waterbird groups. The analysis estimated the largest suitable habitat area for the herbivorous/tuber-eating group (HTG) and the insectivorous waterbird group (ING) under a normal water recession pattern, whereas early water recession had a more adverse effect. The suitable habitat area for the piscivorous/omnivorous group (POG) was higher under late water recession than under normal conditions. The ING was the most affected by hydrological changes among the three waterbird groups. Further, we identified the key conservation and potential restoration habitats. The HTG exhibited the largest key con-servation habitat area compared to the other two groups, while the ING showed a potential restoration habitat area larger than its key conservation habitat area, indicating its sensitivity to environmental changes. The optimal inundation durations from September 1 to January 20 for HTG, ING and POG were 52 & PLUSMN; 7 d, 68 & PLUSMN; 18 d, and 132 & PLUSMN; 22 d, respectively. Therefore, the water recession starting in mid-October may be favourable for waterbirds in Dongting Lake. Altogether, our results can be used as guidance for prioritising certain management actions for waterbird conservation. Moreover, our study highlighted the importance of considering habitat spatiotemporal variation in highly dynamic wetlands when implementing management practices.

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been proven to produce analgesia, therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of EA on alfaxalone-based TIVA in goats. In this current study, the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone was determined in a combination with EA. The findings found that EA reduces the alfaxalone MIR required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to standardized noxious. In conclusion, EA provided analgesia, reduced the MIR of alfaxalone-based IV anesthesia, and thereby alleviated the adverse cardiorespiratory effects associated with alfaxalone anesthesia in goats.Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is increasingly used in companion animals. The effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on alfaxalone-based TIVA has not been previously reported in goats. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to standardized noxious stimulation during its combination with EA in goats. Twelve clinically healthy goats weighing 18.5 & PLUSMN; 2 kg were randomly assigned to two groups (six goats/group). Alfaxalone alone (ALF group) and alfaxalone combined with EA (EA-ALF group). In the EA-ALF, alfaxalone was administered 30 min after EA stimulation. For induction of anesthesia, a bolus of alfaxalone was given at 3 mg/kg IV, and an infusion dose of 9.6 mg/kg/h was initially set for maintenance. The MIR of alfaxalone in both groups was determined by testing for responses to stimulation (clamping on a digit with Vulsellum forceps) at 10-min intervals after induction of anesthesia till the entire period of the experiment. Cardiopulmonary parameters and nociceptive threshold were measured throughout anesthesia. The median alfaxalone MIR was significantly lower in the EA-ALF group than the ALF group [9 (4.8-9.6) and 12 (11.4-18)], respectively; p = 0.0035). In the ALF group, goats anesthetized with MIR showed a significant increase in heart rate and cardiac output (p < 0.0001 and 0.0312, respectively), and decrease in respiratory rate (p < 0.0001), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (p = 0.0081), and rectal temperature (p = 0.0046) compared with those in the EA-ALF. Additionally, goats in the EA-ALF showed a higher nociceptive threshold than those in the ALF group (p < 0.0001). EA provided analgesia, reduced the MIR of alfaxalone-based IV anesthesia and thereby alleviated the adverse cardiorespiratory effects associated with alfaxalone anesthesia in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary
   A buffalo breeding farm was selected to study the growth performance of Swamp and Murrah crossbred buffaloes. The farm was practicing extensive grazing system without supplementation since 2010 to 2011. In early 2012, the farm had implemented a new intervention to improve the growth performance via improving the feed and the feeding management. Farm records between 2010 to 2015 were analyzed for growth performance and partial budget analysis. So far, there is no comparative study done between Swamp and Murrah crossbred buffaloes in Malaysia. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to study the differences in the biological and economical performances between Swamp and crossbred buffaloes in Malaysia. With a new intervention, a significant improvement was reported of the number of calves born, average birth weight, and reduced percentage of calf mortality rate, calving interval, and weaning age. Crossbred buffalo showed dominance in biological performance in terms of higher pre- and post-weaning daily weight gain and taking a shorter period to achieve market and breeding weight compared to Swamp buffaloes. Thus, reared Murrah crossbred buffaloes with new intervention management would give a farmer a higher profit return. However, with reared Swamp, the farmer potentially conserves the local indigenous breed of Swamp buffalo.
   This study was conducted to compare the growth and economic performances between Swamp and Murrah crossbred buffaloes. The records of 108 Swamp and 276 Murrah crossbred buffaloes born between January 2010 and December 2015 were used in this study. The farm was practicing an extensive grazing system without supplementation from January 2010 to December 2011 (pre-intervention) and a new implementation of supplement in the feeding regime from January 2012 to December 2015 (post-intervention). The birth, weaning, and body weight at three monthly intervals, number of calves born, and mortality rate of calves at different years and during pre- and post-intervention were analyzed using a general linear model procedure. The interventions in 2012 had a positive effect on increasing the number of calves born for both breeds, average birth weight, economic performance, and reduce mortality calf rate. As a result, the birth weight of Murrah crossbred buffaloes was higher (36.63 +/- 0.50 kg) than Swamp buffaloes (34.69 +/- 0.40 kg) (p < 0.05). The average pre-weaning daily weight gain for Swamp and Murrah crossbred buffaloes was 0.73 and 0.98 kg/day (p < 0.05), while the average post-weaning daily weight gain was 0.39 and 0.44 kg/day, respectively (p < 0.05). The Swamp and Murrah crossbred buffaloes achieved the targeted market weight of 250 kg at 18 and 15 months old, respectively, while the targeted breeding weight of 385 kg was achieved at 30 and 26 months old, respectively. In this farm, on average a total of 64 calves were born yearly, with the ratio number of born calves per number of mated dams recorded higher in Murrah crossbred buffaloes as compared to Swamp buffalo (0.64 vs. 0.37) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the average number of calves born in the post-intervention period (January 2012-December 2015) was significantly higher than in the pre-intervention period (January 2010-December 2011), respectively (Swamp: 23 vs. 8 and Murrah crossbred: 53 vs. 31, respectively) (p < 0.05). Partial budget method was used to estimate the net gain or loss between the two breeds. The average annual revenue was 2304.14 MYR (566.13 USD) for Swamp buffaloes and 4531.50 MYR (1113.
   39 USD) for Murrah crossbred buffaloes. The average annual cost saving was 340.02 MYR (83.54 USD) for Swamp and 215.75 MYR (53.01 USD) for Murrah crossbred buffaloes. On the other hand, annual added cost was 84.95 MYR (20.87 USD) for Swamp and 96.76 MYR (23.77 USD) for Murrah crossbred buffaloes. Therefore, the annual net benefit was 2559.21 MYR (628.80 USD) for Swamp and 4650.49 MYR (1142.63 USD) for Murrah crossbred buffaloes. As a conclusion, this study had shown that the higher average daily weight gain contributes to better cost savings, as shown by the crossbred buffaloes.

AB  - Anthracnose, a fungal disease harming fruit trees and crops, poses a threat to agriculture. Traditional chemical pesticides face issues like environmental pollution and resistance. A strategy combining low-toxicity chemicals with biopesticides is proposed to enhance disease control while reducing chemical use. Our study found that mixing validamycin A (VMA) and Bacillus velezensis TCS001 effectively controlled anthracnose in Camellia oleifera. The combination increased antifungal efficacy by 65.62% over VMA alone and 18.83% over TCS001 alone. It caused pathogen deformities and loss of pathogenicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the mix affected the pathogen's metabolism and redox processes, particularly impacting cellular membrane functions and inducing apoptosis via glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. In vivo tests showed the treatment activated C. oleifera's disease resistance, with a 161.72% increase in polyphenol oxidase concentration in treated plants. This research offers insights into VMA and TCS001's mechanisms against anthracnose, supporting sustainable forestry and national edible oil security.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals. The development of in vitro cellular models from naturally susceptible species like humans or ruminants can potentially make a great contribution to the study of many aspects of these diseases, including the ability of prions to infect and replicate in cells and therapeutics. Our study shows for the first time how ovine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and their neural-like progeny are able to react to scrapie prion infection in vitro and assesses the effects of this infection on cell viability and proliferation. Finally, we observe that the differentiation of ovine mesenchymal stem cells into neuron-like cells makes them more permissive to prion infection.
   Scrapie is a prion disease affecting sheep and goats and it is considered a prototype of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as candidates for developing in vitro models of prion diseases. Murine MSCs are able to propagate prions after previous mouse-adaptation of prion strains and, although ovine MSCs express the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), their susceptibility to prion infection has never been investigated. Here, we analyze the potential of ovine bone marrow-derived MSCs (oBM-MSCs), in growth and neurogenic conditions, to be infected by natural scrapie and propagate prion particles (PrPSc) in vitro, as well as the effect of this infection on cell viability and proliferation. Cultures were kept for 48-72 h in contact with homogenates of central nervous system (CNS) samples from scrapie or control sheep. In growth conditions, oBM-MSCs initially maintained detectable levels of PrPSc post-inoculation, as determined by Western blotting and ELISA. However, the PrPSc signal weakened and was lost over time. oBM-MSCs infected with scrapie displayed lower cell doubling and higher doubling times than those infected with control inocula. On the other hand, in neurogenic conditions, oBM-MSCs not only maintained detectable levels of PrPSc post-inoculation, as determined by ELISA, but this PrPSc signal also increased progressively over time. Finally, inoculation with CNS extracts seems to induce the proliferation of oBM-MSCs in both growth and neurogenic conditions. Our results suggest that oBM-MSCs respond to prion infection by decreasing their proliferation capacity and thus might not be permissive to prion replication, whereas ovine MSC-derived neuron-like cells seem to maintain and replicate PrPSc.

AB  - The spatial availability of social resources is speculated to structure animal movement decisions, but the effects of social resources on animal movements are difficult to identify because social resources are rarely measured. Here, we assessed whether varying availability of a key social resource-access to receptive mates-produces predictable changes in movement decisions among bighorn sheep in Nevada, the United States. We compared the probability that males made long-distance 'foray' movements, a critical driver of connectivity, across three ecoregions with varying temporal duration of a socially mediated factor, breeding season. We used a hidden Markov model to identify foray events and then quantified the effects of social covariates on the probability of foray using a discrete choice model. We found that males engaged in forays at higher rates when the breeding season was short, suggesting that males were most responsive to the social resource when its existence was short lived. During the breeding season, males altered their response to social covariates, relative to the non-breeding season, though patterns varied, and age was associated with increased foray probability. Our results suggest that animals respond to the temporal availability of social resources when making the long-distance movements that drive connectivity.

AB  - Various pharmaceuticals are essential for livestock farming, but some are highly toxic to aquatic life if they reach surface water bodies. Mediterranean Climate is characterized by dry summers followed by intense autumn storms. We studied the effect of these climatic conditions on the risk of pharmaceutical residues transfer to streams at the catchment-scale. Pharmaceutical products routinely used in the study area, as well as their application frequency and season, were identified through interviews with farmers. As a proof a concept, three veterinary pharmaceuticals (Fenbendazole (FBZ), Mebendazole (MBZ) and Ivermectin (IVM)) were chosen as model chemicals based on their relatively high usage, their specificity to represent different types of livestock (swine, sheep and cattle), and their ability to be analyzed using the same analytical method. Stream water was analyzed during low flow periods and at high frequency (up to 2 h(-1)) during flood events. The selected veterinary pharmaceuticals were not detected during low flow, but FBZ and MBZ reached high concentrations for short periods during floods. Due to the event-driven nature of their transfer, a significant load of veterinary pharmaceuticals can reach the river and cause temporary but significant degradation of water quality (e.g. for FBZ, the water concentration reached up to 355 times the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC)). This indicates that special care should be taken to avoid keeping freshly treated livestock on pastures that may become hydrologically connected under wet conditions. In addition, it suggests that low-frequency monitoring is not sufficient to detect those high concentration levels that exist during very short periods.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat smallholdings are common in both rural and urban areas of Malawi, and are kept as a food source and as investments to improve livelihoods. However, goats are known to forage on indigestible items that can negatively impact health and lead to a loss of productive performance. To date, no studies have estimated the prevalence of pollution among Malawi goats despite issues with waste management. To this end, we sought to survey the frequency of plastic and other indigestible foreign bodies among goats slaughtered by informal market butcher stands in five districts spanning Malawi. Most of the butchers surveyed identified plastic during slaughter (80%) while almost half (45.3%) identified other indigestible objects (hardware). Plastic was found by butchers in all districts and across rural and urban settings. While being less common than plastic, the hardware noted by butchers included sharps such as needles and bicycle spokes. When purchasing, butchers do consider animal health important, but 70.7% consider injury status as less or not important. Overall, this study highlights the issues of pollution among smallholder goats and demonstrates the need for further study to address the impacts of pollution on animal health and knock-on impacts on smallholder livelihoods.Abstract Smallholder goat production plays a major role in rural livelihoods and food security in Malawi, but suffers from drastic and unpredictable production losses. While goat production is closely linked to small-scale local markets for slaughter and butchering, the perspectives of butchers and their potential as a source of animal health information are largely untapped. Butchers can provide insights into goat health status at slaughter as well as issues that go unseen before slaughter, such as the presence of indigestible foreign bodies (IFBs). IFBs include solid materials such as plastics and hardware (metals, stones, and other hard objects) that cause foreign body syndrome and can lead to impaction, oedema, malnutrition, and death. To estimate the presence of IFBs, 150 market stand butchers were surveyed across five districts in Malawi, focusing on a distinction between hardware and single-use plastics, which are still widely present in Malawi despite bans on production. Most butchers found plastic IFBs (80.7%), with over half (56.7%) reporting plastic IFBs recently among the past five slaughters. Hardware IFBs were less common, reported by 45.3% of butchers. While some butchers commented on the impact of IFBs on meat quality metrics ex-post, the majority observed no differences. While butchers unanimously considered health to be an important characteristic when sourcing goats, 70.7% consider injury status to be less important or not important.

AB  - For agriculturally important plants, pollination and herbivory are 2 ecological factors that play into the success of crop yields. Each is also important in natural environments where invasive plants and their effect on species interactions may alter the native ecology. The California Wild Radish (Raphanus sativus x raphanistrum), a hybrid derived from an agriculturally important crop and a nonnative cultivar, is common in California. Remarkably, it has recently replaced wild populations of both progenitor species. Experiments on phenotypic variation for petal color and antiherbivore defenses suggest both pairs of polymorphisms are maintained as a result of pollinator- and herbivore-mediated natural selection. This species provides an opportunity to understand how natural selection shapes the evolution of ecologically important traits when traits are constrained by 2 opposing forces. Here we provide the genome assembly of the California Wild Radish displaying improvement to currently existing genomes for agronomically important crucifers. This genome sequence provides the tools to dissect the genomic architecture of traits related to herbivory and pollination using natural variation in the wild as well as the ability to infer demographic and selective history in the context of hybridization. Study systems like these will improve our understanding and predictions of evolutionary change for correlated traits.

AB  - Most research on the effects of artificial light at night (ALAN) on animal behaviour focuses on nocturnal species. In addition, there are few studies on the effects of ALAN on the feeding behaviour of herbivores or how such behavioural changes affect herbivore performance. In this study, we tested whether ALAN has direct effects on the feeding frequency and performance of the larvae of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a species in which adults are diurnal but larvae exhibit little diel rhythm in feeding activity. We also tested for effects of ALAN on the growth, nutritional quality, or anti-herbivore defences of this herbivore's primary host plant in North America, common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). There was no evidence that ALAN affected the growth, nutritional quality or defensive traits of the host plant. However, at night, the feeding frequency of larvae exposed to ALAN was two times higher than in larvae that were not exposed to ALAN. Despite this effect on feeding frequency, ALAN had no significant effects on larval development time (days from second instar to pupation) or pupal mass. Our study highlights that ALAN can have strong impacts on the feeding activity patterns of herbivorous insects and that these impacts are not limited to nocturnal species.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases (TBDs), including Lyme disease (LD), have become of great concern in the United States due to their impacts on individuals, communities, local businesses, and the national economy. Methods to mitigate the impact of TBDs often target tick habitat and wildlife hosts, yet the effectiveness of these methods is contingent on large-scale adoption by private woodland owners (PWOs) and agencies. As research has shown, adaptive land management methods may have a significative impact on LD mitigation in forest landscapes. Therefore, understanding how PWOs' current and future decisions on land management methods may contribute to reducing human exposure to TBDs is critical. In this paper we characterize the factors influencing PWOs' land management decisions and develop an improved understanding of their perception of LD as it relates to land management. We synthesize this information by identifying opportunities for and barriers against the adoption of adaptive land management methods among PWOs. We applied a quantitative survey to 355 PWOs from the state of Maine in fall of 2019 and spring of 2020. Our analysis sought to explore the relationships between PWOs' individual characteristics and histories, and their knowledge, experience, perceptions, attitudes and sources of information regarding ticks and LD. Our findings show that the diversity of PWOs' attitudes, perceptions of, and land management objectives requires to be approached in tandem. PWOs' orientations toward LD management methods are significantly associated with several socio-demographic and land-ownership characteristics, such as gender, education background, size of woodlot and frequency of engagement in land management, supporting the inclusion of demographic data in future PWO behavior research. In this paper we discuss how sociodemographic characteristics alongside PWOs' attitudes, perceptions of and land management objectives can be considered by agencies interested in promoting land management methods through targeted outreach and educational campaigns.

AB  - Simple Summary This study examined how different types of human-animal interactions affect the welfare of nursery pigs, focusing on both their behavior and cardiac activity. Thirty-six pigs were divided into three groups based on whether they experienced positive, minimal, or rough human handling over a six-week period. Each pig was then individually tested in an experimental setting with the handler. Pigs exposed to negative handling presented more fear-related behaviors, spent less time in contact, and received fewer strokes than those handled positively. They also exhibited physiological responses indicating greater stress. Conversely, pigs handled gently displayed more affiliative behaviors and greater parasympathetic activation, potentially indicating a positive emotional state. Minimally handled pigs presented some behavioral similarities to gently handled pigs, but physiological data indicated a more positive interaction for gently handled pigs. These results emphasize how the quality of human-animal relationships impacts pigs' affective state and welfare.Abstract The human-animal relationship is crucial for animal welfare. Gentle handling enhances pigs' comfort while rough handling causes fear and stress. This study examined how different human-animal relationship qualities affect the behavior and heart rate variability (linear and non-linear parameters) of 36 nursery pigs. Over six weeks, pigs experienced positive (n = 12), minimal (n = 12), or negative (n = 12) human handling. Their responses to handlers were then assessed in an experimental arena with four phases: habituation, exposure to the handler standing and sitting, and forced interaction. Pigs subjected to negative handling exhibited increased fear-related behaviors, spending less time in contact with the handler. They also exhibited heightened stress responses, with greater LF/HF ratio and Lmean values compared with positively handled pigs. Conversely, gently handled pigs displayed affiliative behaviors, accepting more strokes, and higher parasympathetic activation, indicated by greater RMSSD/SDNN and SampEn values, suggesting a more positive affective state. Minimally handled pigs exhibited some behavioral similarities to gently handled pigs, although physiological data indicated that the interaction was likely more rewarding for the gently handled pigs. These results emphasize the impact of human-animal relationships on pig welfare and highlight the value of incorporating non-linear heart rate variability parameters in such evaluations.

AB  - Crambe sventenii Pett. ex Bramwell & Sunding and Pleudia herbanica (A.Santos & M.Fern & aacute;ndez) M.Will, N.Schmalz & Class.-Bockh. are two single-island endemic species from Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), inhabiting the same areas and similar habitats. They are under the "Critically Endangered" category due to historical herbivore pressure, mainly goats, leading to habitat fragmentation and poor population recruitment. The main aim of our study was to provide insights into the conservation genetics and habitat suitability of these two species. For this purpose, we sampled all known populations on the island and developed two new sets of microsatellite markers. Moreover, to assist restoration plans, we performed species distribution models to determine the most suitable areas for reintroduction. While Crambe sventenii is highly fragmented, with low genetic diversity indices in some populations, Pleudia herbanica's genetic structure is quite homogeneous, grouped in three main regions, with signs of inbreeding and an overall low genetic diversity. Both species could present moderate to high levels of autogamy. Our findings can provide guidance to local governments regarding conservation actions to be implemented in the field, like the identification of propagule sources and new suitable areas for restoration.

AB  - Resistance of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum 'Mertelik' to Cameraria ohridella was proven in the trial under semi-field conditions. Seedlings of vulnerable and resistant trees were grown together in rearing cages and were exposed to the strong attack from C. ohridella larvae. Significant differences in leaflet injuries were observed between susceptible and insect-resistant trees. Variety 'Mertelik' showed almost none or very small damages compared to high defoliation level in case of standard trees. The results confirmed that this resistant clone could be suitable for use under field conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAlthough nonfat milk has been used worldwide in the industrial dairy process, little is known about the effects of fat separation during the manufacturing process on skim milk's structural and digestive properties. This study investigated the effects of the manufacturing process on the structure and in vitro digestion properties of skim goat milk, particularly emphasizing fat separation. RESULTSChanges in the surface charge and hydrophobicity of milk proteins caused by fat separation resulted in oxidation and aggregation in the subsequent homogenization, heat and spray-drying processing, which affected its digestibility. Compared with separation by dish separator (DS), skim milk after tubular centrifugal separation (CS) showed a higher initial and final digestibility. The CS samples also had a lower surface hydrophobicity level and higher free sulfhydryl content, zeta-potential, and average particle size (P < 0.05). Goat milk protein after CS was more readily oxidized and aggregated during the subsequent homogenization and heat treatment, as evidenced by the higher carbonyl content and particle size. Centrifugal separation also converted more beta-sheets to alpha-helices, thus promoting the aggregation of oxidized skim milk protein. CONCLUSIONThe skim milk after CS and DS demonstrated different structural and digestive properties. Skim goat milk products after CS were more susceptible to oxidant-induced protein structural changes, resulting in higher protein digestibility. These findings provide insights into the mechanism involved in the control of gastric digestion of skim milk during manufacturing process. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Animal density is a fundamental parameter in ecology and conservation, and yet it has remained difficult to measure. For terrestrial mammals and birds, camera-traps have dramatically improved our ability to collect systematic data across a large number of species, but density estimation (except for species with natural marks) is still faced with statistical and logistical hurdles, including the requirement for auxiliary data and large sample sizes, and an inability to incorporate covariates. To fill this gap in the camera-trapper's statistical toolbox, we extended the existing Random Encounter Model (REM) to the multi-species case in a Bayesian framework. This multi-species REM can incorporate covariates and provides parameter estimates for even the rarest species. As input to the model, we used information directly available in the camera-trap data. The model outputs posterior distributions for the REM parameters-movement speed, activity level, the effective angle and radius of the camera-trap detection zone, and density-for each species. We applied this model to an existing dataset for 35 species in Borneo, collected across old-growth and logged forest. Here, we added animal position data derived from the image sequences in order to estimate the speed and detection zone parameters. The model revealed a decrease in movement speeds, and therefore day-range, across the species community in logged compared to old-growth forest, whilst activity levels showed no consistent trend. Detection zones were shorter, but of similar width, in logged compared to old-growth forest. Overall, animal density was lower in logged forest, even though most species individually occurred at higher density in logged forest. However, the biomass per unit area was substantially higher in logged compared to old-growth forest, particularly among herbivores and omnivores, likely because of increased resource availability at ground level. We also included body mass as a variable in the model, revealing that larger-bodied species were more active, had more variable speeds, and had larger detection zones. Caution is warranted when estimating density for semi-arboreal and fossorial species using camera-traps, and more extensive testing of assumptions is recommended. Nonetheless, we anticipate that multi-species density estimation could have very broad application.

AB  - Migratory, long-lived animals are an important focus for life-history theory because they manifest extreme trade-offs in life-history traits: delayed maturity, low fecundity, variable recruitment rates, long generation times, and vital rates that respond to variation across environments. Galapagos tortoises are an iconic example: they are long-lived, migrate seasonally, face multiple anthropogenic threats, and have cryptic early life-history stages for which vital rates are unknown. From 2012 to 2021, we studied the reproductive ecology of two species of Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis porteri and C. donfaustoi) along elevation gradients that coincided with substantial changes in climate and vegetation productivity. Specifically, we (1) measured the body and reproductive condition of 166 adult females, (2) tracked the movements of 33 adult females using global positioning system telemetry, and monitored their body condition seasonally, (3) recorded nest temperatures, clutch characteristics, and egg survival from 107 nests, and (4) used radiotelemetry to monitor growth, survival, and movements of 104 hatchlings. We also monitored temperature and rainfall from field sites, and remotely sensed primary productivity along the elevation gradient. Our study showed that environmental variability, mediated by elevation, influenced vital rates of giant tortoises, specifically egg production by adult females and juvenile recruitment. Adult females were either elevational migrants or year-round lowland residents. Migrants had higher body condition than residents, and body condition was positively correlated with the probability of being gravid. Nests occurred in the hottest, driest parts of the tortoise's range, between 6 and 165 m elevation. Clutch size increased with elevation, whereas egg survival decreased. Hatchling survival and growth were highest at intermediate elevations. Hatchlings dispersed rapidly to 100-750 m from their nests before becoming sedentary (ranging over <0.2 ha). Predicted future climates may impact the relationships between elevation and vital rates of Galapagos tortoises and other species living across elevation gradients. Resilience will be maximized by ensuring the connectivity of foraging and reproductive areas within the current and possible future elevational ranges of these species.

AB  - The present work reports on new records of the flat-headed or Cameroon cusimanse (Crossarchus platycephalus) obtained from camera trap surveys carried out between 2021 and 2023 in central and northwestern Gabon. These records-in the form of high-definition videos-extend the southern limit of the species' known range by 172 km, as well as provide additional evidence of group living and co-occurrence with the blue duiker (Philantomba monticola) and moustached guenon (Cercopithecus cephus). These findings suggest that C. platycephalus may be more widespread than previously thought in Gabon, and that a review of existing camera trap datasets could help determine its precise distribution and habitat requirements.

KW  - ACTIVATION
AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes severe disease in domestic pigs and wild boars, seriously threatening the development of the global pig industry. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is an important component of innate immunity, inducing the transcription and expression of antiviral cytokines by activating Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ASFV antagonizes IFN-I signaling have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, using coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and dual luciferase reporter assay methods, we investigated these mechanisms and identified a novel ASFV immunosuppressive protein, pB475L, which interacts with the C-terminal domain of STAT2. Consequently, pB475L inhibited IFN-I signaling by inhibiting STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerization and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we constructed an ASFV-B475L7PM mutant strain by homologous recombination, fi nding that ASFVB475L7PM attenuated the inhibitory effects on IFN-I signaling compared to ASFV-WT. In summary, this study reveals a new mechanism by which ASFV impairs host innate immunity.

AB  - Tea, an aromatic beverage from Camellia sinensis, is the second most consumed drink after water. The different types of tea include black, green, oolong, etc. Salivary amylase is an enzyme that helps digestion by breaking down polysaccharides into smaller molecules, contributing to elevated blood glucose levels and postprandial hyperglycemia. The scientific community is exploring natural inhibitors of amylase to slow down starch digestion and lower postprandial blood glucose levels for diabetes management. Plantderived alpha-amylase inhibitors are gaining popularity as safe and costeffective alternatives. The current study included the effect of tea extract on the action of human salivary amylase. The result demonstrated that the extract slowed down human salivary amylase activity in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 1% tea extract, the achromatic point was reached in an hour, while in the control sample, it was achieved within 5 minutes. In conclusion, tea consumption affects the attributes of human saliva by inhibiting the activity of salivary amylase, thereby affecting the digestion of starch. Thus, tea could potentially be used to manage glucose levels in diabetes patients.

AB  - Boron (B) toxicity causes oxidative stress, damaging plant membranes, chloroplasts, proteins, and lipid metabolism, leading to reduced productivity. This study hypothesizes that hydrolyzed keratin (HK) from sheep wool (SW) can mitigate B toxicity. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions with lettuce plants. The experimental subjects included control, HK, boron-toxic conditions (BT), and BT+HK applications. Plant samples were analyzed for weight, B and N concentrations, and relative chlorophyll content. Additionally, the effects of oxidative stress in plants were determined through H2O2 accumulation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and molecular-level changes, which were identified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The HK effectively mitigates the impact of B toxicity on lettuce growth and health. Under normal conditions, HK increased dry weight from 2.46 g to 3.40 g plant-1, and under B toxicity, it raised dry weight to 2.64 g plant-1. HK also enhanced nitrogen concentrations in both inner and outer leaves, while reducing B levels in both leaf types. HK reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, alleviating oxidative stress, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, suggesting improved antioxidant defense. The highest chlorophyll content was observed in HK-treated plants, indicating better photosynthesis. FTIR analysis revealed that HK restored structural integrity in carbohydrates, proteins, and cell membranes in the inner leaves, which were altered by B toxicity. These results highlight HK's potential in enhancing plant growth, nutrient uptake, and oxidative stress management under B-toxicity, while demonstrating the utility of FTIR in identifying molecular-level changes in plants.

AB  - Copper ion (Cu2+) and zinc ion (Zn2+) are widely co-existent in anaerobic digestion effluent as typical contaminants. This work aims to explore how Cu2+-Zn2+ association affects physiological properties of S. platensis using Schlosser medium (SM) and sterilized anaerobic digestion effluent (SADE). Microalgae cells viability, biochemical properties, uptake of Cu2+ and Zn2+, and risk assessment associated with the biomass reuse as additives to pigs were comprehensively assessed. Biomass production ranged from 0.03 to 0.28 g/L in SM and 0.63 to 0.79 g/L in SADE due to the presence of Cu2+ and Zn2+. Peak value of chlorophyll-a and carotenoid content during the experiment decreased by 70-100% and 40-100% in SM, and by 70-77% and 30-55% in SADE. Crude protein level reduced by 4-41% in SM and by 65-75% in SADE. The reduction ratio of these compounds was positively related to the Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. Maximum value of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was both obtained at 0.3 Cu + 2.0 Zn (50.8% and 22.8%, respectively) and 25% SADE reactors (33.8% and 27.7%, respectively). Uptake of Cu in biomass was facilitated by Zn2+ concentration (> 4.0 mg/L). Risk of S. platensis biomass associated with Cu2+ was higher than Zn2+. S. platensis from SM (Cu2+ <= 0.3 mg/L and Zn2+ <= 4.0 mg/L) and diluted SADE (25% and 50% SADE) reactors could be used as feed additives without any risk (hazard index < 1), which provides sufficient protein and fatty acids for pig consumption. These results revealed the promising application of using S. platensis for bioremediation of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in anaerobic digestion effluent and harvesting biomass for animal feed additives.

AB  - Soil structure plays an important role in edaphic conditions and the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of organic amendment on soil structure and hydraulic properties. A corn field in a semiarid land was separately amended with sheep manure compost at five different rates (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 t/ha) and corn stover (6 t/ha) in combination with two decomposing agents. The soil structure of different amended soils was analyzed from the aggregate and pore domain perspectives. The internal pore structure of the soil was visualized through X-ray computed tomography and quantified using a pore-network model. Soil aggregate-size distribution and stability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water-retention curves were measured by sampling or in situ. The gas permeability and diffusivity of different amended soils were simulated based on the extracted pore networks. The aggregate stability of the amended soils was improved compared with the control, that is, the mean weight diameter increased and the percentage of aggregate destruction decreased. The stability of soil aggregates varied non -monotonically with the application rate of compost and decreased after treatment with corn stover and decomposing agents. The pore-network parameters including air -filled porosity, pore radius, throat length, and coordinate number increased for the amended soils compared with the control. The mean pore size increased with increasing compost incorporation rate. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the compost-amended soils was higher than that of the control but varied quadratically with the application rate. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil treated with corn stover and decomposing agents was clearly higher than that without the agent and the control. The greater gas diffusivity and air permeability indicate that soil aeration improved following the incorporation of organic amendments. The air permeability versus air -filled porosity relationship followed a power law, and the gas diffusivity versus air -filled porosity relationship was characterized by a generalized density-corrected model regardless of amendment. The findings of this study can help improve the understanding of soil structure and hydrological function to organic fertilizer incorporation and further monitor the quality of soil structure through the pore space perspective.

AB  - Background: Plant-plant facilitation provides benefits to the protected species since the host species reduces the intensity of stressful physical conditions. However, it has been hypothesized that the outcome of the interaction could be regulated by the characteristics of the interacting species and that herbivores could counteract the benefits of protective plants.
   Question: Can cactus size and identity of neighboring plants influence the herbivory of the columnar cactus P. leucocephalus?
   Studied species / Mathematical model: Pilosocereus leucocephalus (Poselg.) Byles & G.D. Rowley /One-way ANOVA, Repeated measures ANOVA, Analysis of covariance and linear regression.
   Study site and dates: San Ignacio, Veracruz, Mexico. April to May 2019.
   Methods: We randomly selected 60 P. leucocephalus plants growing underneath the canopy of seven species of shrubs and P. leucocephalus plants growing >= 3 m away from other species and exposed to full sunlight conditions. We obtained the size of the P. leucocephalus plants (size of main stem from ground to apex) and determined the intensity (number of bites on the stem) of vertebrate herbivory.
   Results: The number of bite scars by small vertebrate species was significantly higher on the stems of cacti established in open spaces than on those underneath the canopy of seven shrub species and increased significantly with the stem size of the protected species.
   Conclusions: We conclude that herbivory damage by rodents on a giant cactus in a dry tropical forest depends on cactus size and the identity, but not the shade, of the nearest neighbor.

AB  - Fallow deer is one of the most common and widespread cervid species in Europe. To make informed management decisions on any scale, it is essential to have long-term data on the abundance of populations and their harvest. We provide missing information on the changes and status of fallow deer populations in Europe and analyse the relationships between population and harvest changes using a numerical approach. To conduct our analyses, we collected national statistical data on population sizes and hunting bags for all European countries for four periods: 1984, the mid-2000s, mid-2010s, and early 2020s. The fallow deer population increased five-fold from 1984 to the early 2020s and the harvest increased six-fold in the same period. Although the correlations between the population growth rate and harvest growth rate are not strong, removing outliers strengthened the correlation. This indicates that the hunting effort increases as the population increases. Overall, the lack of some data shows that consistent, reliable data collection (monitoring programs) is needed to efficiently manage the increasing fallow deer populations as a renewable natural resource and mitigate the potential negative impacts in a holistic and responsible manner.

AB  - Seahorses belong to the teleost family Syngnathidae that evolved a distinct body plan and unique male pregnancy compared to other teleosts. As a classic model for studying evolution of viviparity and sexual selection of teleosts, seahorse species still lack a publicly available high-quality reference genome. Here, we generated the genome assembly of the big-belly seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis with long-read and Hi-C technologies. We managed to place over 99% of the total length of 444.7 Mb of assembled genome into 21 linkage groups with almost no gaps. We reconstructed a phylogenomic tree with the big-belly seahorse genome and other representative Syngnathidae and teleost species. We also reconstructed the historical population dynamics of four representative Syngnathidae species. We found the gene families that underwent expansion or contraction in the Syngnathidae ancestor were enriched for immune-related or ion transporter gene ontology terms. Many of these genes were also reported to show a dynamic expression pattern during the pregnancy stages of H. abdominalis. We also identified putative positively selected genes in the Syngnathidae ancestor or in H. abdominalis, whose mouse mutants are enriched for abnormal craniofacial and limb morphological phenotypes. Overall, our study provides an important genome resource for evolutionary and developmental studies of seahorse species, and candidate genes for future experimental works.

AB  - Inflammation is essential for host defense but requires strict regulation to prevent immunopathology. This study reveals how pig liver esterase (PLE) in alveolar macrophages (PAMs) modulates PRRSV-induced inflammation through endocannabinoid metabolism. We identified PLE6 as the dominant hydrolytically active subtype in PAMs. Functional studies demonstrated that PLE promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine expression during PRRSV infection, while its substrate 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Animal experiments confirmed that PLE inhibition reduces pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage in PRRSV-infected piglets. Transcriptomic and mechanistic analyses revealed that PLE hydrolyzes 2-AG to activate the PI3K-Akt-NF-kappa B pathway, particularly through enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and p65. These findings establish a novel pathological mechanism where PLE-mediated 2-AG degradation disrupts endocannabinoid homeostasis, amplifying PRRSV-induced inflammation. The study provides therapeutic insights for targeting endocannabinoid hydrolysis to control inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are contaminants of emerging concern. However, limited work has been done on chronic toxicity of Ag-NPs to fish using biomarkers. The present study elucidates the extracellular synthesis of non-agglomerated Ag-NPs using processing waste of sheep and swine by dispensing with additional capping agents and their characterisation, and toxicity evaluation on the physiological stress response of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus using biomarkers. Spectrophotometry, FTIR, DLS and HR-TM were employed for characterisation of Ag-NPs. Antioxidant, metabolic and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activities were assayed using standard methods for chronic toxicity analysis of Ag-NPs to fish. Characterisation results showed a spherical shape of AgNPs with predominant size frequency between 5-20, 21-30 followed by 31-50 and 51-100 nm, capping by biomolecules, absorption at 400-410 nm with zeta potential of -27 and -32 mV. Sheep waste-derived Ag-NPs showed high bactericidal properties against fish pathogens. An enhancement in antioxidant and metabolic enzyme activities and inhibition of AChE activity were observed with increased sub-lethal ammonia concentration and temperature. Biosynthesis of Ag-NPs can be undertaken using animal wastes for their potential application in environment and health management of aquaculture based on characterisation, capping, bactericidal activity, biomarkers and physiological responses in fish.

TI  - A culture of aggression: the Gorongosa elephants' enduring legacy of war
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
KW  - AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Humans have hunted elephants since the Palaeolithic era and, as cunning predators, have likely helped shape the animals' sophisticated defensive behaviour. In recent centuries, the use of modern weapons in targeted mass killings has resulted in signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in elephants, including heightened aggression and impaired decision-making. During Mozambique's long civil war (1977-1992), 90% of the elephants of Gorongosa National Park were killed. More than a quarter of a century after the end of hostilities aggression towards vehicles by elephant families is an enduring legacy. This study found that females and entire families were more likely to charge when vehicles were in close proximity (<similar to 80 m) and on, rather than off, the roads. Although aggression was primarily initiated and led by older adult females, most charges involved mobbing by entire families, including calves. Some individuals engaged in idiosyncratic defensive behaviours, while some families exhibited distinctive group manoeuvres that appeared to form traditions, indicating that young elephants were acquiring their defensive responses within this social context. We argue that the aggressive behaviour of the Gorongosa elephants is a response to the traumatic events of the civil war and that the observed patterns of behaviour are transmitted within and across groups, giving rise to a culturally learned behavioural variant that has persisted over time and generations. Given rapid environmental change, increasing contact between elephants and people, and the extreme losses caused by poaching and armed conflict, a better understanding of the role that culture plays in the response of elephants to people is urgently needed. Conservation and management strategies may have to be adapted to meet the changing cultures of specific elephant populations.

AB  - Simple Summary As poikilotherms, insects are sensitive to ambient environmental conditions; therefore, it is important to gauge how heat stress affects their survival and fitness. The ladybeetles Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Propylaea quatuordecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are key natural enemies within cotton fields in Xinjiang Province, China. This study investigated the effects of different temperatures (i.e., 32, 35, and 38 degrees C) on the survival, reproduction, predation, and antioxidant capacity of adult ladybugs. Laboratory assays showed that elevated temperatures (i.e., 35 and 38 degrees C) impacted P. quatuordecimpunctata survival and reproduction to a greater extent than that of H. variegata. At all experimental temperatures, H. variegata's predation rate on aphid prey surpassed that of P. quatuordecimpunctata. Yet, prey consumption rates of H. variegata were highest at 35 degrees C, while those of P. quatuordecimpunctata gradually decreased with higher temperatures. Lastly, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and protein content in both ladybugs were significantly affected by ambient temperature. By assessing the thermal biology of individual ladybug species, laboratory assays can thus explain their spatiotemporal distribution and inform strategies to enhance biological control under conditions of global warming or extreme weather events. In cotton-growing regions of northwestern China, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Propylaea quatuordecimpunctata (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are key natural enemies of hemipteran pests. As only H. variegata can be encountered in hot, arid production areas, the thermal responses and climatic adaptability of both species likely differ substantially. In this study, we assessed the survival, longevity, fecundity, prey consumption rate, and antioxidant capacity of both species under laboratory conditions at 32-38 degrees C. The (negative) impacts of elevated temperatures (i.e., 35 and 38 degrees C) on adult survival and reproduction were more pronounced for P. quatuordecimpunctata than for H. variegata. Similarly, high temperatures exhibited the strongest negative impacts on the prey consumption rates of P. quatuordecimpunctata. At elevated temperatures, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity increased, while glutathione-S-transferases activity decreased for both species. However, for P. quatuordecimpunctata, peroxidase activity and total antioxidant capacity progressively declined. Antioxidant responses thus constitute a key physiological adaptation of ladybugs to heat stress, reflecting a superior thermal tolerance of H. variegata. Our work emphasizes how laboratory assays can explain spatiotemporal distribution patterns of individual ladybugs and inform strategies to bolster their ensuing biological control under conditions of global warming or extreme weather events.

AB  - Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2), a major driver of multiple tissue development, is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in organisms. However, it is unknown if PITX2 regulates goat granulosa cell (GC) steroidogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the role and mechanism of PITX2 in GC steroidogenesis. In our study, PITX2 significantly facilitated the secretion level of estrogen and progesterone through increasing CYP11A1, CYP19A1, and STAR mRNA and protein expressions in GCs. Furthermore, PITX2 participated in the WNT pathway, enhancing the production of E2 and P4 in GCs. PITX2 in GCs increased the DVL-1 and CTNNB1 expression, involved in the WNT/8-catenin signaling pathway related to steroidogenesis. Moreover, GC steroidogenesis-related gene translation was decreased by CTNNB1-siRNA but enhanced when transfected with PITX2. PITX2 regulates secretion of E2 and P4 from GCs via the WNT/8-catenin pathway and alters GC proliferation and steroidogenesis. These findings will help understand the role of PITX2 in goat ovarian follicular development and oocyte maturation.

AB  - Food waste management is a major global issue, and alternative protein sources like insect farming offer a sustainable solution. This study investigated the environmental impacts of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) production using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), evaluating its role in both protein production and food waste treatment. The assessment considered three functional units: FU1 (1 kg of dried larvae), FU2 (per kg of protein), and FU3 (treatment of 1 ton of food waste). The results indicate that larvae rearing is the largest contributor to emissions in FU1 (46% of 18.51 kg CO2 eq). In FU2, BSFL protein shows a higher climate impact (49.41 kg CO2 eq) than fishmeal or soybean meal but requires significantly less land. FU3 demonstrates that BSFL-based composting can achieve net negative emissions (similar to-24.8 kg CO2 eq), outperforming conventional waste treatment. An optimized scenario (Scenario A) shows marked improvements across all units compared to a Business-as-Usual case, including a 79% reduction in FU1 emissions and a 577% increase in FU3 carbon savings. These findings underline the environmental advantages of BSFL systems, especially in Singapore, and support their potential as sustainable alternatives for protein production and food waste management.

AB  - Cold stress significantly affects gene expression in adipocytes; studying this phenomenon can help reveal the pathogeneses of conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance. Adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL); cell death-inducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation factor subunit alpha (DFFA)-like effector (CIDEA); and uncoupling protein genes UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 are the most studied genes in pig adipose tissues under cold stress. However, contradictory results have been observed in gene expression changes to UCP3 and UCP2 when adipose tissues under cold stress were examined. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 32 publications in total on the effect of cold stress on the expression of ATGL, CIDEA, UCP2, and UCP3. Our results showed that cold stress affected the expression of swine adipocyte genes; specifically, it was positively correlated with the expression of UCP3 in swine adipocytes. Conversely, expression of ATGL was negatively affected under cold stress conditions. In addition, the loss of functional UCP1 in pigs likely triggered a compensatory increase in UCP3 activity. We also simulated the docking results of UCP2 and UCP3. Our results showed that UCP2 could strongly bind to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), meaning that UCP3 played a more significant role in pig adipocytes.

AB  - Allium triquetrum L. (Amaryllidaceae), a bulbiferous monocot, is native to the Mediterranean. It was introduced to Australia in the early 1900s, where it has subsequently become a significant invader of temperate forests throughout south-eastern Australia. Intensive chemical and mechanical control methods can suppress A. triquetrum infestations at the local scale for short periods of time but remain ineffective at sustainably curtailing its invasion at landscape and regional scales. In this context, we undertook field surveys across the Mediterranean (mainland France, Corsica, Sardinia) to determine the feasibility of developing classical biological control solutions for A. triquetrum in Australia. Despite extensive sampling (i.e. 30 surveys at 18 sites over three growing seasons), very few phytophagous arthropod and fungal pathogen taxa were detected on A. triquetrum. The most common arthropod species were the flies Phytomyza gymnostoma and Delia hirticrura, the weevil Oprohinus consputus and the moth Hysterophora maculosana. All identified arthropod taxa were considered generalists, having been found on other plant species, and some are known pests of cultivated Allium species. Twenty-one different fungal isolates were recovered from A. triquetrum, with most considered as saprophytic, secondary/opportunistic pathogens that probably infected already-damaged A. triquetrum leaves. Only four fungal taxa were found to be primary pathogens of A. triquetrum but have been recorded to infect other plant species. None of these enemy taxa were deemed to be suitable candidate biocontrol agents to help manage A. triquetrum invasion in Australia. Future research directions for improved A. triquetrum management in Australia are discussed in this paper.

AB  - The growth and chemical composition of essential oils (EOs) depend on several factors in particular the supply of fertilization. The use of fertilization with different manure sources and doses in a sustainable production system are critical factors in integrated nutrient management and play an important role in increasing of quantity and quality of medicinal plant. Furthermore, organic manures play an important role in the growth of plants leading to organic and cleaner production. Hence, a field experiment was conducted to study the usage of different organic manures and chemical fertilizers on biomass production, accumulation of nutrients in the leaves, essential oil content, essential oil yield and chemical compositions of Thymus vulgaris. In addition to these objectives, providing an economical and low-cost alternative with the use of organic fertilizers. The treatments consisted of: three sources of organic manure (quail, cattle, and goat) at four doses, chemical fertilizer and the control (without fertilizer). Significant differences were observed between manure sources and doses in virtually all response variables. The results showed that the highest biomass and leaf nutrients of T. vulgaris was obtained in plants treated with quail and cattle manure. Higher production of reactive oxygen species was observed in plants fertilized with goat manure, which generally showed the lowest levels of leaf nutrients. The results showed that the highest essential oil yield of T. vulgaris was obtained in plants treated with cattle manure compared to the control treatment. Thymol was major chemical compound of thyme tended to increase with increasing doses of the three sources of organic manures. The present study indicated that the usage of the right dose and source organic manure are crucial to provide quantitative-qualitative gains in the cultivation of T. vulgaris.(c) 2023 SAAB.

AB  - The species-rich natural and seminatural grasslands of East-Central Europe have long offered diverse forages and fodder species for domestic livestock. The use and perception of forage and fodder plants are influenced by various agricultural, environmental, sociocultural, technical, and political factors. In our paper, we compared four indicator sets used by traditional land users and scientists since the Enlightenment period (18th century) until the present. We analyzed 24 literature sources and field data from Poland, Hungary, and neighboring countries. We found 2 049 records related to 529 plant species and identified 47 different types of forage/fodder quality indicators. The most often used indicators in the Enlightenment science indicator sets were "nutritional value," "livestock preference," and "impact on livestock health"; in the early ethnographic indicator sets (late 19th, early 20th century) "impact on livestock health" and "usedfor curing"; while themodern rangelandindicatorset focusedon "nutritionalvalue," "impact on livestock health," and "productivity" of plants. The indicators used by present-day traditional herders and farmers in Hungary and Romania resembled the indicators documented in the Enlightenment period. We found data for more than 130 plant species on plant-livestock interactions that have the potential to be used in nature conservation management of seminatural pastures and meadows. The data include species currently considered protected, rare, and/or threatened in the studied countries. We argue that plant ecologists, conservation biologists, and practitioners could efficiently use historical and traditional knowledge sources about wild forage and fodder species for better and more sustainable management of species-rich grasslands in Europe.

AB  - The presence or absence of subcutaneous adipose accumulation will affect the energy storage, insulation resistance and metabolism of animals. Proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes play a significant role in lipid deposition. The objective of this study was to clone the goat CXCL17 gene and investigate its potential functions on goat subcutaneous preadipocytes' proliferation by gaining or losing function in vitro. The goat CXCL17 gene was cloned by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and bioinformatics analysis was performed. The expression of the CXCL17 gene in the different goat tissues and adipocytes at different differentiation stages was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results showed that the cloned sequence of goat CXCL17 gene is 728 bp and the CDS region is 357 bp, encoding 118 amino acids. CXCL17 protein is located in nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria and extracellular matrix. Tissue-expression profiles revealed that CXCL17 expressed in all of the examined tissues. In visceral tissues, the highest expression level was found in lung (p < 0.01); in muscle tissues, the highest CXCL17 expression level was found in the longissimus dorsi (p < 0.01) and in adipose tissues, the highest expression level was found in subcutaneous adipose (p <0.01). Compared with those cells before differentiation, CXCL17 expression levels upregulated at 48 h (p < 0.01), 72 h (p < 0.01), 120 h (p < 0.01) and downregulated at 96 h (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the results of crystal violet staining and semi-quantitative assay showed that transfection with 1 mu g CXCL17 expression plasmid reduced the cell numbers in vitro. Meanwhile, the expression of CCND1 was significantly decreased. A similar consequence happened after interfering with CXCL17 expression. However, plasmid transfected with 2 mu g pEGFPN1-CXCL17 increased the number of cells in vitro. These results suggest that CXCL17 is involved in the proliferation of goat subcutaneous preadipocytes.

AB  - Mycotoxin binders, in combination with enzymes degrading some mycotoxins, contribute to feed detoxification. Their use reduces economic losses and the negative impacts of mycotoxins on animal health and productivity in farm animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mycotoxin detoxifier on the expression of the ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters ABCB1 mRNA and ABCC2 mRNA, which transport xenobiotics and thus have a barrier function, in the tissues of pigs exposed to low doses of deoxynivalenol (DON, 1 mg/kg feed) and zearalenone (ZEN, 0.4 mg/kg feed) for 37 days. The levels of expression were determined by an RT-PCR, and the effect of the mycotoxin detoxifier (Mycofix Plus3.E) was evaluated by a comparison of results between healthy pigs (n = 6), animals treated with DON and ZEN (n = 6), and a group that received both mycotoxins and the detoxifier (n = 6). A significant downregulation of ABCB1 mRNA and ABCC2 mRNA was observed in the jejunum (p < 0.05). A tendencies toward the downregulation of ABCB1 mRNA and ABCC2 mRNA were found in the ileum and duodenum, respectively. The mycotoxin detoxifier restored the expression of ABCB1 mRNA to the level found in healthy animals but did not restore that of ABCC2 mRNA to the level of healthy animals in the jejunum.

AB  - China, the world's largest consumer and producer of pork in the world, is attracting increasing attention due to the environmental impacts of its pig production. Previous studies seldom comprehensively compare the environmental impacts of the pig production system with different models, resulting in different intensities of environmental impacts. We aim to comprehensively evaluate Chinese pig production with different breeding models and explore a more sustainable way for pig production. We use life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate and compare environmental impacts of pig production system with four main breeding models in China from 1998 to 2020: domestic breeding, small-scale breeding, medium-scale breeding, and large-scale breeding. The life cycle encompasses fertilizer production, feed production, feed processing, pig raising, waste treatment, and slaughtering. The impact categories including energy consumption (EN), global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EU), water use (WD), and land occupation (LO) are expressed with "100 kg live weight of fattening pig at farm gate." The results show that driven by governmental support, growing meat demand, and cost advantage, the scale breeding especially large-scale breeding simultaneously yielded greater net economic benefit and less environmental impact compared to other breeding models especially the domestic breeding. Due to mineral fertilizer application, feed production contributed over 50% of the total environmental impacts. Notably, the composition of feeds exerted significant influence on the environmental impacts arising from fertilizer production and feed processing. Furthermore, attributable to the substantial use of electricity and heat, as well as the concomitant emissions, pig raising contributed the largest GWP, while ranking second in terms of AP and EU. Notably, waste management constituted the third-largest EU, AP, and WD. In addition to promote scale breeding, we put forth several sustainable measures encompassing feed composition, cultivation practices, fertilizer utilization, and waste management for consideration.

AB  - Simple Summary The increasing interest in the welfare of farmed animals has resulted in the development of alternative production systems for pigs. Access to outdoor pens or pastures is considered to improve welfare, as it is environmental-friendly and widely accepted by society. Outdoor housing allows pigs to freely display their natural behaviors, which is perhaps the most significant advantage of this type of housing vs. indoor housing systems. Among various indoor systems, bedding made of different materials, especially straw, appears to promote appropriate behavioral patterns in pigs, but it may also lead to respiratory disorders. However, the literature indicates that none of the described housing systems for pigs is perfect, and each one has some negative effects on welfare, management, and food safety. Humans who care for pigs prefer an environment that not only allows the pigs to express their natural behaviors but also limits the development of aggression and stereotypes. Most of the behavioral and health problems encountered by pigs in barren, conventional conditions are solved by alternative housing systems. However, it is not known whether these systems are advantageous in terms of the performance of pigs. In this work, we review the effects of housing systems on pigs' behaviors and performance, which are among the major indicators of the welfare of these animals. Research results point out that outdoor systems are more ideal for sows and fatteners than buildings. Nonetheless, outdoor housing is associated with two major effects in both groups: increased activity due to environmental exploration and higher space allowance, and increased incidence of injuries compared to indoor systems. Sows are more active when housed in groups, but they experience an increased frequency of injuries. According to the literature, group-housed sows give birth to healthy piglets with good daily weight gains. The difference in the fattening and slaughter performance of pigs raised indoors vs. outdoors remains unclear, and the results reported so far are inconsistent. Outdoor systems seem to be associated with a higher incidence of osteochondrosis and lesions of elbow and hock joints, whereas indoor systems cause a greater degree of body soiling in pigs. Based on the reviewed literature, it may be concluded that outdoor housing helps to solve behavioral issues in pigs but leads to other problems in pig production.

AB  - In Kutch (Gujarat District, India), there is a growing concern about the lack of good quality forage owing to the arid climate and poor soil health. Opuntia ficus-indica has been increasingly recognized as a drought-resilient forage in arid Kutch. This study seeks to identify the maturity phase of cactus cladodes with the best forage qualities. Five accessions of spineless forage cactus (CBG, No. 1270, No. 1271, No. 1308, and Bianca Macomer) and three cladode maturity phases (young, intermediate, and mature) were examined in a randomized block design experiment in a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement. Although only mineral matter and total carbohydrate concentration were significantly different among the accessions, CBG showed better forage qualities than other accessions. Dry matter, organic matter, mineral matter, crude protein, ether extract, and total carbohydrate accumulations were higher in the intermediate phase. In the mature phase, relatively difficult to digest fiber components such as neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose increase. Our findings indicate that for spineless forage cactus grown in arid areas, the intermediate phase is the best phase to harvest cladodes for feeding livestock.

AB  - Upper canines do not usually appear in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758)) and their occasional appearance represents the expression of a tooth, as a rudimentary canine, which has been suppressed in the evolution of the group. These dental anomalies could be potentially useful for tracing ancestral genes in local ecotypes and populations. We studied the skulls of 517 adult roe deer males from seven Iberian Peninsula hunting populations looking for canine occurrence and the variations depending on region and ecomorphological variety. A total of 18 specimens had canines (3.48%), but a relationship was detected between the geographic origin and the canine presence. We found upper canines in three populations that were located in the Tagus River Basin, with 6.08%, 10.91%, and 20% prevalences, respectively. In the population with the highest prevalence, we also found a case of duplicated canines on either side of the upper jaw. Here, the high prevalence of upper canines against the evolutionary trend may be a sign of atavistic populations, possibly adapted to a less fibrous diet, in a geographical area connected through the Tagus River Basin, and probably regarding one of the glacial refuges of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Elephant grass is widely used in feed production and ecological restoration because of its huge biomass and low occurrence of diseases and insect pets. However, drought seriously affects growth and development of this grass. Strigolactone (SL), a small molecular phytohormone, reportedly participates in improving resilience to cope with arid environment. But the mechanism of SL regulating elephant grass to response to drought stress remains unknown and needs further investigation. We conducted RNA-seq experiments and identified 84,296 genes including 765 and 2325 upregulated differential expression genes (DEGs) and 622 and 1826 downregulated DEGs, compared drought rehydration with spraying SL in roots and leaves, respectively. Combined with targeted phytohormones metabolite analysis, five hormones including 6-BA, ABA, MeSA, NAA, and JA had significant changes under re-watering and spraying SL stages. Moreover, a total of 17 co-expression modules were identified, of which eight modules had the most significant correlation with all physiological indicators with weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The venn analysis revealed the common genes between Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enriched functional DEGs and the top 30 hub genes of higher weights in eight modules, respectively. Finally, 44 DEGs had been identified as key genes which played a major role in SL response to drought stress. After verification of its expression level by qPCR, six key genes in elephant grass including PpPEPCK, PpRuBPC, PpPGK, PpGAPDH, PpFBA, and PpSBPase genes regulated photosynthetic capacity under the SL treatment to respond to drought stress. Meanwhile, PpACAT, PpMFP2, PpAGT2, PpIVD, PpMCCA, and PpMCCB regulated root development and phytohormone crosstalk to respond to water deficit conditions. Our research led to a more comprehensive understanding about exogenous SL that plays a role in elephant grass response to drought stress and revealed insights into the SL regulating molecular mechanism in plants to adapt to the arid environment.

AB  - In our previous study of Hu sheep hair follicles, we found that CRABP2 was highly expressed in DPCs, which suggested that CRABP2 may influence the number of DPCs. In the present study, we aimed to understand the effect of CRABP2 in Hu sheep dermal papilla cells (DPCs). First, we explored the influence of CRABP2 on the ability of Hu sheep DPCs' proliferation. Based on the results obtained from some experiments, such as CCK-8, EDU, qPCR, and Western blot experiment, we found that the overexpression of CRABP2 facilitated the proliferation of DPCs compared to the negative control group. Then, we also detected the effect of CRABP2 on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway based on the important function of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in hair follicles. The results showed that CRABP2 could activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in DPCs, and it rescues the proliferation of DPCs when the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was inhibited. In summary, our findings indicate that CRABP2 is a vital functional gene in the proliferation of Hu sheep DPCs. Our study will be of great use for revealing the roles of CRABP2 in the hair follicles of Hu sheep.

Santa Ines rams (n = 6) underwent evaluation of general and testicular physiological parameters (heart and respiratory rates, internal and scrotal temperatures, internal-scrotal temperature gradient, scrotal distention, and color Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the spermatic cords and spectral analyses of testicular arteries) over six consecutive weeks per season at three separate times daily (morning = 8:00 a.m., noon = 12:00 p.m., and afternoon = 5:00 p.m.) during the RS and LS. Climatic air temperature and relative humidity data were recorded, and the temperature and humidity index (THI) was calculated. Higher thermal challenge was observed in LS relative to RS (air temperature = 28.0 vs. 30.9 degrees C; relative humidity = 84.1 vs. 69.9%; THI = 80.0 vs. 82.5; P < 0.05). In both seasons, respiratory rate and internal temperature were normal, demonstrating the animals' adaptability. In RS, however, a higher scrotal temperature was recorded in relation to LS (35.0 vs. 34.7 degrees C; P < 0.05), with a gradual increase from morning to afternoon. Lower resistivity (0.40 vs. 0.64; P < 0.05) and pulsatility (0.55 vs. 1.14; P < 0.05) indices, and a higher rate of high-velocity blood flow of testicular arteries (71.1 vs. 60.6%; P < 0.05) were observed in RS compared to LS. The lowest correlations between testicular hemodynamic, physiological variables, and environmental parameters (P < 0.05) were observed in the morning. In conclusion, testicular thermoregulation and testicular hemodynamics were influenced by the climatic seasons and time of the day, being more efficient in the LS season and with less interference from environmental factors in the morning.
