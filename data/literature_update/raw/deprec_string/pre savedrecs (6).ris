AB  - The role of divergent selection between alternative environments in promoting reproductive isolation (RI) between lineages is well recognized. However, most studies view each divergent environment as homogenous, thereby overlooking the potential role within-environment variation plays in RI between differentiating lineages. Here, we test the importance of microenvironmental variation in RI by using individual trees of two host plants, each harboring locally adapted populations of the cynipid wasp Belonocnema treatae. We compared the fitness surrogate (survival) of offspring from hybrid crosses with resident crosses across individual trees on each of two primary host plants, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata. We found evidence of weak hybrid inviability between host-associated lineages of B. treatae despite strong genomic differentiation. However, averaging across environments masked great variation in hybrid fitness on individual trees, where hybrids performed worse than, equal to, or better than residents. Thus, considering the environmental context of hybridization is critical to improving the predictability of divergence under variable selection.

AB  - Quantifying the capacity of protected area networks to shield multiple marine megafauna with diverse life histories is complicated, as many species are wide-ranging, requiring varied monitoring approaches. Yet, such information is needed to identify and assess the potential use of umbrella species and to plan how best to enhance conservation strategies. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of part of the European Natura 2000 protected area network (western Greece) for marine megafauna and whether loggerhead sea turtles are viable umbrella species in this coastal region. We systematically surveyed inside and outside coastal marine protected areas (MPAs) at a regional scale using aerial drones (18,505 animal records) and combined them with distribution data from published datasets (tracking, sightings, strandings) of sea turtles, elasmobranchs, cetaceans and pinnipeds. MPAs covered 56% of the surveyed coastline (similar to 1500 km). There was just a 22% overlap in the distributions of the four groups from aerial drone and other datasets, demonstrating the value of combining different approaches to improve records of coastal area use for effective management. All four taxonomic groups were more likely to be detected inside coastal MPAs than outside, confirming sufficient habitat diversity despite varied life history traits. Coastal habitats frequented by loggerhead turtles during breeding/non-breeding periods combined overlapped with 76% of areas used by the other three groups, supporting their potential use as an umbrella species. In conclusion, this study showed that aerial drones can be readily combined with other monitoring approaches in coastal areas to enhance the management of marine megafauna in protected area networks and to identify the efficacy of umbrella species.

AB  - Global warming is affecting the phenological cycles of plants and animals, altering the complex synchronization that has co-evolved over thousands of years between interacting species and trophic levels. Here, we examined how warmer winter conditions affect the timing of budburst in six common European trees and the hatching of a generalist leaf-feeding insect, the spongy moth Lymantria dispar, whose fitness depends on the synchrony between egg hatch and leaf emergence of the host tree. We applied four different temperature treatments to L. dispar eggs and twig cuttings, that mimicked warmer winters and reduced chilling temperatures that are necessary for insect diapause and bud dormancy release, using heated open-top chambers (ambient or +3.5(degrees)C), and heated greenhouses (maintained at >6(degrees)C or >10(degrees)C). In addition, we conducted preference and performance tests to determine which tree species the larvae prefer and benefit from the most. Budburst success and twig survival were highest for all tree species at ambient temperature conditions, whereas it declined under elevated winter temperature for Tilia cordata and Acer pseudoplatanus, likely due to a lack of chilling. While L. dispar egg hatch coincided with budburst in most tree species within 10 days under ambient conditions, it coincided with budburst only in Quercus robur, Carpinus betulus, and, to a lesser extent, Ulmus glabra under warmer conditions. With further warming, we, therefore, expect an increasing mismatch in trees with high chilling requirements, such as Fagus sylvatica and A. pseudoplatanus, but still good synchronization with trees having low chilling requirements, such as Q. robur and C. betulus. Surprisingly, first instar larvae preferred and gained weight faster when fed with leaves of F. sylvatica, while Q. robur ranked second. Our results suggest that spongy moth outbreaks are likely to persist in oak and hornbeam forests in western and central Europe.

AB  - Three hundred forty-one radiocarbon dates from the Groningen radiocarbon database are compiled in this study. They show for the first time that organic sediment samples from the eastern Netherlands and mammal bones from Doggerland reflect shifts in the presence and the density of vegetation (food for herbivores) and mammal biomass during the last ice age (Weichselian Stage, similar to 119-14.7 ka cal bp). Comparison with oxygen isotope curves of Greenland ice cores and geomorphological data shows that cold climate, in particular during the younger part of the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial and during the Late Pleniglacial, and related scarcity or even absence of vegetation, were limiting factors for the carrying capacity of the landscape and thus for the population density of large herbivores during the period covered by C-14 dating (last ca. 55 000 years). A 'fossil gap' during the Late Pleniglacial lasted ca. 13 000 years from ca. 28 to 15 ka cal bp. Previous research from the nearby Eifel region in Germany shows that environmental conditions were less extreme ('refugium conditions') than in the Netherlands, taking into account the continuous presence of spores of coprophilous fungi in the Eifel, indicating uninterrupted food supply for herbivores.

AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotope variability in herbivore enamel is frequently used to evaluate seasonal changes in the diets of fossil taxa as well as their broader ecosystems. Unfortunately, these reconstructions are often based on small samples (i.e., < 5 individuals) and the impacts of inter-and intraindividual variation on these data are largely unknown due to the lack of a modern comparative framework from wild herbivore populations. In this study, we used serially-sampled isotope values from the mandibular dentition (M-1 , M-2 , M-3) of five wild, male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with known life histories from the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR; central Georgia, USA), to test the fidelity to which seasonal ecosystem-level variability is reflected in enamel carbon and oxygen isotope values. d(13)C values across all individuals and sampled teeth fell within-21%o and 15.8%o, thereby indicating a diet dominated by C-3 vegetation throughout the spring, summer, fall and winter months. We find significant (p < 0.05) inter-individual differences in the means of M-1 , M-2 and M-3 d(13)C and d(18)O values, with the exception of M-2 d(18)O values. M-1 d(13)C values were consistently depleted, while d(18)O values were consistently enriched (relative to M-2 and M-3) across all individuals sampled, likely indicative of pre weaning, milk-dominated diet. Finally, there was little change in d(18)O values across the M-1 , M-2 and M-3 despite dramatic fluctuations in temperature at the PNWR. We hypothesize that the primary driver of this pattern is the depletion of M-2 d(18)O values due to the amount effect. These data support a complex relationship between enamel isotopic variation and the fluctuation of abiotic and biotic ecosystem variables that should be more fully considered in paleoecological analyses.

AB  - Pile burning is the most common method of logging residue disposal in Rocky Mountain forests. Though the high temperatures reached during burning affect numerous soil properties in the short term, the longer-term effects of the practice are less clear. We previously identified a 50-year time series of burn scars created after clear cut harvesting in lodgepole pine stands where we reported sparse tree colonization across the entire chronosequence. Here we analyzed soil nutrients and chemistry and conducted in situ and greenhouse seedling bioassays to determine whether edaphic factors or poor seedling performance explain the pattern. Pile burning had a lasting effect on soil pH, but nutrient availability was 2?3 times higher in burn scars compared to unburned forest soils for many constituents and planted pine seedlings had good survival and growth. However, seedling growth was slightly less in burn scars compared to unburned soils indicating suboptimal soil pH or other belowground factors may contribute to sparse tree colonization of the openings. For example, seedling survival and ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization were both lowest in the most recently created scars where soils were alkaline and improved with time as pH declined, suggesting gradual amelioration of post-fire growing conditions. Survival in burn scars was comparable for unprotected trees and those in protective mesh tubes, indicating that herbivory was not a significant impediment to seedling establishment. However, a preliminary study suggests that seed predation may have contributed to the low tree colonization into the openings. Though large burn pile scars may require soil rehabilitation, and soil changes may have a lasting effect on understory plant composition, we found that they were not a significant barrier to tree establishment in these moderate-size burn scars.

AB  - Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence-absence (PA) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only (PO) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, PA data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive PO datasets. Joint-likelihood ISDMs can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit ISDMs to empirical data, using PA and PO data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km(2) resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit ISDMs to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.

AB  - Ungulate conservation directly affects conservation of their predators and habitats. Assessing conservation status of ungulates found in the mountains is particularly challenging given the tough terrain and extreme weather. This is true for Central and South Asia's mountains which harbour high ungulate diversity. Urial Ovis vignei, a Vulnerable wild sheep, occurs patchily across Asian mountains. Ladakh urial Ovis vignei vignei is a subspecies restricted to Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan in the trans-Himalaya. Poor understanding of its conservation status has limited conservation efforts in the region. We conducted a distribution survey using single-season single-species occupancy, with spatial replicates accounting for auto-correlated replicate-level presence across the entire potential urial habitat (3425km(2)) in Ladakh, India. We then identified remaining populations and conducted double-observer surveys to estimate densities. We found urial to use only 32% (16-53%) of its presumed range. We estimated densities of 1.27 (1.27-1.39) urial km(-2) and 0.96 (0.96-1.10) urial km(-2) across the two landscapes covering 18% of surveyed area. These two areas are currently the last remaining strongholds for the species in India, yet densities were lower than expected when compared to previous studies. Urial distribution in India overlaps with human use like habitations, livestock grazing, and roads, hence effective conservation of the species will need involvement of local communities. We propose annual monitoring of urial and setting up community-based livestock-free reserves across the two landscapes. More such robust investigations at meaningful large scales are needed to direct conservation action for the understudied mountain ungulates of high Asia.

AB  - Better knowledge of genetic relationships between the Fortymile caribou herd and its neighbors is needed for conservation decision-making in Canada. Here, we contribute the first fine-scale analysis of genetic population structure in nine contiguous caribou herds at the geographic boundaries between Barren-ground and Northern Mountain caribou, and at the Alaska-Yukon border. Using pairwise differentiation metrics, STRUCTURE, and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) to analyze 15 microsatellite loci in 379 caribou, we found complex patterns of genetic differentiation. The Fortymile was the only herd assigned to more than one genetic cluster, indicative of its history as a larger herd whose range expansions and gene flow to other herds were likely important to maintaining diversity across a functioning genetic metapopulation. Some small herds (Chisana, Klaza, and White Mountains) were genetically distinct, while others (Hart River, Clear Creek, Mentasta) exhibited little differentiation from herds they occasionally overlap, including herds assigned to different conservation units (DUs). This genetic connectivity does not result from demographic connectivity, as episodic contact during rut, rather than herd switching, is the likely mechanism. Unusually, one small herd (White Mountains) maintained genetic differentiation despite rut overlap with Fortymile. Our data reveal that some herds with different ecological and behavioral attributes are demographically independent but nonetheless genetically connected. Thus, we suggest that managing caribou for an appropriate level of genetic connectivity, while also supporting herd persistence, will be essential to conserve caribou genetic diversity in the region.

AB  - Density and abundance estimates are critical to effective wildlife management and are essential for monitoring population trends and setting effective quotas for harvesting. Management of roan (Hippotragus equinus) and sable (H. niger) antelopes in Mudumu National Park (MNP), Namibia, is challenging because they are elusive, naturally unmarked, and believed to occur at low densities. The species are threatened by habitat fragmentation, human population growth, and illegal hunting, and reliable density and abundance estimates have not been quantified, hampering management and conservation plans. Our objective was to estimate roan and sable densities and abundances using the time in front of the camera model (TIFC) and the Poisson-binomial N-mixture model (PB), respectively. We also evaluated the effects of environmental and ecological variables on roan and sable abundance. We used data from two camera trap surveys conducted between March and September 2021 in the MNP. Results showed that the TIFC model provided low-density estimates of 1.62 (95% CI 1.61-1.64) roans/km2 and 2.46 (95% CI 2.42-2.50) sables/km2, consistent with trends reported in Africa where these species occur at low densities. In addition, the total abundance of roans and sables in the MNP from the PB model were 57 and 242, respectively. Higher roan abundance occurred in sites with higher grass cover. This study provides the first accurate camera trap-derived density and abundance estimates for roan and sable in the MNP, which will be critical for developing comprehensive conservation programs and strategies that are likely to reduce the risk of extinction for both species.

AB  - The dual mandate for many protected areas (PAs) to simultaneously promote recreation and conserve biodiversity may be hampered by negative effects of recreation on wildlife. However, reports of these effects are not consistent, presenting a knowledge gap that hinders evidence-based decision-making. We used camera traps to monitor human activity and terrestrial mammals in Golden Ears Provincial Park and the adjacent University of British Columbia Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Vancouver, Canada, with the objective of discerning relative effects of various forms of recreation on cougars (Puma concolor), black bears (Ursus americanus), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Additionally, public closures of the study area associated with the COVD-19 pandemic offered an unprecedented period of human-exclusion through which to explore these effects. Using Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models, we detected negative effects of hikers (mean posterior estimate = -0.58, 95% credible interval [CI] -1.09 to -0.12) on weekly bobcat habitat use and negative effects of motorized vehicles (estimate = -0.28, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.05) on weekly black bear habitat use. We also found increased cougar detection rates in the PA during the COVID-19 closure (estimate = 0.007, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.009), but decreased cougar detection rates (estimate = -0.006, 95% CI -0.009 to -0.003) and increased black-tailed deer detection rates (estimate = 0.014, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.026) upon reopening of the PA. Our results emphasize that effects of human activity on wildlife habitat use and movement may be species- and/or activity-dependent, and that camera traps can be an invaluable tool for monitoring both wildlife and human activity, collecting data even when public access is barred. Further, we encourage PA managers seeking to promote both biodiversity conservation and recreation to explicitly assess trade-offs between these two goals in their PAs.

AB  - Background: It is widely accepted that certain leaf traits indicating leaf quality play an important role in regulating insect herbivory. Numerous studies have attempted to find a clear relationship between insect herbivory and leaf traits. However, the results are inconsistent. In particular, it is still unclear whether leaf traits of a tree species affect insect herbivory in the field. Methods: We examined the effects of leaf traits including structural defensive traits (specific leaf area), nutritional traits (nitrogen content, water content, and soluble sugar content), and chemical defensive traits (tannin content and carbon content) on variation of insect herbivory among three forest strata (vertical variability) and 18 locations (horizontal variability) in a Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis) forest landscape. Results: Vertically, insect herbivory in the low -canopy stratum was significantly higher than in the other strata, but variation of leaf traits among strata had little explanatory power for the vertical pattern of insect herbivory. Horizontally, leaf carbon content had weak negative effects on insect herbivory while leaf tannin content had weak and divergent effects on insect herbivory in different strata. Conclusions: Leaf traits selected in this study have weak effects on insect herbivory in the Chinese cork oak forests we studied. These effects may be masked by other abiotic and biotic factors, but further examination is needed.

AB  - The African lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus, 1758) has evolved complex associations in which individual survival is an interplay of cooperation among pride members. Although feeding behaviors of African lions are widely known, our understanding of how age and sex classes affect per capita intake of other individual members in a pride remains unclear. This study used long-term population monitoring data collected from 2004 to 2023 to assess how prey size and feeding group composition affect different age/sex class interactions and per capita food intake of African lion cubs, subadults, adult males, and adult females. The results indicate that African lion feeding group composition and interaction patterns at carcasses were affected by prey size. Cub per capita food intake was reduced by increased numbers of cubs and subadults. For subadults, the per capita intake was reduced as the number of cubs, subadults, and adult females increased. However, subadults increased their per capita intake rates when feeding together with both cubs and adult females. Adult females also showed competitive interactions when feeding at carcasses with cubs, subadults, and fellow adult females. Nevertheless, the adult female per capita intake was increased when more females fed with cubs or subadults and when feeding in combination with cubs and adult males. For adult male lions, only increased numbers of adult females led to a reduced per capita intake at carcasses, reflecting competition. These varied effects on per capita food intake suggest how age and sex-based composition of feeding groups play a role in the foraging success of African lions and how food availability may influence the demographic composition of prides.

AB  - Information on essential resource requirements and characteristics of livestock predation is crucial for formulating a better conservation strategy for leopards in a human-dominated landscape. We assessed food habits and characteristics of livestock predation in the human-dominated landscape of South Gujarat, India, using scat analysis (n = 350) and secondary information from forest department reports (n = 780). Leopards consumed 17 prey species, with pigs contributing the most (44%) to the leopards' diet, while domestic horses contributed the least (1%). Leopards preyed upon four domestic species: goats (47%), cows (43%), buffaloes (6%), and horses (2%). Young individuals of livestock were most commonly targeted by leopards, and livestock species were predominantly preyed upon during the evening or night time. Livestock were most vulnerable to predation when tied in open areas and least vulnerable while grazing. Our results highlight the significant role of pigs as the main prey and their contribution to mitigating livestock predation. Additionally, improving cattle shed structures and implementing night guarding could help reduce livestock predation. This study also addresses the knowledge gap regarding leopard ecology in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Along the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) coast, natural resource managers continually struggle with managing coastal uplands due to front-end costs, prolonged maintenance, and habitat-specific ecological needs. Prescribed fire, mechanical removal, and chemical treatments are common habitat management techniques used to remove invasive species, clear understory, and achieve other management goals. However, rapid development and changing climate exacerbate the difficulty in using these techniques. A potential alternative or complementary technique is using livestock for habitat management (i.e., targeted or controlled grazing). In other regions of the world, using livestock for conservation or restoration of managed lands has shown to be a less intrusive and more financially viable alternative. To better understand the research needs, logistical, and environmental concerns related to using livestock for habitat management in the coastal uplands of the GoM, we developed and distributed a survey to three groups of land users, including natural resource managers, researchers, and live-stock producers in the region. Survey results show that over 96% of respondents are interested in using livestock for habitat management, but less than 10% of respondents were aware of any information that could be used to inform grazing practices for coastal upland habitat management along the Gulf of Mexico coast. There were differences among surveyed groups, but generally small-sized cattle breeds and goats were identified as the livestock with the most potential for environmental benefit and ease of containment. General concerns and areas for further investigation were implementation (e.g., which livestock type to use and grazing intensity), logistical considerations (e.g., fencing and rotational frequency), impacts of grazing on water quality, wildlife, vegetation, and livestock nutrition. Survey respondents overwhelmingly (at least 75% of each group) indicated that livestock grazing ideally would not be a standalone management practice and should be used in conjunction with other habitat management techniques such as prescribed burns, mechanical clearing, or chemical treatments. The results of the survey could be used to develop applied research projects and guidance documents that directly address informational needs related to using livestock for habitat management of coastal uplands along the Gulf of Mexico coast.

AB  - Abiotic environmental conditions can significantly influence the way species interact. In particular, plant-herbivore interactions can be substantially dependent on temperature and nutrients. The overall product of these relationships is critical for the fate and stability of vegetated ecosystems like marine forests. The last few decades have seen a rapid spread of barrens on temperate rocky reefs mainly as a result of overgrazing. The ecological feedbacks that characterize the barren state involve a different set of interactions than those occurring in vegetated habitats. Reversing these trends requires a proper understanding of the novel feedbacks and the conditions under which they operate. Here, we explored the role of a secondary herbivore in reinforcing the stability of barrens formed by sea urchin overgrazing under different nutrient conditions. Combining comparative and experimental studies in two Mediterranean regions characterized by contrasting nutrient conditions, we assessed: (i) if the creation of barren areas enhances limpet abundance, (ii) the size-specific grazing impact by limpets, and (iii) the ability of limpets alone to maintain barrens. Our results show that urchin overgrazing enhanced limpet abundance. The effects of limpet grazing varied with nutrient conditions, being up to five times more intense under oligotrophic conditions. Limpets were able to maintain barrens in the absence of sea urchins only under low-nutrient conditions, enhancing the stability of the depauperate state. Overall, our study suggests a greater vulnerability of subtidal forests in oligotrophic regions of the Mediterranean and demonstrates the importance of environment conditions in regulating feedbacks mediated by plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - In Southeast Asia, seagrass meadows are under threat through coastal development and increased pollution, but remain understudied. The dugong is a marine herbivore that is dependent on the availability of seagrass as a primary food source. In this study, we assess the patterns of co-occurrence between dugongs and seagrass. We hypothesize that the changing spatial patterns of dugong feeding are positively correlated to the seasonal variation in distribution and abundance of mixed species in subtidal tropical seagrass meadows. We documented seagrass cover and dugong feeding trails in the Sibu Archipelago meadow in Johor, Malaysia, across the monsoon seasons of 2016-2017 using an underwater towed video method. Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics were used to quantify the degree of clustering in feeding trails, feeding patch size, and to identify feeding hotspots and coldspots. This site has the single largest subtidal meadow in Peninsular Malaysia known to date, measuring 12.88 km2. The study captured a reduction in seagrass extent and coverage during the study. Feeding trail occurrence averaged three per image throughout the seasons, with the maximum number being 14 trails per image. Dugongs fed in a spatially clustered manner leaving two distinct feeding trail patterns: (1) a dispersed pattern when seagrass cover was high or low (76-100% and 0-25%) that resulted in larger patch sizes, and (2) a concentrated pattern in moderate seagrass cover (26-75%) that resulted in smaller patch size. Feeding hotspots and coldspots had significantly different seagrass cover, suggesting that dugongs foraged strategically within the meadow. Our results demonstrate that seagrass cover played a significant role in driving dugong feeding patterns and in creating feeding hotspots and coldspots in tropical subtidal meadows.

AB  - BackgroundThe Egyptian buffalo has a sizable impact on Egypt's agricultural sector and food supply. It is regarded as the main dairy animal and an important source of red meat. This study aimed to detect the polymorphisms of the DGAT1 and TCAP genes and assess the potential impact of the discovered nsSNPs on the stability of the tertiary structure polypeptides of selected genes in Egyptian buffalo.MethodsAllele identification was made by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were recognized by sequencing the purified PCR products. Protein translation indicated the synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs, and the peptides' 3D tertiary structure of selected genes, as well as the effect of amino acid substitution on the protein structure, was performed using bioinformatics tools.ResultsAnalysis of the data revealed that an nsSNP was detected in a tested region of the DGAT1 gene and caused an amino acid substitution in a polypeptide that was predicted to be neutral and located in the coiled part of the protein. The analysis of the TCAP gene showed four nsSNPs that caused four substitutions located in the alpha-helix region. Protein prediction analysis showed that the amino acid substitutions in DGAT1 and TCAP were non-conserved with low sensitivity to variation. The non-conservative amino acid substitutions result in amino acids with new properties different from the original amino acid that change the protein's structure and function.ConclusionWe can infer that the DGAT1 and TCAP genes' SNPs may affect meat-related traits and may improve meat quality.

AB  - Human-wildlife coexistence in shared landscapes requires effectively navigating different stakeholder interests. Despite progress in this field, most studies focus on a limited number of "problematic" wildlife species. This narrow scope overlooks the species-specific nature of human-wildlife interactions. To identify general patterns in stakeholder perceptions of diverse wildlife species, we implemented a modified 3i (interest, influence, impact) method to assess how individuals within seven stakeholder groups (crop farmers, livestock farmers, foresters, hunters, tourism operators, protected area managers, and staff of environmental non-governmental organizations) rated their interest in, their influence on, and how they are impacted by twelve wildlife species categories: moose, red deer, wild reindeer, chamois, roe deer, brown bear, wild boar, grey wolf, European ground squirrel, cormorant, eagles, and vultures (some of them were site-specific). The study design consisted of two steps: 1) assessing expert perceptions of the 3i for each stakeholder-species combination in each of the five study areas in Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Spain, and 2) assessing stakeholder (251 individuals) perceptions of the 3i. We found substantial variation in stakeholder perceptions across groups, sites, and species categories. Within-group heterogeneity and individual respondents belonging to multiple stakeholder categories further challenged simplistic assumptions of distinct and well-defined stakeholder perspectives. Expert perceptions often underestimated stakeholder interest in wildlife species categories and occasionally diverged from stakeholder-perceptions of influence and impact. Notably, perceived impacts of brown bears, wolves, and eagles often exceeded the perceived influence on these species categories, underscoring a sense of powerlessness in managing interactions in some sites. Our study provides a comparative framework for understanding major patterns in key conservation conflicts in Europe, and emphasizes the importance of addressing contextualized stakeholder diversity and heterogeneity for more effective co-management of human-wildlife coexistence. These findings offer actionable pathways for improving conservation outcomes and participatory wildlife management across Europe.

AB  - Psammotermes allocerus Silvestri, 1908 is the only described species representing the genus Psammotermes Desneux, 1902 in Southern Africa. The large geographical range of this subterranean termite covers both summer and winter rainfall regimes. Deadwood is the preferred food when available, but in more arid habitats, both live and dead grasses form the major dietary component. Along the Namib Desert margins, the species' localised herbivory creates circular bare patches known as fairy circles. For a regional phylogeographic study of this species, we sampled 65 sand termite populations within drier parts of Namibia, South Africa, and Angola. Based on combined molecular and ecological data, we found considerable genetic diversification within P. allocerus. Analyses of two mitochondrial markers (COI, COII), including a Bayesian inference tree, haplotype analysis and genetic distances suggest a delineation into seven highly differentiated genetic groups. The 'Succulent Karoo' group is additionally characterised by unique features of the royal chamber, nest and tunnel system. In conclusion, our data suggest that P. allocerus should be not regarded as one species but as a species complex. Termites of each analysed group 'Northern Namib', 'Western Kalahari Basin', 'Nama', 'Southwestern Kalahari', 'East Gariep', 'Southern Namib' and 'Succulent Karoo' should be considered as distinct species. The species name P. allocerus should be used for termites of the 'Succulent Karoo'.

AB  - Natural selection favors individuals with the highest inclusive fitness (i.e., total number of descendants). In cases where one sex is more productive, one or both parents may maximize their inclusive fitness by investing in the offspring of the more prolific sex. Such preferential production can lead to skewed sex ratios at various life history stages, including at birth, resulting in secondary sex ratio bias. Several competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain observed variation in secondary sex ratios including Fisher's frequency dependence and two hypotheses related to maternal condition: Trivers-Willard and the local resource hypotheses. Although it has been shown that maternal condition can influence the number of offspring produced in white-tailed deer, there is no consensus as to which of the hypotheses drives sex ratio bias in wild populations. Using a spatiotemporally extensive dataset of pregnant white-tailed deer from Mississippi, USA, we examined fetal sex ratio in relation to the Fisherian frequency-dependence hypothesis and hypotheses related to maternal condition. While there was a male-sex ratio bias in pregnant females that reduced in intensity with the number of offspring, there was no support for condition-related hypotheses. Instead, secondary sex ratios for white-tailed deer in Mississippi were nearly consistent with Fisherian frequency dependence. Our findings add to the body of literature on secondary sex biases in white-tailed deer and help inform sex bias ratios for a southern population of a cervid of management importance in the US.

However, terrigenous biomarkers can decompose in soils, can be stored and redeposited in colluvium and on flood-plains prior to their ultimate deposition in lakes. These and other effects can blur and distort biomarker signals. Therefore, we analysed sediments from two maars in Westeifel to evaluate whether signals of the faecal biomarkers (5 beta-stanols, bile acids) demonstrate statistically significant differences between contrasting periods in land-use intensity. In Holzmaar, palaeoenvironmental data showed evidence for agriculture including cereal cultivation and grassland during the pre-Roman Iron Age and Middle Ages compared with those from periods that were less influenced by land use and showed a higher abundance of broadleaf forest. However, the specific domesticated taxa of livestock in the locale from these periods remain speculative. We found statistically significantly different faecal biomarker signals, which we interpret to be related to an enhanced deposition of faeces of horses, pigs and ruminants in the core sections that represented periods of amplified land use. The analyses of grass- and broadleaf-tree characteristic n-alkanes supported the applicability of biomarkers for land-use reconstruction. Stanol data from a core section dating to the Mesolithic showed no clear results. Analyses of two core sections from Ulmener Maar, which covered periods before and after the decline of elm in the Neolithic, indicated input of pig faeces in the younger section. This study provides important evidence that faecal biomarkers can be used for land-use reconstruction in central European lakes with small catchment areas for time periods from the Neolithic onwards. The results underscore the importance of bile acid analyses in addition to stanol analyses for an identification of faeces inputs from different animals.

AB  - Seabed hydrocarbon seeps present natural laboratories for investigating responses of marine ecosystems to petroleum input. A hydrocarbon seep near Scott Inlet, Baffin Bay, was visited for in situ observations and sampling in the summer of 2018. Video evidence of an active hydrocarbon seep was confirmed by methane and hydrocarbon analysis of the overlying water column, which is 260 in at this site. Elevated methane concentrations in bottom water above and down current from the seep decreased to background seawater levels in the mid-water column >150 in above the seafloor. Seafloor microbial mats morphologically resembling sulfide-oxidizing bacteria surrounded areas of bubble ebullition. Calcareous tube worms, brittle stars, shrimp, sponges, sea stars, sea anemones, sea urchins, small fish and soft corals were observed near the seep, with soft corals showing evidence for hydrocarbon incorporation. Sediment microbial communities included putative methane-oxidizing Methyloproftiridus, sulfate-reducing Desollobulbacecie and sulfide-oxidizing Sulfurovton. A metabolic gene diagnostic for aerobic methanotrophs (pmoA) was detected in the sediment and bottom water above the seep epicentre and up to 5 km away. Both 16S rRNA gene and pmoA amplicon sequencing revealed that pelagic microbial communities oriented along the geologic basement rise associated with methane seepage (running SW to NE) differed from communities in off-axis water up to 5 km away. Relative abundances of aerobic methanotrophs and putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were elevated in the bottom water clown current from the seep. Detection of bacterial clades typically associated with hydrocarbon and methane oxidation highlights the importance of Arctic marine microbial communities in mitigating hydrocarbon emissions from natural geologic sources.

AB  - Adaptive management of large herbivores requires an understanding of how spatial-temporal fluctuations in forage biomass and quality influence animal performance. Advances in remote sensing have yielded information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of forage biomass, which in turn have informed rangeland management decisions such as stocking rate and paddock selection for free-ranging cattle. However, less is known about the spatial-temporal patterns of diet quality and their influence on large herbivore performance. This is due to infrequent concurrent ground observations of forage conditions with performance (e.g., mass gain), and previously limited satellite data at fine spatial and temporal scales. We combined multi-temporal field observations of diet quality (weekly) and mass gain (monthly) with satellite-derived phenological metrics (pseudo-daily, using data fusion and interpolation) to model daily mass gains of free-ranging yearling cattle in shortgrass steppe. We used this model to predict grazing season (mid-May to October) mass gains, a key management indicator, across 40 different paddocks grazed over a 10-year period (n = 138). We found strong relationships between diet quality and the satellite-derived phenological metrics, especially metrics related to the timing and rate of green-up and senescence. Satellite-derived diet quality estimates were strong predictors of monthly mass gains (R-2 = 0.68) across a wide range of aboveground net herbaceous production. Season-long predictions of average daily gain and cattle off-mass had mean absolute errors of 8.9% and 2.9%, respectively. The model performed better temporally (across repeated observations in the same paddock) than spatially (across all paddocks within a given year), highlighting the need for accurate vegetation maps and robust field data collection across both space and time. This study demonstrates that free-ranging cattle performance in rangelands is strongly affected by diet quality, which is related to the timing of vegetation green-up and senescence. Senescing vegetation suppressed mass gains, even if adequate forage was available. The satellite-based pseudo-daily approach presented here offers new opportunities for adaptive management of large herbivores, such as identifying within-season triggers to move livestock among paddocks, predicting wildlife herd health, or timing the grazing season to better match earlier spring green-up caused by climate change and plant species invasion.

AB  - Composting is an effective strategy to process agricultural and urban waste into forms that may be beneficial to crops. The objectives of this orchard field study were to characterize how a dairy manure compost and a food waste compost influenced: (1) soil nitrogen and carbon pools, (2) bacterial and nematode soil food webs and (3) tree growth and leaf N. The effects of composts were compared with fertilized and unfertilized control plots over two years in a newly planted almond orchard. Both dairy manure compost and food waste compost increased soil organic matter pools, as well as soil nitrate and ammonium at certain time points. Both composts also distinctly altered bacterial communities after application, specifically those groups with carbon degrading potential, and increased populations of bacterial feeding nematodes, although in different timeframes. Unique correlations were observed between nematode and bacterial groups within compost treatments that were not present in controls. Food waste compost increased trunk diameters compared to controls and had greater relative abundance of herbivorous root tip feeding nematodes. Results suggest that recycled waste composts contribute to biologically based nitrogen cycling and can increase tree growth, mainly within the first year after application.

AB  - Cervid populations introduced to favorable habitats in confinement often increase excessively without predators and hunting. Overabundant deer populations impact the ecosystems and may cause damages to agriculture and forestry. Long-term count data on the changes in a deer population is essential to understand the relationship between the population dynamics and the natural vegetation. The introduced sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1836) population without predators on Nakanoshima Island, Hokkaido, Japan, showed repeated irruptions and declines with mass mortality and irregular culling between 1980s and 2000s. The overabundant deer significantly altered the natural vegetation, and density-dependent changes in population parameters such as body size and reproduction were observed. Here, we present the drive count and culling data to examine the population dynamics during 1980-2023. Deer were counted by 20-30 walking drivers and 2-3 observers on boats once per year in February or March. The number of counted deer rapidly increased from the original three introduced around 1960 to >270 deer (the first peak) in two decades and decreased by half due to starvation and the first culling. Thereafter, the number of counted deer continued to increase with a lower growth rate, reached a higher peak (>400, the second peak) than the first irruption in two decades, and decreased again by half due to starvation and the second culling. Although the number of counted deer increased again up to >300 in several years, it decreased and was maintained at around 100 deer with the annual culling program since 2012.

AB  - Understanding the trophic and demographic dynamics of apex predators is of paramount importance for ecosystem conservation. Apex predators are usually free from predation, and thus, the main driver of population dynamics is the availability of trophic resources, which affects breeding performance. Albeit food habits have been described in many apex species, the effects of changes in the trophic niche on long-term demographic dynamics are poorly known. We describe the long-term (N = 25 years) changes in trophic niche breadth of a recovering golden eagle population in a Mediterranean landscape (northern Spain) and search for potential correlates with their productivity (i.e., number of fledged eaglets per controlled pair) as a proxy for their breeding performance (N = 290 pair-years). We identified a total of 3475 prey items from 77 species; rabbits, hares, and red-legged partridges were the most frequent prey consumed (overall 51%), followed by roe deer (10%), red-billed chough, red foxes, and woodpigeons, all of them with >5%. Prey diversity in eagles' diet decreased during the study period. Consumption of rabbits and roe deer increased, while that of hares and partridges decreased; no significant trends were observed in the consumption of foxes, choughs, and woodpigeons. Prey diversity and red-legged partridge consumption were negatively correlated with productivity at the territory level, while rabbits, corvids, and pigeons showed a strong positive relationship with productivity. The size of the territory showed the strongest positive relationship with productivity, while roughness was negatively correlated. Rabbits and ungulates showed negative and positive correlations with roughness, respectively, while predator consumption exhibited a negative relationship with the size of the territory. Our findings give insights into the potential trophic mechanisms driving the dynamics of recovering apex predator populations; a reduction in the trophic niche breadth toward specific groups of prey, which could be due to a higher availability and individual specificity toward these prey species, might enhance productivity at the territory level and, ultimately, influence population dynamics facilitating the recovery process. The remarkable increase in the consumption of wild ungulates, predators, and other apex consumers suggests that the current population recovery and reduced trophic niche breadth may facilitate this eagle population to exhibit its apex role and contribute to ecosystem functionality.

AB  - BackgroundThe habitat use of wild ungulates is determined by forage availability, but also the avoidance of predation and human disturbance. They should apply foraging strategies that provide the most energy at the lowest cost. However, due to data limitations at the scale of movement trajectories, it is not clear to what extent even well-studied species such as red deer (Cervus elaphus) trade-off between forage quality and quantity, especially in heterogeneous alpine habitats characterized by short vegetation periods.MethodsWe used remote sensing data to derive spatially continuous forage quality and quantity information. To predict relative nitrogen (i.e. forage quality) and biomass (i.e. forage quantity), we related field data to predictor variables derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data. In particular, our approach employed random forest regression algorithms, integrating various remote sensing variables such as reflectance values, vegetation indices and optical traits derived from a radiative transfer model. We combined these forage characteristics with variables representing human activity, and applied integrated step selection functions to estimate sex-specific summer habitat selection of red deer in open habitats within and around the Swiss National Park, an alpine Strict Nature Reserve.ResultsThe combination of vegetation indices and optical traits greatly improved predictive power in both the biomass (R2 = 0.60, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 88.55 g/m2) and relative nitrogen models (R2 = 0.34, RMSE = 0.28%). Both female and male red deer selected more strongly for biomass (estimate = 0.672 +/- 0.059 SE for normalised values for females, and 0.507 +/- 0.061 for males) than relative nitrogen (estimate = 0.124 +/- 0.062 for females, and 0.161 +/- 0.061 for males, respectively). Females showed higher levels of use of the Swiss National Park.ConclusionsRed deer in summer habitats select forage quantity over quality with little difference between sexes. Females respond more strongly to human activities and thus prefer the Swiss National Park. Our results demonstrate the capability of satellite data to estimate forage quality and quantity separately for movement ecology studies, going beyond the exclusive use of conventional vegetation indices.

AB  - Invasive alien slugs alter plant community assemblages via selective herbivory, yet evidence of their impacts on indigenous plant species in threatened Australian native grasslands are scarce. Carabid beetles have been explored as biocontrol agents of pest slugs in agriculture, with native grassland habitat adjoining agricultural fields thought to be a potential source of beneficial carabid predators. The association between indigenous carabid beetles and invasive alien slugs within remnant native grassland vegetation patches, however, is unquantified. Studies were conducted to identify (i) The extent and determinants of slug invasion into remnant native grassland, and (ii) Whether carabid beetles can confer biotic resistance to native plant species in remnant grasslands. The interaction between alien slugs, carabid beetles and a rare grassland forb was explored in microcosm experiments to test the hypothesis that carabid beetles, by regulating slug herbivory, influence plant survival and growth. Slugs were found at 90% of the remnant native grasslands surveyed; carabid beetles were infrequent and their active abundance was low. There was little evidence that landscape or site-level parameters influence slug density, although species-specific patterns were apparent for the two most abundant slug species. This may reflect the importance of propagule pressure from source populations (the agricultural matrix) affecting slug invasion success, suggesting that native grassland habitat features are of secondary importance. The microcosm experiments provided evidence that slug herbivory may significantly impact the survival of a native forb at the seedling stage, but less so at a mature plant stage. We found that carabid beetles can markedly reduce the impact of alien slugs on plants, provided that encounters between the two taxa occurs. Interactions in the field are likely to be density-dependent such that beneficial impacts of carabid beetles are only apparent when their abundance is high. The high abundance of alien slugs in remnant grasslands, and lack of evidence for biotic resistance via carabid beetle predation, indicates that grassland conservation management may need to include slug baiting to mitigate the potential for negative impacts of slugs on seedling recruitment of threatened native plant species.

AB  - Fruiting trees provide important fruit and seed resources for various animal species, but rarely are they considered to be rich sources of insects as well. During a study of seed dispersal of Trewia nudiflora (Euphorbiaceae) using camera traps in Nepal, we observed four tropical deer species (Axis axis, Muntiacus vaginalis, Rusa unicolor, Axis porcinus) foraging for insects, rather than fruits under the trees. These herbivorous deer are proven seed dispersers of Trewia, but 8%-38% of video captures (across each species) were of insectivory, rather than frugivory. The deer chased and consumed red cotton bugs (Dysdercus sp. family Pyrrhocoridae), which were seed predators that hoarded Trewia seeds. It is likely that other unidentified insect species were also consumed. Tropical deer species are considered to be fully herbivorous, so our observations extend their known diets and possibly indicate a seasonal requirement for protein. These findings also highlight tri-trophic interactions among deer, insects, and fruits that could have important implications for seedling recruitment if seed predators are being consumed by seed dispersers (in addition to fruit consumption).

AB  - Characterizing the cell type-specific transcriptome is crucial for understanding the cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution and complex phenotypes. Here, single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) is used to construct a cell transcriptomic atlas of 397,011 cells, representing 57 cell types, from 12 tissues in river and swamp buffalo, which exhibit significant divergence in milk production. Differential expression analyses identify metabolic and secretory tissues (i.e., liver, mammary gland, and pituitary) and cell types (e.g., hepatocytes, luminal cells, somatotropes, and lactotropes) that mediate the divergence of milk production. Lactotrope-specific downregulation of TRHDE in river buffalo is associated with high milk production. Integrative analyses of sc/snRNA-seq data with genomic data in buffalo and cattle reveal key cell types (e.g., luminal cells and excitatory neurons) and genes (e.g., RPL13 and LALBA) associated with milk production. Ultimately, the Buffalo Cell Atlas (http://bovomicshub.com) will serve as a valuable resource for advancing buffalo genetics and genomics research, enabling cross-species comparative transcriptome studies and providing deeper insights into the regulation of milk synthesis and secretion.

AB  - The Southern Ocean has been disproportionately affected by climate change and is therefore an ideal place to study the influence of changing environmental conditions on ecosystems. Changes in the demography of predator populations are indicators of broader shifts in food web structure, but long-term data are required to study these effects. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from Macquarie Island have consistently decreased in population size while all other major populations across the Southern Ocean have recently stabilized or are increasing. Two long-term mark-recapture studies (1956-1967 and 1993-2009) have monitored this population, which provides an opportunity to investigate demographic performance over a range of climatic conditions. Using a 9-state matrix population model, we estimated climate influences on female survival by incorporating two major climatic indices into our model: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Our best model included a 1 year lagged effect of SAM and an unlagged SOI as covariates. A positive relationship with SAM1 (lagged) related the previous year's SAM with juvenile survival, potentially due to changes in local prey availability surrounding Macquarie Island. The unlagged SOI had a negative effect on both juvenile and adult seals, indicating that sea ice dynamics and access to foraging grounds on the East Antarctic continental shelf could explain the different contributions of ENSO events on the survival of females in this population.

AB  - Main conclusionHair lichen photoprotection involves algal and fungal strategies while hydrated, with pale lichens compensating weak fungal cortical pigments through high, rapidly induced non-photochemical quenching by the photobiont.AbstractHair lichens play vital roles in boreal forests by influencing nutrient cycles, microclimates, and providing habitats for invertebrates and forage for animals. This study examines two widespread and dominant species, Bryoria fuscescens and Alectoria sarmentosa, which possess different fungal pigments-dark light-absorbing melanin in Bryoria, and pale reflecting usnic acid in Alectoria. These cortical pigments affect species distribution, with Bryoria favoring sun-exposed forest canopies due to its efficient light-protective melanin, while Alectoria thrives in partly shaded, moist environments. By investigating sympatric populations, we explored whether non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) compensates for Alectoria's less-effective sun-screening pigment. Our results reveal that Alectoria exhibits higher and more rapidly induced NPQ compared to Bryoria, along with faster recovery from photoinhibition. The flexibility and rapid response of Alectoria's NPQ help mitigate high-light stress, optimizing growth in fluctuating light environments. These compensatory mechanisms suggest that, despite weaker cortical pigmentation, hydrated Alectoria can sustain photosynthesis and recover from light-induced damage more efficiently. However, because NPQ does not function in the desiccated state-where efficient sun-screening by cortical pigments is essential-Alectoria is confined to humid and sheltered forest canopies in drier macroclimates but not in rainforest climates. This study underscores the adaptive strategies of both photobionts and mycobionts in hydrated hair lichens to manage varying light conditions in boreal forests, highlighting NPQ as a compensating mechanism in lichen photoprotection. It advances our understanding by illustrating how the transition from dry to wet conditions amplifies the algal partner's contribution to overall photoprotection.

AB  - The artisanal fishing in the Bay of Bengal has been characterized by complex heterogeneity. A lack of comprehensive data on threatened elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), including guitarfish, hinders evidence-based management. This study evaluated the status of guitarfish, focusing on the effects of artisanal fishing and the socioeconomic circumstances of fishers impacting catch and perceived catch trends. The impacts were assessed spatially and temporally in coastal Bangladesh. Interviews were conducted with 150 artisanal fishers in primary fish landing locations and fishing communities. The analysis showed a notable decrease in the perceived catch of various guitarfish species. Catch decreased significantly for Glaucostegus granulatus, sharpnose guitarfish, and Rhina ancylostoma, bowmouth guitarfish in the past decade. The decrease was linked to overfishing, illegal/harmful fishing techniques and injuries from fishing equipment. Fishing-related (soak time, gear, depth at fishing and vessel length) and socioeconomic drivers (income and debt levels) were found to impact guitarfish catch levels. Socioeconomic factors complicate the situation because these factors influence fishers' fishing habits, perspectives and decision-making. Guitarfish were caught both as a target and incidentally. Most captures occurred in the southcentral region of Bangladesh. Four hotspots of guitarfish catches were identified based on the fishers' knowledge. The critical habitats in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta mouth area are vital habitats for guitarfish, highlighting the need to protect these ecosystems using spatial management tools. To tackle the complex issues of guitarfish conservation, the local fishing communities need a holistic strategy combining biological knowledge, socioeconomic factors and specific codesigned initiatives. Although fishers may lack formal education, there is a distinct potential for specialized and bilateral conservation education programmes to empower fishing communities and promote sustainable practices. Conservation measures should focus on mixed methods, such as community engagement, enhanced socioeconomic circumstances and efficient spatial and fishing technique management.

AB  - Determining the factors affecting the structure of insect herbivore communities is a major challenge in ecology. Previous research demonstrated that plant defenses determine plant-herbivore associations. However, non-defensive variables may also explain why some plant species are associated with more diverse insect herbivore assemblages than others. Neotropical rolled-leaf beetles (Cephaloleia and Chelobasis) complete their life cycle inside the young rolled leaves of their host plants in the order Zingiberales. The diet breadth of each species in this assemblage is particularly well-known at our study site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. This study focused on the following non-defensive variables: host plant elevational and geographic range size, soil type, habitat, local abundance, plant size, and leaf size. Because plant characteristics among closely related plants are not independent, we analyzed these variables in a phylogenetic context. We detected a positive effect of leaf width on rolled-leaf beetle species richness (explaining 55% of the variation), abundance (28% of the variation and 57% when habitat is included in the model), diversity (37% of the variation), and community structure (6% of the variation, and 21%-26% when taxonomic family is included in the model). Our study demonstrates that Zingiberales leaf width influences positively rolled-leaf beetle species richness, abundance, and diversity. This effect varies among plant families. Our study shows that plant architecture plays an important role in structuring insect herbivore assemblages in Zingiberales. Our results highlight the importance of including variables beyond plant defenses to understand the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Determining the efficacy of artificial water developments for desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) populations is an important conservation concern as projected climatic changes pose potentially severe effects to the species in the southwestern United States. We monitored daily visitation frequencies and temporal activity patterns of bighorn sheep at 20 water developments on the Barry M. Goldwater Range-East in Arizona, USA, from January 2015 to December 2018. We evaluated the effects of weather, landscape, and interspecific presence on these data using zero-inflated modeling and temporal activity analysis. Approximately 95% of visits by sheep occurred during summer primarily in response to relatively high temperatures and low precipitation. Conversely, sheep were nearly absent from developments during non-summer when vegetative moisture was relatively high, especially if temperature was low and precipitation high. The frequency of visits by bighorn sheep increased when interspecifics were present owing to high use of water developments by all species during summer. Bighorn sheep altered their temporal activity to avoid the high activity periods of predators and competitors in all seasons. Water developments with terrain offering antipredator protection also had greater frequencies of visits, but these features did not affect the probability of absence. Overall, our study indicates that water developments provide hydration and thermoregulatory relief to bighorn sheep during the hot and water-limited conditions of summer and sites lacking adequate antipredator terrain limit water development efficaciousness. We also find that temporal partition by sheep potentially reduces fitness during summer and recommend further analysis based on motion-sensitive cameras to explore this topic.

AB  - Fencing off grassland soils emits massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Whether grazing management in desert steppes with fragile ecosystems can mitigate this trend remains highly uncertain. Here, we examined how soil carbon mineralization, as well as its underlying mechanisms, varied with grazing intensity by sheep in a long-term (17- year) experiment in the desert steppe. Carbon mineralization decreased by 15 %- 55 % under different grazing intensities compared to fencing controls. Soil organic carbon (SOC) maintained high levels under light grazing, whereas it decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Reductions in plant carbon and absolute microbial abundance due to grazing, coupled with changes in soil carbon quality and the environment, drove the reduction in carbon mineralization. We suggest that mechanisms of carbon mineralization can be integrated into predictive modelling efforts to better understand the impact of grazing on carbon fluxes in ecologically fragile, but globally important, arid and semi-arid grasslands.

AB  - Induced defense in trees refers to the increased production of specific substances in response to herbivore attacks, which negatively affects the herbivore. This type of resistance can contribute to the sustainable management of herbivorous insect problems in forest ecosystems. The Aleppo pine, a drought-resistant forest tree species, holds great ecological and socioeconomic importance. One of its predators is the Pine Processionary Moth (PPM) Thaumetopoea pityocampa. This study explores the impact of new foliage that emerges following severe defoliation caused by the PPM on the subsequent year's larval performance. Moreover, we investigate whether there is a difference in the chemical composition of the foliage of defoliated and undefoliated trees in terms of terpenes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes), total phenols, nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and the C/N ratio. The aim is to determine whether these components act as an induced defense mechanism. The results indicate that the performance of L1 larvae was negatively affected by new foliage after defoliation. Larvae feeding on new foliage experienced high mortality rates and were significantly shorter than those that fed on the foliage of undefoliated trees. The chemical composition analysis revealed that only the new foliage after defoliation contained bornyl acetate (monoterpene), and the concentration of p-cymene (another monoterpene) was higher in this new foliage compared to that of undefoliated trees. Furthermore, two diterpenes, methyl dehydroabietate and dehydroabietal, showed a stronger correlation with defoliation. These compounds have demonstrated insecticidal activity against other insects and could potentially serve as starting components for a bio-insecticide against the PPM. These findings suggest the presence of an induced defense in Aleppo pine, as the tree produces foliage containing specific terpenes that are unfavorable to larvae. This is one of the factors contributing to the reduction of the PPM population. However, due to the current climate change situation, further research is necessary to better understand how these conditions impact the susceptibility of trees to defoliation.

AB  - Environmental stress can exacerbate inbreeding depression by amplifying differences between inbred and outbred individuals. In wild populations, where the environment is often unpredictable and stress can be highly detrimental, the interplay between inbreeding depression and environmental variation is potentially important. Here, we investigate variation in inbreeding level, fitness and strength of inbreeding depression across a fine-scale geographic area (similar to 12 km(2)) in an individually monitored population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We show that northern regions of the study area have lower birth weights, lower juvenile survival rates, and higher inbreeding coefficients. Such fine-scale differences in inbreeding coefficients could be caused by the mating system of red deer combined with female density variation. We then tested for an inbreeding depression-by-environment interaction (ID x E) in birth weight and juvenile survival, by fitting an interaction term between the inbreeding coefficient and geographic location. We find that inbreeding depression in juvenile survival is stronger in the harsher northern regions, indicating the presence of ID x E. We also highlight that the ability to infer ID x E is affected by the variation in inbreeding within each geographic region. Therefore, for future studies on ID x E in wild populations, we recommend first assessing whether inbreeding and traits vary spatially or temporally. Overall, this is one of only a handful of studies to find evidence for ID x E in a wild population-despite its prevalence in experimental systems-likely due to intense data demands or insufficient variation in environmental stress or inbreeding coefficients.

AB  - Community structure is driven by the interaction of physical processes and biological interactions that can vary across environmental gradients and the strength of top-down control is expected to vary along gradients of primary productivity. In coastal marine systems, upwelling drives regional resource availability through the bottom-up effect of nutrient subsidies. This alters rates of primary production and is expected to alter algae-herbivore interactions in rocky intertidal habitats. Despite the potential for upwelling to alter these interactions, the interaction of upwelling and grazing pressure is poorly understood, particularly for warm-temperate systems. Using in situ herbivore exclusion experiments replicated across multiple upwelling regimes, we investigated the effects of both grazing pressure, upwelling, and their interactions on the sessile invertebrate community and biomass of macroalgal communities in a warm-temperate system. The sessile invertebrate cover showed indirect effects of grazing, being consistently low where algal biomass was high at upwelling sites and at nonupwelling sites when grazers were excluded. The macroalgal cover was greater at upwelling sites when grazers were excluded and there was a strong effect of succession throughout the experimental period. Grazing effects were greater at upwelling sites, particularly during winter months. There was a nonsignificant trend toward greater grazing pressure on early than later successional stages. Our results show that the positive bottom-up effects of nutrient supply on algal production do not overwhelm top-down control in this warm-temperate system but do have knock-on consequences for invertebrates that compete with macroalgae for space. We speculate that global increases in air and sea surface temperatures in warm-temperate systems will promote top-down effects in upwelling regions by increasing herbivore metabolic and growth rates.

AB  - Evaluating consequences of stressors on vital rates in marine mammals is of considerable interest to scientific and regulatory bodies. Many of these species face numerous anthropogenic and environmental disturbances. Despite its importance as a critical form of mortality, little is known about disease progression in air-breathing marine megafauna at sea. We examined the movement, diving, foraging behaviour and physiological state of an adult female northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) who suffered from an infection while at sea. Comparing her to healthy individuals, we identified abnormal behavioural patterns from high-resolution biologging instruments that are likely indicators of diseased and deteriorating condition. We observed continuous extended (3-30 minutes) surface intervals coinciding with almost no foraging attempts (jaw motion) during 2 weeks of acute illness early in her post-breeding foraging trip. Elephant seals typically spend similar to 2 minutes at the surface. There were less frequent but highly extended (30-200 minutes) surface periods across the remainder of the trip. Dive duration declined throughout the trip rather than increasing. This seal returned in the poorest body condition recorded for an adult female elephant seal (18.3% adipose tissue; post-breeding trip average is 30.4%). She was immunocompromised at the end of her foraging trip and has not been seen since that moulting season. The timing and severity of the illness, which began during the end of the energy-intensive lactation fast, forced this animal over a tipping point from which she could not recover. Additional physiological constraints to foraging, including thermoregulation and oxygen consumption, likely exacerbated her already poor condition. These findings improve our understanding of illness in free-ranging air-breathing marine megafauna, demonstrate the vulnerability of individuals at critical points in their life history, highlight the importance of considering individual health when interpreting biologging data and could help differentiate between malnutrition and other causes of at-sea mortality from transmitted data.

AB  - Crop damage caused by wild boar (Sus scrofa) in many agroforestry regions of the world has affected agricultural development and farmers' livelihoods. Understanding the patterns of wild boar crop damage is important for properly managing these conflicts, and can improve the effectiveness of existing prevention strategies. We collected a comprehensive dataset from Guizhou Province, China, from 2017 to 2020, obtained from motion-sensitive camera monitoring, transect surveys, interview surveys, and wildlife management administrations. These data include 3,156 records of wild boar activity in natural areas and 576 records of crop damage. We applied a multi-scale MaxEnt model to map the regional distribution of wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk in Guizhou Province and focused on the role of habitat suitability in wild boar crop damage from a regional perspective. Wild boar habitat suitability exhibits a divergent pattern, expanding from the central area of Guizhou Province to the eastern, northern, southern, and northwestern regions, with a gradually increasing trend. Suitability of habitat for wild boar was associated with composite topographic index, mean coldest season temperature, isothermality, Shannon diversity index, edge density, and distance to village roads. Similarly, crop damage caused by wild boars in agroforestry areas is mainly concentrated in the northeast, with the risk increasing from west to east. The risk of damage was associated with temperature seasonality, roughness, distance to village roads, precipitation in the warmest quarter, edge density, and contagion index. Furthermore, in agroforestry areas, there is a positive correlation between wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk, with Spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5759 to 0.5932. This correlation is not perfectly synchronized on a regional scale. This study indicates that the relationship between habitat suitability and crop damage caused by wild boar in Guizhou Province is primarily influenced by changes in population size rather than the habitat. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of controlling wild boar populations through hunting as a way to effectively reduce the risk of crop damage in agroforestry areas, without neglecting the need for proper habitat management.
   Crop damage by wild boars has severe impacts on global agriculture and livelihoods, necessitating an understanding of the patterns and drivers of this damage for more effective prevention strategies. This study collected extensive data from Guizhou Province, China, to map wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk, revealing distinct distribution patterns and drivers associated with both. Despite the correlation between habitat suitability and crop damage, the study emphasizes the importance of controlling wild boar populations through hunting as a way to effectively reduce the risk of crop damage in agroforestry areas, without neglecting the need for proper habitat management.image

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife in human-dominated landscapes often faces a range of disturbances that can alter their natural behaviors. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are increasing across Europe, raising concerns about ecological impacts and the spread of diseases such as African swine fever (ASF). This research focuses on the behavioral adaptations of wild boars in response to specific human disturbances. Utilizing advanced biologging technologies, specifically accelerometer and magnetometer combined with dead reckoning methods, fifteen wild boars in a suburban forest near Prague were monitored over a period from February 2020 to July 2021. This study provides insights into the wild boar's resilience, revealing that while the animals are inclined to flee when near disturbances, they predominantly remain in a resting state otherwise. Their most common reaction was to continue resting. These observations underscore the potential role of disturbance management in controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases such as African swine fever (ASF) within wild boar populations.Abstract Currently, African swine fever (ASF), a highly fatal disease has become pervasive, with outbreaks recorded across European countries, leading to preventative measures to restrict wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) movement, and, therefore, keep ASF from spreading. This study aims to detail how specific human activities-defined as "car", "dog", "chainsaw", and "tourism"-affect wild boar behavior, considering the disturbance proximity, and evaluate possible implications for wild boar management in ASF-affected areas. Wild boar behavior was studied using advanced biologging technology. This study tracks and analyzes wild boar movements and behavioral responses to human disturbances. This study utilizes the dead reckoning method to precisely reconstruct the animal movements and evaluate behavioral changes based on proximity to disturbances. The sound of specific human activities was reproduced for telemetered animals from forest roads from different distances. Statistical analyses show that wild boars exhibit increased vigilance and altered movement patterns in response to closer human activity, but only in a small number of cases and with no significantly longer time scale. The relative representation of behaviors after disruption confirmed a high instance of resting behavior (83%). Running was the least observed reaction in only 0.9% of all cases. The remaining reactions were identified as foraging (5.1%), walking (5.0%), standing (2.2%), and other (3.8%). The findings suggest that while human presence and activities do influence wild boar behavior, adherence to movement restrictions and careful management of human activity in ASF-infected areas is not a necessary measure if human movement is limited to forest roads.

AB  - Consumer-resource interactions are often influenced by other species in the community, such as when neighbouring plants increase or reduce herbivory to a focal plant species (known as associational effects). The many studies on associational effects between a focal plant and some neighbour have shown that these effects can vary greatly in strength and direction. But because almost all of these studies measure associational effects from only one or two neighbour species, we know little about the actual range of associational effects that a plant species might encounter in a natural setting. This makes it difficult to determine how important effects of neighbours are in real field settings, and how associational effects might interact with competition and other processes to influence plant community composition. In this study, we used a field experiment with a focal species, Solanum carolinense, and 11 common neighbour species to investigate how associational effects vary among many co-occurring neighbour species and to test whether factors such as neighbour plant apparency, phylogenetic proximity to the focal species, or effects on focal plant defence traits help to explain interspecific variation in associational effect strength. We found that some neighbour species affected S. carolinense damage and attack by specialist herbivores, but associational effects of most neighbours were weak. Associational effects increased herbivore attack on average earlier in the season (associational susceptibility) and reduced herbivore attack on average later in the season (associational resistance) relative to S. carolinense in monoculture. We found some evidence that a neighbour's associational effect was related to its biomass and phylogenetic proximity to the focal species. While neighbour species differed in their effects on physical leaf traits of focal plants (trichome density, specific leaf area, and leaf toughness), these traits did not appear to mediate the effects of neighbours on focal plant herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of associational effect strengths in natural communities are similar to those observed for other interaction types, and that multiple mechanisms are likely acting simultaneously to shape associational effects of different neighbour species.

AB  - Endozoochory by megafauna enables temperate mountain plants to disperse over long distance. As an endozoochorous agent, Brown Bear may play a unique role through its biology and ecology especially because of its diverse diet (angiosperms, ferns, mosses). However, few studies have been conducted on the dispersal of all angiosperms and none on ferns or mosses. Also, the fact that the faecal matrix could represent a barrier to the germination of dispersed seeds due to various physical or chemical constraints, has often been neglected. In this study, we investigated endozoochory by the European Brown Bear and the faecal matrix effect on germination success. We conducted a seedling emergence monitoring experiment in the greenhouse for seven months to assess seed dispersal potential based on 86 faeces. Each sample was split into two treatments (raw vs. filtered faeces), to test the effect of the faecal matrix on seedling germination and growth. We found that Brown Bear dispersed not only fleshy-fruited plants, but also dry-fruited plants and for the first time among Ursids, ferns and mosses. We also pointed out that the faecal matrix acts as an important barrier for germination with little effect on growth. These results highlight the role of Brown Bears in the dispersal of non-fleshy-fruited plants, and suggest that the spectrum of plant species potentially dispersed by Brown Bear is wider than formerly thought. They also stress the importance of faeces disaggregation on seed dispersal outcomes, a mechanism mediated by abiotic or biotic agents.

AB  - Coccidiosis is a protozoan disease that is characterized by diffuse diarrhea, dehydration, emaciation accompanied by moderate morbidity and mild mortality in animals and birds. The current study targeted the molecular characterization of Eimeria isolates in captive deer from different localities in Lahore. The host species was the Cervidae family, such as Hog deer (Axis porcinus) and Punjab urial (Ovis aries vignei). The Eimeria crandallis was isolated from zoo animals. The DNA was extracted from oocysts and amplified by using reported oligonucleotide primers that exhibited the 809 bp product. These were analyzed by using the small subunit 18S rRNA gene-based evolutionary relationship with 36 other Eimeria species reported in caprine, cervinae, bovines, avians, and rodents. Light microscopic examination exhibited 3.29% (7/213) Eimeria-positive fecal samples with morphological features, including sub-spherical forms, the presence of micropyle with polar cap, and oocysts diameters (mu m) ranging from 24.32 +/- 1.61 to 18.94 +/- 1.51. The phylogenetic tree constitutes four distinct clusters with relatively higher values. The evolutionary network showed that sequences were clustered in the monophyletic group of Eimeria species reported in caprine and cervinae. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity matrix analysis exhibited 99.5-99.9% identity of the study isolates with Eimeria crandallis (AF336339). This study provides relevant baseline data to develop strategic control measures for coccidiosis in zoo animals. However, further investigations are required to place the hog deer and Punjab urial-derived E. crandallis into the caprine-originated cluster.

AB  - The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo leo), a flagship species of conservation significance, has expanded its range beyond the Gir protected areas into multi-use landscapes, including the coastal regions of Saurashtra, Gujarat, India. This study examines the dietary patterns of Asiatic lions in this unique coastal region. Using scat analysis, we identified the prey species consumed and quantified their contributions to the lions' diet. Results indicate that the lions predominantly consumed wild prey, such as Boselaphus tragocamelus, Sus scrofa, and Axis axis, which together constituted 64% of their diet. Domestic prey contributed 31%. In terms of biomass, wild prey accounted for 70%, with Boselaphus tragocamelus alone contributing 51%. The dietary niche breadth, calculated using Levin's index, was 0.36, suggesting a relatively specialized diet. This study underscores the importance of prey abundance and habitat structure in shaping lion predation patterns. Lions' reliance on wild prey, particularly Boselaphus tragocamelus and Sus scrofa, highlights their crucial role in the coastal region. Additionally, the inclusion of domestic prey, such as feral cattle, may reflect their high availability and reduced anti-predator behaviors. These findings emphasize the need for robust prey population monitoring and habitat conservation to ensure the long-term survival of Asiatic lions in the coastal region.

AB  - Many global wildlife populations are experiencing unprecedented declines. Estimates of population abundance are needed to effectively manage common species and to conserve vulnerable species. Camera traps have advanced as wildlife monitoring tools for ungulates and can provide improved methods of estimating population abundance. Little is known, however, about how camera traps set for ungulates compare with traditional methods (e.g., ground and aerial surveys) used simultaneously. From 2012 to 2014, we captured and radio collared 34 female and 32 male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in a closed population in Utah, USA. Each collar had a unique letter and number combination. We then estimated number of young, females and yearlings, males and population abundance using multiple methods simultaneously: helicopter surveys, resight surveys performed from the ground, camera trap surveys using marked but not individually identifiable individuals and camera trap surveys using marked and individually identifiable animals. All methods estimated similar abundance. Across years, ages and sexes, however, camera trap surveys produced the most consistent and precise estimates of abundance for adult females and yearlings, lambs and the population. That method was less intrusive and safer than helicopter surveys. Our results indicate that camera trap surveys using photographs of marked animals in which the majority of the population visits a specific resource can produce precise estimates of abundance that are safer, as well as less intrusive and expensive than traditional methods. Using camera traps also creates a permanent record of photographs that can be archived and reanalyzed to answer future ecological and population questions. Finally, this method of estimating abundance can be used in other areas with ungulates that congregate around resources (e.g., watering sites or mineral licks).

AB  - center dot Key message The browsing level of oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur) and fir (Abies alba) provided only a rough estimate of the expected regeneration success. Thus, it cannot be recommended as a standard measurement to predict forest development, unless the number of saplings and the height of those saplings are considered. center dot Context Browsing by large herbivores may affect regeneration success and forest development, with an impact that lasts for decades. center dot Aims Whether the browsing level of a tree species can be used in forestry as a standard measure to assess whether the target values (for instance regeneration success) of highly selected tree species, such as oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl., Quercus robur (L.)) and fir (Abies alba (Mill.)), will be reached is unclear and need specification. center dot Methods In this study, 985 sampling plots (10 m(2)) in Southern Germany (Baden-Wurttemberg) containing browsed and unbrowsed oak and fir-saplings were analysed. Both the browsing level and a measure of the expected regeneration success that considered not only the sapling density but also different height classes (<= 20 cm; 21-50 cm; 51-130 cm) were calculated. center dot Results The use of the browsing level as a proxy for the expected regeneration success was statistically only partly justified. For fir the relationship between browsing level and expected regeneration success became even weaker for a new indicator variable which considers two height classes rather than one class for saplings exceeding 50 cm (51-80 cm and 81-130 cm). center dot Conclusion According to these results, the browsing level cannot be recommended as a standard measurement and/or predictor of damage, unless the number of saplings and the height of those saplings are considered. Thus, in efforts to mitigate conflicts between foresters and hunters, a measurement is needed that addresses the successful establishment of a sufficient number of trees despite browsing, rather than the browsing of trees alone.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - The wave-impacted waters off exposed sandy beaches support marine megafauna, including dolphins, whales, sharks, rays and turtles. To characterise variation in megafaunal assemblages in this challenging habitat, we used drone-based remote sensing to survey marine megafauna off 23 beaches along 1050 km of the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) coast from 2017 to 2020. The surveys occurred from September to May and included 17,085 drone flights, with megafaunal abundances standardised by flight hours. In total, we identified 3838 individual animals from 16 taxa, although no megafauna was observed off 5 of the 23 beaches surveyed. Bottlenose dolphins were the most commonly sighted taxa and accounted for 82.3% of total megafaunal abundance. Cownose (6.7%) and eagle (3.4%) rays were the next most abundant taxa, with potentially dangerous sharks being rarely sighted (<1% of total megafauna). The megafaunal assemblages off wave-exposed beaches in northern NSW significantly differed from those in the central region, whereas the assemblages off the central region and southern NSW did not differ significantly. Wave exposure and water temperature were the best predictors of megafaunal assemblage structure. The richness of marine megafauna off ocean beaches was significantly greater in northern than southern NSW, and turtles were only observed off beaches in the northern region. However, variation in megafaunal richness, as well as the abundances of total megafauna, dolphins, rays, sharks and turtles were not significantly explained by water temperature, wave height, distance to estuary, or proximity to the nearest reef. Overall, drone-based surveys determined that megafaunal assemblages off wave-exposed beaches are characterised by sparse individuals or small groups of sharks, turtles and rays, punctuated by occasional large aggregations of dolphins, cownose rays and schooling sharks. The exception to this pattern was bottlenose dolphins, which routinely patrolled some beaches in northern NSW.

AB  - The role of large frugivores in the dispersal of tropical trees has been well-studied, whereas the importance of the world's largest rodents for plant dispersal has previously been ignored. We studied plant dispersal by gut passage (endozoochory) in Neotropical wetlands by the largest extant rodent, the capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. We compared it with another of the world's 10 largest rodents, the nutria or coypu Myocastor coypus. We collected 96 faecal samples (50 capybara, 46 nutria) from 10 sites within the Taim Ramsar site in southern Brazil, and extracted intact propagules from 10 g subsamples. Propagules from 27 plant taxa (24 angiosperms, and three aquatic ferns) were recovered, representing 13 plant families. Whole Spirodela (duckweed) plants were dispersed. Seeds from 14 angiosperm taxa were germinated in the laboratory. Taxonomic composition of propagules was significantly different for the two mammals, but propagule size was not. Capybara dispersed more terrestrial propagules per sample, and nutrias more aquatic propagules. When total faecal production was taken into account, an estimated 1025 propagules (including 133 fern spores) were dispersed by each capybara per day, compared with 691 propagules for nutrias (including 566 fern spores). Capybaras have larger home ranges and likely dispersed plants over a greater distance. Synthesis: This is the first demonstration that rodents disperse aquatic pteridophytes as well as flowering plants. Our results suggest that capybaras and nutrias play important, complementary roles in dispersing a variety of aquatic and terrestrial plant species within Neotropical wetlands. Our study indicates that the role of herbivorous mammals as vectors of plants with small seeds and non-fleshy fruits has been overlooked in the neotropics and that defaunation of large herbivores can have negative consequences, in a manner similar to that previously highlighted for frugivores.

Al & eacute;m disso, comparamos os resultados com outro mam & iacute;fero que est & aacute; entre os 10 maiores roedores do mundo, o rat & atilde;o-do-banhado Myocastor coypus. Para realizar esta pesquisa, coletamos 96 amostras fecais (50 de capivaras e 46 de rat & atilde;o-do-banhado) em 10 locais distintos na Esta & ccedil;& atilde;o Ecol & oacute;gica do Taim, um s & iacute;tio Ramsar no sul do Brasil. Posteriormente, extra & iacute;mos os prop & aacute;gulos intactos de subamostras de 10 g. Prop & aacute;gulos de 27 t & aacute;xons de plantas (24 angiospermas e tr & ecirc;s pterid & oacute;fitas aqu & aacute;ticas) foram recuperados, representando 13 fam & iacute;lias de plantas. Encontramos plantas inteiras do g & ecirc;nero Spirodela (lentilha d'& aacute;gua) sendo dispersas. Sementes de 14 t & aacute;xons de angiospermas foram germinadas em laborat & oacute;rio. A composi & ccedil;& atilde;o taxon & ocirc;mica dos prop & aacute;gulos foi significativamente diferente entre os dois mam & iacute;feros, mas o tamanho dos prop & aacute;gulos n & atilde;o. Capivaras dispersaram mais prop & aacute;gulos de plantas terrestres por amostra, enquanto rat & otilde;es-do-banhado dispersaram mais prop & aacute;gulos de plantas aqu & aacute;ticas. Quando a produ & ccedil;& atilde;o fecal total foi levada em conta, estimou-se que cada capivara dispersa 1025 prop & aacute;gulos (incluindo 133 esporos de pterid & oacute;fitas) por dia, comparado com 691 prop & aacute;gulos dispersos pelos rat & otilde;es-do-banhado (incluindo 566 esporos de pterid & oacute;fitas). As capivaras t & ecirc;m & aacute;reas de vida maiores e provavelmente dispersam plantas por dist & acirc;ncias maiores. S & iacute;ntese Esta & eacute; a primeira demonstra & ccedil;& atilde;o de que roedores dispersam pterid & oacute;fitas aqu & aacute;ticas, bem como angiospermas. Nossos resultados sugerem que capivaras e rat & otilde;es-do-banhado desempenham pap & eacute;is importantes e complementares na dispers & atilde;o de uma variedade de esp & eacute;cies de plantas aqu & aacute;ticas e terrestres em & aacute;reas & uacute;midas Neotropicais. Nosso estudo indica que o papel dos mam & iacute;feros herb & iacute;voros como vetores de plantas com sementes pequenas e frutos n & atilde;o carnosos tem sido negligenciado na regi & atilde;o neotropical, e que a defauna & ccedil;& atilde;o de grandes herb & iacute;voros pode ter consequ & ecirc;ncias negativas, de maneira semelhante ao que foi anteriormente destacado para frug & iacute;voros.
   This study is the first to show that the world's largest rodents can disperse both aquatic pteridophytes and flowering plants. Capybaras and nutrias play complementary roles in Neotropical wetlands, dispersing a variety of aquatic and terrestrial plant species. The research underscores the overlooked role of herbivorous mammals as dispersers of small-seeded plants in the Neotropics and warns that the defaunation of these herbivores can lead to significant ecological consequences.image

AB  - The extant diversity of the avian clade Palaeognathae is composed of the iconic flightless ratites (ostriches, rheas, kiwi, emus, and cassowaries), and the volant tinamous of Central and South America. Palaeognaths were once considered a classic illustration of diversification driven by Gondwanan vicariance, but this paradigm has been rejected in light of molecular phylogenetic and divergence time results from the last two decades that indicate that palaeognaths underwent multiple relatively recent transitions to flightlessness and large body size, reinvigorating research into their evolutionary origins and historical biogeography. This revised perspective on palaeognath macroevolution has highlighted lingering gaps in our understanding of how, when, and where extant palaeognath diversity arose. Towards resolving those questions, we aim to comprehensively review the known fossil record of palaeognath skeletal remains, and to summarize the current state of knowledge of their evolutionary history. Total clade palaeognaths appear to be one of a small handful of crown bird lineages that crossed the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, but gaps in their Paleogene fossil record and a lack of Cretaceous fossils preclude a detailed understanding of their multiple transitions to flightlessness and large body size, and recognizable members of extant subclades generally do not appear until the Neogene. Despite these knowledge gaps, we combine what is known from the fossil record of palaeognaths with plausible divergence time estimates, suggesting a relatively rapid pace of diversification and phenotypic evolution in the early Cenozoic. In line with some recent authors, we surmise that the most recent common ancestor of palaeognaths was likely a relatively small-bodied, ground-feeding bird, features that may have facilitated total-clade palaeognath survivorship through the K-Pg mass extinction, and which may bear on the ecological habits of the ancestral crown bird.

AB  - Growing human population and demand for freshwater have led to global alterations to rivers, including construction of millions of reservoirs that alter flow regimes, groundwater depletion that causes channel dewatering, and nutrient pollution that degrades water quality. Although taxonomic-based indicators have played a central role in measuring ecological integrity of rivers, trait-based ecological indicators may be applied across regions and provide insight into the mechanistic linkages between environmental variation and organism responses. The goal of this study was to conduct a multi-system assessment of fish functional trait responses to anthropogenic alteration of rivers. Our interests were to determine if (1) traits commonly available for freshwater fishes responded through time as rivers transitioned across states of alteration, and (2) the number of freshwater fish strategists for each trait responded in the same direction across rivers afflicted primarily by dewatering, flow regulation, or water quality improvement. We compiled fish community data from three case studies and used existing trait databases to calculate trait strategist richness defined as the number of species expressing a trait. We then fit random forest models and used recursive feature elimination to identify the traits that were most important for predicting the period from which replicated fish collections were taken, thereby providing a test of which traits most strongly correlated with environmental alterations. Finally, we use partial dependence plots to assess if traits responded in the same directions across case studies and therefore might represent broadly applicable ecological indicators. The largest number of traits responded to stream dewatering (n = 16), with fewer traits responding to water quality abatement (n = 5) and flow homogenization (n = 4). Across case studies, fishes classified as partial herbivores (i.e., they consumed plant matter in addition to other items) and fishes classified as intermediate between periodic and opportunistic life history strategy endpoints declined as flows were depleted, homogenized, or polluted. Fishes using gravel substrates declined as flows were depleted and polluted, but increased after flow homogenization caused by dam construction, perhaps because of altered sediment dynamics. Although the magnitudes and thresholds for change in strategist richness we identify here are specific to the rivers we studied, the emergent themes of consistency in responsiveness and directionality suggest (1) the strategists richness metric and (2) traits related to trophic ecology, life history, and habitat use might be useful indicators for detecting and measuring ecological change in other river systems.

AB  - An important modifier of forests and forestry practices is browsing by cervids. As high populations of moose (Alces alces L.) cause extensive forest damage in the Fennoscandian boreal forests, models should be able to predict the susceptibility of projected forest structures to browse damage. We augmented the European Forestry Dynamics Model (EFDM) for the area of seedling stands damaged by moose. The augmented model was tested in projecting both forest resources and moose damage for 18 million hectares of forest land in Finland, based on input data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI). Modeling the area of seedling stands damaged as a function of moose population density, forest characteristics, and region-specific interactions of these variables was found to work realistically for 30 years, predicting that the area of seedling stands damaged by moose would increase by up to a third from the last NFI observation. Our work lays the groundwork for modeling consequential, large-scale ecological and socio-economic effects of moose browsing.

AB  - In coastal wetlands and tropical reefs, snails can regulate foundation species by feeding on marsh grasses and hard corals. In many cases, their impacts are amplified because they facilitate microbial infection in grazer-induced wounds. Whether snails commonly graze live plants and facilitate microbial growth on plants in tropical seagrass systems is less explored. On a Belizean Caye, we examined patterns in snail-generated grazer scars on the abundant turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum). Our initial survey showed the occurrence of snail-induced scarring on live turtlegrass blades was common, with 57% of live leaves scarred. Feeding trials demonstrated that two of five common snails (Tegula fasciata-smooth tegula and Smaragdia viridis-emerald nerite) grazed unepiphytized turtlegrass blades and that smooth tegula abundance had a positive relationship with scarring intensity. Subsequent surveys at three Caribbean sites (separated by >150 km) also showed a high occurrence of snail-induced scars on turtlegrass blades. Finally, simulated herbivory experiments and field observations of a turtlegrass bed in Florida, United States suggests that herbivore damage could facilitate fungal growth in live seagrass tissue through mechanical opening of tissue. Combined, these findings reveal that snail grazing on live turtlegrass blades in the Caribbean can be common. Based on these results, we hypothesize that small grazers could be exerting top-down control over turtlegrass growth directly via grazing and/or indirectly by facilitating microbial infection in live seagrass tissue. Further studies are needed to determine the generality and relative importance of direct and indirect effects of gastropod grazing on turtlegrass health.

AB  - Aim: Spatiotemporal variation in resource availability is a strong driver of animal distributions. In the northern hardwood and boreal forests of the northeastern United States, tree mast events provide resource pulses that drive the population dynamics of small mammals, including the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), a primary songbird nest predator. This study sought to determine whether mast availability ameliorates their abiotic limits, enabling red squirrel elevational distributions to temporarily expand and negatively impact high-elevation songbirds.
   Location: Northeastern United States.
   Methods: We used two independent datasets to evaluate our hypotheses. First, we fit a dynamic occupancy model using data from camera trap surveys to evaluate red squirrel distributional responses to pulses in the tree mast. We also assessed population responses using systematic auditory surveys analysed with an open-population binomial mixture model. Further, we used modelled red squirrel abundance in nest-survival models to evaluate whether their abundance is correlated with the daily nest survival of three songbird species.
   Results: The tree mast provided a critical resource pulse that resulted in a two-fold increase in the annual elevational distribution of red squirrels. The elevational distribution of red squirrels ranged from a minimum of similar to 450 m (range: 663-1145 m asl) following two consecutive years without a masting event to a maximum of over 1000 m (range: 443-1545 m asl) after a large mast event. The daily nest survival of three songbird species tended to decline with an increase in the abundance of red squirrels.
   Main Conclusions: Tree mast is a central biological phenomenon in many temperate and boreal forests. This study reveals how this resource pulse results in range changes in a small mammal that is both a seed and bird predator, as well as prey for many carnivores. Thus, understanding this phenomenon can inform the conservation and management of northern forests, including breeding songbirds.

AB  - Personality in wildlife has been linked to several ecological processes including mortality risk, facultative migration, and behavioral plasticity. In this paper I examined the relationship between personality and antipredator tactics exhibited by 20 wild female elk (Cervus canadensis) in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Two observers conducted 106 separate chases designed explicitly to resemble predator pursuits by wolves, the main predator of elk. We quantified and classified elk tactical responses during each chase. Elk with "shy" type personalities responded to 84% of predator-resembling pursuits by employing speed-based tactics to outrun pursuers or rejoin conspecifics. Elk with "bold" type personalities adopted this tactic just 11% of the time, and instead employed tactics where they stopped and evaluated pursuers in 45% of chases, attempted to hide from pursuers in 19% of chases, and turned aggressively toward pursuers in 17% of chases. Bold animals employed a greater variety of tactics overall and were more likely to try multiple tactics within the same 10-min chase. Shyness was also positively correlated with flight initiation distance at the start of chases. These results are important for wildlife managers who may be artificially and unwittingly selecting against certain personalities and thereby influencing management and conservation outcomes.

AB  - Migratory sharks play a key ecological role through movements within and among marine ecosystems, yet many populations are declining. Addressing the decline is especially challenging for wide-ranging species, as they may undertake movements between countries with disparate conservation priorities. To investigate the transboundary migrations of threatened sharks between neighbouring South Africa and Mozambique, we tracked 4 commonly occurring carcharhinid species (bull, blacktip, tiger and grey reef sharks). A total of 102 individuals were fitted with long-life acoustic transmitters and monitored for 4 yr (2018-2022) on an acoustic receiver network of 350 receivers. During this period, 63% of tagged bull sharks (n = 19), 87% of blacktips (n = 13), 94% of tiger (n = 16) and 25% of grey reef sharks (n = 3) undertook transboundary movements. The frequency of mean transboundary movements per year ranged between 1.3 +/- 1.5 (SD) for grey reef sharks and 81 +/- 35.6 for tiger sharks. Blacktip, bull and tiger sharks all undertook long-distance transboundary migrations ranging from 980 to 2256 km. These data confirm high connectivity between neighbouring countries by threatened sharks undertaking persistent transboundary movements. This study emphasizes the need for collaborative transboundary cooperation between the 2 countries and the alignment of regional management plans and interventions to address declining shark populations in this region of the Western Indian Ocean.

AB  - The acquisition of microbial symbionts enables animals to rapidly adapt to and exploit novel ecological niches, thus significantly enhancing the evolutionary fitness and success of their hosts. However, the dynamics of host-microbe interactions and their evolutionary implications remain largely underexplored in marine invertebrates. Crabs of the family Sesarmidae (Crustacea: Brachyura) are dominant inhabitants of mangrove forests and are considered keystone species there. Their rapid diversification, particularly after adopting a plant-feeding lifestyle, is believed to have been facilitated by symbiotic gut microbes, enabling successful colonization of intertidal and terrestrial environments. To investigate the patterns and mechanisms shaping the microbial communities and the role of microbes in the evolution of Sesarmidae, we characterized and compared the gut microbiome compositions across 43 crab species from Sesarmidae and other mangrove-associated families using 16S metabarcoding. We found that the gut microbiome assemblages in crabs are primarily determined by host identity, with a secondary influence from environmental factors such as microhabitat and sampling location, and to a lesser extent influenced by biological factors such as sex and gut region. While patterns of phylosymbiosis (i.e. when microbial community relationships recapitulate the phylogeny of their hosts) were consistently observed in all beta-diversity metrics analysed, the strength of phylosymbiosis varied across crab families. This suggests that the bacterial assemblages in each family were differentially shaped by different degrees of host filtering and/or other evolutionary processes. Notably, Sesarmidae displayed signals of cophylogeny with its core gut bacterial genera, which likely play crucial functional roles in their hosts by providing lignocellulolytic enzymes, essential amino acids, and fatty acids supplementation. Our results support the hypothesis of microbial contribution to herbivory and terrestrialization in mangrove crabs, highlighting the tight association and codiversification of the crab holobiont.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the effects of stumping on the fine root architecture of decaying Hippophae rhamnoides plantation in feldspathic sandstone areas, and to determine the optimal stump height that is contributive to the recovery and growth of H. rhamnoides. The fine root architecture, and the econometric properties of soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) in fine roots and rhizosphere roots as well as the underlying correlations were analyzed after different stump height treatments (0 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm, no stumping). The above treatments all significantly affected fine root architecture, which grew into fishtail branches in all treatments. Especially, at the stump height of 15 cm, the topological index (0.75), total branching rate (1.91), specific root length (69.69), and average diameter (0.62) of fine roots were all better than after other treatments. Stumping did not significantly affect C content of fine roots, P and C: N ratio of rhizosphere soils, but very significantly affected other nutrient contents and the stoichiometric ratios of both fine roots and rhizosphere soils. These results indicate the stump height of 15 cm better promote the growth of H. rhamnoides. Principal component analysis shows the N, P, C:N of fine roots, and the C, C:P of rhizosphere soils maximally affect the fine root architecture. Our findings are critical for vegetation recovery and soil erosion prevention and control in feldspathic sandstone areas.

AB  - Seasonal patterns in mesozooplankton composition, vertical distribution, and timing of reproduction are challenging to study in the open sea due to ocean currents and mix of populations of different origins. Sill fjords, on the other hand, with restricted water exchange, are ideal locations for studying taxa- and community-specific adaptations to the prevailing environment. Here, we present re-occurring patterns in the mesozooplankton community structure in Billefjorden, Svalbard, a high Arctic sill fjord with extensive seasonal ice cover, based on monthly sampling from 2011 to 2013. The zooplankton community composition confirmed the Arctic character of this fjord. Predominantly herbivorous taxa, such as Calanus glacialis and Pseudocalanus spp., showed strong seasonal variation in abundance and depth distribution, with population minima in spring being compensated by a rapid population recovery during summer. Omnivorous taxa, such as Microcalanus spp. and copepods of the family Aetideidae, largely remained at depth throughout the year and had an extended or year-round reproductive period. Deep-dwelling omnivorous/carnivorous species peaked in abundance in winter-spring when herbivorous populations were severely depleted. Taxa with seasonally limited occurrences, i.e., meroplankton, peaked in spring and summer at the surface, but were largely absent for the rest of the year. The different life histories, with contrasting feeding modes, depth preferences, and timing of reproduction lead to reduced interspecies competition and allow for a rather high and stable abundance of mesozooplankton year-round despite the short primary production window at high latitudes.

AB  - Although biodiversity is crucial for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), following the current trajectory, we risk failing SDG 15. Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km(2) of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km(2)). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km(2)) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs. Using indices of functional connectivity is crucial for environmental impact assessments, as entire ecological networks for several species can be affected far beyond the reservoirs.

AB  - Invasive species are a global threat to biodiversity and there is a pressing need to better understand why some species become invasive outside of their native range, and others do not. One explanation for invasive species success is their release from concurrent natural enemies upon introduction to the non-native range. The so-called enemy release hypothesis (ERH) has conflicting support, depending upon the ecosystem and species investigated. To date, most studies testing the generality of the ERH have focused on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we tested whether enemy release might contribute to the success of the invasive non-native brown seaweeds Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum muticum in the United Kingdom. We conducted choice and no choice experiments to determine herbivore preference on these invaders relative to six functionally-similar native species. We also measured and compared species traits associated with defence against herbivory (carbon to nitrogen ratio, polyphenolic concentration, tensile strength, and compensatory growth). There were no differences in the biomass consumed between invasive and native species for either choice or no choice tests. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (a measure of nutritional quality) was significantly lower for S. muticum compared to the three native fucoid species, but measures of the other three defence traits were similar or even greater for invasive species compared with native species. Taken together, it is unlikely that the ERH applies to invasive seaweeds in the northeast Atlantic, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the success of invasive species in this system.

AB  - Food availability varies considerably over space and time in wetland systems, and consumers must be able to track those changes during energetically-demanding points in the life cycle like breeding. Resource tracking has been studied frequently among herbivores, but receives less attention among consumers of macroinvertebrates. We evaluated the change in resource availability across habitat types and time and the simultaneous density of waterfowl consumers throughout their breeding season in a high-elevation, flood-irrigated system. We also assessed whether the macroinvertebrate resource density better predicted waterfowl density across habitats, compared to consistency (i.e., temporal evenness) of the invertebrate resource or taxonomic richness. Resource density varied marginally across wetland types but was highest in basin wetlands (i.e., ponds) and peaked early in the breeding season, whereas it remained relatively low and stable in other wetland habitats. Breeding duck density was positively related to resource density, more so than temporal resource stability, for all species. Resource density was negatively related to duckling density, however. These results have the potential to not only elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection among breeding ducks in flood-irrigated landscapes but also suggest there is not a consequential trade-off to selecting wetland sites based on energy density versus temporal resource stability and that good-quality wetland sites provide both.
   Nektonic macroinvertebrate density varies across wetland types and over time during the waterfowl breeding season, with basin wetlands harboring the highest density and the most stable resources. Waterfowl pairs are able to track these densities and are found in the greatest numbers in the wetlands with the highest food density during the breeding season.image

AB  - Plants can retain either physiologically active green leaves or inactive brown leaves over winter. Research has suggested that leaf retention incurs a cost due to higher herbivore load in the following year; however, no distinction has, thus, far been made between retention of green and brown leaves. We surveyed the over-winter retention of physiologically active green and inactive brown leaves of valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and examined their relationship with the diversity and density of 15 gall-making cynipid wasp species. Cynipid diversity in the spring was 8.2-fold greater on larger trees with more green leaf retention. Brown leaf retention was not associated with spring cynipid diversity, but was related to a substantial 20-fold reduction in spring cynipid densities on large trees. Retention of either leaf type was generally a poor predictor of summer cynipid diversity and density. Overall, green leaf retention better explained cynipid diversity, but brown leaf retention better explained cynipid densities. These differing effects may be explained by the fact that green leaves provide a common cue used by herbivores to find a suitable host. Retained brown leaves, however, may be an ecological trap for over-winter gall wasps that normally drop to the ground.

AB  - Although little information exists on the efficacy of deworming in wild ruminants, gastrointestinal nematodes have been found to demonstrate increasing drug resistance. The spread of drug-resistant strains may be increased by transmission among livestock and susceptible wildlife species, thus posing a potential threat to endangered species, such as the European bison.
   The aim of the study was twofold: to identify the parasite loads in captive European bison with the use of coprological techniques, and to test the influence of other nearby ungulates on the richness of bison parasitofauna. Additionally, the efficacy of deworming procedures against gastrointestinal nematodes in bison was evaluated. The survey was based on a coprological investigation of 285 fecal samples from 156 European bison in 15 enclosures.
   The parasitofauna of the captive European bison was consistent with those of free-ranging populations. The highest prevalence was noted for Eimeria spp. oocysts (60.7%), strongyle eggs (50.9%), Fasciola hepatica eggs (13.1%), Dictyocaulus viviparus larvae (12.3%) and Trichuris sp. Eggs (9.47%). Moreover, the close proximity of other ungulate species resulted in a higher diversity of parasite species.
   In all cases, deworming with albendazole, fenbendazole and ivermectin proved to be ineffective against strongylids and Trichuris sp. The results of fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) ranged from 37.2 to 99.6% (95% CI <90%) for albendazole; values >95% (95% CI = 41-100) were noted for fenbendazole, and FECRT ranged from 63.2 to 97.5 (95% CI = 0-99) for ivermectin.
   As the results of anthelmintic treatment are unsatisfactory, it seems justified to continue study in this area. Our study is the first large-scale attempt to evaluate the efficacy of anthelminthics in captive European bison. The potential sharing of parasite species between bison and other ungulates should also be further investigated from the perspective of minimizing the risk of the spread of drug-resistant parasite strains.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and hunters on 2 Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) within the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia, USA, significantly declined in number from the 1980s to 2018. Managers were interested in understanding how they could manipulate hunter distribution according to deer management goals. To understand the spatial distribution of hunting pressure and factors driving hunter resource selection, we analyzed GPS tracking data from 58 deer hunters over the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 hunting seasons. We evaluated hunter selection on 3 spatial scales relative to elevation, slope, and distance from roads, trails, wildlife openings, deciduous forest, mixed forest, and evergreen forest. We incorporated covariates into 6 binary logistic regression models, plus a null model, within a used versus available framework. First, we compared hunter locations to available locations generated within the 2 WMAs. Elevation and distance to deciduous forest had the greatest effect on hunter selection, where hunters selected for lower elevations and closer proximity to deciduous forest. Second, we compared individual hunting bout locations to available locations generated within a buffer around the hunter's starting location with a buffer radius equal to the maximum distance they travelled from their starting location. At the bout scale, distance to wildlife openings and elevation were the most important drivers of hunter selection; hunters selected areas closer to wildlife openings and higher elevations. Third, we compared individual hunter stand locations (used) to randomly selected locations along the hunter's travel path (available). Only distance to roads and deciduous forest were significant in explaining hunter selection of stands. Hunters chose locations farther from roads and closer to deciduous forest relative to their travel paths. Mapping our WMA-scale results revealed that only 5% of the total WMA area contained a greater relative probability of hunter selection compared to the probability of non-selection. Our results suggest that vast refuge areas for deer likely existed on the WMAs during our study period. Manipulating hunter distribution is not necessary to aid in sustaining deer on either WMA at this time.

AB  - The germination niche of plant species depends primarily on the seeds' responsiveness to temperature and water potential. However, to appreciate future climate risks to natural regeneration through germination, a global level synthesis across species is needed. We performed a meta-regression and phylogenetic patterning of primary data from 377 studies on 486 species, including trees, grasses, crops and wild species, to determine patterns and cocorrelants in the cardinal values that define species' germination niches. We found positive correlations between base temperature and other germination traits related to cardinal temperatures suggesting that plant species alter base temperature values in harmony with other thermal traits as a highly efficient adaptation strategy to coping with harsh conditions. A negative correlation was found between thermal time and base temperature, and positive correlations between other cardinal temperatures and base temperature. Mean values of thermal time indicate that annual crops germinate more rapidly compared to wild species, potentially as a consequence of domestication, and tropical tree seeds the slowest. Dryland species (Cactaceae and Agavaceae) have the widest upper thermal and lower moisture niches, indicative of abilities to grow under harsh conditions, while forages have the narrowest thermal and moisture niches, suggesting higher sensitivity to frost or drought. We propose a new conceptual framework for future research on germination niche as shaped by thermal and moisture traits. Our database represents a unique source of information to further determine the vegetation boundaries of wild or cultivated species, including within simulation studies on plant species adaptations under changing land-use and climate.

AB  - Simple Summary High wild boar population densities lead to human-wildlife conflicts. For proper wildlife management, knowledge of wildlife biology as well as human attitudes is needed. We conducted inquiries on hunting methods and on hunters' attitudes in the German Federal State of Lower Saxony to better understand hunting strategies. Single hunt, especially at bait, is still the most widely used method for hunting wild boar. The proportion of drive hunts within the hunting bag is increasing. The proportions of hunting methods vary regionally due to wild boar densities, geographical conditions and hunters' practices. Private hunting is important for wild boar management, although it is just insufficient. Besides promoting more efficient hunting methods and motivating hunters, in the future, additionally, administrative wildlife managers could be established as coordinators of wild boar management, and as such, could manage hunting, the incorporation of regional conditions and investigating hunters' attitudes and abilities. High wild boar population densities lead to demands for a population reduction to avoid crop damages or epidemic diseases. Along with biological studies, a better understanding of the human influence on wildlife and on wildlife management is important. We conducted inquiries on hunting methods and on hunters' attitudes in the Federal State of Lower Saxony, Germany, to better understand hunting strategies and the influence on increasing wild boar population, as well as to underpin game management concepts. Single hunt, especially at bait, is still the most widely used method for hunting wild boar. The proportion of drive hunts within the hunting bag is increasing. The proportions of hunting methods vary regionally due to wild boar densities, geographical features (vegetation, terrain, etc.) and hunters' practices. Hunters increased the proportion of conjoint hunts on wild boar. Baiting remains an important hunting method in wild boar management and the proportion of drive hunts should be fostered. Private hunting is important for wild boar management, although it is just insufficient. Additionally, administrative wildlife managers are recommended for the near future as coordinators of wild boar management, and as such, could manage hunting, the incorporation of regional conditions and investigating hunters' attitudes and abilities.

AB  - Farmers looking to maximize ecosystem services often use diversification practices on their fields to increase abundance and diversity of insect natural enemies. These practices affect functional traits of natural enemies such as body size that can play an important role in their effectiveness as biological control agents. However, landscape features out of the control of farmers might also affect functional traits of natural enemies and their herbivores, including land use surrounding farms. There have been few studies elucidating how landscape complexity and local diversity interact to affect functional traits, and ultimately ecosystem services such as predation on herbivore pests. We examined combined effects of landscape complexity and a local management practice (push-pull) on lady beetle size, and its consequences for egg predation of lepidopteran pests in Kenyan smallholder maize farms. Cheilomenes sulphurea (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a potential predator of the invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was collected in push-pull and control fields along a landscape gradient. We measured beetle size and conducted feeding assays with fall armyworm eggs. We found that female beetles had larger bodies in landscapes with greater complexity. Predation rates not only increased as a response to beetle size but also in response to landscape complexity, suggesting it is not just size that determines predation. Surprisingly, we did not find any effect of the local management practice or its interaction on functional traits or predation rates. Our study suggests that landscape complexity could benefit pest control through two mechanisms: (1) increase in predator body size, leading to higher predation rates; and (2) changes in predator behavior as a function of landscape characteristics - increasing egg predation. Further studies on these mechanisms would allow deeper understanding of landscape simplification's effect on ecosystem services, as mediated by morphological and behavioral traits, and help us harness these traits to increase biological control.

AB  - Carnivores alter their activity to maximize individual fitness by increasing encounters with prey, reducing overlap with humans and minimizing opportunities for loss of kills to kleptoparasitism. We observed 16 radiocollared lions, Panthera leo leo, within the Gir landscape by continuous focal animal sampling for a period of 2-10 days in each session and studied their hunting and feeding patterns with respect to the activity patterns of their prey, chital and domestic livestock. Lions were mostly active during the night while most of the day was spent resting under cover, when temperatures and human activity were high. Activity of lions differed between the sexes but coincided with the activity of their prey. Feeding intervals and feeding bouts for lions were longer inside the protected area compared to multiuse landscapes outside it. Lions tended to feed longer on predated than scavenged carcasses. Livestock comprised the majority of the lions' diet in the Gir landscape. We observed a low level of kleptoparasitism in the Asiatic lions compared with their counterparts in the Serengeti in Africa. Hunting by lionesses declined during the corresponding male activity period, possibly to minimize kleptoparasitism by male lions. We conclude that the hunting and feeding times of lions are adapted to maximize payoffs. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We predicted that future climatic conditions, intense grazing, light limitation and nutrient enrichment have all negative effects on the survival and photosynthetic condition of B. rutabulum, and their joint effects become strong even if individual factors have only weak effects (multiple stress hypothesis).MethodsWe measured after two growing seasons biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence of transplanted moss colonies in full-factorial treatments of fertilisation, exclusion of sheep grazing and light amendment by LED lamps, replicated in ambient and future climatic conditions.ResultsFuture climate and fertilisation had negligible effects on colony biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence of bryophyte colonies, whereas light amendment had positive effect on chlorophyll fluorescence and grazing exclusion had positive effect on colony biomass. Colony biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence decreased with increasing number of global change factors.ConclusionSupporting the multiple stress hypothesis, individually weak global change factors can combine to strong joint effects.
   Multiple global change factors have relatively strong negative effects on a bryophyte even if the effects of single factors are weak.We did not find evidence of multiplicative interactions (e.g. synergies) between multiple global change factors. Nevertheless, the additive effects of combined treatments showed increasing linear response with greater number of factors acting in combination.Amended light availability promotes bryophyte photosynthetic condition, whereas intense grazing may be a disturbance factor having negative effects on bryophytes.Considering multiple global change effects operating simultaneously is required for improved predictions of plant responses to global environmental change.

AB  - Globally, massive carnivore guild extirpations have led to trophic downgrading and compromised ecosystem services. However, the complexity of multi-carnivore food webs complicates accurate identification of spe-cies interactions and community organization. Here, we used fecal DNA metabarcoding to investigate three communities that together encompass eight large-and meso-carnivore species and their 44 prey taxa of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), one of the last places on Earth that still harbors intact carnivore assemblages. Quantitative food-web analyses revealed pronounced interspecific variations in the carnivores' prey compo-sitions and dietary partitioning both between and within guilds. Additionally, body masses of the carnivores and their prey exhibited consistent hump-shaped correlations across communities. Overall, differences in prey diversity, size category, and proportional utilization among the carnivore species result in trophic niche segregation that likely promotes carnivore coexistence in the harsh QTP environment. Network structure an-alyses detected significant modularity in all food webs but nestedness in only one. Furthermore, network characterization identified pikas (Ochotona spp.), bharal (Pseudois nayaur), and domestic yak (Bos grun-niens) as potential keystone prey across the areas. Our results paint a holistic and detailed picture of the QTP carnivore assemblages' trophic networks and demonstrate that the combined use of the molecular dietary approach and network analysis can generate structural insights into carnivore coexistence and can identify functionally important species in complex communities. Such knowledge can help safeguard carnivore guild integrity and enhance community resilience to environmental perturbations in the sensitive QTP ecosystems.

AB  - The dry climate characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will seriously affect microbial metabolism during composting. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of regular water supplementation on the fungal and enzymatic activities of sheep manure composting in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The experiment set up the treatments of water replenishment once every 7 days(T2) and 3.5 days (T3) days, and no water supplementation was used as the control (T1). The results showed that regular water supplementation increased the activities of various enzymes during composting, and the activities of protease, cellulase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in T3 were higher than those in T2. Regular water supplementation increased the relative abundance of Remersonia and Mycothermus, which were significantly positively correlated with the germination index, and degradation of organic components. Regular water supplementation could enrich fungi carbohydrate, protein, and nucleotide metabolisms, and T3 had a better effect. A redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors could significantly affect the fungal community; among them, moisture content (76.9%, p = 0.002) was the greatest contributor. In conclusion, regular water supplementation can improve the key enzyme activities and fungal metabolic function of sheep manure composting, and water replenishment once every 3.5 days had the best effect.

AB  - Archaea play a crucial role in microbial systems, including driving biochemical reactions and affecting host health by producing methane through hydrogen. The study of swine gut archaea has a positive significance in reducing methane emissions and improving feed utilization efficiency. However, the development and functional changes of archaea in the pig intestines have been overlooked for a long time. In this study, 54 fecal samples were collected from 36 parental pigs (18 boars and 18 pregnant/lactating sows), and 108 fecal samples from 18 offspring pigs during lactation, nursery, growing, and finishing stages were tracked and collected for metagenomic sequencing. We obtained 14 archaeal non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). These archaea were classified as Methanobacteriota and Thermoplasmatota at the phylum level, and Methanobrevibacter, Methanosphaera, MX-02, and UBA71 at the genus level, involving hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic, and acetoclastic pathways. The hydrogenotrophic pathway dominated the methanogenesis function, and the vast majority of archaea participated in it. Dietary changes profoundly affected the archaeal composition and methanogenesis function in pigs. The abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria in parental pigs fed high-fiber diets was higher than that in offspring pigs fed low-fiber diets. The methanogenesis function was positively correlated with fiber decomposition functions and negatively correlated with the starch decomposition function. Increased abundance of sulfate reductase and fumarate reductase, as well as decreased acetate/propionate ratio,

AB  - Temperate forests face a "regeneration debt" reflecting limited tree seedling survival and/or growth. Monitoring demographic processes allows us to identify when and how these debts are incurred and can help identify the factors responsible. If rates of survival and growth are steady, we can easily estimate cohort half-lives and the times it takes cohorts to transit through a range of heights. Dividing the estimated half-life by the transit time yields the Regeneration Ratio (RR). This new metric efficiently integrates survival and growth data into one dimensionless index, facilitating comparisons among regions, treatments, and species. Demographic data from 17 cohorts of white pine (Pinus strobus), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) seedlings tracked for 7-20 years in the upper Midwest, USA, yielded different half-lives, transit times, and RRs among sites, experimental treatments, and species. Overall, RRs ranged from 0 to 4.8, showing higher sensitivity to local conditions than half-lives or transit times. Half-lives varied significantly among species, dominated variation in RR, and were uncorrelated with growth. Thus, increasing survival may enhance regeneration more than forming gaps to spur growth. Species differ in how RR covaries with transit time and half-life reflecting their distinct physiologies and life-history traits. Within hemlocks, regional differences in white-tailed deer density and forest and wildlife management increasingly affected survival and growth between 1991 and 2011. Tracking at least 50 seedlings for at least 3 years may yield useful estimates. These metrics give managers tools to evaluate and track regeneration success over time and across landscapes, helping them to identify and respond to factors threatening tree regeneration.

AB  - Tree mycorrhizal type plays an important role in promoting plant species diversity and coexistence, via its mediating role in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), i.e., the process by which an individual's performance is impaired by the density of conspecific plants. Previous findings suggest that ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species are generally less susceptible to CNDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species, due to the chemical and physical protection that EM fungi provide their host with. We examined how CNDD effects on leaf herbivory, seedling growth, and survival differ between AM and EM seedlings of ten tree species collected over 3 years in an old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. We found that AM and EM seedlings differed in how conspecific density affected their leaf herbivory, seedling growth, and survival. Specifically, AM seedlings leaf herbivory rates significantly increased with increasing conspecific seedling and adult density, and their growth and survival rates decreased with increasing conspecific adult density, these patterns were, however, absent in EM seedlings. Our work suggests that AM seedlings have a performance disadvantage relative to EM seedlings related to the negative effects from conspecific neighbors. We highlight the importance of integrating information on seedling leaf herbivory, seedling growth, to provide further understanding on potential mechanisms driving differences in CNDD between AM and EM tree seedlings.

AB  - The longevity (lifespan) and growth rates of a given species provide the basis for estimating its contributions to secondary production and energy flow in an ecosystem, for guiding management decisions, and determining recovery times after disturbances. For brittle stars, a class of echinoderms that dominate the megabenthos in various marine systems due to their often large populations, including those on Arctic soft bottom shelves, growth and longevity information can be estimated through growth bands in their ossicles (arm bones). Here, we estimated the maximum life span, age distribution, and growth rate of the common, large Arctic endemic brittle star, Ophiopleura borealis, from the northern Barents Sea. We counted growth bands in trawl-caught specimens using scanning electron microscope images of the innermost arm ossicles of 80 specimens spanning the known size range. These counts were corrected for overgrowth of the earliest growth bands, and growth parameters were estimated using common growth models. The age bands appeared as alternating layers of dense and less dense lines in the stereom of the ossicle fossae. The maximum corrected age band count was 39, which we infer as reflecting the age in years. This estimate is higher than for most other studied brittle stars, including polar species. Most individuals in the sampled population spanned estimated ages from 25-32 years. The growth constant k estimates of 0.09 from the Single logistic growth model and 0.01 from the specialized van Bertalanffy model indicate slow growth. The combined slow growth rate and long lifespan in Arctic brittle stars suggest that the large stocks found in Arctic regions may take a substantial time period to establish and recover from potential disturbances.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are produced by plants to overcome environmental challenges, both biotic and abiotic. We were interested in characterizing how autumn seasonality in temperate and subtropical climates affects overall PSM production in comparison to herbivory. Herbivory is commonly measured between spring to summer when plants have high resource availability and prioritize growth and reproduction. However, autumn seasonality also challenges plants as they cope with limited resources and prepare survival for winter. This suggests a potential gap in our understanding of how herbivory affects PSM production in autumn compared to spring/summer. Using meta-analysis, we recorded overall production of 22 different PSM subgroups from 58 published papers to calculate effect sizes from herbivory studies (absence to presence) and temperate to subtropical seasonal studies (summer to autumn), while considering other variables (e.g., plant type, increase in time since herbivory, temperature, and precipitation). We also compared production of five phenolic PSM subgroups - hydroxybenzoic acids, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, hydrolysable tannins, and condensed tannins. We wanted to detect a shared response across all PSMs and found that herbivory increased overall PSM production in herbaceous plants. Herbivory was also found to have a positive effect on individual PSM subgroups, such as flavonol production, while autumn seasonality was found to have a positive effect on flavan-3-ol and condensed tannin production. We discuss how these responses might stem from plants producing some PSMs constitutively, whereas others are induced only after herbivory, and how plants produce metabolites with higher costs only during seasons when other resources for growth and reproduction are less available, while other phenolic PSM subgroups serve more than one function for plants and such functions can be season dependent. The outcome of our meta-analysis is that autumn seasonality changes some PSM production differently from herbivory, and we see value in further investigating seasonality-herbivory interactions with plant chemical defense.
   Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are important plant responses to environmental stressors. In this meta-analysis, we test how two stressors - herbivory and non-growing seasonality - affect overall PSM production.image

AB  - Saharan ungulates have suffered from poaching across their range leading to population declines. Low abundance and habitat inaccessibility have limited the availability of empirical data on desert ungulate ecology in the wild. Our objective was to evaluate temporal and spatial distribution, and home-range sizes of wild dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas) and slender-horned gazelles (Gazella leptoceros) under natural conditions using observations from 14,398 camera-days collected between April 2019 and October 2021 in the 7,700-ha fenced area of Jbil National Park (Jbil NP), Tunisia. We individually identified gazelles in Jbil NP using unique horn morphology. Both gazelle species exhibited nocturnal activity patterns in summer, but diurnal activity patterns dominated in winter. We also detected both species more frequently in the plains than in mountains. Water presence was influential in determining distribution only for dorcas gazelles. Minimum convex polygons (MCPs) were 2,062 ha for both the male and female of the most frequently detected dorcas gazelle pair and 1,527 ha for another solitary male. For slender-horned gazelles, MCPs were 2,280 ha and 2,041 ha, respectively, for a male and a female detected in Jbil NP. The decline and rarity of gazelles in the Sahara Desert have limited the sample size of our observed populations. Our study provides hitherto unknown data on wild populations of rapidly declining gazelle species and contributes to ongoing conservation efforts.

AB  - The variation of photoperiod affects the photosynthesis of primary producer algae in the ocean, leading to fluctuations in algal abundance. The changes in photoperiod and algal abundance may have complex integrated effects on primary consumer herbivorous zooplankton. Therefore, in this study, we exposed two clones of rotifer Brachionus plicatilis to the combinations of five photoperiods (0 L: 24 D, 6 L: 18 D, 14 L: 10 D, 18 L: 6 D, and 24 L: 0 D) and three algal abundances (3 x 104, 10 x 104, and 100 x 104 cells mL-1) and recorded the key life history traits. Results showed that the two clones of rotifer B. plicatilis had similar responses to the combinations of photoperiod and algal abundance. Reduced algal abundance delayed development and impaired fecundity, but prolonged survival time. Algal abundance fluctuations affected the resource allocation patterns of rotifers. Short photoperiods had a tendency to reduce the life span of rotifers. There was a significant interaction between photoperiod and algal abundance on the key life history parameters of rotifers. As algal abundance decreased, extreme photoperiods delayed the sexual maturity time of rotifers. Low algal abundance exacerbated the negative effects of light deficiency on rotifers, while high algal abundance alleviated the effects of the extreme photoperiod. Such findings are of great significance for understanding the effects of food fluctuations on the structural stability of the bottom food chain in aquatic ecosystems under the variation of photoperiod with different latitudes and seasons.

AB  - Animals representing a wide range of taxonomic groups are known to select specific food combinations to achieve a nutritionally balanced diet. The nutrient balancing hypothesis suggests that, when given the opportunity, animals select foods to achieve a particular target nutrient balance, and that balancing occurs between meals and between days. For wild ruminants who inhabit landscapes dominated by human land use, nutritionally imbalanced diets can result from ingesting agricultural crops rich in starch and sugar (nonstructural carbohydrates [NCs]), which can be provided to them by people as supplementary feeds. Here, we test the nutrient balancing hypothesis by assessing potential effects that the ingestion of such crops by Alces alces (moose) may have on forage intake. We predicted that moose compensate for an imbalanced intake of excess NC by selecting tree forage with macro-nutritional content better suited for their rumen microbiome during wintertime. We applied DNA metabarcoding to identify plants in fecal and rumen content from the same moose during winter in Sweden. We found that the concentration of NC-rich crops in feces predicted the presence of Picea abies (Norway spruce) in rumen samples. The finding is consistent with the prediction that moose use tree forage as a nutritionally complementary resource to balance their intake of NC-rich foods, and that they ingested P. abies in particular (normally a forage rarely eaten by moose) because it was the most readily available tree. Our finding sheds new light on the foraging behavior of a model species in herbivore ecology, and on how habitat alterations by humans may change the behavior of wildlife.

AB  - Immune functions are costly, and immune investment is usually dependent on the individual's condition and resource availability. For phytophagous insects, host plant quality has large effects on performance, for example growth and survival, and may also affect their immune function. Polyphagous insects often experience a large variation in quality among different host plant species, and their immune investment may thus vary depending on which host plant species they develop on. Larvae of the polyphagous moth Spodoptera littoralis have previously been found to exhibit density-dependent prophylaxis as they invest more in certain immune responses in high population densities. In addition, the immune response of S. littoralis has been shown to depend on nutrient quality in experiments with artificial diet. Here, I studied the effects of natural host plant diet and larval density on a number of immune responses to understand how host plant species affects immune investment in generalist insects, and whether the density-dependent prophylaxis could be mediated by host plant species. While host plant species in general did not mediate the density-dependent immune expression, particular host plant species was found to increase larval investment in certain functions of the immune system. Interestingly, these results indicate that different host plants may provide a polyphagous species with protection against different kinds of antagonisms. This insight may contribute to our understanding of the relationship between preference and performance in generalists, as well as having applied consequences for sustainable pest management.

AB  - Droughts have become more prevalent in recent years, causing problems for large herbivores such as the black ( Diceros bicornis) and white ( Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceros, whose populations are influenced by variation in climatic conditions. This variation acts primarily through the effects of rainfall on forage availability but acts differently on browse or grass. Consequently, browsing black rhinos and grazing white rhinos might show differing responses to changes in rainfall. Moreover, young large herbivores have a more limited capacity to survive environmental stressors than do adult animals that are more resilient to environmental variation. Thus, our aim was to investigate the relationship between rainfall and the survival of young (<3 years old) black and white rhinos at Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve, South Africa. Using stratified Cox models, we found that both species had higher survival with more rain, but the effect was more similar than expected given the differences in diets. Moreover, there was evidence of an effect of age class for white rhinos but not for black rhinos. Additionally, most rhinos that died did so during the dry season when scarce forage and limited fat reserves likely constrained their ability to tolerate periodically low-quality diets. Despite the effect of rainfall operating through substantially different plant growth forms, young animals of both rhino species showed sensitivity to variation in rainfall that could ultimately affect population abundance and conservation status.

AB  - This study investigates the decontamination of laundry wastewater (LWW) using Pistia stratiotes via phytoremediation and recyclability of residual macrophyte biomass for enriched bio-CH4 production. Phytoremediation was performed using a hydroponic system. The optimum phytoremediation factors were LWW concentration = 79.4 %, plant density = 4 plants/reactor, and retention time = 12.9 days. This condition offered maximum removal efficiencies of 82.32 +/- 3.59 %, 67.19 +/- 2.90 %, and 70.34 +/- 3.56 % for NH4+, COD, and PO43-, respectively. The residual P. stratiotes biomass (RPSB) was anaerobically co-digested with buffalo dung (BD) at 1:1 (w/w, wet basis) for enriched bio-CH4 production, achieving a maximum cumulative bio-CH4 yield of 696.84 +/- 35.82 mL/g-VS. The modified Gompertz kinetic model fitted well to the anaerobic co-digestion experimental data with R-2-value = 94.4 %. The integrated phytoremediation/co-digestion scheme succeeded in promoting social well-being through improved water quality, clean energy recovery, and benefiting the environment through carbon footprint emission reduction. These outputs achieved multiple targets of sustainable development goals.

AB  - The expansion of the scale of the aquaculture industry is one significant characteristic of global changes. However, the effects of the husbandry environment on fish phenotypic plasticity especially on fish behavioral adaptability got less attention. Moreover, whether fish boldness and brain neurogenesis mediate the environmental effects on fish behaviors was not clear. In this study, a batch of natural and husbandry rockfish Sebastes schlegelii were sampled, and the boldness, behavioral adaptability, and neurogenesis molecular markers of these fish were determined. Generally, our results showed that husbandry fish had significantly more sheltering behavior (MANOVA, P = 0.009), risk-taking behavior (MANOVA, P = 0.037), time duration spent to launch predatory behavior (MANOVA, P = 0.015), and higher fish boldness (MANOVA, P < 0.001) compared to natural fish, and meanwhile bold fish presented significantly more risk-taking behavior (LMM, P < 0.001), and less sheltering behavior (LMM, P = 0.05), flexible behavior (LMM, P = 0.022), and time duration spent to launch predatory behavior (LMM, P = 0.019) compared to shy fish. Overall, boldness almost had no effects on any neurogenesis processes, and meanwhile, environmental effects were also very limited (LMM, all P > 0.05). The structural equation model showed that the environmental effects on behavioral capacities were direct, indirect, or both direct and indirect (global goodness-of-fit: Fisher's C = 18.672, P = 0.097), which were the trade-offs between survival environment and fish boldness. These results provide novel and fundamental knowledge for improving the ecological fitness of husbandry fish in biodiversity protection under the background of global environmental changes and urbanization.

AB  - Selenium (Se) levels in water have been increasing in Lake Koocanusa and the Kootenai River below Libby Dam in Montana due to coal mining in the drainage basin of the Elk River, British Columbia. Aquatic monitoring of Se is ongoing to assess potential effects; however, exposure to terrestrial, aquatic-dependent wildlife has not been investigated. Tree swallows are a targeted receptor for evaluation of potential Se-related effects as this species is a mid-level consumer with aquatic-terrestrial food web linkages, is sensitive to Se, and reliably uses nest boxes. The goals of this project were to identify tree swallow demographics and metal(loid) concentrations to assess potential species and ecosystem-level effects within the Kootenai River basin study area. During 2022 and 2023, a total of 98 nest boxes were monitored across similar to 120 km of shoreline; 60 eggs were collected. Egg metal(loid) concentrations, including Se, were below levels identified to cause reproductive effects in avian species. However, nest box occupancy increased with distance from the US/Canada border (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.83), and Se concentrations were significantly higher (P = 0.014) in 2023 than 2022 (3.2 (3.0-3.4) and 2.8 (2.6-3.1), respectively; geometric mean, 95% CI; mg/kg, dw). With ongoing mining operations in the drainage basin of the Elk River, these results suggest that long-term monitoring of tree swallows will support assessment of spatiotemporal metal(loid) trends. Additional data, including tree swallow foraging patterns, will allow evaluation of differences in nest box occupancy and metal(loid) concentrations in the Kootenai River basin.

AB  - The dry season coupled with large group size may negatively affect reproductive success of group living mammals in semi-arid environments. We determined the reproductive success of goats between seasons and herd sizes in a semi-arid savanna at Msinga, South Africa. To do this, we used 17 herds to count the number of adult females, kid births and mortalities in the wet and dry seasons of 2017-2018. We found that small and large herds had a significantly greater reproductive performance in the wet than dry season, and this was greater in small than large herds. Kid mortalities (44.0%) for both herds across seasons resulted in decreased kidding success. Abortions (7.0%) in both herds across seasons also contributed negatively to kidding success. Ultimately, kidding success was 80.0 and 14.0% in small herds and 65.4 and 39.8% in large herds in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Our results indicate that goats in semi-arid environments have a poor reproductive performance which may be exacerbated by effects of the dry season. The provision of supplementary feeds may improve the poor survival of kids in semi-arid areas.

AB  - The stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) of three demersal guilds (benthic feeders, benthic/ nekton feeders and nekton feeders) were assessed to understand their trophic relationships on the southeastern Brazilian coast. The organic matter (OM) pool that fuels the demersal food web is composed of a mixture of autochthonous (marine) and allochthonous (terrigenous) sources, highlighting the Paraiba do Sul River (PSR) influence in the shallow coastal waters, regardless of seasonality. Of the studied guilds, the nekton feeder guild (Doryteuthis plei, Lophius gastrophysus, Percophis brasiliensis and Saurida caribbaea) in the demersal food web had the highest delta N-15' values in the dry and rainy seasons. The benthic feeder guild (Atlantoraja platana, Dactylopterus volitans, Dules auriga, Etropus longimanus, Prionotus nudigula and Zapteryx brevirostris) presented the widest isotopic niche breadth (highest total niche area and trophic diversity) due to the assimilation of a variety of benthic crustaceans, with different isotope signatures. The assimilation of benthic and pelagic crustaceans by the benthic feeder and benthic/nekton feeder (Atlantoraja cyclophora, Octopus vulgaris and Priacanthus arenatus) guilds resulted in isotopic overlap (28.1-50.6%). Seasonal trends from benthic and inshore to pelagic and offshore associated food webs were observed for the benthic feeder and benthic/nekton feeder guilds. Our results highlight the importance of terrestrial OM sources from PSR to shallow coastal demersal food webs off inner and medium continental shelf in southeastern Brazil. In addition, the trophic relationships of megafauna from benthic to nekton feeders were discussed.

AB  - The Pacific coast of the Tohoku District, northern Japan is known for the high species diversity of the order Rajiformes (skates), although lacking detailed information on the skate fauna based on quantitative surveys. This comprehensive study investigated the species composition, richness and diversity, abundance, distribution patterns, and some biological aspects of skates occurring from the lower continental shelf to upper continental slope off the Tohoku District (Aomori to Ibaraki Prefectures, 150-900 m depth), based on data accumulated during three years of bottom trawl surveys. A total of 331 individual skates, weighing 462.9 kg, were collected during the surveys, representing 11 species (eight arhynchobatids and three rajids), with six species of the genus Bathyraja being particularly abundant. At least 33% of all recorded Japanese skates (33 species) occurred in the survey area, indicating of the high species diversity of skates off the Tohoku District. Rhinoraja longicauda (n = 100), Dipturus chinensis (n = 69), Bathyraja trachouros (n = 51), and Bathyraja matsubarai (n = 46) were the most abundant species, collectively accounting for 80.4% (266 of 331 individuals) of the total skate catch. Detailed distribution patterns are revealed for each species, confirming three major groups, occupying shallow (D. chinensis), middle (Ba. trachouros and R. longicauda), and deep (Bathyraja isotrachys and Ba. matsubarai) zones, their distribution being strongly dependent on water depth. Furthermore, the distribution of species inhabiting relatively shallow areas varied with latitude, the overall skate fauna of the Tohoku District exhibiting significant vertical and horizontal diversity. The small sizes of mature R. longicauda are suggestive of a relatively short life cycle related to population stability. In addition, "larger-shallower" distribution trends were observed in some species.

AB  - The Triassic-Jurassic boundary marks the third largest mass extinction event in the Phanerozoic, characterized by a rise in CO2-concentrations from c. 600 ppm to c. 2100-2400 ppm, coupled with a c. 3.0-4.0 degrees C temperature rise. This is hypothesized to have induced major floral turnover, altering vegetation structure, composition and leaf morphology, which in turn are hypothesized to have driven changes in wildfire. However, the effects of elevated CO2 on fuel properties, such as chemical composition of leaves, are also important in influencing fire behaviour, but yet have not been considered. We test this by selecting three Triassic analogue species grown experimentally in different atmospheric compositions, and analyse variations in leaf chemistry, and leaf level flammability. These data were used to inform a fire behaviour model. We find that all three species tested showed a reduction in their volatile component, leading to lower flammability. Accounting for these variations in a model, our results suggest that leaf intrinsic flammability has a measurable impact on modelled fire behaviour. If scaled up to ecosystem level, periods of elevated CO2 may therefore be capable of inducing both biochemical and morphological changes in fuel properties, and thus may be capable of influencing fire behaviour.

AB  - Insect-plant interactions are among importantly ecological processes, and rapid environmental changes such as temperature and resource fluctuations can disrupt long-standing insect-plant interactions. While individual impacts of climate warming, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, and plant provenance on insect-plant interactions are well studied, their joint effects on insect-plant interactions are less explored in ecologically realistic settings. To this end, we performed five experiments with native and invasive Solidago canadensis populations from home and introduced ranges and two insect herbivores (leaf-chewing Spodoptera litura and sap-sucking Corythucha marmorata) in the context of climate warming and N deposition. We determined leaf defensive traits, feeding preference, and insect growth and development, and quantified the possible associations among climate change, host-plant traits, and insect performance with structural equation modeling. First, native S. canadensis populations experienced higher damage by S. litura but lower damage by C. marmorata than invasive S. canadensis populations in the ambient environment. Second, warming decreased the leaf consumption, growth, and survival of S. litura on native S. canadensis populations, but did not affect these traits on invasive S. canadensis populations; warming increased the number of C. marmorata on native S. canadensis populations via direct facilitation, but decreased that on invasive S. canadensis populations via indirect suppression. Third, N addition enhanced the survival of S. litura on native S. canadensis populations, and its feeding preference and leaf consumption on invasive S. canadensis populations. Finally, warming plus N addition exhibited non-additive effects on insect-plant interactions. Based on these results, we tentatively conclude that climate warming could have contrasting effects on insect-plant interactions depending on host-plant provenance and that the effects of atmospheric N deposition on insects might be relatively weak compared to climate warming. Future studies should focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these different patterns.

AB  - Genetic diversity is of crucial importance for population fitness and the potential of populations to adapt to environmental change. Population-level genetic diversity is expected to be reduced in specialists having small and isolated populations. We analysed genetic structure and diversity in (pre-)Alpine populations of four Copper butterfly species, differing in the degree of habitat specialisation. Despite substantial variation among genetic markers and molecular indices, genetic diversity and thus evolutionary potential tended to be highest in Lycaena hippothoe and lowest in L. tityrus. Microsatellite analyses revealed that genetic diversity tended to be higher in L. hippothoe and L. virgaureae than in L. helle and L. tityrus. MDH sequencing indicated only few differences among species, while GAPDH sequencing showed higher genetic diversity in L. hippothoe and L. tityrus than in L. virgaureae and L. helle. In L. helle, populations showed strong genetic differentiation but without clear spatial structure, while the other species showed genetic differentiation among clusters according to cardinal directions. These results do not match our a priori predictions of a high genetic diversity in L. tityrus and a particularly low one in the glacial relict L. helle. We thus document that evolutionary potential is not necessarily constrained in relict taxa, and that predicting genetic diversity is challenging. Implications for insect conservation Conservation status does not necessarily reflect genetic diversity at the species level. It thus seems to be more meaningful to focus on specific populations of concern to assess genetic vulnerability to environmental change.

AB  - Density estimation is critical to effectively manage invasive species and elucidate areas of highest concern. For wild pigs (Sus scrofa), the ability to estimate density is complicated because of their variable home range sizes and social structure. Common methods for estimating density (e.g., mark-recapture) may be unsuitable in management applications because additional data needs to be collected before and after management. Removal models offer a suitable alternative to estimate density changes following management and can be applied broadly across areas where management of wild pigs is ongoing. We collected wild pig removal and camera trap data from 25 private properties ranging in size from approximately 0.5 km2 to 95 km2 across 3 ecoregions in South Carolina, USA, from 2020-2023. We compared factors affecting consistency and precision of property-level density estimates between removal and spatial mark-resight (SMR) models. In general, excluding 1 large outlier, density estimates from removal models were between 0.60 and 15.85 wild pigs/km2 (median = 5.34) with a median coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.76 and 95% confidence intervals for the CV between 0.70 and 0.94. Similarly, excluding 1 large outlier, density estimates from SMR were between 0.22 and 30.97 wild pigs/km2 (median = 5.48) with a median CV of 0.39 and 95% confidence intervals for the CV between 0.38 and 1.20. We found the precision of removal models was affected primarily by the number of wild pigs dispatched in the removal period (3 months) and the ecoregion in which they were removed. None of the covariates, including the number of recaptures (a corresponding measure of sample size), influenced precision of the SMR models, although recaptures did influence the density estimates. At the individual property level, density estimates from our 2 estimators were dissimilar from each other in approximately 80% of instances, although none of the covariates we examined influenced dissimilarity. Our results provide unique insight into how sample size affects density estimates using 2 common methods and into novel SMR models that incorporate both marked and unmarked detections. In addition, the density estimates in this study can be used as a reference for wild pig densities in common land cover types throughout the southeastern United States.

AB  - The carp-like fish Potanin's Altai Osman Oreoleuciscus potanini inhabits the Central Asian Internal Drainage Basin in Mongolia. The lakes and rivers of this basin have relatively low bio-productivity and fish species diversity, which is compensated by a high diversity of intraspecific forms. O. potanini has four intraspecific forms, differing in morphology and ecology. The most abundant form is the herbivorous form, whose gut content mainly (up to 80%) consists of the stonewort algae Chara spp. However, it remains unknown whether O. potanini digests and assimilates these algae. To clarify this issue, we used stable isotope analysis (SIA) and fatty acid (FA) analysis, which allow us to study assimilated food. SIA revealed that O. potanini obtained bulk carbon from periphytic microalgae rather than from Chara spp. FA analysis generally confirmed the results of SIA. Specifically, biomarker FAs of diatom algae were found in the biomass of O. potanini, while characteristic biomarkers of Chara spp. were absent. Thus, the herbivorous form of O. potanini appeared to ingest stoneworts for assimilating periphytic microalgae during gut passage.

AB  - The process of domestication has altered many phenotypes. Selection on these phenotypes has long been hypothesised to indirectly select for increases in the genome-wide recombination rate. This hypothesis is potentially consistent with theory on the evolution of the recombination rate, but empirical support has been unclear. We review relevant theory, lab-based experiments, and data comparing recombination rates in wild progenitors and their domesticated counterparts. We utilise population sequencing data and a deep learning method to infer genome-wide recombination rates for new comparisons of chicken/red junglefowl, sheep/mouflon, and goat/bezoar. We find evidence of increased recombination in domesticated goats compared to bezoars but more mixed results in chicken and generally decreased recombination in domesticated sheep compared to mouflon. Our results add to a growing body of literature in plants and animals that finds no consistent evidence of an increase in genome-wide recombination with domestication.

AB  - Tea plantation ecosystem play an important role in carbon sinks through plant photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, and soil organic matter storage. The carbon storage assessment of tea plantation ecosystem is an essential task for high-carbon sink tea plantation establishment, carbon trade, and regional sustainable development. However, the uniqueness of ecological information and spatial distribution in the tea plantation ecosystems leads to great challenges in carbon storage measurement and modeling in large scale, including (1) The acquisition of above and under-ground biomass of tea garden for carbon storage assessment are difficult. (2) The scarcity of long-term field observation data. (3) The portability of carbon storage assessment model is affected by the strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity of tea garden distribution. We reviewed the literatures of carbon storage investigation of the tea plantation ecosystem, summarized the principle, advantages, limitations, and application of carbon storage measurement methods, and discussed the estimation results of carbon storage for tea plantation in different studies. The perspectives are proposed to overcome existing challenges, including (1) Utilizing remote sensing techniques to obtain spatial distributions and growth parameters related to carbon storage assessment of tea plantations. (2) Combining the "Space-Sky-Ground" observation system to acquire long-term observation data. (3) Developing high applicability and precision carbon storage estimation model, especially tea plants biomass estimation models. (4) To reduce the uncertainty in tea plantation ecosystem carbon stock estimation, it is necessary to build model-data-fusion technology frame by integrate observation data into carbon storage estimation models. This review summarized the progress and proposed perspectives of carbon storage assessment for the tea plantation ecosystem, which can provide references for further carbon sink investigation of tea plantation ecosystem.

AB  - The Arabian Sand Gazelle (Gazella marica Thomas, 1897) is endemic to the Middle East and its populations in South-eastern Anatolia in Turkey are in danger of extinction. Here, we focus on its protected habitats in the Mesopotamian steppes and examine how to create connectivity between habitats under changing climate conditions. We use ecological niche modelling for four time periods, as simulated in five General Circulation Models (GCMs), to assess the distributional shifts of G. marica over the decades and predict its future ecological connection effectivity based on a least-cost model. We suggest establishing three potential corridors between core protected areas. The findings indicate that there will be a southward and westward shift in the distribution of the species due to future climate change. Overall, the results of the GCMs suggest that climate change will trigger habitat loss for G. marica. Unless conservation measures take the forecasted changes in habitat into consideration, the extinction of this species will be unavoidable.

AB  - Bats perform critical ecosystem functions, including the pollination, seed dispersal, and regulation of invertebrate populations. Yet, bat populations are declining worldwide primarily due to habitat loss and other anthropogenic stressors. Thus, studies on bat ecology, particularly on environmental determinants of bat occupancy, are paramount to their conservation. High mobility, nocturnal behavior, and roosting site selection of bats make conventional surveys challenging. Moreover, little is known about geographic distribution, habitat suitability, and responses to climate change among tropical bat species. To bridge these research gaps, we applied ecological niche modeling to two Ceylonese bat species, Kerivoula malpasi and Kerivoula picta, to map their geographic distribution. Seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation were critical environmental predictors of bat distribution in general. Southwestern lowland forests contained the most optimal habitats for the relatively wide-ranging Kerivoula picta, while the central highlands provided the most suitable habitats for the narrow-ranging Kerivoula malpasi. No tangible changes in the highly suitable habitats were evident in response to projected climate change for either species. Yet, the optimal ranges of K. malpasi can become fragmented in the future, whereas the most optimal habitats for K. picta are likely to become spatially contiguous in the future. Habitat availability or fundamental niche alone is insufficient to reliably forecast species persistence, thus we caution against considering these two bat species as resilient to climate change. Our findings will enable the conservation authorities to initiate preemptive conservation strategies, such as the establishment of landscape-scale habitat connectivity and management of buffer zones around conservation lands. We also encourage conservation authorities to employ ecological niche models to map potential species distributions and to forecast range shifts due to climate change.

AB  - The risk of predation can alter the way animals perceive costs and benefits in their environment, on which foraging decisions are made. To maximize fitness, animals with offspring show the most pronounced alteration in behavior because mothers experience increased nutritional requirements and increased vulnerability to predation. Therefore, the tolerance of risk is shaped, in part, by reproductive state. Like prey species, mesopredators balance a trade-off between food and predation to maximize fitness. However, few studies have acknowledged its importance. We investigated how mesopredators may alter their space use between periods when young are and are not vulnerable. Investigating the fine-scale space use of 19 packs of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in the Kruger National Park, we found lower risk tolerance of denning packs; they re-visited area less frequently as lion and impala density increased and thus reduced the likelihood of risky encounters by avoiding areas where both risk and reward were high. By contrast, non-denning packs re-visited area less frequently as lion density increased and impala density decreased and thus avoided areas where reward was low, especially if risk was high. These results suggest that wild dogs shift their patterns of space use when the pack is most vulnerable. Ultimately, we found evidence of decreased risk tolerance by denning packs, likely because of increased vulnerability of lactating mothers and immobile pups. More broadly, our findings suggest that risk tolerance is dependent on reproductive state for mesopredators and should be considered as a possible mechanism for other mesopredators as well.

AB  - Aim: Attempts over the past 30 years to explain geographical variation in the strength of herbivore pressure have given rise to ecological hypotheses like the latitudinal herbivory hypothesis. This hypothesis, however, has rarely been tested using community-level data. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the patterns and potential mechanisms underlying geographical variation in community-wide herbivory.
   Location: The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   Time Period: July 2021.
   Major Taxa Studied: Plants.
   Methods: We selected 43 grassland sites along a 1500-km latitudinal gradient (c. 27 degrees N to 39 degrees N) and a 2698-m elevational gradient (1886-4584 m) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We evaluated geographical patterns in invertebrate herbivory pressure at the population and community levels, while also evaluating the importance of geographical variation in mediating the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on intraspecific variation (through changes in herbivory on component species) and species turnover effects (through changes in plant community composition).
   Results: Community-wide herbivory decreased with latitude, mirroring intraspecific variation, while species turnover effects did not vary along any tested geographical gradients. Furthermore, we found that geographical variation in community-wide herbivory was strongly positively correlated with soil nitrogen content. We also found a positive effect of soil nitrogen content on intraspecific variation and a negative effect of plant community biomass on species turnover effects.
   Main Conclusions: The latitudinal gradient in community-wide herbivory was primarily mediated by intraspecific variation, which was in turn associated with a gradient in soil nitrogen content. Our findings highlight the need for community-wide assessments of geographical variation in plant-herbivore interactions, decomposing community-wide herbivory into intraspecific variation and species turnover effects.

AB  - River ecosystems are facing significant degradation from human activities, which impact both biotic (e.g., fish and invertebrates) and abiotic components (e.g., water and habitat). A comprehensive comparison of energy flow patterns and system attributes among river food webs under different levels of human interference is highly important for developing management strategies to protect river ecosystems. Along the subtropical Pearl River, six spatial zones, including agricultural, industrial, island, urban, factory, and estuarine areas, were chosen to construct the Ecopath models. The output results revealed that the highest trophic level of the Pearl River was 3.8-4.2, which was occupied by softshell turtles and piscivorous/carnivorous fish. The most diverse functional groups were found in island and estuarine zones due to their heterogeneous habitats (e.g., high submerged vegetation coverage and the transition area between fresh and brackish water). In contrast, the food web structure in the industrial zone was destroyed due to water pollution (e.g., sewage discharge) and habitat degradation. The increase in exotic species and the decrease in native top predators were two factors that result in the low efficiency of energy transmission. A series of trophic (e.g., Lindeman transfer efficiency and mixed predator-prey impacts), structural (e.g., keystoneness, omnivory, and Finn's path length), and theoretical (e.g., connectance and ascendency) indices revealed that the health and maturity of the Pearl River sections can be ranked as island > estuarine > agricultural > urban > factory > industrial zones. The food chains led by softshell turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis), piscivores (e.g., Elopichthys bambusa), molluscivores (e.g., Mylopharyngodon piceus), and herbivores (e.g., Ctenopharyngodon idelus) could be used to indicate the health and functioning of river ecosystems. Our results suggest that the ecological management of river ecosystems should focus more efforts on protecting original habitats (e.g., the island zone with fish feeding/spawning grounds), monitoring bioindicators with keystone trophic impacts in the food web, and evaluating the food chains that play important roles in upward energy transmission.

AB  - South America is a pivotal paleontological setting for Late Quaternary megafaunal research. Nonetheless, its paleobiogeography and paleoecology, and the causes for the recent extinction of megafauna in the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential geographical distribution and historically intertropical stable areas (HISAs) of South American megafauna. We generated maps using Paleo-Species Distribution Models for 12 megafaunal taxa (11 herbivores and one carnivore) during interglacial and glacial periods in the Late Quaternary: 120 and 21 ka. Our models, together with isotopic data, show that the HSIAs occurred mainly in low-altitude plains (<1000 m) and were superimposed on seasonal dry forest biomes. We propose the occurrence of two HSIAs: the West Intertropical Region and the Brazilian Intertropical Region, the latter being redefined. We suggest that the Brazilian Intertropical Region is much smaller than previously proposed, but was still a key zoogeographical region for megafauna in South America during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - The performance of herbivore consumers in freshwater ecosystems is influenced by food quality and quantity, which are crucial factors in understanding energy flow. However, the comprehensive effects of these factors on consumer growth based on natural food research remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a growth experiment culturing the Cladocera Daphnia similis in natural lake water collected from 30 subtropical lakes. Our results showed that the seston concentration (SC), seston phosphorus (seston P), and seston carbon: phosphorus ratio (seston C:P, in moles) were the most important factors in influencing the growth rate of D. similis according to the Random Forest model. Specifically, the growth rate of D. similis was significantly positive correlated with SC and seston P, and significantly negative correlated with seston C:P. D. similis exhibited the optimal growth performance within the seston C:P range of 32.8 to 69.8, with a sharp decline in growth rate observed at a break point of seston C:P of 70. The combined effect of food quality and quantity on growth rate was that higher SC (>= 0.26 mg C/L), lower seston C:P (<= 69.80), and higher P (>= 0.11 mmol/g) were associated with significantly higher growth rates. Additionally, the growth rate increased significantly with the biomass of cryptophyte, indicating the importance of food composition. Our study shows that the growth rate of D. similis is co-affected by the quality and quantity of natural food. SC, seston C:P, seston P and algae composition are reliable indicators for assessing the growth rate of consumer in freshwater ecosystems. The inhibitory effect of low C:P on consumer growth should be applied with caution when assessing the development of herbivore consumers in natural lakes.

AB  - 1. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained momentum globally and guidance is needed to identify those species, sites and planting methods that increase restoration success. Incorporating native Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species in FLR approaches provides an opportunity to simultaneously deliver ecological and economic benefits. The Brazil nut tree is one of the most valuable Amazonian NTFP species and could fulfil a cornerstone role in Amazon FLR. However, the factors defining establishment success within Brazil nut restoration activities remain unknown. 2. Here, we evaluate the effect of management practices, restoration site (pastures, agroforestry, secondary forest and canopy gaps in old growth forest) and environmental conditions on the establishment success (tree growth, survival and fruit production) of Brazil nut restoration projects implemented by smallholders in the Peruvian Amazon. We performed a field study at 25 restoration sites of 1-38 years in age, where we conducted measurements on 481 trees and interviewed 21 smallholders. We used mixed effect models to identify drivers of performance. 3. Twenty years after planting, diameter growth in secondary forests was 38%, 34%, and 24% higher than in canopy gaps, pastures, and agroforestry sites, respectively. Survival rate was similar for trees planted in pastures and secondary forests, but 15-20% higher there than trees planted in agroforestry sites, and 7-12% higher than in canopy gaps. Fruit production was 262% higher for reproductive trees in secondary forest sites compared to pastures, but production probability did not differ between restoration sites. These results show that secondary forests are the most suitable sites for planting Brazil nut trees. 4. In addition to restoration site effects, we also found significant effects of management practices. Survival rate increased with application of fire for clearing and weeding and economic investments and decreased with potentially inefficient herbivore protection. Fruit production was lower for trees planted further away from smallholders' homes. These results show that smallholders' management has a substantial effect on establishment success. 5. Our findings suggest a significant importance of post-planting maintenance of trees to increase success of FLR projects. Further, our study shows that evaluation of past restoration activities can guide future forest restoration in tropical landscapes.

AB  - Intraspecific variation modifies ecological processes and ecosystem functioning. Still, we know relatively little of how the nature and strength of ecosystem effects caused by intraspecific variation may interact with climate change. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test if, and to what extent, ocean warming modifies the ecological impacts of intraspecific variation in a predatory fish. The mesocosms consisted of a simplified coastal food web with threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as the top predator, from a population where two stickleback phenotypes with either complete or incomplete lateral armour plating coexist and display differentiated predation behaviour: The completely plated phenotype often feeds more on invertebrate herbivores compared with the incompletely plated phenotype. Presence of stickleback reduced biomass of arthropod shredders (crustaceans, insect larvae). Warming (+4 degrees C) strengthened this predation, releasing benthic primary producers (diatoms) from top-down control, causing a trophic cascade. This trophic cascade was attributed to one of the plate phenotypes: the completely plated stickleback increased their predation on shredders under warming, while the incompletely plated stickleback instead decreased their predation. Diatom biomass responded accordingly: warming increased diatom biomass in the presence of completely plated stickleback but not when incompletely plated stickleback was present. Our results suggest that different plate phenotypes of threespine stickleback differentially affect lower trophic levels and that warming may exacerbate these cascading effects. These trait-dependent effects on trophic cascades highlight the consequences of intraspecific variation on ecosystem functioning.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Simple Summary Improving the reproductive performance of boars is a major goal in pig-breeding programmes. Semen traits are significantly associated with the reproductive performance of boars, and thus, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the genes affecting semen traits are important. Genome-wide association study have been widely used to detect significant SNPs associated with economically important traits in pigs. The results of our study can be used in genomic selection models to facilitate future breeding programs aimed at improving reproductive traits in boars.Abstract Artificial insemination plays a crucial role in pig production, particularly in enhancing the genetic potential of elite boars. To accelerate genetic progress for semen traits in pigs, it is vital to understand and identify the underlying genetic markers associated with desirable traits. Herein, we genotyped 1238 Landrace boars with GeneSeek Porcine SNP50 K Bead chip and conducted genome-wide association studies to identify genetic regions and candidate genes associated with 12 semen traits. Our study identified 38 SNPs associated with the analyzed 12 semen traits. Furthermore, we identified several promising candidate genes, including HIBADH, DLG1, MED1, APAF1, MGST3, MTG2, and ZP4. These candidate genes have the potential function to facilitate the breeding of boars with improved semen traits. By further investigating and understanding the roles of these genes, we can develop more effective breeding strategies that contribute to the overall enhancement of pig production. The results of our study provide valuable insights for the pig-breeding industry and support ongoing research efforts to optimize genetic selection for superior semen traits.

AB  - Within-species genetic diversity is crucial for the persistence and integrity of populations and ecosystems. Conservation actions require an understanding of factors influencing genetic diversity, especially in the context of global change. Both population size and connectivity are factors greatly influencing genetic diversity; the relative importance of these factors can, however, change through time. Hence, quantifying the degree to which population size or genetic connectivity are shaping genetic diversity, and at which ecological time scale (past or present), is challenging, yet essential for the development of efficient conservation strategies. In this study, we estimated the genetic diversity of 42 colonies of Rhinolophus hipposideros, a long-lived mammal vulnerable to global change, sampling locations spanning its continental northern range. Here, we present an integrative approach that disentangles and quantifies the contribution of different connectivity measures in addition to contemporary colony size and historic bottlenecks in shaping genetic diversity. In our study, the best model explained 64% of the variation in genetic diversity. It included historic bottlenecks, contemporary colony size, connectivity and a negative interaction between the latter two. Contemporary connectivity explained most genetic diversity when considering a 65 km radius around the focal colonies, emphasizing the large geographic scale at which the positive impact of connectivity on genetic diversity is most profound and hence, the minimum scale at which conservation should be planned. Our results highlight that the relative importance of the two main factors shaping genetic diversity varies through time, emphasizing the relevance of disentangling them to ensure appropriate conservation strategies.

AB  - Population genetic data can provide valuable information on the demography of a species. For rare and elusive marine megafauna, samples for generating the data are traditionally obtained from tissue biopsies, which can be logistically difficult and expensive to collect and require invasive sampling techniques. Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers an alternative, minimally invasive approach to provide important genetic information. Although eDNA approaches have been studied extensively for species detection and biodiversity monitoring in metabarcoding studies, the potential for the technique to address population-level questions remains largely unexplored. Here, we applied "eDNA haplotyping" to obtain estimates of the intraspecific genetic diversity of a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregation at Ningaloo reef, Australia. Over 2 weeks, we collected seawater samples directly behind individual sharks prior to taking a tissue biopsy sample from the same animal. Our data showed a 100% match between mtDNA sequences recovered in the eDNA and tissue sample for all 28 individuals sampled. In the seawater samples, >97% of all reads were assigned to six dominant haplotypes, and a clear dominant signal (similar to 99% of sample reads) was recovered in each sample. Our study demonstrates accurate individual-level haplotyping from seawater eDNA. When DNA from one individual clearly dominates each eDNA sample, it provides many of the same opportunities for population genetic analyses as a tissue sample, potentially removing the need for tissue sampling. Our results show that eDNA approaches for population-level analyses have the potential to supply critical demographic data for the conservation and management of marine megafauna.

AB  - Purple soils are greatly representative of ecologically fragile soils in southern China, yet the impact of vegetation restoration processes on the nitrogen (N) availability in purple soil ecosystems is still unclear. In this study, the soil nutrient content, available N fractions (including microbial biomass N (MBN), ammonium N (NH4+-N), nitrate N (NO3--N), and total dissolved N (TDN)), and enzyme activities (including urease (URE), nitrate reductase (NR), and nitrite reductase (NIR)) involved in N mineralization and immobilization were investigated across the three vegetation-restoration measures: Camellia oleifera monoculture, Camellia oleifera ryegrass intercropping, and Camellia oleifera intercropping with weeds. The results showed that the Camellia oleifera monoculture mode considerably enhanced the accumulation and availability of soil N and modified the proportion of available N fractions in arable land situated on purple soil slopes, compared to the intercropping mode, the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of soil demonstrated more pronounced effects due to the Camellia oleifera monoculture vegetation-restoration measures. However, soil nutrient loss is faster on set-aside land and in crop monocultures, and intercropping restoration measures are more beneficial for soil and water conservation under timely fertilization conditions. The soil URE, NR, and NIR activities and MBN content in the Camellia oleifera monoculture model were significantly higher than in the control check sample. Soil N transformation occurs through the combined influence of chemical and biological processes. The relationships between the activities of the three soil enzymes studied and the contents of various components of soil nutrients and effective N displayed significant differences. Notably, URE had a highly significant positive correlation with TOC. There is a strong positive correlation between NR and TN, NIR and TDN, NO3--N, and NH4+-N. Our findings suggest that vegetation restoration improved the soil N availability and its enzyme activities in purple soils, making an essential contribution to the restoration and sustainability of purple soil ecosystem functions.

AB  - The Southern Ocean is warming more rapidly than other parts of our planet. How this region's endemic biodiversity will respond to such changes can be illuminated by studying past events through genetic analyses of time-series data sets, including historic and fossil remains. Archaeological and subfossil remains show that the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) was common along the coasts of Australia and New Zealand in the recent past. This species is now mostly confined to sub-Antarctic islands and the southern tip of South America. We analyzed ancient seal samples from Australia (Tasmania), New Zealand and the Antarctic mainland to examine how southern elephant seals have responded to a changing climate and anthropogenic pressures during the Holocene. Our analyses show that these seals formed part of a broader Australasian lineage, comprising seals from all sampled locations from the south Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Our study demonstrates that southern elephant seal populations have dynamically altered both range and population sizes under climatic and human pressures over surprisingly short evolutionary timeframes for such a large, long-lived mammal.

AB  - Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are among the first insects to arrive on a corpse, and so they are particularly important in forensic entomology. To use blow flies in forensic investigations, there must be information available on their species diversity, abundance, and distribution in the areas where investigations are conducted. Several factors can contribute to species distribution, and elevation is one of those factors. The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of Calliphoridae across four elevational gradients in Sicily and Ecuador, where little information is available. Baited traps were placed at elevations ranging from 20 m to 1552 m in Sicily (a major island and region of Italy and a distinct ecoregion) and 561 m to 3336 m in Ecuador. Species richness, relative abundance, and diversity were calculated, as well as the ratio of female to male blow flies and community assemblage. Twelve species were collected in Sicily, and seventeen species were collected in Ecuador. In Sicily, the most abundant species was Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (68.50% of the total capture), while in Ecuador, it was Compsomyiops verena (Walker) (51.67% of the total capture). In Sicily, significant differences were only observed in the relative abundance of L. sericata across elevations. In Ecuador, significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of Calliphora nigribasis (Macquart), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann), C. verena, Hemilucilia semidiaphana (Rondani), Lucilia ibis (Shannon), L. purpurascens (Walker), and Paralucilia sp. across elevations. These data can help build a checklist of blow fly species in these two regions and can be instrumental in environmental and forensic investigations.

AB  - Native forests around the world are widely used for livestock grazing as they offer different sources of forage. Nevertheless, in heterogeneous forested landscapes, forage productivity drivers are still unclear, hindering precise predictions of field receptivity. Our aim is to relate landscape variables with forage productivity in forested landscapes using satellite and ground-based data. To accomplish this, we harvested 36 enclosures in two Patagonian valleys during a three-year period. The location of the enclosures encompassed a gradient of altitude and mean annual rainfall, across three vegetation types commonly used for cattle raising. We estimated five generalized linear models to predict forage productivity using different remote sensing and ground (field) data as predictors. The most important variables for predicting forage productivity were five of remote sensing type and two of field type. The highest goodness of fit was obtained when all variables were included (D2 = 0.71). When ground-based information was combined with remote sensing data, the goodness of fit was higher (D2 = 0.65) compared with models that only used remote data as predictors (D2 = 0.49). Models obtained based on remote data serve to support situations where field information is not available. High forage productivity levels can be obtained in high forests or scrubs with varying values of canopy openness, without removing the forest. The models generated in this work improve livestock stocking rates adjustment in NW Patagonia forests, and may be also re-estimated with new data in other regions used for cattle raising worldwide, contributing to the sustainable use of native forests.

AB  - The analysis of stable isotopes on fossil mammals has become a widely used tool for understanding the paleoecology and paleodiet of these organisms. In this work, we study the stable isotope composition of collagen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and bioapatite (delta C-13 and delta O-18) of fossil bones from Arroyo del Vizca & iacute;no, a fossiliferous site in southern Uruguay dated to similar to 32 ka cal BP. Fourteen taxa were analyzed: the ground sloths Lestodon armatus, Glossotherium robustum, Mylodon darwinii, Valgipes bucklandi and Nothrotheriops sp.; the glyptodonts Glyptodon reticulatus, Panochthus tuberculatus, and Doedicurus clavicaudatus; the equids Hippidion principale and Equus neogeus; the proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis; the notoungulate Toxodon platensis; the saber-tooth felid Smilodon populator; and an indeterminate cervid. In general, the percentage of nitrogen in collagen and the C:N ratio were within the limits expected for collagen preservation in fossil bone. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 results of the herbivores indicated that most taxa consumed high proportions of C-3 plants in open, relatively dry environments, but significant variations were observed. Furthermore, relatively high values of delta O-18 in bone bioapatite, which approximately tracks local drinking water, indicated low precipitation and/or high evaporation. Our results show that the herbivorous taxa present at the site covered a considerable range of the grazer-browser spectrum and support the existence of niche partitioning among closely related taxa. Overall, these kinds of approaches are indispensable to better understand how these communities thrived during the Pleistocene in the region, supporting an outstanding number of giant species, before their extinction at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

However, white flash produces colour night-time photographs that can be critically useful for both species and individual identification. White flash was thought to cause more disturbance to wildlife than was infrared and this may lead to camera avoidance. Evaluating the extent of this response, and differences between the flash types, is useful to develop improved survey designs. Aims. This research aimed to quantify the behavioural responses of Eld's deer to white and infrared flash, to determine whether white-flash cameras were suitable for use in population surveys of this species. Methods. A behavioural ethogram was used to quantify the responses of the deer to the two flash types, as well as the responses of different sex-age classes and group sizes when encountering a camera trap. Additionally, the detection rate for white flash and infrared flash cameras was compared through time, to determine any pattern of avoidance. Key results. While deer were more likely to observe and be startled by white flash than infrared, this did not adversely affect the detection of the deer, with no significant change in the detection rate between the two different flash types over time. Group size was found not to influence behavioural response when encountering camera traps, whereas different age-sex classes of deer showed very few differences in response to camera traps. Conclusions. White flash cameras were found to be suitable for Eld's deer population surveys and were beneficial in providing colour night-time photos that allow for spotted female deer to be individually identified. Implications. Practitioners should not be concerned about the influence of white flash when using camera traps to monitor populations of Eld's deer, and using white flash is recommended when individual identification is required.

AB  - Burrowing animals profoundly influence plant communities, and changes in the burrower and plant communities together with changing abiotic parameters can shift the influence of burrowers on plants. However, we lack an ability to predict when, where, and how burrowers will influence vegetation. To begin to understand how naturally, varying environmental conditions influence the impacts of burrowers, we need to examine how burrower impacts on marsh plants differ across sites differing in environmental conditions. We manipulated crab presence for multiple years and measured the responses of the dominant plants, Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) and perennial pickleweed (Sarcocornia pacifica), at three sites in northern California and two sites in southern California. Southern California (Point Conception, CA, to the U.S.-Mexico border) experiences higher air and water temperatures, lower precipitation, and higher porewater salinity levels. Combining data from these field studies with laboratory studies allowed us to generate predictions about burrowing crab effects in salt marshes. Our models included (1) an estimate of grazing pressure on marsh plants by the dominant burrowing crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) and (2) several soil biogeochemical measurements. Crab effects varied from strongly positive to strongly negative and depended upon estimated crab grazing pressure and edaphic conditions (salinity, ammonium, and nitrate). Relative to crabs at other sites, crabs enhanced cordgrass at sites with intermediate levels of ammonium and extreme salinities. The dependence of crab effects on edaphic conditions suggests that projected interannual variability in temperature, precipitation, and nutrients could lead to more temporally variable impacts of crabs on cordgrass. Understanding the environmental controls on these interactions will help promote cordgrass productivity and stabilize salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - When habitat use by field-dwelling animals coincides in space and time with agricultural practices such as spring mowing of meadows, human-wildlife conflicts can have deadly consequences for wildlife. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) fawns are particularly vulnerable because they hide in meadows during the rearing phase. Thus, a better understanding of the habitat drivers of bed-site selection is critical to mitigating fawn mortality during mowing. Here, we tease apart the among-field (presumably driven by maternal behaviour) and within-field (driven by fawn behaviour) components of bed-site selection of roe deer during the spring mowing season. We collected over 600 fawn bed sites across an environmentally diverse study region. At the among-field scale, we implemented a used versus available design and employed a two-part statistical model (GAMLSS) to identify habitat characteristics that were linked to either fawn presence (vs. absence) or abundance on a given field. At the within-field scale, we compared habitat characteristics at fawn bed-sites with paired random sites using a conditional logistic regression model. At the among-field scale, fawns were more likely to be present, and were more abundant, in fields within more diverse, rural landscapes, with nearby woodland. Surprisingly, fawns were more often present in fields that were near roads and had lower vegetation productivity. At the within-field scale, however, fawns preferred bed-sites which were further from both roads and woodland, but that provided the best visual cover to minimise predation risk. Our findings revealed substantial and novel scale-dependent differences in the drivers of habitat selection of mothers and fawns, which, together, determine the precise locations of bed-sites between and within meadows. These results may aid wildlife managers in identifying areas where there is a high probability of encountering a roe deer fawn so as to initiate targeted searches prior to mowing and, ultimately, mitigate fawn mowing mortality.

AB  - Olive productivity should be improved through stimulating nutrition, particularly under poor fertility soils. Con-sequently, the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of applying organic and bio-fertilizers on the phy-siological growth, yield and fruit quality of olive trees under newly reclaimed poor-fertility sandy soil in an arid environment. During a field experiment carried out at El-Qantara, North Sinai, Egypt over two consecutive sea-sons (2019-2020 and 2020-2021), olive Kalamata trees were evaluated under three organic fertilizer treatments alone or in combination with three bio-fertilizers treatments. Organic fertilizer was applied as goat manure (16.8 kg/tree/year), or olive pomace (8.5 kg/tree/year) in mid-December of each season vs. untreated trees. The bio-fertilizers were applied as N-fixing bacteria (150 g/tree) was inculated in early March of each season, or amino acid mixture (1.5%) was applied three times, at 70% of full bloom, 21 days after full bloom, and a month later in comparison to a non-fertilized trees (control). The cultivar used was Kalamata, a dual-purpose cultivar for oil and table olives whose value increases when processed as table olives. The results indicated that the goat man-ure followed by olive pomace significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoids), leaf mineral contents (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Fe), tree canopy volume, number of flowers per inflorescence, number of inflorescences per shoot, initial fruit set, fruit retention. For fruit quality, fruit length and width, fruit weight, and total fruit yield was increased compared to the non-fertilized control. Likewise, The bio-fertilizer N-fixing bacteria followed by the amino acid mixture significantly improved all of the aforementioned parameters. Accord-ingly, it is recommended, both environmentally and economically to utilize organic and bio-fertizers, particularly goat manure combined with N-fixing bacteria, in low-fertility soil to sustain olive production as well as reducing mineral fertilization.

AB  - Predators can directly and indirectly alter the foraging behaviour of prey through direct predation and the risk of predation, and in doing so, initiate indirect effects that influence myriad species and ecological processes. We describe how wolves indirectly alter the trajectory of forests by constraining the distance that beavers, a central place forager and prolific ecosystem engineer, forage from water. Specifically, we demonstrate that wolves wait in ambush and kill beavers on longer feeding trails than would be expected based on the spatio-temporal availability of beavers. This pattern is driven by temporal dynamics of beaver foraging: beavers make more foraging trips and spend more time on land per trip on longer feeding trails that extend farther from water. As a result, beavers are more vulnerable on longer feeding trails than shorter ones. Wolf predation appears to be a selective evolutionary pressure propelled by consumptive and non-consumptive mechanisms that constrain the distance from water beavers forage, which in turn limits the area of forest around wetlands, lakes and rivers beavers alter through foraging. Thus, wolves appear intricately linked to boreal forest dynamics by shaping beaver foraging behaviour, a form of natural disturbance that alters the successional and ecological states of forests.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe and compare the dietary composition of lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) populations in Liwonde National Park, Malawi. Using scat analyses and direct observations, our results indicate a high degree of dietary overlap (O-ab > 0.70), indicative of intraguild competition, and all carnivores exhibited a dietary preference for kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros). At present, coexistence is potentially facilitated by low carnivore densities and spatiotemporal responses. We recommend that carnivore diets and niche partitioning strategies continue to be investigated as carnivore populations increase.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts arising from livestock depredation can impact both livestock producers and carnivore populations. We used livestock depredation insurance claims from 2 895 depredation events involving 7 411 livestock throughout Mexico to evaluate the diversity of carnivores and livestock involved in depredations and identify attributes related to species-specific livestock depredation sites and carnivore predation patterns. Cattle comprised 48% of depredation events, followed by sheep (36%), goats (13%), equids (2%), and hogs ( < 1%). Coyotes were responsible for 28% of depredation events, followed by domestic dogs (27%), pumas (22%), jaguars (15%), and bears (5%). Both kill sites of differing livestock species and predation patterns of carnivores varied with respect to predator responsible or prey killed, landscape attributes, and season; patterns reflected primarily species-specific habitat preferences, livestock husbandry practices, and tolerances of carnivores for human impacts. Our results indicate that the greatest challenge of managing depredation conflicts in Mexico is that depredations by carnivores that kill the most livestock (coyote, domestic dog) are facilitated by increasing human impacts and the canid's adaptability. Depredations associated with carnivores limited to relatively rare ecological conditions (e.g., proximity to protected natural areas [PNAs]) can be mitigated by cultural changes, such as avoiding establishing new livestock production areas near PNAs, or new PNAs adjacent to traditional livestock production areas. Opportunities to limit ecologically and sociologically problematic impacts such as retaliatory killing of carnivores include accurate identification of the actual depredating carnivore.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss globally threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Fragmentation disrupts gene flow and isolates populations, endangering species persistence. Dispersal ability is critical for species to maintain gene flow among populations and colonising new habitats. However, most species' dispersal abilities are unknown, raising the question of whether species are dispersal or habitat limited. Carrion beetles recycle animal necromass, an important ecosystem function. In theory, species depending on ephemeral resources such as carrion have good dispersal abilities to colonise new habitat patches regularly. However, little is known about the dispersal capacity of carrion beetles. To infer such dispersal abilities, we investigated the population genetic structure of three common carrion beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Silphinae): Nicrophorus vespilloides Herbst, Necrodes littoralis Linnaeus and Oiceoptoma thoracicum Linnaeus. We sampled individuals using liver-baited pitfall traps and laid out carcasses in 47 sites in four regions in southern Germany. The distances between sampling sites ranged from 100 m to 320 km. We used microsatellite markers to assess population genetic structure and gene flow at local and regional spatial scales. Markers were newly developed for N. littoralis and O. thoracicum. Pairwise FST, AMOVA and DAPC analyses revealed no significant population genetic structure within all three species, indicating no limitation in gene flow, even over long distances. Our data suggest excellent dispersal abilities in all three species without critical spatial limitation at the regional scale of our study. This implies that carrion management should focus more on habitat amount rather than spatial arrangements for the conservation of carrion insects.

AB  - Seagrass, systems export significant amounts of their primary production as large detritus (i.e. macrophytodetritus). Accumulations of exported macrophytodetritus (AEM) are found in many areas in coastal environment. Dead seagrass leaves are often a dominant component of these accumulations, offering shelter and/or food to numerous organisms. AEM are particular habitats, different from donor habitats (i.e. seagrass meadow, kelp or macroalgae habitats) and with their own characteristics and dynamics. They have received less attention than donor habitats despite the fact they often connect different coastal habitats, are the place of intense remineralization processes and shelter associated detritus food web. As for seagrass meadows themselves, AEM are potentially affected by global change and by tropicalization processes. Here, we review briefly general characteristic of AEM with a focus on Mediterranean Sea and Western Australia and we provide some hypotheses concerning their tropicalization in a near future. We conclude that AEM functioning could change either through: (1) declines in biomass or loss of seagrass directly due to increased ocean temperatures or increased herbivory from tropicalized herbivores; (2) increased degradation and processing of seagrass detritus within seagrass meadows leading to reduced export; (3) replacement of large temperate seagrass species with smaller tropical seagrass species; and/or (4) loss or changes to macroalgae species in neighboring habitats that export detritus. These processes will alter the amount, composition, quality, timing and frequency of inputs of detritus into ecosystems that rely on AEM as trophic subsidies, which will alter the suitability of AEM as habitat and food for invertebrates.

AB  - When rain falls on an existing cover of snow, followed by low temperatures, or falls as freezing rain, it can leave a hard crust. These Arctic rain on snow (ROS) events can profoundly influence the environment and in turn, human livelihoods. Impacts can be immediate (e.g. on human travel, herding, or harvesting) or evolve or accumulate, leading to massive starvation-induced die-offs of reindeer, caribou, and musk oxen, for example. We provide here a review and synthesis of Arctic ROS events and their impacts, addressing human-environment relationships, meteorological conditions associated with ROS events, and challenges in their detection. From our assessment of the state of the science, we conclude that while (a) systematic detection of ROS events, their intensity, and trends across the Arctic region can be approached by combining data from satellite remote sensing, atmospheric reanalyses, and meteorological station records; (b) obtaining knowledge and information most germane to impacts, such as the thickness of ice layers, how ice layers form within a snowpack, and antecedent conditions that can amplify impacts, necessitates collaboration and knowledge co-production with community members and indigenous knowledge-holders.

AB  - Ecological resource availability is crucial for the persistence and survival of local desert animal communities. Dryland resources such as shrubs and burrows positively benefit animal species by mitigating harsh abiotic factors and providing habitat. Understanding the role of native shrubs, many of which serve as foundation species within desert regions, as well as the function of underground burrows as resources, provides insights into habitat utilization. In this study, we seek to better understand the co-occurrence of these two resources as a first step in quantifying key patterns locally and regionally in drylands. We tested whether the presence of burrows increased with the density of foundational shrubs near the burrows at two scales-within a 5 m radius of every burrow recorded and at the site level-defined as discrete ecological areas. We performed fieldwork across 31 sites within the arid and semiarid regions of Central California. We used a combination of burrow field surveys and satellite imagery to document both vertebrate animal burrow frequencies and shrub densities. Additionally, the accuracy of the shrub data was verified through ground truthing. Both fine-scale and site-level shrub densities positively predicted the relative likelihood of burrows and the frequency of burrows, respectively. The existence of two highly utilized dryland resources and the relationship between them signal that areas abundant in both resources will likely better support resident animal species. This finding underscores the significance of incorporating both shrub density and burrow frequency in studies of habitat interconnectivity and quality. The co-occurrence patterns of these resources will support novel habitat management and conservation strategies designed around both conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Eradicating feral pigs from island ecosystems can assist in restoring damaged biodiversity values and protect commercial industries such as agriculture. Although many feral pig eradications have been attempted, management decisions are often led by practitioner experience rather than empirical evidence. Few interventions have been guided by population models to identify harvest intensity necessary to achieve eradication within a specified time frame, nor have they applied data on control effort and costs to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of proposed control strategies. We used effort and cost data from a feral pig-control program on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, over 17 months to derive functional-response relationships between control effort (in hours per pig) and pig abundance for four control methods: (1) ground-based shooting, (2) trapping with remote triggers, (3) poison baiting, and (4) thermal-assisted aerial culling. We developed a stochastic Leslie matrix with compensatory density feedback on survival to project population trajectories from an initial population (N-0) of 250 female pigs with an estimated island-wide carrying capacity (K) of 2500 over 3 and 10 years for populations subjected to an annual harvest of 35%-95%. We built functional-response models to calculate annual effort and cost for six cull scenarios across all harvest rates. We derived total cost and effort over 3- and 10-year projections from the sum of annual cost and effort within the projection intervals. Pig populations were reduced to <10% N(0 )based on harvest rates >80% and 60% for culls of 3- and 10-year durations, respectively. In all scenarios above, the minimum required harvest rate and the total cost to reduce population to <= 10% of N-0 decreased with increasing harvest proportion, with lower total costs incurred over 3 years compared to 10 years. The simulations suggest that the most cost-effective approach for most scenarios is to maximize annual harvest and complete eradication effort over the shortest periods.

AB  - Private-land, deer-hunting cooperatives seek to facilitate collective action to restrain buck harvest, encourage doe harvest, and improve hunter satisfaction. We evaluated 15 deer-hunting cooperatives in southern Michigan to assess whether perceived satisfaction among 348 members was affected by deer harvest outcomes, characteristics of cooperative members, agreement over voluntarily established harvest and population management goals, and members' perceived fit with their cooperative. Our results indicate that cooperative members harvested just over 2 antlerless deer for every antlered buck, compared to an overall hunter harvest ratio of approximately 1:1 across all of southern Michigan. Perceived satisfaction levels generally increased among cooperative members after joining a cooperative. Perceived satisfaction was positively correlated with members' perceived fit within the cooperative, members' perceived agreement with other cooperative members on harvest and management goals, years of membership and antlerless harvest, and negatively associated with member age. Our results suggested that efforts to promote the formation and successful operation of private, deer-management cooperatives may provide a way for state wildlife agencies to leverage collective action to enhance deer management capacity, boost hunter satisfaction, and potentially increase hunter recruitment, retention, and reactivation.

AB  - We examined the distribution of termites along an elevational gradient in the western Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. Sampling followed standardized protocols at nine forest sites (125, 325, 488, 715, 850, 1150, 1316, 1544, and 1700 masl), all except the lowest site within the Intercontinental Mediterranean Biosphere Reserve. We found a total of three termite species, with Reticulitermes grassei (Rhinotermitidae) being the most abundant, followed by Kalotermes flavicollis (Kalotermitinae) and Amitermes sp. (Terminidae). Comparing microhabitat preferences, we found R. grassei and Amitermes sp. exclusively in buried wood and under rocks, and K. flavicollis exclusively in dead tree trunks and surface wood. The findings reveal the distribution of microhabitats along an elevation gradient and the corresponding preferences of termite species across these microhabitats. We found that total termite density decreased significantly with elevation (r(s) = -0.40; p < 0.001), but with distinct differences among species. Kalotermes flavicollis and Amitermes sp. showed a strong negative correlation between density and elevation. In contrast, for R. grassei, the most common termite, we found no significant correlation. Termite density also varied among forest types, with a non-significant trend (p = 0.075) of higher density in the cork oak forest (hits/m(2) = 0.06) compared to holm oak (0.04) and fir-cedar (0.02) forests. This research contributes to the limited knowledge of termite diversity and ecology in northern Africa and western Mediterranean forests.

AB  - The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is experiencing rapid climate warming, resulting in affecting the marine food web. To investigate the microzooplankton spatial distribution and to assess how climate change could affect the tintinnids community, sea water samples were collected during late summer 2018 at 19 stations in three different areas: Deception Island, Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound. The microzooplankton community comprised mainly tintinnids, aloricate ciliates, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and micrometazoans. Microzooplankton abundance varied between 3 and 109 ind. L-1 and biomass ranged from 0.009 to 2.55 mu g C L-1. Significant differences in terms of abundance and taxonomic composition of microzooplankton were found among the three sampling areas. Deception Island area showed 44% of tintinnids and the rest were heterotrophic dinoflagellate, aloricate ciliates and micrometazoans. In Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound areas, tintinnids reached, respectively, 73% and 83% of the microzooplankton composition, with all the other groups varying between 20 and 30%. Tintinnids were the most representative group in the area, with the species Codonellopsis balechi, Codonellopsis glacialis, Cymatocylis convallaria and Cymatocylis drygalskii. The highest amounts of tintinnids were found at the surface and 100 m depth. The above mentioned species may be considered key species for the WAP and therefore they can be used to track environmental and hydrographical changes in the area. In late summer, microzooplankton presented low abundances and biomass, nevertheless they represented an important fraction of the planktonic community in the area.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo farming has become economically important in Brazil given the highly rustic nature of the species and the better nutritional characteristics of buffalo meat and milk. However, the sector has been impacted by the occurrence of different diseases in buffaloes that have been poorly described in the international literature to date. This study reports and describes the clinically observed neurological signs and the macroscopic and microscopic lesions of bacterial meningitis in adult buffaloes raised in the Amazon biome. These lesions are associated with fractures of the base of the horn and exposure of the frontal sinus.Abstract Meningitis is the inflammation of the membranes surrounding the central nervous system and is poorly described in water buffaloes. Five cases of meningitis in adults buffaloes of the Murrah and Mediterranean breads were studied. All buffaloes came from a farm located in the municipality of Castanhal, Para, Brazil at different times. Clinical examination showed neurological clinical signs, such as apathy, reluctance to move, spastic paresis especially of the pelvic limbs, hypermetria, difficulty getting up, pressing of the head into obstacles and convulsion. In three buffaloes, a large part of the horn had been lost, exposing the corresponding frontal sinus, through which a bloody to purulent exudate flowed. The hemogram revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis. At necropsy, adherence of the dura mater to the periosteum and a purulent to fibrinopurulent exudate were observed in the sulci of the cerebral cortex and on the pia mater over almost the entire surface of the brain and throughout the spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid had a cloudy aspect with fibrin filaments. The histopathology of buffaloes confirmed the diagnosis of bacterial fibrinopurulent meningitis. Buffaloes are susceptible to bacterial inflammation of the meninges due to fractures of the base of the horn and mostly present with neurological manifestations.

AB  - While the invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White) [Hemiptera: Fulgoridae], continues to expand its range in the United States, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the economic threat that this pest presents to forest ecosystems and production nurseries. L. delicatula uses several common hardwood trees as hosts and a previous study found that short-term feeding can reduce growth of young maple saplings. Herein, long-term feeding over 4 consecutive seasons significantly reduced diameter growth and below-ground starch storage in roots of young silver maples (Acer saccharinum L.), weeping willows (Salix babylonica L.), river birches (Betula nigra L.), and trees of heaven (Ailanthus altissima [Mill.] Swingle) in response to L. delicatula feeding pressure in a density-dependent manner. In Year 3 when feeding pressure was the lowest, silver maple and willow recovered with greater diameter growth than in Year 2. Nutrients essential for photosynthesis and growth (iron, sulfur, and phosphorus) were reduced in leaves of all tree species compared to controls in the second year. This 4-yr study represents a worst-case scenario in which L. delicatula fed on the same trees for 4 consecutive growing seasons. In the wild, population numbers can vary greatly from year to year on individual trees and they move frequently among hosts (until autumn when they settle on A. altissima or other late-season hosts that have not yet senesced). Thus, we would not expect negative impacts of unconfined L. delicatula in natural settings on forest or ornamental trees to be as marked as reported here.

AB  - The behavior and abundance of sympatric predators can be affected by a complex dominance hierarchy. The strength of antagonistic interactions in predator communities is difficult to study and remains poorly understood for many predator assemblages. Predators directly and indirectly influence the broader ecosystem, so identifying the relative importance of competition, prey, and habitat in shaping predator interactions has broad conservation and management implications. We investigated space use among five predator species (black bear [Ursus americanus], bobcat [Lynx rufus], coyote [Canis latrans], mountain lion [Puma concolor], and gray wolf [Canis lupus]) across three temporal scales in northern Idaho, USA. We used camera trap data to test whether potentially subordinate predators spatially avoided dominant predators and how prey availability influenced those relationships. We found few instances of subordinate predators spatially avoiding dominant predators and only at the finest temporal scale of our analyses. Instead, habitat features generally influenced predator space use patterns at coarser scales whereas prey and competitor presence influenced space use patterns at finer scales. Co-occurrence was positively associated between coyotes and bobcats at coarser timescales and between mesopredators and apex predators at finer timescales. Bobcats and mountain lions temporarily delayed the use of sites recently visited by coyotes and black bears, respectively. And all predator species used sites sooner following the detection of a competitor in areas with higher relative abundances of prey (primarily white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus]). Our results suggest attraction to shared habitats and prey resources influenced space use in the predator community more than avoidance of competitors. We propose that the effects of interspecific interactions on predator distributions were most evident for mesopredators because their trophic position requires balancing risks and rewards associated with prey, apex predators, and other mesopredators. In addition, relatively high densities of a common prey source likely facilitated the spatial coexistence in this predator community. Our study demonstrates the value of simultaneously assessing multiple interspecific interactions across different spatiotemporal scales to discern relationships within the predator guild.

AB  - Anthropogenic land-use change is currently one of the greatest threats to biodiversity across the globe and tropical savannas are likely to be disproportionately impacted by these changes in coming decades. In particular, the loss of larger savanna trees is concerning because of the critical ecological functions they provide. Here, we studied the potential for positive (e.g., increased resources, propagation) and negative (e.g., harvesting, cattle grazing) influence of two increasingly dominant land uses throughout southern African savannas, communal lands and intensive agricultural, on the size class distributions of dominant large tree species (i.e., knobthorn [Senegalia nigrecens] and marula [Scelerocarya birrea]) in savannas surrounded by these transformed lands. We recorded a total of 646 knobthorn and 303 marula individuals. The two species showed individualistic responses to surrounding land use types. Average abundances (mean, +/- 95 % CI) of marula were similar between savanna patches surrounded by savanna only, and savannas surrounded by agricultural and communal areas, while the abundance of most size classes of knobthorn were drastically reduced by surrounding land uses, likely from harvesting for fuel wood. In this study we showed that the influence of land use changes on large tree populations spills over onto the savannas they surround. Furthermore, tree population responses depend on both the surrounding land use and species identity, which determine the nature of exploitative activities. The different exploitative activities appear to be neutral with respect to the populations of marula while reducing populations sizes of knobthorn (i.e. through wood fuel harvesting). We conclude with management recommendations that may increase knobthorn populations in communal areas. Specifically, we suggest encouraging people to propagate knobthorn and other native and wood fuel species for sale at nurseries, teaching harvesting approaches that foster sustainable populations, and encouraging alternative sources fuel and diversified livelihoods.

AB  - Effective conservation is often informed by focal species studies to identify beneficial land management interventions. For nocturnal or cryptic species, quantifying habitat use across individually marked animals can allow unbiased assessment of intervention efficacy and identify other important habitats. Here, using a landscape-scale experiment, we examine whether interventions intended to create nesting habitat for the largely nocturnal Eurasian Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus within semi-natural grassland also provide foraging habitat. GPS loggers were fitted to five adult Stone-curlews during the breeding season within an extensive area of semi-natural grassland (3850 ha, hereafter 'grassland'), surrounded by a mosaic of arable cropland (total study area 118 600 ha). The largely closed-sward grassland was diversified by experimental ground-disturbance plots (the intervention) prior to this study. We used the GPS fixes to identify 1881 foraging locations (510 during nesting and 1371 post-breeding) across the grassland and surrounding landscape. Most foraging locations were close to the nest-site during the nesting period (90% within 1 km) or day-roost during post-breeding (90% within 5 km), but birds travelled up to 4.1 km from these sites during nesting and 13 km post-breeding. Stone-curlews were two- (by night) or three-times (by day) more likely to select disturbed-grassland over unmodified grassland for foraging during nesting, and c. 15 times more likely to do so post-breeding. Spring-sown crops and pig fields or manure heaps were also selected over grassland for nocturnal foraging. Given that central place foraging occurs in this species, conservation efforts that promote breeding attempts through ground-disturbance should ensure suitable foraging habitat is near the nest (<1 km). Creating multiple areas of disturbed-ground close to the edge of large grassland blocks can provide a network of nesting and foraging habitats, while allowing access to foraging habitats on the surrounding arable farmland. Similar interventions may benefit other disturbance associated grassland waders.

TI  - A handbook for the standardised sampling of plant functional traits in disturbance-prone ecosystems, with a focus on open ecosystems (vol 68, pg 473, 2021)
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA  - English
AB  - Plant functional traits provide a valuable tool to improve our understanding of ecological processes at a range of scales. Previous handbooks on plant functional traits have highlighted the importance of standardising measurements of traits to improve our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes. In open ecosystems (i.e. grasslands, savannas, open woodlands and shrublands), traits related to disturbance (e.g. herbivory, drought, and fire) play a central role in explaining species performance and distributions and are the focus of this handbook. We provide brief descriptions of 34 traits and list important environmental filters and their relevance, provide detailed sampling methodologies and outline potential pitfalls for each trait. We have grouped traits according to plant functional type (grasses, forbs and woody plants) and, because demographic stages may experience different selective pressures, we have separated traits according to the different plant life stages (seedlings saplings and adults). We have attempted to not include traits that have been covered in previous handbooks except for where updates or additional information was considered beneficial.

AB  - The process of organizing and interpreting sensory information, known as perceptual processing, is a key feature of adaptation allowing animals to integrate, assess and cope with challenges in their environments. Here, we examined the durations of vigilance bouts and stares in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, as an indicator of time spent vigilant and perceptual processing, respectively. We tested the extent to which vigilance was shaped by relevant ecological factors, focusing on predation risk. Specifically, we tested whether stare duration increased when sheep were younger, part of smaller groups, further from others, further from escape terrain or closer to obstructive cover, all of which are expected to affect individual predation risk. Perceptual processing in bighorn sheep conformed to the 1-4 s perceptual window found in other mammals, consistent with the idea of a phylogenetically conserved mechanism across mammalian species but was variable within individuals, indicating that perceptual processing is plastic to relevant ecological contexts. As expected, stare duration was much shorter than vigilance bout duration. Stare duration increased with decreasing distance to obstructive cover, which could indicate perceptual processing costs of searching for cryptic predators. We also found a significant difference in vigilance bout duration between the sexes: age was positively correlated with vigilance bout duration in males but not in females. Vigilance bout durations were longer when animals were further from escape terrain. Neither group size nor distance to other individuals was associated with stare or bout durations.

AB  - The ancient expansion of savannahs has long been examined through models and palaeorecords, but this new experiment combining CO2 and drought finds the physiological mechanisms priming the forest-to-savannah transition.
   Savannahs dominated by grasses with scattered C-3 trees expanded between 24 and 9 million years ago in low latitudes at the expense of forests. Fire, herbivory, drought and the susceptibility of trees to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2](a)) are proposed as key drivers of this transition. The role of disturbance is well studied, but physiological arguments are mostly derived from models and palaeorecords, without direct experimental evidence. In replicated comparative experimental trials, we examined the physiological effects of [CO2](a) and prolonged drought in a broadleaf forest tree, a savannah tree and a savannah C-4 grass. We show that the forest tree was more disadvantaged than either the savannah tree or the C-4 grass by the low [CO2](a) and increasing aridity. Our experiments provide insights into the role of the intrinsic physiological susceptibility of trees in priming the disturbance-driven transition from forest to savannah in the conditions of the early Miocene.

AB  - The important albeit discontinuous pollen and more complete small mammal microrecords from the long, Late Upper Pleistocene stratigraphic deposit in El Miro<acute accent>n Cave (Cantabria, Spain, >47,000-12,000 cal BP) are presented and compared in detail. They describe a sequence of environmental conditions varying from cold and relatively dry to somewhat more temperate and more humid throughout the course of late MIS 3 and MIS 2, and into the early Holocene conditions of MIS 1, with variable intensity and function of human occupation of the cave during late Mousterian, Gravettian, Solutrean, Magdalenian and Azilian cultural periods. In general, the discontinuous palynological record is concordant with the more continuous small mammal sequence in tracing the changes in local climate and landscape within the broader context of the high relief and coastal setting of the Cantabrian region of northern Atlantic Iberia. Shifts in the extent and composition of open versus wooded vegetation in the montane and low valley surroundings of the cave are documented by the analyses detailed here. Some of the environmental fluctuations, namely the Last Glacial Maximum, the Late Glacial and the at the beginning of the Holocene, seem to have had significant effects on the nature of human uses of this cave with short, ephemeral, special/limited-function visits, while Oldest Dryas, despite its still-rigorous conditions but abundant pasture for game species (red deer and ibex), did not prevent the cave from being used as a major, repetitive, long-term base camp for foraging bands, notably during the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian.

AB  - Humans are inherently fascinated by exaggerated morphological structures such as elk antlers and peacock trains. Because these traits are costly to develop and wield, the environment in which they are used can select for specific sizes or shapes to minimize such costs. In aquatic environments, selection to reduce drag can constrain the form of exaggerated structures; this is presumably why exaggerated morphologies are less common in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial ones. Interestingly, some crayfish species possess claws with an exaggerated gape between their pinching fingers, but the function of this claw gape is unknown. Here, I describe and test the function of the exaggerated claw gape of the New River crayfish, Cambarus chasmodactylus. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that the claw gape aids in movement against flowing currents. I found that both claw size and gape size were sexually dimorphic in this species and that males have disproportionately larger gapes compared to females. By experimentally covering their claw gape and testing crayfish locomotor performance, I found that individuals with their gape blocked were 30% slower than crayfish with a natural gape. My results highlight a unique adaptation that compensates for wielding an exaggerated structure in aquatic environments.

AB  - Succession occurs when river biota recovers from the loss of biomass and diversity caused by flood disturbance, and has rarely been examined in the tropical savannah biome. Hypotheses are tested which address the environmental context and recovery of riffle macroinvertebrates in an Australian perennial, tropical savannah river, located in a catchment with low anthropogenic impact. Recovery occurred over a 32-week dry-season period of gradually declining discharge with near-stable water quality, after a 23-week wet-season flood-disturbance period, which was typical of the river's flow regime. Prolonged, benign environmental conditions during recovery facilitated the accrual of macroalgae. Macroinvertebrate abundance, mediated by macroalgal biomass, and diversity increased at a logarithmic, asymptotic rate over the recovery period. Macroinvertebrate assemblages and functional feeding groups (FFGs) tended to become more similar between consecutive sample dates as recovery progressed, though with variable abundances of core taxa (Orthocladiinae, Hydropsychidae, Orthotrichia, Chironominae and Pyralidae) and prominence of Hydroptila late in the recovery period. Filterer abundances fluctuated most, whilst the relative abundance of herbivorous shredders and predators generally increased. The return of macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity to its pre-disturbance state is attributed to the similar pre- and post-disturbance environmental conditions. Recovery broadly agreed with the secondary succession paradigm for macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrate succession was probably driven mainly by biotic factors, after the initial colonisation period. However, this requires elucidation and expansion of the current paradigm of river benthic succession from flood disturbance to address macroinvertebrate population dynamics under benign abiotic environmental conditions.

AB  - Hunting preferences reveal a great deal about the life of Paleolithic humans, and may reflect changes in human demography, technology, and adaptations to changing environments. However, the effects of hunting preferences and environmental availability are often conflated, stressing the need for comparisons to other predators that exploited the same environment. Manot Cave (Israel), preserved rich Early Upper Paleolithic (46-33 ka) human occupations, along with repeated spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) occupations, allowing us to compare anthropogenic and biogenic bone assemblages within the same space and time frame. We focused on the faunal remains retrieved in themiddle of the cave (Area D), and conducted detailed taphonomic and zooarchaeological analyses. The Area D archaeofauna was dominated by Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), which showed high abundance of carnivore damage. This and the carnivore-to-ungulate ratio, the presence of juvenile hyena and numerous coprolites match the criteria of a hyena den, confirming that the bone assemblage was created mainly by hyenas. Manot Area D thus reveals hyena prey choice in the Upper Paleolithic Galilee, which we then compared with human prey choice. Our results showed that hyena prey assemblages in Manot and elsewhere in the Levant were Dama-dominated while human assemblages were dominated by Gazella, demonstrating that hyenas and humans hunted different animal size groups, possibly in different habitats. We interpret this phenomenon as resulting from two possible scenarios: the emergence of projectile technology which may favor hunting in open environments, and niche partitioning derived by human-hyena competition. Hyenas were abundant and hunted unselectively while the anthropogenic record presents population turnovers and some dietary diversification. Whereas both scenarios are difficult to test directly with the available evidence, we argue that either one explains quite well the late Pleistocene archaeofaunal patterns in the Levantine record.

AB  - The influential role of fire in shaping Florida scrub vegetation is well documented; however, relatively less is known about the role of fire on trophic interactions such as those between plants and herbivores. Here we examined the response of insect herbivory to time-since-fire and succession on Lyonia fruticosa (Michx.) G.S. Torr. (Ericaceae), a shrub found in scrub of south-central Florida. We measured herbivory on > 200 plants across a time-since-fire gradient of 7 sites (ranging from 0.6-8.7 yr) by (1) surveying recently flushed leaves for 3 mo to control for leaf age, and (2) surveying herbivory across whole plants irrespective of leaf age. We also recorded damage types (chewing, scraping, and mining) to determine how herbivore guilds were affected by time-since-fire. Using generalized additive models, we found herbivory increased for 5 to 6 yr post-fire with 59.8% of the devi-ance explained by time-since-fire in flushed leaf surveys and 76.6% in whole plant surveys. Chewing was the dominant damage type and increased for 5 yr post-fire. Scraping and mining damage were less frequent and unaffected by time-since-fire within the range studied. Additionally, we modeled the post-fire responses of L. fruticosa traits (height, stems, flowering, and leaf area), and found that most changes in growth and reproduction oc-curred within the first 4 to 6 yr post-fire. Herbivory levels increased as plants recovered and peaked in yr 5 and 6 post-fire indicating insect herbivores, like the plants, are well adapted to the dynamic, pyrogenic landscape.

AB  - Estimates of body condition or body composition are useful metrics, and consistency among results determined by independent investigators enhances their utility. If concordant, albeit subjective, assessments of body condition can be achieved by personnel possessing differing levels of expertise, there are important implications for generating useful information that otherwise may not be obtained by investigators facing logistic or economic constraints, or difficult field conditions. We used a serendipitous opportunity to explore level of agreement among personnel with disparate levels of anatomical knowledge and familiarity with palpation to index body condition of 55 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Our preliminary results-albeit affected by sample size-suggested the investigators interpreted and applied scoring criteria similarly, despite their differing backgrounds. Given the potential to gain meaningful information on body condition that otherwise may not be attainable, we encourage further evaluation of concordance among independent investigators whenever body condition of bighorn sheep can be rated independently by >1 individual and, further, that the information be shared widely.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interaction, susceptible to nutrient enrichment, is fundamental for maintaining a healthy and stable ecosystem. Hence, identifying nutrient thresholds may enable better management and monitoring of ecosystems. However, little information is available for the nutrient threshold for the susceptibility of seagrass, the only marine angiosperm, to herbivory. In present study, we investigated how nitrate enrichment altered the traits of dominant tropical seagrass Thalassia hemprichii at the physiological level (nutritional quality, chemical deterrents, and structural characteristics), changing its susceptibility to the herbivory of Cerithidea rhizophorarum. A set of multiple-choice feeding assays were conducted using nitrate-enriched seagrass pre-cultivated in the lab for 60 days. The present study found that the effect of nitrate enrichment on seagrass susceptibility to herbivory was non-linear, with a threshold effect. Low nitrate enrichment chemically and structurally defended seagrass, subsequently reducing herbivory, while continuously increasing nutrient enrichment crossing the threshold enhanced seagrass susceptibility to herbivory. Meanwhile, seagrass leaf total phenol and free fatty acid contents were the two dominant factors determining the herbivory preference of C. rhizophorarum. Overall, since anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment is increasing in intensity and frequency, our findings are significant for conservation and emphasize the importance of coastal eutrophication control.

AB  - Island biogeography is the study of the spatio-temporal distribution of species, communities, assemblages or ecosystems on islands and other isolated habitats. Island diversity is structured by five classes of process: dispersal, establishment, biotic interactions, extinction and evolution. Classical approaches in island biogeography focused on species richness as the deterministic outcome of these processes. This has proved fruitful, but species traits can potentially offer new biological insights into the processes by which island life assembles and why some species perform better at colonising and persisting on islands. Functional traits refer to morphological and phenological characteristics of an organism or species that can be linked to its ecological strategy and that scale up from individual plants to properties of communities and ecosystems. A baseline hypothesis is for traits and ecological strategies of island species to show similar patterns as a matched mainland environment. However, strong dispersal, environmental and biotic-interaction filters as well as stochasticity associated with insularity modify this baseline. Clades that do colonise often embark on distinct ecological and evolutionary pathways, some because of distinctive evolutionary forces on islands, and some because of the opportunities offered by freedom from competitors or herbivores or the absence of mutualists. Functional traits are expected to be shaped by these processes. Here, we review and discuss the potential for integrating functional traits into island biogeography. While we focus on plants, the general considerations and concepts may be extended to other groups of organisms. We evaluate how functional traits on islands relate to core principles of species dispersal, establishment, extinction, reproduction, biotic interactions, evolution and conservation. We formulate existing knowledge as 33 working hypotheses. Some of these are grounded on firm empirical evidence, others provide opportunities for future research. We organise our hypotheses under five overarching sections. Section A focuses on plant functional traits enabling species dispersal to islands. Section B discusses how traits help to predict species establishment, successional trajectories and natural extinctions on islands. Section C reviews how traits indicate species biotic interactions and reproduction strategies and which traits promote intra-island dispersal. Section D discusses how evolution on islands leads to predictable changes in trait values and which traits are most susceptible to change. Section E debates how functional ecology can be used to study multiple drivers of global change on islands and to formulate effective conservation measures. Islands have a justified reputation as research models. They illuminate the forces operating within mainland communities by showing what happens when those forces are released or changed. We believe that the lens of functional ecology can shed more light on these forces than research approaches that do not consider functional differences among species.

AB  - Indigenous land stewardship and mixed-severity fire regimes both promote landscape heterogeneity, and the relationship between them is an emerging area of research. In our study, we reconstructed the historical fire regime of Ne Sextsine, a 5900-ha dry, Douglas fir-dominated forest in the traditional territory of the T'exelc (Williams Lake First Nation) in British Columbia, Canada. Between 1550 and 1982 CE, we found median fire intervals of 18 years at the plot level and 4 years at the study-site level. Ne Sextsine was characterized by an historical mixed-severity fire regime, dominated by frequent, low-severity fires as indicated by fire scars, with infrequent, mixed-severity fires indicated by cohorts. Differentiating low- from mixed-severity plots over time was key to understanding the drivers of the fire regime at Ne Sextsine. Low-severity plots were coincident with areas of highest use by the T'exelc, including winter village sites, summer fishing camps, and travel corridors. The high fire frequency in low-severity plots ceased in the 1870s, following the smallpox epidemic, the forced relocation of Indigenous peoples into small reserves, and the prohibition of Indigenous burning. In contrast, the mixed-severity plots were coincident with areas where forest resources, such as deer or certain berry species, were important. The high fire frequency in the mixed-severity plots continued until the 1920s when industrial-scale grazing and logging began, facilitated by the establishment of a nearby railway. T'exelc oral histories and archeological evidence at Ne Sextsine speak to varied land stewardship, reflected in the spatiotemporal complexity of low- and mixed-severity fire plots. Across Ne Sextsine, 63% of cohorts established and persisted in the absence of fire after colonial impacts beginning in the 1860s, resulting in a dense, homogeneous landscape that no longer supports T'exelc values and is more likely to burn at uncharacteristic high severities. This nuanced understanding of the Indigenous contribution to a mixed-severity fire regime is critical for advancing proactive fire mitigation that is ecoculturally relevant and guided by Indigenous expertise.

AB  - Currently 1677 species are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), yet only a small percentage have been delisted due to recovery. In the fall of 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting 23 species due to extinction. Tracking changes in species 'recovery status over time is critical to understanding species' statuses, informing adaptive management strategies, and assessing the performance of the ESA to prevent further species loss. In this paper, we describe four key obstacles in tracking species recovery status under the ESA. First, ESA 5-year reviews lack a standardized format and clear documentation. Second, despite having been listed for decades, many species still suffer major data gaps in their biology and threats, rendering it difficult if not impossible to track progress towards recovery. Third, many species have continued declining after listing, yet given the above (1 & 2), understanding potential causes (proximate and/or ultimate) can be difficult. Fourth, many species currently have no path to clear recovery, which represents a potential failing of the process. We conclude with a discussion of potential policy responses that could be addressed to enhance the efficacy of the ESA.
   The U.S. Endangered Species Act protects about 1700 species, but no concise, standardized metrics exist for assessing changes in species recovery status. We helped develop and test novel metrics that track changes in recovery status using six components. Our testing also revealed several key challenges to species recovery. image

AB  - With the rapidly increasing intensity of human activities in the marine realm, it has become urgent to better understand the impacts of human-induced disturbances on marine species. Marine mammals and birds are often observed to alter their fine-scale spatial distribution patterns in the presence of human at-sea activities, such as ship traffic and offshore wind farms (OWFs). This study presents EPIC (Extensive Periphery for Impact and Control), a novel approach for investigating such displacement in marine megafauna. The approach consists of a survey design that uses the OWFs surroundings in all directions as control space, complemented by a sophisticated statistical approach to quantify the extent and intensity of displacement and habitat loss in and around the area of potential disturbance. The approach is showcased by investigating the effects of an OWF in the Dutch North Sea on the habitat use of razorbills (Alca torda) and common guillemots (Uria aalge), two seabird species that occur in large numbers across the North Sea. We used an explicit spatial-temporal Bayesian model to predict their spatial distribution patterns based on eight aerial surveysed. The model output is used for a simulation study, comparing bird densities in the potential impact area with 1000 similarly sized control areas from the peripheral control space and from these, displacement around the OWF. Strong displacement was found for both razorbills and guillemots, within the OWF footprint but also in its surroundings. Razorbill and guillemot densities inside the OWF were reduced by 0.953 and 1.604 individuals per km(2), respectively, compared to the remainder of the study area, remaining considerably lower than control densities up to 2 km and > 10 km distance. The presented methodological approach holds great potential for future studies on the effects of local disturbances on displacement of marine megafauna.

AB  - Entanglement in ropes associated with static fishing gear (pots/traps/creels) is a welfare and conservation concern for minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus), and other megafauna in Scottish waters. The Scottish Entanglement Alliance estimated that six humpback whales and 30 minke whales become entangled annually. Where entanglement type was known, 83% of minke whales, 50% of humpback whales, and 76% of basking sharks were caught in floating groundlines between pots. We collaborated with fishers on Scotland's west coast to trial sinking groundline (which lies on the seabed) to assess its practicality. A total of 15 Nephrops (langoustine) and crab fishers re-roped 61 sets of creel gear and fished the gear for similar to 15 months, reporting on each haul. Over 1500 hauls were reported; the fishers encountered few problems, in some cases preferring the modified gear. We also deployed depth sensors/accelerometers and filmed a range of sinking and floating rope configurations with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to collect data on performance underwater. This project is encouraging, both because of its results-that there may be a simple option to greatly reduce entanglement risk-and because of the successful, bottom-up, partnership approach with Scottish creel fishers.

AB  - Musk deer (Moschus), the sole genus in the family Moschidae, are critically endangered and face an uncertain future due to the limited understanding of their taxonomy, evolutionary history, genetic load, and adaptive evolution. These knowledge gaps hinder conservation efforts at crucial stages. Here, we conducted a comprehensive conservation genomic analysis by sequencing eight M. anhuiensis genomes and integrating public data from 15 M. berezovskii individuals. Phylogenomic and population genomic analyses confirmed that M. anhuiensis is a distinct phylogenetic species that diverged approximately 260 thousand years ago (kya). Both species experienced severe population bottlenecks, subsequently exhibiting marked genetic divergence. Over the past 200 kya, M. berezovskii has undergone multiple admixture events and bottlenecks, whereas M. anhuiensis has steadily declined and maintained a small, stable population. Anthropogenic activities have intensified these pressures, leading to sharp declines in both species. Notably, M. anhuiensis has accumulated homozygous deleterious mutations, thereby heightening its extinction risk. Moreover, selective sweep analysis revealed 32 positively selected genes, including olfactory receptor genes (OLF3 and OR6B1), which are essential for foraging, reproduction, and social interactions; the proliferation-related gene (PDGFRA), which responds to environmental changes and injury; and the thermoregulation gene (CDH13), which helps maintain body temperature stability in extreme conditions. These findings shed light on the speciation and evolutionary history of musk deer, offering crucial insights into their local adaptations and vulnerabilities. This work provides a foundation for targeted conservation efforts to avert extinction and safeguard biodiversity.

AB  - Livestock farming has been a practice of great importance for the evolution of civilization, not only influencing social, economic, and cultural aspects at a global level, but also food, the economy, and sustainability, especially in developing countries, where it generates significant pressure on natural resources and biodiversity. In this context, conflict arises between wildlife, mainly top predators, and livestock farmers. Despite the efforts of different communities to implement measures against predation, the conflict continues to increase. In Latin America, the livestock sector is growing at a much higher rate than in the rest of the world, particularly in Chile, where around a third of agricultural production units use livestock as their main source of livelihood. To understand the factors influencing the behavior of goat farmers when adopting measures, we applied a hurdle model with social, spatial, economic, and productive information to assess the decision to adopt measures and the intensity of the adoption of such practices. To perform this, we used data from a survey, administered in 2014 to 476 farmers located in the three provinces of the Coquimbo Region. Our dependent variable was defined by six measures: a protection dog, night confinement of the herd, supervised grazing, anti-carnivore corral, the death or capture of the predator, and repelling the predator. The adoption decision, as well as the intensity of adoption, were influenced by the location, household size, the type of livestock, the income generated by the livestock, health management, and access to technical advice. The decision to adopt measures was influenced by the production system and whether it was self-sustaining, while the intensity of adoption was influenced by herd size and the number of losses due to predation. The results showed the importance of developing and adjusting livestock support initiatives in the study area, including those that could be created, based on differentiated measures according to the profiles of farmers in the territory.

AB  - Background Xuan Lien Nature Reserve was established in 1999 to protect important habitats and wildlife in the northern part of the Annamites in Vietnam. While Xuan Lien is home to many threatened species, it has experienced a high level of human disturbance over the last decades. To document and provide baseline data on the status and distribution of the terrestrial vertebrate fauna community in the region, we conducted a systematic camera trapping survey in Xuan Lien Nature Reserve in 2023. The data collected during the survey will help design proper conservation measures to better conserve the remaining species. New information Our study investigates and updates the species richness of mid- to large-sized terrestrial vertebrates, thus providing essential information for developing conservation strategies in Xuan Lien Nature Reserve, Vietnam. As camera traps were set up in a grid-based design, our survey also generated the first-ever systematic data for terrestrial vertebrate fauna in the area. The study covers approximately 21,000 hectares (about 77% of the area), using 35 camera trap stations; each station consists of two cameras. In total, the final dataset consists of 6,276 trap nights, recording at least 46 species in 39 genera. The results suggest that Xuan Lien is a key stronghold for small carnivores, based on the diversity of such species groups in the Reserve. We failed to detect the previously documented Roosevelt's muntjac ( Muntiacus rooseveltorum Osgood, 1932) and we only documented a single record of the northern red muntjac ( Muntiacus vaginalis Boddaert, 1785). Our survey confirms the severity of overhunting and other anthropogenic threats to the mammal fauna, especially ungulates, in the Reserve.

AB  - Mortality site investigations of telemetered wildlife are important for cause-specific survival analyses and understanding underlying causes of observed population dynamics. Yet, eroding ecoliteracy and a lack of quality control in data collection can lead researchers to make incorrect conclusions, which may negatively impact management decisions for wildlife populations. We reviewed a random sample of 50 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2019 on survival and cause-specific mortality of ungulates monitored with telemetry devices. This concise review revealed extensive variation in reporting of field procedures, with many studies omitting critical information for the cause of mortality inference. Field protocols used to investigate mortality sites and ascertain the cause of mortality are often minimally described and frequently fail to address how investigators dealt with uncertainty. We outline a step-by-step procedure for mortality site investigations of telemetered ungulates, including evidence that should be documented in the field. Specifically, we highlight data that can be useful to differentiate predation from scavenging and more conclusively identify the predator species that killed the ungulate. We also outline how uncertainty in identifying the cause of mortality could be acknowledged and reported. We demonstrate the importance of rigorous protocols and prompt site investigations using data from our 5-year study on survival and cause-specific mortality of telemetered mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in northern California. Over the course of our study, we visited mortality sites of neonates (n = 91) and adults (n = 23) to ascertain the cause of mortality. Rapid site visitations significantly improved the successful identification of the cause of mortality and confidence levels for neonates. We discuss the need for rigorous and standardized protocols that include measures of confidence for mortality site investigations. We invite reviewers and journal editors to encourage authors to provide supportive information associated with the identification of causes of mortality, including uncertainty.

AB  - The Levantine Early Upper Paleolithic (ca. 45e30 ka) has been a focus of research because of its unique position as a conduit of human, flora, and fauna species between Africa and Eurasia. Studies have mainly focused on the Early Ahmarian and Levantine Aurignacian, two entities, the former endemic and the latter foreign, which are considered to have coinhabited the region during that period. However, other cultural entities, such as the Atlitian in the Mediterranean region and the Arkov-Divshon in the arid regions of the southern Levant received less attention, and accordingly, suffer from broad definitions and chronological insecurity. These cultures hold potential insights regarding nuanced adaptations, recip-rocal influences, and diachronic assimilation processes. The recently discovered site of Nahal Rahaf 2 Rockshelter in the Judean Desert provides integral information on one of these entitiesdthe Arkov-Divshon. Two excavation seasons revealed a sequence of archaeological layers, with lithic assemblages in which laterally carinated items were prominent. Alongside rich faunal assemblages, other components of the material culture include perforated marine shells and bone tools, marking the first association of these elements with Arkov-Divshon and implying some degree of contact with the Mediterranean re-gions of the Levant. Good preservation of organic materials allowed radiocarbon dating of the human occupation at the site to ca. 37.5 - 34.0 ka cal BP, indicating chronological overlap with the Levantine Aurignacian, and possibly also with the latest phases of the Early Ahmarian. Thus, challenging the val-idity of the widely accepted 'Two Tradition' Model of the Levantine Upper Paleolithic. Lithic analyses suggest the use of one main reduction sequence and the primary production of bladelets from carinated items. Faunal remains suggest targeted hunting of ibex and gazelle. Botanical remains and sedimentary analyses suggest roughly similar environmental conditions, with a possible woodier environment in the surroundings of the site. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary The gut microbiota forms a complex microecosystem in vertebrates and is affected by various factors. Wild and captive red deer currently live in the same region but have vastly different diets. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequencing technology was performed to evaluate variations in the fecal microbiota of wild and captive individuals of both sexes of red deer. It was found that the composition and function of fecal microbiota in wild and captive environments were significantly different. As a key intrinsic factor, sex has a persistent impact on the formation and development of gut microbiota. Overall, this study reveals differences in the in the fecal microbiota of red deer based on environment and sex. These data could guide future applications of population management in red deer conservation. Gut microbiota play an important role in impacting the host's metabolism, immunity, speciation, and many other functions. How sex and environment affect the structure and function of fecal microbiota in red deer (Cervus elaphus) is still unclear, particularly with regard to the intake of different diets. In this study, non-invasive molecular sexing techniques were used to determine the sex of fecal samples from both wild and captive red deer during the overwintering period. Fecal microbiota composition and diversity analyses were performed using amplicons from the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Based on Picrust2 prediction software, potential function distribution information was evaluated by comparing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG). The results showed that the fecal microbiota of the wild deer (WF, n = 10; WM, n = 12) was significantly enriched in Firmicutes and decreased in Bacteroidetes, while the captive deer (CF, n = 8; CM, n = 3) had a significantly higher number of Bacteroidetes. The dominant species of fecal microbiota in the wild and captive red deer were similar at the genus level. The alpha diversity index shows significant difference in fecal microbiota diversity between the males and females in wild deer (p < 0.05). Beta diversity shows significant inter-group differences between wild and captive deer (p < 0.05) but no significant differences between female and male in wild or captive deer. The metabolism was the most important pathway at the first level of KEGG pathway analysis. In the secondary pathway of metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, energy metabolism, and the metabolism of other amino acids were significantly different. In summary, these compositional and functional variations in the fecal microbiota of red deer may be helpful for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, providing important information for future applications of population management and conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We studied Q fever in an area of Spain where a significant number of human cases are diagnosed every year. Although animals are the only source of infection for people, this is the first study carried out in the autonomous community of Asturias that addresses in an integrated way the infection in domestic animals, wildlife and the environment as well as people. Our results revealed that a remarkable percentage of domestic ruminants and wild ungulates from all geographic areas of the region had been in contact with the infection's causative agent (Coxiella burnetii). In addition, the bacteria could be detected in the air and/or the dust of livestock farms. Finally, a statistical analysis was carried out to investigate the risk factors (age, sex, geographical area, etc.) for the human population of the region. These findings will help local health authorities to focus on the origin of the problem and facilitate applying preventive measures in the affected livestock farms.
   This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of C. burnetii in domestic ruminants, wild ungulates, as well as the current situation of Q fever in humans in a small region in northwestern Spain where a close contact at the wildlife-livestock-human interface exists, and information on C. burnetii infection is scarce. Seroprevalence of C. burnetii was 8.4% in sheep, 18.4% in cattle, and 24.4% in goats. Real-time PCR analysis of environmental samples collected in 25 livestock farms detected Coxiella DNA in dust and/or aerosols collected in 20 of them. Analysis of sera from 327 wild ungulates revealed lower seroprevalence than that found in domestic ruminants, with 8.4% of Iberian red deer, 7.3% chamois, 6.9% fallow deer, 5.5% European wild boar and 3.5% of roe deer harboring antibodies to C. burnetii. Exposure to the pathogen in humans was determined by IFAT analysis of 1312 blood samples collected from patients admitted at healthcare centers with Q fever compatible symptoms, such as fever and/or pneumonia. Results showed that 15.9% of the patients had IFAT titers >= 1/128 suggestive of probable acute infection. This study is an example of a One Health approach with medical and veterinary institutions involved in investigating zoonotic diseases.

AB  - Parasites are integral parts of ecosystem function and important drivers of evolutionary processes. Characterizing ectoparasite diversity is fundamental to studies of host- parasite interactions, evolution, and conservation, and also for understanding emerging disease threats for some vector borne pathogens. With more than 1400 species, bats represent the second most speciose mammalian clade, but their ectoparasite fauna are poorly known for most species. We sequenced mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase C subunit I and nuclear 18S ribosomal gene fragments, and used Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to characterize ectoparasite taxon identity and diversity for 17 species of parasitized bats sampled along the Baja California peninsula and in Northwestern Mexico. The sequence data revealed multiple novel lineages of bat bugs (Cimicidae), flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae), and ticks (Argasidae). Within families, the new linages showed more than 10% sequence divergence, which is consistent with separation at least at the species level. Both families of bat flies showed host specificity, particularly on Myotis species. We also identified new records for the Baja peninsula of one tick (Carios kelleyi), and of five Streblid bat fly species. One Nycteribiid bat fly haplotype from Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) hosts was found throughout the peninsula, suggesting potential long distance co-dispersal with hosts. Different bat bug and tick communities were found in the north and south of the peninsula. This study is the first systematic survey of bat ectoparasites in the Baja California peninsula, revealing novel lineages that are highly genetically differentiated from other parts of North America. For some ectoparasite species, haplotype distributions may reflect patterns of bat migration. This work is a first step in characterizing ectoparasite diversity over the Baja California peninsula, and understanding how ecological and evolutionary interactions shape bat ectoparasite communities among host species in different parts of their ranges.

AB  - Symbiotic nitrogen fixation of Chinese milk vetch ( Astragalus sinicus L.) can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and serve as an organic nitrogen source in agricultural ecosystems. Exogenous organic material application is a common practice of affecting symbiotic nitrogen fixation; however, the results of the regulation activities remain under discussion. Studies on the impact of organic amendments on symbiotic nitrogen fixation have focused on dissolved organic carbon content changes, whereas the impact on dissolved organic carbon composition and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In situ pot experiments were carried out using soils from a 40 -year -old field experiment platform to investigate symbiotic nitrogen fixation rate trends, dissolved organic carbon concentration and component, and diazotroph community structure in roots and in rhizosphere soils following longterm application of different exogenous organic substrates, i.e., green manure, green manure and pig manure, and green manure and rice straw. Remarkable increases in rate were observed in and when compared with that in green manure treatment, with the greatest enhancement observed in the treatment. Moreover, organic amendments, particularly pig manure application, altered diazotroph community composition in rhizosphere soils, therefore increasing the abundance of the host -specific genus Mesorhizobium . Furthermore, organic amendments influence the diazotroph communities through two primary mechanisms. Firstly, the components of dissolved organic carbon promote an increase in available iron, facilitated by the presence of humus substrates. Secondly, the elevated content of dissolved organic carbon and available iron expands the niche breadth of Mesorhizobium within the rhizosphere. Consequently, these alterations result in a modified diazotroph community within the rhizosphere, which in turn influences Mesorhizobium nodulation in the root and symbiotic nitrogen fixation rate. The results of the present study enhance our understanding of the impact of organic amendments on symbiotic nitrogen fixation and the underlying mechanism, highlighting the key role of dissolved organic carbon composition on diazotroph community composition in the rhizosphere.

AB  - Context To investigate the major impact of roads on wildlife, most studies focus on hot-spots of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) to identify areas in need of mitigation measures. However, on road stretches where the frequency of WVC is low, a question arises: is this because those locations are 'safe' places for wildlife to cross the road with little risk of collisions; or is it because individuals avoid approaching and crossing the road in these locations?Objectives In this study, we addressed this gap by evaluating how roe deer crossings are related to WVC risk across the road network.Methods We used 56 076 WVC locations between 2013 and 2017 to predict the spatiotemporal risk zones in response to environmental, road-related and seasonal predictors using Species-Distribution Modelling (SDM). We compared the predictive WVC risk to the location of 20 744 road crossing by 46 GPS-collared roe deer individuals.Results We found that the risk of WVC with roe deer tends to be higher on federal roads that are present in a density of approximate 2.2 km/km2 and surrounded by broad-leafed forests and demonstrate that SDMs can be a powerful tool to predict the risk of WVC across the road network. Roe deer crossed roads more frequently in high WVC risk areas. Temporally, the number of WVC changed throughout the year, which can be linked to roe deer movement patterns rather than landscape features. Within this study, we did not identify any road segments that were a complete barrier to roe deer movement.Conclusions The absence of complete barriers to roe deer movement detected in the present study, might be due to the low spatial variation of the landscape, coupled with the high individual variation in movement behaviour. By applying our approach at greater spatial scales and in other landscape contexts, future studies can continue to explore the potential barrier impacts of roads on landscape connectivity. Exploring the relationship between crossing activity and collision risk can improve one's ability to correctly identify road stretches that require mitigation measures to improve connectivity versus reduce collisions.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a prevalent environmental pollutant in agricultural ecosystems, particularly within paddy ecosystems, is readily absorbed by rice and enter herbivorous insects through the food chain, thereby influencing the implementation of integrated pest management strategies. However, the effect and mechanisms of Cd exposure on the sensitivity of pests in paddy to insecticides remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of Cd exposure on the fitness, insecticide sensitivity and symbiotic bacteria of Sogatella furcifera (Horva<acute accent>th) (white-backed planthopper, WBPH). Cd exposure did not affect the population growth of WBPH but significantly increased the sensitivity to three insecticides, nitenpyram, dinotefuran and etofenprox. Furthermore, Cd exposure reduced the diversity of symbiotic bacteria in WBPH, particularly decreasing the relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Chryseobacterium and Pantoea, which were positively correlated with the survival rate of WBPH after Cd exposure and pesticide treatment. This indicates that Cd exposure may enhance insecticide sensitivity by disrupting the symbiotic bacteria equilibrium within WBPH. This study provides new insights into the symbiotic bacteria mediated increase in insecticide sensitivity due to heavy metal exposure, providing a foundation for utilizing compounds that disturb symbiotic bacteria balance in pest for pest control.

AB  - Sponges are ecologically important benthic organisms with many important functional roles. However, despite increasing global interest in the functions that sponges perform, there has been limited focus on how such functions will be impacted by different anthropogenic stressors. In this review, we describe the progress that has been made in our understanding of the functional roles of sponges over the last 15 years and consider the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on these roles. We split sponge functional roles into interactions with the water column and associations with other organisms. We found evidence for an increasing focus on functional roles among sponge-focused research articles, with our understanding of sponge-mediated nutrient cycling increasing substantially in recent years. From the information available, many anthropogenic stressors have the potential to negatively impact sponge pumping, and therefore have the potential to cause ecosystem level impacts. While our understanding of the importance of sponges has increased in the last 15 years, much more experimental work is required to fully understand how sponges will contribute to reef ecosystem function in future changing oceans.

AB  - Simple Summary Microbial aerosols from pig houses can be released into the environment, posing a serious threat to biosafety and public health. At present, there are few studies on the structural characteristics of aerosol bacteria in piggeries at different growth stages. It is important to understand the characteristics of aerosol bacteria in pig houses to solve the problems of air pollution and disease control in pig houses at different growth stages. In this study, bacterial aerosol concentrations and bacterial communities were compared in pig houses at different growth stages in Hebei Province, China. It was found that bacterial concentrations, community richness, and diversity in the air increased with the age of pigs. There are many pathogenic bacteria in the microbial aerosols of piggery. Our study highlights the importance of more comprehensive research and analysis of microbial aerosols in pig houses. Precautions for air pollution should be instituted in pig houses, including wearing masks, rigorous disinfection, and hygiene procedures. With the development of modern pig raising technology, the increasing density of animals in pig houses leads to the accumulation of microbial aerosols in pig houses. It is an important prerequisite to grasp the characteristics of bacteria in aerosols in different pig houses to solve the problems of air pollution and disease prevention and control in different pig houses. This work investigated the effects of growth stages on bacterial aerosol concentrations and bacterial communities in pig houses. Three traditional types of closed pig houses were studied: farrowing (FAR) houses, weaning (WEA) houses, and fattening (FAT) houses. The Andersen six-stage sampler and high-volume air sampler were used to assess the concentrations and size distribution of airborne bacteria, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify the bacterial communities. We found that the airborne bacterial concentration, community richness, and diversity index increased with pig age. We found that Acinetobacter, Erysipelothrix, Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Aerococcus in the microbial aerosols of pig houses have the potential risk of causing disease. These differences lead us to believe that disinfection strategies for pig houses should involve a situational focus on environmental aerosol composition on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - This study investigated the expression patterns of certain ATP synthesis associated genes (GAPDHS, PGK2, ENO4 and MDH2) in fresh and frozen-thawed bubaline spermatozoa vis-`a-vis capacitation. Eight adult Murrah buffalo bulls, aged 5-7 years, were randomly selected from a bull farm and fresh semen was collected once a week for four weeks (n = 32) from the selected bulls. Simultaneously, frozen straws of the same bulls were collected (n = 32, four straws were pooled per sample). The samples were divided into four groups i.e., fresh non capacitated (control/group 1), fresh capacitated (group 2), frozen non capacitated (group 3) and frozen capacitated (group 4). In all groups mRNA extraction was done. The mRNA expression of GAPDHS was significantly higher in group 3 compared to the other groups, whereas the expression of ENO4 was significantly up-regulated in group 2 and 3 compared to the group 4. Similarly, the mRNA expression of PGK2 was significantly up-regulated in group 3 whereas in case of MDH2, it was significantly higher in group 2, 3 and 4 compared group 1. It can be concluded from our study that freezing and capacitation has a significant effect on the expression dynamics of the ATP synthesis-associated genes warranting necessary interventions in handling procedures to minimise the adverse effect of freezing on ATP synthesis process to ensure persistence of fertilizing ability of sperm.

AB  - The stable carbon-isotope composition of mammalian tooth enamel is a powerful tool for reconstructing paleodiet and paleoenvironment. Its application in the fossil record relies on a thorough understanding of the isotopic composition of mammalian diets in modern ecosystems. We compiled and evaluated a global dataset of the carbon-isotope values of artiodactyl tooth enamel, supplemented by new samples, for 79 extant species. After correcting for differences in atmospheric carbon-isotope composition, body mass, and digestive physiology, we compared the inferred carbon-isotope values of ingested forage (delta C-13(diet)) among seven feeding categories. The artiodactyl herbivore dietary spectrum is expressed through a wide range of delta C-13(diet) values, with the most depleted mean value in frugivores and the most enriched in obligate grazers. In general, grazing species have a broader range of isotope values than browsing species, suggesting a wider dietary niche breadth. Notably, variable grazers exhibit a bimodal distribution of delta C-13(diet) values, with North American and Asian taxa consuming C-3 diets and African taxa consuming C-4 diets, reflecting the amount of C-4 vegetation in the environment. Variation in delta C-13(diet) values also occurs among terrestrial ecoregions and artiodactyl clades. Grassland ecoregions differ significantly from forest ecoregions. We detected a low but significant phylogenetic signal in the mean delta C-13(diet) values of extant species, with some of the oldest ruminant lineages having maintained C-3 feeding and pure C-4 diets being restricted to two bovid clades. Determining variation in delta C-13(diet) values in different feeding categories and lineages will help refine paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the rich fossil record of artiodactyls.

AB  - There is limited data regarding the nesting ecology of boreal ducks and their response to industrial development, despite this region being an important North American breeding area. We investigated how landcover and oil and gas development affect third-order nest-site selection of boreal ducks. We located duck nests in Alberta's western boreal forest between 2016 and 2018. We used multiscale analysis to identify how scale affects the selection of a resource using generalized linear mixed-effects models and determined what scale-optimized combination of landscape features were most important in describing where ducks nest. We located 136 nests of six species of upland nesting ducks between 2016 and 2018. The magnitude, direction, and best spatial scale varied by resource. For landcover, ducks selected nest-sites associated with mineral wetlands (300 m) and open water (300 m). Ducks avoided greater densities of seismic lines (300 m) and pipelines (2500 m) but selected nest-sites associated with borrow pits (300 m) and roads (1000 m). We used our models to predict important duck nesting habitat in the boreal forest, which can support conservation and management decisions. We recommend conservation actions target the conservation of mineral wetlands and associated habitats within this working landscape. Further research is necessary to understand the adaptive consequences of nest-site selection and how industrial development influences important nest predators.

AB  - Herbivory is considered an important biotic interaction in mangroves. Nevertheless, detailed information on specific plant-herbivore interactions that might have considerable influence in ecological and evolutionary processes is still very poor and fragmented. Herbivory damage was quantified during December 2015 in seedlings and trees in monospecific stands of Avicennia germinans in Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas, Mexico. The use of this mangrove species as a larval host is well documented; however, this is the first report for Junonia litoralis. These lepidopteran larvae consumed, on average, 10.2% of the leaf area; but herbivory was higher on seedlings (mean 15%) than on trees (mean 2.3%). These values are comparable to estimations of 10% mean herbivory damage in other field studies. This indicates that herbivores cause greater damage in seedlings than in trees. Herbivore activity by J. litoralis only occurred in A. germinans and did not affect associated herbs or shrubs of other species. The close interaction between J. litoralis and A. germinans may have profound implications for ecological and evolutionary processes of mangroves and enables a better understanding of ecosystem function and its conservation. Further studies are needed to investigate such interactions and their implications including long-term monitoring of interstitial salinity and leaf chemistry at different stages of growth and maturity of the host species.

TI  - Habitat Mapping of Bos gaurus in Parsa National Park, Nepal: Ensemble Modeling Approach
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION

KW  - RESERVE
AB  - Bos gaurus, a globally vulnerable and protected priority species in Nepal, has experienced habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and diseases. Consequently, their population is isolated significantly in Parsa National Park and Chitwan National Park in Nepal. However, their distribution even in these protected areas is limited to topographical features. This study focuses on habitat suitability modeling of B. gaurus in Parsa National Park (PNP) utilizing the ensemble modeling approach to identify key ecogeographical and climatic variables influencing B. gaurus suitable habitat and to estimate suitability in and around Parsa National Park, Nepal. After the multicollinearity test, potential ecogeographical variables were integrated with ground presence points for ensemble modeling. The model revealed that distance from waterholes and settlements, slope, and bioclimatic variables highly influenced highly in B. gaurus's habitat suitability. The model found only 31.29% (285.55 km(2)) area as a suitable area for B. gaurus distribution in and around PNP. The eastern part of the park (newly extended area around Halkhoriya Lake) and the south-central section of park show the suitable habitat for B. gaurus. However, wildlife-friendly infrastructure in the East-West Highway (that fragments the park) within park can facilitate B. gaurus's movement among these crucial habitat patches. Future habitat projections under the SSP1-2.6 climate scenario indicate a gradual reduction in suitable habitat, indicating a marginal impact of the climate change scenario on gaur habitat in the area. These changes highlight the limited vulnerability of B. gaurus to climate change and the risk of habitat fragmentation, potentially leading to population declines. However, conservation strategies including maintaining water sources, restoring degraded habitats, particularly in the northern section of the park, and enhancing connectivity through wildlife corridors could ensure long-term survival.

AB  - Climate change is disrupting floral traits that mediate mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions. Plastic responses of these traits to multiple shifting conditions may be adaptive, depending on natural selection in new environments. We manipulated snowmelt date over three seasons (3-11 d earlier) in factorial combination with growing-season precipitation (normal, halved, or doubled) to measure plastic responses of volatile emissions and other floral traits in Ipomopsis aggregata. We quantified how precipitation and early snowmelt affected selection on traits by seed predators and pollinators. Within years, floral emissions did not respond to precipitation treatments but shifted with snowmelt treatment depending on the year. Across 3 yr, emissions correlated with both precipitation and snowmelt date. These effects were driven by changes in soil moisture. Selection on several traits changed with earlier snowmelt or reduced precipitation, in some cases driven by predispersal seed predation. Floral trait plasticity was not generally adaptive. Floral volatile emissions shifted in the face of two effects of climate change, and the new environments modulated selection imposed by interacting species. The complexity of the responses underscores the need for more studies of how climate change will affect floral volatiles and other floral traits.

AB  - The water buffalo faces challenges in optimizing nutrition due to varying local feed resources. In response to this challenge, the current study introduces originality by addressing the lack of region-specific feeding strategies for water buffaloes. This is achieved through the formulation of 30 different diets based on locally available resources, offering a tailored approach to enhance nutritional optimization in diverse agroecological contexts. These diets were segmented into three groups of ten, each catering to the maintenance (MD1 to MD10), growth (GD(1) to GD(10)), and lactation/production (PD1 to PD10) needs of buffaloes. Utilizing local feed ingredients, each diet was assessed for its chemical composition, in vitro gas and methane emissions, and dry matter (DM) disappearance using buffalo rumen liquor. The production diets (127 and 32.2 g/kg DM) had more protein and fats than the maintenance diets (82.0 and 21.0 g/kg DM). There was less (p < 0.05) fiber in the production diets compared to the maintenance ones. Different protein components (P-B1, P-B2) were lower (p < 0.05) in the maintenance diets compared to the growth and production ones, but other protein fractions (P-B3, P-c) were higher (p < 0.05) in the maintenance diet. Furthermore, the growth diets had the highest amount of other protein components (P-A), while the maintenance diets had the highest amount of soluble carbohydrates (586 g/kg DM), whereas the carbohydrate fraction (C-B1) was highest (p < 0.05) in the production diets (187 g/kg DM), followed by the growth (129 g/kg DM) and maintenance diets (96.1 g/kg DM). On the contrary, the carbohydrate C-A fraction was (p < 0.05) higher in the maintenance diets (107 g/kg DM) than in the growth (70.4 g/kg DM) and production diets (44.7 g/kg DM). The in vitro gas production over time (12, 24, and 48 h) was roughly the same for all the diets. Interestingly, certain components (ether extract, lignin, NDIN, ADIN, and P-B3 and C-C) of the diets seemed to reduce methane production, while others (OM, NPN, SP, P-A and P-B1,P- tCHO and C-B2) increased it. In simple words, this study reveals that different diets affect gas production during digestion, signifying a significant step towards a promising future for buffalo farming through tailored, region-specific formulations.

AB  - Instrumentation and sample collection for wildlife research and management may require chemical immobilisation of animals, which may entail physiological and behavioural effects on them. It is therefore important to evaluate the immobilisation protocols to reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity of the handled animals and their populations. Using a multi-sensor approach, we assessed the short-term (< 10 days) thermal and behavioural responses of 10 adult female moose (Alces alces) equipped with ruminal temperature loggers and GPS collars with accelerometers to helicopter-based chemical immobilisations. We investigated the body temperature (T-b), movement rates, and resting time before, during, and after recapture. Chemical immobilisations on average increased maximum T-b by 0.71 degrees C during the capture day, and imposed longer travel distances during the capture day and the two following days (3.8 and 1.8 km, respectively), compared to a 10-day reference period before the immobilisation. The probability of resting was 5-6% lower on the capture day and the two following days compared to the reference period, and females with offspring had a higher probability of resting than females without. Maximum T-b, movement rate, and resting time returned to pre-capture levels on an individual level 2 h, 3 days, and 3 days after the immobilisation, respectively. Chemical immobilisation of moose from a helicopter increases the energy expenditure deduced through movement and T-b rise lasting for hours to days. Ecological and physiological studies aimed at inferring general patterns may encounter bias if including sensor and tracking data from tagged animals without accounting for potential post-capture effects.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and competitive strength are major mechanisms determining the success of invasive species and are influenced by abiotic factors. A rise in the ratio of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) in soils is frequently associated with the invasion of bamboo into broad-leaved evergreen forests. However, the influence of soil nitrogen (N) chemistry on plant growth and interspecific competition in the context of invasion remains insufficiently studied. In the present work, differences in plasticity and interspecific competition between native tree species in broad-leaved evergreen forests and invasive bamboo in response to different N forms were investigated using seedlings grown in a controlled environment. We show that moso bamboo responded positively and strongly to increased soil NH4+/NO3- ratios, while the native tree species Sapium sebiferum, Camellia oleifera, and Machilus pauhoi responded negatively and exhibited limited plasticity. Native tree species growth was significantly inhibited in the presence of moso bamboo under high-NH4+ conditions, whereas native tree species were less affected by interspecific competition when NO3- was supplied as the sole N source. By contrast, moso bamboo growth was significantly inhibited, followed by seedling death, in both monoculture and in mixed culture with prolonged NO3- treatment. All species tested exhibited significantly higher rates of (NH4+)-N-15 than (NO3-)-N-15 uptake, but the Michaelis constant (K-m) for (NH4+)-N-15 uptake was lower in moso bamboo, indicating higher substrate affinity. Nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) activities showed no inducible effects in moso bamboo compared to the induction response seen in the native tree species in response to NO3-. Activities of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) significantly increased with NH4+ provision in roots of moso bamboo, contrasted by a less plastic response in the native tree species. Enhanced ammonification and reduced nitrification in soils is typically observed during bamboo invasion and appears to create a positive soil-plant feedback loop that, due to highly flexible and opportunistic NH4+-acquisition pathways, favours bamboo fitness and invasion into native forests when NH4+ is the dominant N form.

AB  - World-wide declines in arthropod abundance and diversity are a major concern, particularly given their importance in ecosystem functioning. Yet, data documenting long-term trends are rare from the tropics, particularly the Afrotropics. Here we evaluate changes in the arthropod communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda across almost four decades. Systematic sweep-net sampling was conducted in two forested sections of the park that had been logged and in one old-growth forest area over 12 consecutive months in 1983/1984 and 2020/2021. This data was augmented with intermittent samples taken in 1986 and 1995. Arthropod abundance declined in all areas, but only significantly so in the moderately logged forestry compartment (41%). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that community compositions of arthropods differed between the censuses. Understanding the drivers of changes in the arthropod communities is difficult as the system is complex and dynamic. We document an increase in temperature, but no change in rainfall, increases in 11 mammal species, including a marked increase in elephant numbers, and changes in forest structure. We also report on changes in the landscape outside of the park, which includes the human population increasing by a factor of four and agricultural intensification that now includes the use of pesticides. We document that many components of the ecosystem we studied changed simultaneously, which signals that for effective conservation planning, more long-term multi-disciplinary efforts are needed.

AB  - Temporal niche partitioning between ecologically similar species may decrease interspecific competition and facilitate their coexistence, but the temporal interactions between sympatric skunks are still poorly understood. Furthermore, different interacting factors to explain activity patterns and their role in species coexistence in the temporal niche have been overlooked. Using camera traps over 2 years, we evaluated the temporal segregation between Conepatus leuconotus and Spilogale pygmaea and the influence of biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic factors in shaping their daily and monthly activity patterns in a seasonal tropical forest at the Mexican Pacific slope. Both skunks selected the nocturnal and crepuscular periods, with strong avoidance of daylight hours. We observed partial temporal segregation between species without significant seasonal variation. Spilogale pygmaea was most active when the activity of C. leuconotus decreased, suggesting that S. pygmaea adopts a temporal avoidance strategy to decrease the potential for direct encounters with the dominant species. We found that skunk activity patterns are also determined by the activity of prey and native and exotic predators, as well as relative humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, and night length. Our results showed that these factors differently affect daily and monthly activity between seasons and their effect varies in each species. This study provides evidence that multiple extrinsic factors play an important role in shaping the daily and monthly activity patterns of both skunks and, of course, affect their temporal niche partitioning, possibly promoting coexistence in a seasonal tropical environment.

AB  - The widespread use of pesticides along with the simplification of the landscape has had undesirable effects on agroecosystems, such as the loss of biodiversity and the associated ecosystem service biological control. How current production systems can be remodelled to allow for a re-establishment of biological pest control, while preserving productivity, is a major challenge. Here, we tested whether a combination of tools could augment or synergize biological control of insect pests in apple (Malus domestica), comprised of a tortricid pest complex, a geometrid pest complex and the rosy apple aphid. The tools aimed at disrupting mating behaviour of multiple pest species (multispecies mating disruption, "Disrupt", MMD), attracting natural enemies (a blend of herbivory-induced volatiles, "Attract", A), or providing refuge and rewards for a diverse insect community (perennial flower strip, "Reward", R) over a 3-year period. Suction samples were consistently richer in generalist predators but not in parasitoids when multiple tools including MMD + A + R or MMD + A were employed. In addition, lepidopteran pest levels were significantly lower in these plots than in MMD or MMD + R at the end of the 3-year experiment. This was, however, not reflected in survival of artificially established aphid colonies. Our data indicates that multiple, complementary tools can greatly enhance natural enemy level, but also that long-term implementation is needed to fully realize the augmentatory or synergistic potential of complementary components and restore biological control as an ecosystem service of practical relevance.

AB  - The California Pipevine, Aristolochia californica Torr., is the only endemic California species within the cosmopolitan birthwort family Aristolochiaceae. It occurs as an understory vine in riparian and chaparral areas and in forest edges and windrows. The geographic range of this plant species almost entirely overlaps with that of its major specialized herbivore, the California Pipevine Swallowtail Butterfly Battus philenor hirsuta. While this species pair is a useful, ecologically well-understood system to study co-evolution, until recently, genomic resources for both have been lacking. Here, we report a new, chromosome-level assembly of A. californica as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Following the sequencing and assembly strategy of the CCGP, we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin proximity sequencing technology to produce a de novo assembled genome. Our genome assembly, the first for any species in the genus, contains 531 scaffolds spanning 661 megabase (Mb) pairs, with a contig N50 of 6.53 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 42.2 Mb, and BUSCO complete score of 98%. In combination with the recently published B. philenor hirsuta reference genome assembly, the A. californica reference genome assembly will be a powerful tool for studying co-evolution in a rapidly changing California landscape.

AB  - Forage fishes are key energy conduits that transfer primary and secondary productivity to higher trophic levels. As novel environmental conditions caused by climate change alter ecosystems and predator-prey dynamics, there is a critical need to understand how forage fish control bottom-up forcing of food web dynamics. In the northeast Pacific, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) is an important forage species with high interannual variability in population size that subsequently impacts the foraging and reproductive ecology of marine predators. Anchovy habitat suitability from a species distribution model (SDM) was assessed as an indicator of the diet, distribution and reproduction of four predator species. Across 22 years (1998-2019), this anchovy ecosystem indicator (AEI) was significantly positively correlated with diet composition of all species and the distribution of common murres (Uria aalge), Brandt's cormorants (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), but not rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata). The capacity for the AEI to explain variability in predator reproduction varied by species but was strongest with cormorants and sea lions. The AEI demonstrates the utility of forage SDMs in creating ecosystem indicators to guide ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The production of complex mixtures of secondary metabolites is a ubiquitous feature of plants. Several evolutionary hypotheses seek to explain how phytochemical diversity is maintained, including the synergy hypothesis, the interaction diversity hypothesis, and the screening hypothesis. We experimentally tested a set of predictions derived from these hypotheses by manipulating the richness and structural diversity of phenolic metabolites in the diets of eight plant consumers. Across 3940 total bioassays, there was clear support for the interaction diversity hypothesis over the synergy or screening hypotheses. The number of consumers affected by a particular phenolic composition increased with increasing richness and structural diversity of compounds. Furthermore, the bioactivity of phenolics was consumer-specific. All compounds tested reduced the performance of at least one consumer, but no compounds affected all consumers. These results show how phytochemical diversity may be maintained in nature by a complex selective landscape exerted by diverse communities of plant consumers.

AB  - Herbicides are the most applied pesticides in the world. Despite numerous laboratory studies demonstrating the toxic effect of herbicides on non-target organisms, the effect of herbicides on soil organisms in the field remains complex to understand and is still controversial. In order to understand how changes in agricultural practices aiming to reduce herbicide use could impact soil biodiversity, we studied the effect of the frequency of herbicide application on soil biodiversity in a tropical agroecosystem.Our study was conducted on banana farms in Martinique, an island with a humid tropical climate belonging to the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. Thirteen banana plots from five different farms were selected, ranging from plots receiving no herbicides to plots receiving 4-5 applications per year. Soil macro-arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps resulting in the collection of over 6,200 individuals. Of the 100 taxa that were differentiated, 75 could be identified to species level which allowed to assign each taxon to a trophic group and when possible to classify them according to whether they were introduced or native.Macro-arthropod mean species richness was 21% lower in plots with the highest frequency of herbicide application. However, no conclusive effect of herbicides on macro-arthropod abundance was demonstrated. Mean species richness for different trophic groups also decreased with herbicide applications with decreases of 22% for predators, 17% for omnivores, 55% for herbivores, and 55% for decomposers in plots with 4-5 herbicide applications per year compared to plots with no herbicide use. Species composition of macro-arthropod com-munities varied significantly with herbicide applications. More specifically, we found that native species rep-resented a higher proportion of individuals captured in plots where no herbicides were used; suggesting that agroecological practices implemented at the field level to reduce the frequency of herbicide use potentially play a relevant role in soil biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Ecological niche models are useful tools for predicting and managing biological invasions. However, their reliable implementation and derived applications could be biased by niche shifts among native and invaded areas and by non-equilibrium dynamics. We calculated bioclimatic niche overlap between native and invaded ranges, and tuned species distribution models trained on both the native range (native model), and the native and invasive ranges (complete model) for the axis deer (Axis axis) to assess its invasion risk potential worldwide. Our results suggest that the axis deer shifted its realized niche in some invaded areas where most of the climatic niche available was contained within the environmental conditions from the native range. We found signals of non-equilibrium dynamics between native and invaded niches due to several unfilled areas in invaded regions. The native and complete models are similar in their projection for the equatorial region but differ significantly in the tropical regions. The first fails to predict areas where the species was successfully established. This difference reinforces the idea of using all the occurrences for predicting possible invaded areas, and that invasive species can somehow shift their niche. The complete model predicted that the most climatically suitable regions for the species worldwide were in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly the Neotropics and Afrotropics. While the species has been already established in the Neotropics, it hasn't in the latter. Therefore, our work emphasized the importance of a nuanced understanding of the potential distribution of invasive species to inform more effective management measures.

AB  - Background Understory flammability is affected by abscised plant tissue. Extensive research has shown how interspecific differences in leaf litter traits affect flammability; however, leaves represent only one component of the litter layer. Cones and fruit are also common constituents of the forest floor, yet surprisingly little is known about how flammability is affected by their presence. In this study, we ask how flammability is affected by cones and fruit trait differences, coverage differences, and varying species and coverage combinations. To address these questions, we compared cone and fruit morphological and chemical traits among longleaf pine, loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, post oak, and water oak. We also used burn trials to compare fire behavior of single and mixed-species treatments at three coverage levels (10% of plot area (low), 30% (medium), and 50% (high)) integrated within a common mixed-litter layer under field conditions in central Alabama, USA.Results Like other plant tissues, cone/fruit dry matter, carbon, and lignin content promote fuel consumption and flame height, while nitrogen suppresses flammability. Single-species treatments produced distinct patterns in fire behavior, with longleaf pine cones consistently showing higher percent fuel consumption, flame height, and maximum smoldering temperature than sweetgum capsular heads. Mixed-species treatment results were less consistent; however, at high coverage, a representative upland three-way mixture (longleaf pine + sweetgum + post oak) showed significantly greater fuel consumption and flame height relative to a bottomland three-way mixture (loblolly pine + sweetgum + water oak) at high coverage. Medium cone/fruit coverage maximized flammability in most single and multi-species treatments and produced non-additive fuel consumption in mixtures containing longleaf pine and sweetgum.Conclusion Our results confirm that individual species' cone and fruit flammability often parallels that of litter. Fire behavior in mixture is generally driven by the most flammable constituent species, but this result changes with cone and fruit coverage. Collectively, these results indicate that cones/fruit identity and coverage play an important role in understory flammability and should be integrated into fire behavior modeling efforts in monocultures and mixtures.
   Antecedentes La inflamabilidad del sotobosque est & aacute; afectada por los tejidos vegetales muertos que se desprenden de las plantas. Extensas Investigaciones mostraron cu & aacute;nto las diferencias interespec & iacute;ficas en las caracter & iacute;sticas de la broza de las hojas afectan la inflamabilidad; desde luego, las hojas solo representan un componente del mantillo o broza superficial. Los conos y frutos son tambi & eacute;n constituyentes del piso forestal, y aun as & iacute; es sorprendentemente poco lo que se conoce sobre c & oacute;mo la inflamabilidad es afectada por su presencia. En este estudio, nos preguntamos c & oacute;mo la inflamabilidad es afectada por las diferentes caracter & iacute;sticas de conos y frutos, su cobertura, la variaci & oacute;n entre especies y las combinaciones entre coberturas. Para responder a esas preguntas, comparamos las caracter & iacute;sticas qu & iacute;micas y morfol & oacute;gicas de conos y frutos entre pino de hoja larga, pino taeda, liquid & aacute;mbar, roble encino, y roble de agua. Usamos tambi & eacute;n tratamientos de quema para comparar el comportamiento del fuego en tratamientos simples o mixtos en tres niveles de cobertura (10% del & aacute;rea de la parcela, bajo), 30%, (medio), y 50% (alto), integrados dentro de un estrato mixto de broza bajo condiciones de campo en el centro de Alabama, EEUU.Resultados Como cualquier otro tejido vegetal, los conos/frutos, materia org & aacute;nica, carbono y contenido de lignina promueven el consumo de combustible y la longitud de llama, mientras que el nitr & oacute;geno suprime la inflamabilidad. Los tratamientos con una sola especie producen distintos patrones de comportamiento del fuego, con los conos del pino de hoja larga mostrando consistentemente un porcentaje m & aacute;s alto de consumo de combustible, de longitud de llama, y m & aacute;ximo calor latente que las cabezas de las c & aacute;psulas del liquid & aacute;mbar. Los resultados de los tratamientos con especies mixtas fueron menos consistentes; desde luego, a coberturas altas, una mezcla representativa de las tres especies de altura (pino de hoja larga + liquid & aacute;mbar + roble encino), mostr & oacute; un consumo m & aacute;s significativo y longitud de llama m & aacute;s alto que las especies que crecen en tierras m & aacute;s bajas (pino taeda + liquid & aacute;mbar + roble de agua) a altas coberturas. La cobertura media de conos y frutos maximizaron la inflamabilidad en la mayor & iacute;a de los tratamientos de especies individuales y multi-especies, y produjeron el consumo de combustibles de manera no aditiva en mezclas que conten & iacute;an pino de hoja larga y liquid & aacute;mbar.Conclusiones Nuestros resultados confirman que la inflamabilidad individual de conos y frutos de cada especie es frecuentemente similar a aquella de la broza. El comportamiento del fuego en mezclas es conducido generalmente por la especie constitutiva m & aacute;s inflamable, aunque estos resultados cambian con la cobertura de conos y frutos. Colectivamente, estos resultados indican que la identidad de conos/frutos y su cobertura juega un rol importante en la inflamabilidad del sotobosque y debe ser integrada en los esfuerzos del modelado del comportamiento del fuego en monoculturas y tambi & eacute;n en mezclas de especies.

AB  - The driving factors affecting soil quality were identified to evaluate the effect of vegetation on soil quality in coal mine reclamation areas with various restoration durations. This study used Hippophae rhamnoides subsp.sinensis Rousi with different reclamation durations (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years) in the abandoned land area of the Juxinlong coal mine in Ordos as the research subject. Artificial and abandoned grasslands were selected as the study's controls. A soil quality evaluation model was constructed to assess the soil quality in the reclamation area. A structural equation model was used to thoroughly analyze the driving factors affecting soil quality in the study area. The findings show that: (1) Reclamation duration significantly affected the physicochemical characteristics of the soil. As the reclamation duration increased, soil nutrients such as organic carbon accumulated while the bulk density index (BD) decreased. (2) The soil quality index of Hippophae rhamnoides forest land in China was the highest after 6 years of reclamation. The Hippophae rhamnoides forest land with the lowest soil quality index after 4 years of reclamation differed significantly from that after 6 years (p < 0.05). The soil quality index (SQI) of 6a (years) significantly increased by 67.44% compared to 4a. (3) By constructing a structural equation model, it was found that physical indicators (saturated water content and silt) and reclamation durations were the main drivers of soil quality. SQI had a strong interaction with organic matter (OM) and different restoration durations. The findings of this study will serve as important guidelines for future quantitative evaluation of soil quality following land reclamation and management during the ecological restoration process.

AB  - Wildlife conservationists and managers often need to estimate abundance and demographic parameters to monitor the status of populations, and to ensure that these populations are meeting management goals. DNA capture-recapture surveys have become increasingly common in situations where physical surveys are consistently difficult or counts are small or variable. Desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) inhabit rugged terrain, occur at low population densities, and demonstrate cryptic behaviors, making monitoring and assessing population status difficult. We assessed the effectiveness of a fecal DNA-based capture-recapture method for estimating abundance and survival of desert mule deer. We designed and implemented a fecal DNA sampling design focused at water sources during the dry season (June-July) of 2015-2017 in the Little Chuckwalla Mountains (study area similar to 968 km(2)) located in the Sonoran Desert of southeastern California. We conducted 6, 5, and 4 surveys in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. We used the capture-recapture data in the POPAN open-population model to estimate abundance and the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model to estimate annual survival. We detected 234, 193, and 211 unique individuals in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Over the 3-year study, population abundance estimates ranged from 386 in 2015 (95% CI, 264-509) to 301 in 2017 (95% CI, 260-342). Precision (i.e., coefficient of variation [CV]) of male and female abundance estimates ranged from 7% to 16%, and CV for males and females combined ranged from 5% to 15%. Annual apparent survival for females and males was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.59-0.98) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51-0.85), respectively. We concluded that fecal DNA-based capture-recapture is an effective method for estimating abundance and survival of desert mule deer. This approach could be expanded to encompass additional areas adjacent to our study site, with the potential to monitor the larger metapopulation of desert mule deer in the Sonoran Desert of California. More generally, DNA mark-recapture may be widely applicable to other species that congregate around water sources (or any required resource) during part of the year. Results from this study will be useful for developing population monitoring plans and for studies evaluating the effects of human development or environmental factors on desert mule deer and other desert ungulates.

AB  - Urban wildlife ecology is gaining relevance as metropolitan areas grow throughout the world, reducing natural habitats and creating new ecological niches. However, knowledge is still scarce about the colonisation processes of such urban niches, the establishment of new communities, populations and/or species, and the related changes in behaviour and life histories of urban wildlife. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) has successfully colonised urban niches throughout Europe. The aim of this study is to unveil the processes driving the establishment and maintenance of an urban wild boar population by analysing its genetic structure. A set of 19 microsatellite loci was used to test whether urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain, are an isolated population or if gene flow prevents genetic differentiation between rural and urban wild boars. This knowledge will contribute to the understanding of the effects of synurbisation and the associated management measures on the genetic change of large mammals in urban ecosystems. Despite the unidirectional gene flow from rural to urban areas, the urban wild boars in Barcelona form an island population genotypically differentiated from the surrounding rural ones. The comparison with previous genetic studies of urban wild boar populations suggests that forest patches act as suitable islands for wild boar genetic differentiation. Previous results and the genetic structure of the urban wild boar population in Barcelona classify wild boar as an urban exploiter species. These wild boar peri-urban island populations are responsible for conflict with humans and thus should be managed by reducing the attractiveness of urban areas. The management of peri-urban wild boar populations should aim at reducing migration into urban areas and preventing phenotypic changes (either genetic or plastic) causing habituation of wild boars to humans and urban environments.

AB  - Marine fish communities are highly diverse and contribute significantly to ecosystem processes. However, understanding their specific functional roles and the importance of different prey groups for sustaining fish communities has been limited by the historical classification of fishes into a few coarse trophic guilds. Using diet information to perform a high-resolution trophic classification of 298 temperate reef fish species distributed across south-western Australia, we built metacommunity and subregional trophic networks to evaluate the most important trophic relationships and energy pathways in temperate reefs. We identified 26 specialized trophic guilds within the groups of herbivores, zoobenthivores, zooplanktivores, piscivores, and cleaners. Zoobenthivorous fishes had the highest species richness and trophic diversity with 191 species in nine guilds. Consumers of crustaceans showed greater species redundancy at the metacommunity level. In contrast, a low redundancy of echinodermivores could represent a risk to local capacity for top-down control of sea urchins across the region. Finer scale analysis of prey at the family level showed that piscivorous guilds may influence different trophic pathways, with some guilds consuming other piscivorous fishes, while others consume lower trophic levels, particularly crustaceavores. Evidence of predation on herbivorous guilds was only found for turf grazers, suggesting that fish herbivory might not function as a major direct link between primary producers and higher trophic levels. Among the prey consumed by fishes, micro-crustaceans and decapods accounted for 33% of all diet proportions. The importance of macrophytes to the fish community likely resides indirectly through the trophic pathway of herbivorous and detritivorous invertebrates, particularly crustaceans, which are more consumed by fishes than macrophytes themselves. Comparison of trophic networks in the region showed that warmer locations had higher species redundancy per node and higher strength in trophic interactions. Yet, all networks had structural properties consistent with the meta-network regarding the importance of prey groups and modularity. Considering high-resolution predator-prey interactions enhances our understanding of the blue-print of ecosystem functions in shallow marine systems. Identifying the specific trophic significance of different consumers and prey groups is important for ecological forecasting and the prioritization of conservation and resource management regulations in our current fast-changing world.

AB  - We present a microhistological key for identification of plant fragments consumed and partially digested by free-roaming, forest cervids based on collection of 92 plant species representing forage availability of the Western Carpathian forests. The key represents a determination tool to facilitate microhistological analyses of faecal and ruminal material. We summarized, integrated, and developed current knowledge on microstructures of plants consumed by Cervidae using specific diagnostic features of plant fragments including type, shape, orientation, and arrangement of cells and stomata, type of venation, presence, and type of trichomes and crystalline inclusions. Since most plant species of the same taxa show common patterns in morphology of the different epidermal traits, we categorized collected material into seven functional botanical groups, i.e., grasses and sedges, herbs and leaves of broadleaved trees, needles, ferns and mosses, seeds and fruits, and genera Rubus, Rosa, Vaccinium. The key is consistent with classifications used in the majority of studies on diet of wild cervids and is supported with photographs of the main diagnostics features. The key has the potential to decrease amount of time needed for processing of the reference material, and to improve consistency between users studying feeding behaviour of forest cervids in central Europe.

AB  - Industrial forestry activities can increase landscape fragmentation, impacting wildlife populations, particularly Canada's woodland caribou, Rangifer tarandus caribou. To protect caribou in areas with forestry activities, the province of Ontario, Canada, implemented a Dynamic Caribou Harvest Schedule (DCHS). The DCHS spatially aggregates harvest disturbance into regions and distributes them across the landscape to maintain forest patch size-age distributions consistent with a natural variation range. However, the DCHS may negatively impact the cost of timber supply. We compared the DCHS with an alternative zoning approach that assigned the harvest deferral and operational management zones within a large forest area. We compared these approaches using an optimization model that combined harvest scheduling, access road construction, and caribou protection sub-problems. We formulated the protection of caribou habitat and road construction as network flow problems, while the harvesting problem incorporated the ecological constraints prescribed by the forest management plan. We compared the DCHS and zoning approaches in the Wabadowgang Noopming Forest of Ontario, a boreal area within the caribou distribution zone. For the same volume of sustainable harvest, the zoning approach protected less total area but more habitat and old-growth stands over the long term, and yielded lower timber costs by 1.2-2.2 $.m(-3) than the DCHS.

AB  - Biotic interactions are key processes that strongly affect the performance of seedlings in plant communities. In this work, we evaluated the effect of grazing and shrubs on the emergence and establishment of seedlings with different life-forms (dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous) in a sub-humid grassland community. We delimited five areas of 25 m2 in which we established four permanent plots of 1.0 m2. Two plots were centered at shrubs (beneath the canopy) and two in open spaces (without shrubs). Half of the shrubs and open plots were fenced to avoid grazing. During two consecutive years we marked all emerged seedlings and followed their fate. Grazing promoted dicotyledonous seedling emergence but reduced establishment. On the contrary, shrubs reduced dicotyledonous emergence but enhanced establishment. We did not detect any effect of shrubs or grazing on the emergence of monocotyledonous seedlings. Most seedlings emerged during fall and winter and died during spring and summer. Recruitment from seeds in this grassland is rare and complex, involving biotic and abiotic factors, with different responses to grazing and shrubs depending on seedling life-form and ontogeny.

AB  - Through comparing three survey reports of Caohai since 1986 once a decade in the past thirty years, we confirm that some physical and chemical factors directly (e.g. a decrease of water salinity, pH variability) have provided opportunities for the invasion of Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) in Caohai (a wetland situated in Guizhou, South-West China) in 2010. In addition, some physical and chemical factors (e.g. an increase of organic oxygen consumption and total nitrogen) reflect the richness of herbivorous food (vascular plants residues) for this exotic crayfish. Furthermore, we suggest that the successful invasion of exotic crayfish is related to human activity and the presence of Anatidae waterflows. Direct and indirect effects of crayfish invasion on Caohai have been evaluated by comparing data between before 2010 and after 2010. Although it is an omnivorous species, eating animal food is more conducive to its growth and reproduction. Invasion of red swamp crayfish had a negative effect on submerged plants, Annelida, aquatic insects and amphibians. By contrast, increases in this exotic crayfish provides a richer food source for Ciconiifornis birds. Further research is needed to solve crayfish invasion thoroughly.

AB  - The study of the pollen rain from modern vegetation has greatly improved the interpretation of pollen diagrams and our understanding of ancient plant communities. In this study, 76 pollen samples were studied from various vegetation types in Cantabria, northern Iberian Peninsula. The pollen signals of the main taxa were compared to their estimated spatial coverage at various scales (100 m, 1 km and 5 km from the sampling point) using vegetation maps. Additionally, we investigated whether there were similar modern vegetation types to past ones interpreted from the pollen record from La Molina peatland, Cantabria. Our results revealed that the pollen rain from the laurel-evergreen oak community (Lauro nobilis-Quercetum ilicis) was mainly evergreen Quercus pollen (59-77%), with Laurus nobilis being very under-represented. The representation of Fagus sylvatica pollen varied according to its local presence. In the modern vegetation, two sample sites with over 95% cover of Fagus within a 100 m radius had a pollen content below 3%. Pine demonstrated high dispersal capability, with pollen values exceeding 20% even in samples with little or no pine cover within 1 and 5 km. Poaceae had limited representation, with up to 60% even in samples lacking tree cover within a 5 km radius. Mixed deciduous woodlands were dominated by deciduous Quercus and Corylus, and their resemblance to woods in the northern Iberian Peninsula during the mid Holocene is discussed. While a principal component analysis linked modern vegetation to the most recent part of the pollen diagram from La Molina, no clear parallels emerged between present-day and ancient vegetation. Finally, it was found that there were no differences in pollen concentrations trapped by acrocarpous and pleurocarpous mosses.

AB  - We present a continuous-7000-year sedimentary record from Lashmars Lagoon, Kangaroo Island (Karti/Karta), southern Australia, a region heavily impacted by drought and bushfires in recent decades. Records such as this are vital to contextualise current climatic and environmental shifts, particularly regarding the interplay between hydroclimate and fire-related disturbances in this ecologically sensitive area. We use high-resolution mu X-ray fluorescence core scanning, complemented by bulk organic geochemistry and X-ray diffraction mineralogy of catchment soil and lake sediments to reconstruct past climate and catchment processes. Phases of elevated sediment organic matter content (inferred from high Br and total organic carbon) suggest increased lake freshening and productivity, and coincide with increased chemical weathering (inferred from high Al/K and kaolinite/illite and feldspars), likely reflecting the influence of wetter climates. Conversely, periods of high Ca correlate with biogenic carbonate inputs typical of brackish conditions, which we attribute to drier climates or a marine influence. From 7.0 ka, at the mid-Holocene sea level highstand, until 5.7 ka, we suspect Lashmars Lagoon was under virtually continuous influence from the sea. At 5.7 ka, we interpret the abrupt increase in sediment total organic carbon to reflect the severance of the connection to the sea, allowing organic material to accumulate. This, coupled with evidence of high inferred chemical weathering, suggests the climate was rela-tively wet at the time. After 5.4 ka, our data point to the establishment of drier conditions until the commencement of wetter climates again at 4.5 ka. From 2.5 ka, however, drier climates prevailed again until present. Notably, the climate changes recorded in the sedimentary sequence at Lashmars Lagoon seem to be linked to the strength of the Leeuwin Current, a current that brings warm tropical waters to southern Australia and demonstrates a teleconnection with the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation, and may well have been an important driver of rainfall on Kangaroo Island (Karti/Karta) over the past-7000 years.

AB  - On the one hand, oral processing - mastication - is considered a relatively inflexible component of mammalian feed acquisition that constrains instantaneous intake rates. On the other hand, experimental data shows that the level of feed intake affects faecal particle size and hence net chewing efficiency in ruminants, with larger particles occurring in the faeces at higher intakes. Here, we report the effect of an increased feed intake during maintenance (L1), late (200% of L1) and peak lactation (300% of L1) of a consistent diet (hay:concentrates 50:50) in eight domestic goats on various measures of digestive physiology including faecal mean particle size (MPS). Increasing intake led to an increased gut fill, a reduction in digesta retention times, and an increase in faecal MPS (from 0.57 to 0.72 mm). However, this was an effect of the large particle fraction (>2 mm) being disproportionately excreted at higher intakes; if MPS was assessed on the basis of particles below the typical escape threshold (<= 1 mm), there was no difference between intake levels. These findings suggest that the effect of intake on the calculated net chewing efficiency in ruminants may rather be an effect of increased large particle escape from the forestomach than a reduced chewing intensity per bolus during ingestion or rumination.

AB  - The media generates public consensus, acting as a driver of public policies. In the Anthropocene biodiversity crisis, the role of the media is critical in generating public engagement on conservation public policies. In this study, we aimed to compare the frequency of threats to deer species in media reports with the threats' relevance indicated by experts in the IUCN assessments. For this purpose, we created a ranking of threats importance based on IUCN assessments. In addition, we created a ranking of threats frequency on reports from media, obtained through the "news" tool from Google from 2011 to 2021. We compared both rankings with a kappa agreement test and found different levels of agreement from non-significant agreement to moderate to high agreement, according to the taxonomic group analyzed. With some exceptions, we were able to observe that the main threats described at IUCN assessments coincide with what is reported by the media. However, threats associated with diseases, low reproductive efficiency and population sustainability are underreported. As these threats are somehow invisible to the general public, it may lead to deficiencies in conservation actions that prevent or mitigate the impact of epidemics, inbreeding depression and genetic drift. These specific gaps between the rankings should be the focus of future conservation science popularization activities and cooperation between academics and journalists.

AB  - Context. Migratory populations of bogong moths in Australia are in decline. Numbers decreased after European settlement in the 1800s, and were stable before declining again from about 1980. Numerous hypothesised drivers for the decline have been postulated, and Caughley's declining population paradigm provides a systematic approach to diagnosing which of these are important, and hence the knowledge to guide recovery actions. Aims. This paper aims to assess which of the hypothesised drivers remain as candidate hypotheses for further investigation.Methods. Within the context of known bogong moth life history and the timing of observed declines, hypothesised drivers of the two decline phases were assessed with respect to their potential impact on larval recruitment and adult survival during migration and aestivation.Key results. Changes in vegetation composition and availability arising from the spread of pastoralism stand out as a likely driver of the early decline, with the herbivorous moth larva facing competition with introduced livestock, feral herbivores, and increased densities of native macropods. Many of the numerous postulated drivers of the most recent decline (e.g. changes in rainfall, rising temperatures in aestivation sites, increasing fire frequency) appear to have little support to be retained. Postulated drivers that remain as working hypotheses include increasing soil temperatures, increased cropping areas, and changed cropping practices and area. The effect of some drivers, such as artificial light pollution, is unclear and may warrant further investigation.Conclusions. Inference on the drivers of bogong moth population decline is wanting.Implications. Designed experiments are needed.

AB  - Background Isolated trees are often planted in agricultural landscapes around the world, but their planting background often remains unclear. In this study, we examined the history of demarcation trees in Ibaraki Prefecture in eastern Japan by using land dispute records mainly from the early modern period (from 1600 to 1868), the Rapid Survey Map (RSM) drawn in the late nineteenth century, demarcation tree records from 2011, and interviews of the local residents. Methods We reviewed 39 documents on land disputes to examine the temporal and spatial usage of demarcation tree species in the early modern period. The association between the present distribution of 1486 individuals of six demarcation tree species and past land use in the RSM were analyzed with Fisher's exact test and residual analysis. In addition, we conducted interviews with 48 farmers, most of whom were over 60 years old. Results The demarcation plants in vast communal lands and village boundaries in the early modern period were mostly visually prominent tall trees, usually pines. In contrast, smaller trees were planted for demarcation in small-scale areas of forests and farmlands. Although Pourthiaea villosa (Thunb.) DC. Has been planted since the mid-eighteenth century, its planting seems to have accelerated as communal forests were divided mainly in the Meiji period (from 1868 to 1912). The present dominant state of Deutzia crenata Siebold et Zucc. in older farmlands and its ritual use, history of upland field development in the Kanto region, and ancient demarcation use in central Japan indicate its original use may date back to the medieval (from 1185 to 1600) or ancient ritsuryo period (from the seventh century to 1185). Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) and mulberry (Morus spp.) individuals were considered as early modern or modern crop remnants. Results from the map-based analysis and interviews clarified the recent increase in the use of Euonymus japonicus Thunb. and Celtis sinensis Pers. for demarcation. Conclusions Chronologically dynamic anthropogenic legacies have shaped the present agricultural landscape with different demarcation tree species. A better understanding of the dynamic transformation of vegetation under human influence adds to the historical heritage value of the landscape and should motivate its conservation.

AB  - Soil eukaryotic microorganisms are important to biodiversity, and returning different kinds of organic materials to the field could improve the biodiversity of soil eukaryotic microorganisms. However, no detailed research has been conducted in the northern China semi-arid area in returning the different organic materials to the field and determining the status of eukaryotic microorganisms. Therefore, we explored the effects of various organic materials returning to the soil in combination with inorganic fertilizer on the diversity and community structure of eukaryotic microorganisms in Shanxi province, China. Soil samples were collected from five different fertilization treatments: chemical fertilizer (F), chemical fertilizer + cattle manure (FM), chemical fertilizer + straw (FS), chemical fertilizer + pig manure (FC) and control without fertilizers (CK). High-throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the eukaryotic diversity and community structure. Results showed that the dominant eukaryotic microorganisms among soil samples were Fungi, Viridiplantae, Metazoa and Protist. Although alpha-diversity was not significantly different among the five treatments, principal coordinate analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance illustrated significant differences (p < 0.001) in beta-diversity of eukaryotic microorganism under treatments with different organic materials. Redundancy analysis showed that the soil properties, including total potassium, available nitrogen, available potassium and organic matter were the main factors attributed to eukaryotic microorganisms' community structure in this region.

AB  - The toxic impact of relatively low ammonia exposure on animal lungs lacks attention. Therefore, we employed pigs as an animal model to explore the effects and potential mechanisms of low (LA) and medium (MA) levels of ammonia exposure on lungs. The results demonstrated that the alterations of Th17 and chemokine expression worked through the NF-kappa B and JAK-STAT pathway to accelerate the imbalance of Th1/Th2 and the process of antigen processing and presentation, resulting in lung injury, inflammation and apoptosis. The cell proliferation was stimulated by increasing the expression of key cell cycle-related genes and enhancing cell cycle processes. Accordingly, ammonia exposure affected the cytochromes P450 system and ammonia metabolism within the pulmonary system accompanied by oxidative stress activation to exacerbate the inflammatory response. Furthermore, ammonia exposure inhibited the expression of BMAL1 by activating PER1/CRY1 with increased NFIL expression in MA pigs and activating PER1/2 with increased Rev-Erb or DBP expression in LA pigs, ultimately disrupting the circadian rhythm in pig lungs. Overall, oxidative stress-mediated inflammation and cell apoptosis caused by ammonia exposure were identified as the primary factors contributing to lung injury, which were associated with circadian clock disturbance.

AB  - Management and policy decisions regarding biological invasions and other aspects of global change such as the changing climate have the potential to influence one another. Recently, interest in harvest as an invasive species management strategy has surged. Researchers have speculated about the potential positive (e.g. population and impact reduction, economic losses recouped through new profits) and negative (e.g. generation of economic incentives to encourage further introductions) consequences of such management strategies, but few experimental analyses exist despite the fact that real-world 'experiments' in harvesting invasive species continue to accrue. We provide the first comprehensive list of the many ways humankind has adapted to the presence of invasive species through harvest, and we consider trends that emerge from this list. The spectrum types range from collection of feral invasive populations to cultivation of potential invaders as crops, and harvested invasive species serve a variety of purposes ranging from biofuels to foods. We caution that the costs of invasion and benefit from harvest can be difficult to quantify, and this difficulty is compounded by the fact that costs and benefits are often incurred by different stakeholders. Climate and other aspects of global change accompanying invasive species harvest were rarely taken into account, and we recommend that climate effects of invasive species harvest become an explicit consideration of harvest strategies moving forward. Overall, we conclude that ecologists, economists, environmental managers and stakeholders must work together to ensure successful and responsible application of ongoing harvests and inform future efforts.

AB  - eSynurbic species adapt to global urbanization by increasingly inhabiting urban environments, where social and ecological factors, such as anthropogenic food resources and habitat alterations, promote close humanwildlife interactions. Ineffective management of these interactions can result in conflicts, altered animal population dynamics, and increased public and private expenditures. This study presents the Barcelona wild boar (BCNWB)-prototype model, a spatially explicit, incremental agent-based simulation that captures interactions between citizens and wild boar (Sus scrofa) agents in fine-scale GIS-based scenarios in Barcelona. Developed using GAMA software, the model's results were analyzed with QGIS and R software. The model aims to simulate the dynamics of the social-ecological system underlying the urban ecosystem use by synurbic wild boars and their interactions with humans in the (peri)urban area of Barcelona, Spain.The BCNWB-prototype model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the magnitude and location of wild boar movements (multiple-resolution-goodness-of-fit = 0.73) compared to reported wild boar presences in Barcelona. The model also forecasted 115 attack events and 1,442 direct feeding events during a one-year simulation period, as compared to the actual 150 attacks and 1,858 feeding events reported annually. The model's strong performance highlights its potential as a predictive tool for identifying priority areas for human wild boar interactions and conflicts. Additionally, the model could be employed to assess the cost-effectiveness of management strategies and evaluate the spread, transmission risks, and public health implications of pathogens carried by wild boars.

AB  - 1. Global environmental changes mediated by anthropogenic processes can affect the nutrient status of plants, with important consequences for the performance and dynamics of insect herbivores that feed on them.2. While it is well documented that insects from different feeding guilds (e.g., sap-feeders and leaf-chewers) can respond differently to altered food resources due to their distinct physiological and ecological characteristics, little is known about how ecologically similar insect species from the same feeding guild respond to changes in food nutrient status.3. Using nitrogen (N) fertiliser, the authors examined the effects of N inputs on two sympatric grasshopper species, Euchorthippus cheui and E. unicolor, that share the same host food plant, Leymus chinensis grass. The authors examined the effects of fertilisation on the individual feeding behaviour, performance and abundance of the two grasshopper species.4. The nutrient (protein) content of L. chinensis leaves was enhanced by fertilisation during the entire season. However, E. cheui and E. unicolor exhibited differing growth rates, development and body size responses to fertilisation.5. E. cheui preferred L. chinensis leaves from high-N fertilised treatments, while E. unicolor preferred leaves from low-N fertilised treatments. Moreover, fertilisation increased the abundance of E. cheui but had no significant effect on the abundance of E. unicolor in the field.6. The findings imply that effective management and conservation strategies for insects should target the needs of individual species rather than species groups or communities as a whole because nutritional and environmental requirements are often species-specific.

AB  - Context. Aerial surveys are widely used for estimating the abundance of wildlife over large areas. The failure to count all animals within survey transects is commonly acknowledged and there are many techniques to measure and correct for underestimation. However, the possibility of animals being counted more than once in intensive surveys, which leads to overestimation, is rarely examined. Animals can move in response to observers or vehicles, and bias can occur when animals move before or after detection. Movement of animals immediately prior to and associated with observation processes is methodologically accommodated in distance sampling but bias attributable to responsive movement after observation platforms have passed requires investigation. Aims. We sought to investigate potential biases caused by animal movement during intensive helicopter surveys of feral goats, and to quantify the probability that animals are available for recounting because of their responsive movements. Methods. Using ground-based behavioural studies simultaneous with intensive helicopter strip surveys of feral goats, we measured the extent of responsive movement, distances and directions moved, and sampling design parameters, and contrasted those with random movements. Key results. Feral goats did not move randomly in response to helicopters. Animals within the transect strips, and therefore potentially visible from the aircraft, were more likely to move than those outside the transect. Considerable responsive movement (flushing) occurred between transects and more animals (64%, n = 448) moved towards unsampled transects than towards transects already sampled. Because of the spatial separation of transects, 21% of goats were available for recounting in adjacent transects, leading to potential overestimation. Conclusions. Although most extensive surveys of macropods and other wildlife in Australia account for overestimation in their design, surveys that sample intensively and apply valid corrections for undercounting are likely to produce positively biased estimates of abundance where flushing occurs. Likewise, intensive thermal surveys could be subject to positive bias for animals prone to flushing. This is routinely ignored in wildlife management and research where close transects are used to estimate abundance. Implications. Responsive movement requires consideration when designing intensive aerial surveys of wildlife. Randomised transects without replacement or larger distances between transects will counteract recounting bias.

AB  - Winter mulching is widely used to raise soil temperature and promote earlier harvesting in agroforestry, but successive years of mulching can lead to soil degradation. The effect of winter mulch on soil bacterial community composition and co-occurrence patterns is not clear. The influence of different mulches (a defatted seed cake of Camellia oleifera, DS; a mixture of wheat straw and chicken manure, MWC; and wheat straw, WS) on soil bacterial communities and networks in lei bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) forests over a four-month mulching period was studied using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that mulching time and mulching material treatment significantly influenced bacterial community composition and diversity, mainly driven by nutrient availability. MWC and WS mulching treatments decreased alpha-diversity of the bacterial communities, whereas the DS treatment had no significant impact. The oligotrophs, Gryllotalpicola, Granulicella, and Verrucomicrobia, were enriched before and at the end of mulching, while the copiotrophs, Deltaproteobacteria, were enriched in the middle of the mulching period (Jan). Comparing the three mulching treatments, Proteobacteria were enriched in DS mulching soils in Jan. The complexity of the four networks decreased with pre-mulching, DS mulching, WS mulching, and MWC mulching networks, with a reduction in the number of edges and average degree observed. The results suggested that winter mulching practices adversely affected soil bacterial community diversity and interactions, which may be detrimental to the resistance of bacterial communities to environmental changes and soil sustainability. Mulching MWC and WS has a greater risk of loss of soil bacterial biodiversity than DS.

AB  - We described the overlap of arthropod communities between agricultural lands and adjacent wetlands using transect sampling, to determine if these juxtapositions might be influencing abundances of beneficial arthropods in agricultural lands. We further assessed experimentally whether these beneficial arthropods migrating from wetlands may potentially enhance crop productivity. Large numbers of predaceous carabid beetles and spiders moved from the wetlands into the agricultural lands; both of these groups can be important to biological control of crop pests. However, our exclusion experiments did not detect significant impacts of these predators on herbivorous insects or on crop productivity. Numerous studies have established that natural habitats adjacent to crop lands serve as refuge to beneficial arthropod communities and enhance overall biodiversity. Wetlands adjacent to agricultural lands appear to sense the same function. Our study suggests that wetlands may provide the ecosystem service of enhancing numbers of arthropods beneficial to agriculture, a service not established previously, and a factor that may motivate farmers to conserve wetlands that they own.

AB  - The study aimed to determine the effect of intra-vaginal bio-stimulation with a modified penis-like device (mPLD) or artificial penis and clitoral massage subsequent to artificial insemination (AI) to increase the pregnancy rate of water buffaloes. The AI was performed on 160 buffalo cows after observing their estrus sign. The buffalo cows were divided into four experimental groups (group A: only AI was conducted; group B: intra-vaginal bio-stimulation with a mPLD following AI; group C: massage of the clitoris after AI; group D: both the mPLD and the clitoral massage were used following AI). Each group consisted of 40 animals. Age, parity, body weight, reproductive health status, history of previous calving difficulties, and estrus detection method were recorded. The overall pregnancy rate was found to be 41.3%. The pregnancy rate in groups A, B, C, and D were 32.5, 42.2, 37.5 and 52.5%, respectively. It was determined that both the application of intra-vaginal bio-stimulation with a mPLD and massage of the clitoris following AI (group D) showed a significant effect on pregnancy rate than the control group (group A). It is concluded that the application of a mPLD in conjugation with massage of the clitoris enhances the pregnancy rate of buffalo cows in the coastal region of Bangladesh.

AB  - Large herbivores of grazing activities are the most important production factor to maintain the permanent settlement of human beings in the high-altitude area of the Tibetan Plateau, China, and their population changes are the products of the interaction between climate change and human activities since the Holocene. Using pollen and fungal spore fossil records from a profile since mid-Holocene in the Zoige Basin, the history and controlling factors of vegetation change and grazing activities were revealed. The results showed that the history of vegetation change and grazing activities in the Zoige Basin could be divided into three stages: (i) During the period of 8.5-5.8 ka, alpine meadow dominated by Cyperaceae developed in the Zoige Basin with the highest tree pollen content and the best hydrothermal conditions. The low concentration of coprophilous fungal spore at this stage was probably related to wild herbivores. (ii) During the period of 5.8-3.6 ka, the alpine meadow dominated by Cyperaceae developed further, the tree pollen content decreased slightly, and the climate began to change to drought, but the overall climate was still warm and humid. At this stage, coprophilous fungal spores occurred continuously and their concentration gradually increased, suggesting that there were human activities in the basin and grazing activities began at about 5.8ka. (iii) During about 3.6-0 ka, the vegetation type changed to the desert steppe dominated by Chenopodiaceae and Asteraceae, and after 0.5 ka, the alpine meadow redeveloped. The pollen content of trees decreased significantly, and the climate was mainly cool and dry. Grazing activities, as represented by the concentration of coprophilous fungi spores, began to increase gradually after about 3.6 ka. There was a reverse correlation between grazing activities and the dry and cool climate in this stage. The dry and cool climate was one of the key factors to promote the development of grazing in the Zoige Basin. The research results further complement the evolution of human activities and environmental background in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and have certain reference significance for understanding the impact of climate change on human survival strategies in the plateau environment.

AB  - With higher frequency and intensity of droughts predicted for many tropical forests, understanding the responses of plants and animals to changed climatic conditions will be increasingly important. Ants are considered ecosystem engineers in tropical rainforests due to their abundance and the diversity of functional roles they perform. Function in animals is often dictated by diet, with diets of rainforest ants ranging from purely carnivorous to mostly plant based. Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon have been utilised to infer information on diets, and more broadly on changes in ecosystem dynamics and water-use in plants. We used stable isotopes to investigate the potential effects of drought on the diets of two dominant ant species (Anonychomyrma gilberti and Oecophylla smaragdina) in an in-situ through-fall experiment in lowland rainforest. We observed a significant and sustained increase of delta 15N in both ant species in the drought experiment and during the dry season in the control treatment. We also detected elevated although much smaller levels of delta 15N values in leaves of some drought-stressed plant species. There was no detectable difference of the experiment for ant or plant delta 13C values. We conclude that the observed elevation in ants' delta 15N in response to drought may be partly caused by a drought-induced shift in delta 15N in plants. Although, with average nitrogen enrichment values of 2.7 parts per thousand and 3.2 parts per thousand, for A. gilberti and O. smaragdina, respectively, it is consistent with these ants deriving nitrogen largely from prey. Because ants are such dominant species in rainforests, even small trophic shifts in response to climate change if widespread could have broad implications for species interactions and food webs. Importantly, it is possible that such a change could potentially mediate the effects of drought on tropical forests if herbivory on drought-stressed plants is diminished by ant predation.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and host community composition are implicated as key drivers of changing tick populations and tick-borne pathogen dynamics, altering infection risk through coupled socioecological pathways that mediate interactions between tick vectors, vertebrate hosts, and humans. Patterns of host diversity may be particularly idiosyncratic across urbanized landscapes, due to trade-offs between extreme fragmentation that reduces habitat suitability and access, and human activities that artificially increase resource availability for wildlife. We used camera and hair trap surveys and tick sampling to identify links between landscape composition and configuration, the mammalian host community, and the presence of three tick vector species at a human-wildlife interface in New York City, an emerging area within an endemic region for several tick-borne diseases. We found that human infrastructures, such as the presence of fences in yards, could affect mammal host community composition by changing the "hardness" of edges between urban greenspaces and residential areas. We identified yard- and broader landscape-level features associated with the presence of urban mammal species, and identified cascading effects of host community composition on tick distribution in yards, suggesting management implications for the mitigation of human exposure to tick-borne pathogens. In particular, we identified a possible role of ubiquitous mesomammals, such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), in transporting Amblyomma americanum ticks between parks and neighboring residential yards, and confirmed the key role of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for introducing Ixodes scapularis ticks into yards. Our results challenge assumptions that biodiversity loss in human-modified areas always increases the risk for tick-borne diseases. Instead, we found many residential sites had higher mammal species richness and higher detection of low reservoir competent ("dilution") hosts for Borrelia burgdorferi, such as opossums (Didelphis virginiana), than paired forested greenspaces. Our study highlights the importance of disentangling the mechanisms mediating tick-borne disease hazard as a critical first step toward reducing urban tick-borne disease risk.

AB  - While wildlife management efforts have primarily focused on protected areas, unprotected areas - including community-owned lands - are becoming increasingly important as habitat linkages and dispersal areas between multiple protected areas for species and processes that sustain them. However, these unprotected areas and community lands often lack structured protection measures and face numerous threats to both species and habitats. Involvement of local communities in the management of these areas through community-led strategies can enhance safety for both people and wildlife, thereby promoting coexistence. To examine the effectiveness of community-led strategies for managing wildlife outside protected areas, we fit multi-season occupancy models on African elephant (Loxodonta africana) sightings data collected by volunteer Village Game Scouts (VGS) while on irregular and demand-driven patrols within Mwanga district in Northern Tanzania. Patrol data were processed using the Spatial Monitoring And Reporting Tool (SMART). We estimated elephant probability of occupancy, detection, colonization and extinction, identifying key elephant dispersal areas in the community-modified areas within the district. Our results indicate that proximity to Tsavo West National Park and the availability of seasonal water sources positively influenced the probability of elephant colonization. In contrast, the proportion of built-up and farmed areas, and distance to permanent water sources, negatively influenced the probability of colonization. The number of scout patrols did not significantly influence the probability of elephant colonization or extinction, and elephant occupancy remained relatively stable during the study period. Our study highlights the complementary role of non-protected areas in maintaining populations of endangered species such as elephants. We demonstrate that structured, volunteer community-led strategies coupled with effective communication with authorities, can be used to monitor wildlife spatial distribution and identify factors influencing their distribution in non-protected areas. We recommend community-led protection measures for corridors and dispersal areas, as well as transboundary collaboration to maintain landscape connectivity for endangered species such as elephants.
   Using occupancy models, we show that volunteer patrols can be used to detect species distribution in community-dominated landscapes. Additionally, we show how unprotected areas bordering protected areas play a complementary role in maintaining endangered species. Structured community involvement strategies are therefore critical in maintaining species distribution in unprotected areas. image

AB  - We examine among- and within-catchment variability in century-long patterns of phytoplankton abundance and sedimentary C and N isotopic content in two temperate oligotrophic estuaries of the Eastern Canadian Coast. Two upstream sites are compared with one downstream site within a large, relatively unimpacted catchment. The downstream site is compared to another site situated in an adjacent catchment that experienced more urban development. Variations in delta C-13, delta N-15, and organic content in downstream sites coincided with either water flow restriction events following bridge construction in the 1950s, or wastewater treatment plant startup in the 1960s. Furthermore, downstream sites showed algal abundance peaks between the 1920s and 1990s, in contrast to the upstream site where algal abundance increased throughout the twentieth century. We then quantified the relative importance of two sets of environmental factors as correlates of phytoplankton abundance and composition. We show that downstream algal communities (especially cryptophytes and cyanobacteria) were influenced by land-use factors. In contrast, upstream algal communities were more influenced by climatic variables, namely August air temperature rather than land-use change (e.g., pig farm, golf course). We propose that sand-bar built estuaries tend to be more sensitive to land transformation events at downstream reaches, where land-derived materials tend to accumulate. In contrast, upstream reaches of estuaries drain relatively smaller surface areas, making them potentially more sensitive to climatic signals.

AB  - Significant spatiotemporal variation in human livelihood patterns and its relationship to trans-Eurasian exchange and climate change in north China during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age, has been intensively studied in recent years, but the comprehensive influence of natural and social factors on this variation is not well understood. Therefore, we analyze archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological and carbon isotopic data from late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in agricultural, pastoral, and agro-pastoral regions of north China. Our results demonstrate human subsistence strategies transformed at different speeds in these three geographic areas after wheat, barley, and sheep, goats, and cattle were introduced into north China. Introduced crops and livestock dominated human livelihoods in pastoral regions and became important subsistence in areas above similar to 1500 m a.s.l. in agro-pastoral regions after similar to 3600 BP. In agricultural regions, indigenous millet crops were the most important subsistence throughout 6000-2200 BP, but wheat use increased significantly around 2700 BP. Our study suggests that the introduction of new crops and herbivorous livestock related to the prehistoric trans-Eurasian exchange, and their adaptive advantage in high-cold environments might have rapidly facilitated human adaptability and social development in pastoral regions and northwest margin of agro-pastoral regions during the Bronze Age.

AB  - Background Douyu Village, inhabited by the Lhoba people, is situated within the Eastern Himalayas, in southeastern Tibet, China. The village is located among high mountains and valleys, which feature complex terrain with cold and dry climates and distinctive vegetation types and species. The Lhoba people in this village are isolated from other groups in China. The Lhoba people have lived in this village since the 15th century and mainly depended on gathering, hunting, and swidden agriculture before the 1960s. Because they have a long history and live under extreme climatic, geographical, and ecological conditions, the Lhoba people in Douyu Village may have unique traditional knowledge about wild plants. Thus, this research aims to record the traditional botanical knowledge of the Lhoba people in Douyu. Methods An ethnobotanical study was conducted on the Lhoba people in Douyu Village in Longzi County, Tibet, China. Semi-structured interviews and group discussions with informed consent were used in the study. We interviewed 41 informants (14 key informants) between 18 and 75 years of age. All information was collected, organized, and compiled into "use reports" for quantitative analysis. The informant consensus factor (ICF) was used to determine the homogeneity of the informants' knowledge of medicinal plants, while the cultural importance index (CI) was used to estimate the cultural importance of shared species. Results A total of 91 wild species (90 vascular plants and 1 fungus) belonging to 71 genera and 39 families utilized by the Lhoba people in Douyu were documented. Of these species, Pimpinella xizangense and Wikstroemia lungtzeensis are endemic to Longzi County, while Sinopodophyllum hexandrum and Paeonia ludlowii are endangered species in China. All habitats, from the field vegetation at the valley bottoms to the alpine shrubland and meadows, were used for plant collection, and the numbers of species of plants collected from the various vegetation types (except for fields) decreased with increasing altitude. Our study found that 55 species are edible plants and fungi, 29 species are medicinal plants, and 38 species are used for other purposes. Medicinal plants are used for 11 categories of diseases, among which diseases of blood-forming organs (ICF = 0.96) and gastrointestinal diseases (ICF = 0.95) exhibited the highest ICF values. Based on the CI values, the most important plants in this study area are Berberis xanthophloea, B. kongboensis, Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, Vicatia thibetica, and Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. gyantsensis. Moreover, a comparison of the wild plants used by Lhoba ethnic groups in three counties in China showed significant differences among these regions. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the wild plants utilized by the Lhoba people in Douyu Village are highly diverse, at 90 plant and one fungal species, which reflects not only the number of species but also their diversified functions. The extreme climatic, geographical, and ecological conditions of Douyu within the high mountains and valleys of the Eastern Himalayas potentially affect the Lhoba people's culture, including plant utilization practices, and contribute to the rich diversity of the wild plants used by the local people.

AB  - The study tested an alternative method for the evaluation of habitat preferences of wisents (Bison bonasus) based upon possibly non-biased dataset - presence only data. Data on spatial distribution of free-ranging wisents (3055 individual presence records) were collected over a period of 10 years in the Bieszczady Mountains, south-eastern Poland. Using a nonparametric method of kernel estimators, the density of animal occurrence was calculated. The obtained dot map distribution allowed for spatial analyses of seasonal (winter and vegetative) presence that is related to environmental parameters such as the type of forest stand, dominating tree species, terrain and aspect. According to the final log-linear model, based upon presence-only data, significant differences exist in wisent seasonal preferences for habitat type. Wisents were more commonly found, in both winter and vegetative seasons, on sites with broken canopy closure (85.71% and 86.44%, respectively), as well as on slopes with steepness of 13-17o, with rate of presence of 89.83% and 91.84%, respectively. The most frequented tree association was alnus/pine irrespective of season. During both seasons, the percentage of records of wisent presence was the highest within sites of north aspect (93.22% in winter and 93.88% in vegetative), and on sloping terrain (94.92% and 93.88%, respectively), rather than within valleys or areas of relative flatness. The obtained results allow identification of conditions optimal for those animals unbiased by subjective evaluation of habitat conditions. This approach can be crucial in selecting sites potentially suitable for future reintroductions of wisents in the whole Carpathian range.

AB  - The global trophic structure and trophic level of estuarine-associated fishes was analysed in relation to biogeographic and selected environmental parameters. Meta-assemblages of estuary-associated fishes were collated at the marine ecoregional level and analysed at a broad biogeographical (bioregion) level. The fish assemblages were compared, based on feeding mode functional groups (guilds) and fish trophic levels. Relationships between these guilds and fish trophic levels and selected environmental characteristics and fish functional attributes were also examined. Significant differences were observed between bioregions in the relative species contribution of functional groups and their trophic levels. Sea surface temperature, which is often related to latitude, appeared to be a major factor associated with the relative contribution and trophic levels of estuary-associated fishes within each bioregion. Zoobenthivores dominated the species composition in all bioregions, highlighting the importance of the benthic food chain in estuarine fish communities. Differences in feeding guilds and trophic levels were also observed between bioregions and this was attributed to geographical differences in the relative contributions of the various feeding guilds, which occupy different trophic levels as well as bioregional differences in the trophic levels within the feeding guilds themselves. These variations were linked to the diversity and ability of fishes to process low quality (trophic level) food at low latitudes. The significance of these findings in relation to global climate change pressures are discussed. Generalised estuarine food webs that contrast tropical and cool-temperate bioregions are also presented, with the key role of detritus in conferring stability to estuarine food webs being emphasized.

AB  - High density of herbivore populations can lead to intense foraging competition and depletion of food consequently lowering diet quality and population performance. We tested for the effects of the density of eastern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis michaeli) in nine in situ populations of 0.01-0.7 individuals per km(2) density range on the quality of their diet while controlling for plant available moisture and plant available nutrients. We used faecal calcium, phosphorus, copper and zinc concentrations as proxy indices for dietary quality from 473 fresh faecal samples obtained from 77 adult animals in situ, after determining a positive faeces-diet mineral correlation in feeding trials with black rhinoceros in zoos. Some populations surpassed 70%-80% of their estimated maximum stocking densities expected to cause impact on forage. However, we did not find significant correlation between rhino population density and dietary quality, as measured via faecal mineral nutrient content. This suggests that black rhinoceros may have sufficient behavioural plasticity to adjust their diet to cover their nutritional requirements when density increases. Instead, 1-month lagged plant available moisture, reflecting precipitation over the 4 weeks preceding each sampling effort, significantly explained the mineral concentrations in the faeces. By contrast, plant available nutrients had no effect.

AB  - Protected areas largely now exist as coupled natural-human ecosystems where human activities are increasingly forcing wildlife to adjust behaviors. For many ungulate species that rely on protected areas for their persistence, they must balance these anthropogenic pressures amid natural regulators. Here, we investigated the pressures exerted from humans and livestock, apex predators, and within guild competitors on ungulate co-occurrence patterns in a fragile protected area complex in West Africa. Specifically, we used multi-species occupancy modeling to quantify co-occurrence among four ungulates (Tragelaphus scriptus, Redunca redunca, Kobus kob, Phacochoerus africanus) and applied structural equation models to discern the relative contributions of pressures on co-occurrence patterns. We observed a strong spatial gradient across with higher co-occurrence in the wetter western portion of our similar to 13,000 km(2) study area. Co-occurrence patterns among ungulate dyads ranged from 0.15 to 0.49 with the smallest body sized pair showing highest levels of sympatry, warthog and reedbuck. We found that anthropogenic pressures, namely cattle had the greatest effect in reducing sympatry among wild ungulates more strongly than the presence of African lions that also exhibited negative effects. Humans, hyenas, and competitors showed positive effects on ungulate co-occurrence. In a region of the world ongoing rapid socioecological change with increasing threats from climate and environmental instability, protected areas in West Africa represent a major safeguard for wildlife and human livelihoods alike. Our findings highlight the need for effective interventions that focus on large carnivore conservation, habitat restoration, and containment of livestock grazing to promote the coexistence of biodiversity and socio-economic goals within the region.

AB  - Background and aims: Long distance dispersal (LDD) contributes to the replenishment and recovery of tropical seagrass habitats exposed to disturbance, such as cyclones and infrastructure development. However, our current knowledge regarding the physical attributes of seagrass fragments that influence LDD predominantly stems from temperate species and regions. The goal of this paper is to measure seagrass fragment density and viability in two tropical species, assessing various factors influencing their distribution.
   Methods: We measured the density and viability of floating seagrass fragments for two tropical seagrass species (Zostera muelleri and Halodule uninervis) in two coastal seagrass meadows in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia. We assessed the effect of wind speed, wind direction, seagrass growing/senescent season, seagrass meadow density, meadow location and dugong foraging intensity on fragment density. We also measured seagrass fragment structure and fragment viability; i.e., potential to establish into a new plant.
   Key results: We found that seagrass meadow density, season, wind direction and wind speed influenced total fragment density, while season and wind speed influenced the density of viable fragments. Dugong foraging intensity did not influence fragment density. Our results indicate that wave action from winds combined with high seagrass meadow density increases seagrass fragment creation, and that more fragments are produced during the growing than the senescent season. Seagrass fragments classified as viable for Z. muelleri and H. uninervis had significantly more shoots and leaves than non-viable fragments. We collected 0.63 (+/- 0.08 SE) floating viable fragments 100 m 2 in the growing season, and 0.13 (+/- 0.03 SE) viable fragments 100 m 2 in the senescent season. Over a third (38%) of all fragments collected were viable.
   Conclusion: There is likely to be a large number of viable seagrass fragments available for long distance dispersal. This study's outputs can inform dispersal and connectivity models that are used to direct seagrass ecosystem management and conservation strategies.

AB  - Subsea infrastructure of the oil and gas industry attracts commercial fish species as well as megafauna including sea lions, turtles, sharks and whales. Potential impacts of this attraction, whether positive or negative, are unknown. As part of a pilot study, we deployed acoustic telemetry equipment around offshore infrastructure to assess its effectiveness in detecting tagged marine animals and to gain insights into patterns of megafauna occurrence around these structures. Acoustic receivers were placed around four oil and gas platforms and on two remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) on Australia's North West Shelf. Two whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) tagged in the World Heritage Ningaloo Reef Marine Park were detected at two platforms, North Rankin A and Pluto, located up to 340 km to the northeast. The shark at North Rankin A was detected infrequently and only 15 times over similar to 6 weeks. The shark at Pluto was detected each day of the 24-day deployment, in total 4,894 times. Detections at Pluto platform were highest during the day, with peaks at dusk and dawn. Our study indicates that acoustic telemetry around platforms may be an effective method for understanding how marine megafauna utilise these structures. We recommend collaborating with industry to undertake receiver detection range testing to understand the effectiveness of the method. Furthermore, future studies should co-occur with tagging programs at sites like Ningaloo Reef and around the structures themselves to maximise the probability of detecting animals at these sites, thereby improving our understanding of how marine megafauna interact with these structures.

AB  - There have been many studies on the effects of eutrophication on beta diversity (8-diversity) of species assemblages. However, few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on 8-diversity and community structure, and long-time series analyses are particularly scarce. We conducted a 19-year case study on the impacts of management intervention on the temporal 8-diversity of aquatic grazers in a lake at the Yangtze River Basin. In our study, we compared the changes in temporal 8-diversity as well as its two components, nestedness and turnover, and the synchrony of the rotifer community after management intervention. Our results showed that while the abundance of some sensitive species increased, there was no trend in species richness. Moreover, both the seasonality and interannual stabilities of rotifer assemblages increased. The species synchrony decreased in both spring and summer after management intervention. We also found that management intervention significantly reduced nutrient concentrations but not water clarity and phytoplankton abundance. The total nitrogen (TN): total phosphorous (TP) ratio was reduced after management intervention, causing an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria that may contribute to the increase of rotifer synchrony in autumn. Our results imply that stable environmental fluctuations after management intervention may increase temporal 8-diversity and stability of herbivorous assemblages. However, imbalanced changes in TN and TP after management intervention may weaken the top-down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton and slow down water clarity improvement.

AB  - Indigenous biocultural knowledge offers valuable insights for species conservation; however, like biological diversity, associated cultural knowledge is also often threatened. This paper demonstrates how Indigenous biocultural knowledge of species can contribute to addressing gaps in species occurrence data and conservation knowledge using a case study from the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area (SEAL IPA), northern Australia. Using a series of mapping workshops and interviews this collaborative project recorded Indigenous biocultural knowledge of the distribution, ecology, cultural significance and threats to freshwater turtles (freshwoda teduls in the local Indigenous language, Roper River Kriol). Based on past freshwoda tedul hunting experiences, 74 Indigenous knowledge holders identified 753 past freshwoda tedul occurrences, significantly adding to the 12 occurrences previously listed for the SEAL IPA in Australia's online species database, the Atlas of Living Australia. Importantly, these were the first 'memory' records of past species sightings by Indigenous people to be recognized and added to Australia's national species database. In addition, a blog summarizing this research was promoted through the Atlas of Living Australia, raising awareness of the Indigenous biocultural knowledge associated with these species. The Mepimbat tedul proujek revealed the cultural significance of freshwoda teduls and reported declines in abundance since the turn of the century, implicating invasive hard-hooved ungulates (buffalo, pig) and reduced rainfall. The addition of non-sacred Indigenous knowledge to free online species databases may offer innovative solutions for storage, interaction and sharing of indigenous knowledge, with opportunities for intergenerational and cross-cultural learning and broader application in conservation management and decision-making.

AB  - The genomic landscape of transposable elements (TEs) varies dramatically across species, with some TEs demonstrating greater success in colonizing particular lineages than others. In mammals, long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retrotransposons are typically more common than any other TE. Here, we report an unusual genomic landscape of TEs in the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus. In contrast to other previously examined mammals, long terminal repeat elements occupy more of the deer mouse genome than LINEs (11% and 10%, respectively). This pattern reflects a combination of relatively low LINE activity and a massive invasion of lineage-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Deer mouse ERVs exhibit diverse origins spanning the retroviral phylogeny suggesting they have been host to a wide range of exogenous retroviruses. Notably, we trace the origin of one ERV lineage, which arose similar to 5-18 million years ago, to a close relative of feline leukemia virus, revealing inter-ordinal horizontal transmission. Several lineage-specific ERV subfamilies have very high copy numbers, with the top five most abundant accounting for similar to 2% of the genome. We also observe a massive amplification of Kruppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes, which likely control ERV activity and whose expansion may have been facilitated by ectopic recombination between ERVs. Finally, we find evidence that ERVs directly impacted the evolutionary trajectory of LINEs by outcompeting them for genomic sites and frequently disrupting autonomous LINE copies. Together, our results illuminate the genomic ecology that shaped the unique deer mouse TE landscape, shedding light on the evolutionary processes that give rise to variation in mammalian genome structure.

AB  - Incidental mortality via entanglement in non-selective gillnets is a known conservation issue for marine birds globally, and specifically, in the productive marine waters of British Columbia, Canada. Three alcid species are particularly susceptible to gillnet bycatch (common murres Uria aalge, marbled murrelets Brachyramphus marmoratus (listed as "Threatened" under Canada's Species at Risk Act) and rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata), with estimates of mortality in commercial salmon net fisheries ranging from hundreds to thousands of individuals annually. Despite the risk posed by gillnets, the population-level impacts of mortality due to entanglement have not been estimated. Therefore, we wanted to (1) understand how varying levels of gillnet bycatch may impact population growth and persistence and (2) estimate the population size needed to withstand recent estimates of entanglement mortality. We used a simulation-based approach of matrix projection models to estimate the impact of gillnet bycatch on population growth and probability of extinction within 25 years. We found that the common murre population was the most vulnerable with current rates of gillnet bycatch producing a high probability of extinction. The population size needed to withstand current estimates of gillnet bycatch was estimated at over an order of magnitude higher than the current population size, indicating bycatch mortality in Canadian waters is taking common murres breeding in the USA. Extinction risk for marbled murrelets was estimated at similar to 1% in 25 years given current estimates of gillnet bycatch, contributing to other anthropogenic threats such as loss and fragmentation of nesting habitat. Rhinoceros auklets had very low extinction risk due to the large population size compared to estimates of bycatch. This study highlights the species-specific differences in the impact of bycatch on these alcid populations and the importance of moving away from gillnets toward more selective fishing methods to reduce mortality of vulnerable seabird populations.

AB  - Mesograzers often use macrophytes as both food and habitat and may have strong effects on primary producers. In this context, understanding the factors mediating their interaction with macrophytes, such as host food value, is an important step to predict the impacts of these herbivores on aquatic ecosystems. The amphipod Sunamphitoe pelagica is a mesograzer with distribution restricted to a few brown macroalgal hosts, however it is unclear if food value drives host use by this mesograzer. Herein, we investigated the distribution of S. pelagica and the food value of its hosts. For that, the abundance of S. pelagica on the macroalgae Sargassum filipendula, Padina gymnospora, and Dichotomaria marginata was evaluated seasonally in a subtidal rocky shore at Fortaleza Beach (23 degrees 32 ' S, 45 degrees 10 ' W), state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Furthermore, we conducted laboratory experiments to test feeding preference and rate, as well as the performance (e.g. survival, growth, and reproductive potential) of S. pelagica using the same macroalgal hosts used in the field abundance investigation. Overall, the mesograzer was more abundant on the brown macroalgae Sargassum and Padina than on the red macroalga Dichotomaria. In both feeding preference and rate experiments, S. pelagica consumed more Sargassum and Padina than Dichotomaria. Moreover, the consumption of Padina and Sargassum resulted in high performance of this mesograzer, while juveniles raised on Dichotomaria had a low survival, perishing within few days of experiment. These results suggest the host use by S. pelagica is strongly driven by the food value of macroalgal hosts and are in accordance with the narrow host breadth of this mesograzer. Therefore, considering the vulnerability of large macroalgae to climate change and habitat alterations, the restricted host use by S. pelagica to few brown macroalgae may increase its risk of local extinction.

AB  - Moonlight structures activity patterns of many nocturnal species. Bright moonlight often limits the activity of nocturnal prey, but dense vegetation weakens this effect. Using 8 years of live-trapping data, we asked whether reintroduced megaherbivores (Bison bison) indirectly altered moonlight avoidance by small mammals in tallgrass prairies. In plots with bison, plants intercepted 20% less light, allowing more moonlight to reach ground level. During nights with no moonlight, Peromyscus maniculatus activity was similar in plots with and without bison. During nights with peak moonlight, P. maniculatus activity was four times greater in plots without bison compared to plots with bison. Conversely, Microtus ochrogaster activity was twice as great during full moons compared to new moons, but only in plots with bison. We also equipped a subset of traps with temperature sensors to estimate trap-entry time. Although M. ochrogaster was more active on bright nights, most activity occurred before moonrise or after moonset, avoiding periods of bright moonlight. We conclude that megaherbivores play an unappreciated but important indirect role in tallgrass prairies by inducing behavioral shifts in other animal species. Because overlap in activity patterns can predict the likelihood of predator-prey encounters, such activity shifts have important implications for trophic interactions throughout restored prairie food webs. Additional work to understand interspecific and intraspecific variation in response to moonlight may improve efforts to forecast changes in community assembly due to restoration and land-use change.

AB  - Knowledge about parasitic diseases of wildlife will help us to understand the dynamics of parasites and their effects on host populations. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent in the world, and its distribution is associated with the presence of tropical and subtropical wetlands in South America. The Los Padres Lake Integral Reserve (LPLIR) is an important conservation zone in the pampean region of Argentina. One of the emblematic species found within the reserve is the capybara. The objective of this study was to determine the gastrointestinal parasites present in wild capybaras of the LPLIR and to compare different coprological methodologies. Free-ranging capybara fresh feces from 57 individuals were randomly collected from the area of LPLIR in the summer of 2022. Three different techniques were applied: spontaneous sedimentation technique (SS), INTA modified McMaster technique (MM), and Mini-FLOTAC (MF) technique. Fifty-six samples from all samples analysed (56/57, 98%) were found to be positive for gastrointestinal parasites. Two species of Strongylida, Protozoophaga obesa, Echinocoleus hydrochaeris, one unidentified nematode, one unidentified spirurid, and at least two morphotypes of Eimeria spp. oocysts were recorded. There were found significant differences in the proportion of positive samples and in richness by technique, but no significant differences were found in parasite counting. In conclusion, the choice of methodology depends on the specific objectives of the study. This is the first parasitological study of capybaras from the LPLIR and represents an exploration of parasite communities present in these wild rodents at their southernmost distribution.

AB  - Artificial Light at Night is recognized for its impact on various ecosystems, with coastal areas being particularly vulnerable. While a growing number of studies have identified Artificial Light at Night's impacts on species inhabiting these ecosystems, a critical gap is the limited attention that has been given to intraspecific variability in response to this stressor. This study focused on the sex-dependent influence of Artificial Light at Night on food consumption rates and absorption efficiency in males and females of the non-indigenous amphipod Ampithoe valida. Males and females were exposed to two light treatments: a natural light/dark cycle and Artificial Light at Night. Our hypothesis was that Artificial Light at Night alters the amphipod's food consumption rates and absorption efficiency, but the magnitude of these impacts is sex-dependent. Results showed that females had higher nocturnal food consumption rates under control conditions, while males showed no significant diel food consumption rates. Under Artificial Light at Night conditions, females experienced a substantial reduction in nighttime food consumption rates and absorption efficiency, suggesting stress or disrupted circadian rhythms. In contrast, males increased their nighttime food consumption rates under Artificial Light at Night, possibly exploiting a new light-induced niche. These findings highlight the need for further research on the ecological consequences of intraspecific variation in the responses to Artificial Light at Night, particularly regarding the management and conservation of ecosystems impacted by non-indigenous species.

AB  - Carnivorous mammals disperse seeds through endozoochory and diploendozoochory. The former consists of ingestion of the fruit, passage through the digestive tract, and expulsion of the seeds, a process that allows scarification and dispersal of the seeds over long or short distances. The latter is typical of predators that expel seeds that were contained in the prey and the effects of which may differ from those of endozoochory with respect to the retention time of the seeds in the tracts, as well as their scarification and viability. The objective of this study was to conduct an experimental evaluation comparing the capacity of each mammal species in terms of the dispersal of Juniperus deppeana seeds and, at the same time, to compare this capacity through the two dispersal systems: endozoochory and diploendozoochory. We measured dispersal capacity using indices of recovery, viability, changes in testas, and retention time of seeds in the digestive tract. Juniperus deppeana fruits were collected in the Sierra Fria Protected Natural Area in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and were administered in the diet of captive mammals: gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coati (Nasua narica) and domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). These three mammals represented the endozoochoric dispersers. For the diploendozoochoric treatment, seeds excreted by rabbits were incorporated into the diets of captive mammals: bobcat (Lynx rufus) and cougar (Puma concolor), in a local zoo. Seeds present in the scats were then collected, and recovery rates and retention times were estimated. Viability was estimated by X-ray optical densitometry and testa thicknesses were measured and surfaces checked using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed a recovery of seeds greater than 70% in all the animals. The retention time was <24 h in the endozoochory but longer at 24-96 h in the diploendozoochory (p < .05). Seed viability (x over bar $$ \overline{x} $$ & PLUSMN; SD) was decreased in rabbits (74.0 & PLUSMN; 11.5%), compared to fruits obtained directly from the canopy (89.7 & PLUSMN; 2.0%), while gray fox, coati, bobcat, and cougar did not affect seed viability (p < .05). An increase in the thickness of the testas was also observed in seeds excreted from all mammals (p < .05). Through evaluation, our results suggest that mammalian endozoochory and diploendozoochory contribute to the dispersal of J. deppeana by maintaining viable seeds with adaptive characteristics in the testa to promote forest regeneration and restoration. In particular, feline predators can provide an ecosystem service through scarification and seed dispersal.

AB  - Scavenging guilds often have several trophic levels with varying dominance and intra-guild predation, competition, and interaction. Apex predators can control subordinate predators by limiting their numbers and affecting behaviour but also supply a continuous food source by abandoning carcasses. Camera traps monitored the scavenger guild in Alpe di Catenaia, Tuscan Apennine, for three years to determine intraguild interactions and the behaviour response. Wild boar visited most feeding sites but only scavenged in 1.4% of their visits. Red fox was the most frequent scavenger, traded vigilance and feeding equally, and selected low vegetation density, while marten invested more in feeding than vigilance. Marten was the prime follower, appearing within the shortest time after another scavenger had left the site. Red fox occasionally looked upwards, possibly to detect birds of prey. Badger showed scarcely any vigilance, did not feed much on carcasses but scent-marked abundantly. Wolves showed the highest vigilance in proportion to feeding at carcasses among the scavengers. Sites with good visibility were selected by all scavengers except martens who selected poor visibility and new moon illumination. Scavengers were mostly nocturnal, showed weak responses to twilight hours or lunar illumination, and all but red fox avoided human disturbance areas.

AB  - The moose (Alces alces) is a charismatic species in decline across much of their southern distribution in North America. In the northeastern United States, much of the reduction has been attributed to winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) infestations. Winter ticks are fairly immobile throughout all life stages, and therefore their distribution patterns at any given time are shaped largely by the occurrence of moose across the landscape during the peak of two critical time periods: fall questing (when ticks latch onto moose) and spring drop-off (when engorged female ticks detach from moose). We used recent land cover and lidar data within a dynamic occupancy modeling framework to estimate first-order habitat selection (use vs. non-use) of female moose (n = 74) during the tick questing and drop-off periods. Patch extinction and colonization rates between the fall questing and spring drop-off periods were strongly influenced by habitat and elevation, but these effects were diminished during the fall questing period when moose were more active across the landscape. From the fall questing period to the spring drop-off period, patches where colonization was high and extinction was low had higher proportions of young (shrub/forage) mixed forest at higher elevations. Further, we evaluated the fitness consequences of habitat selection by adult females during the fall questing period, when females and their calves acquire ticks. We compared Resource Selection Functions (RSF) for five females that successfully reared a calf to age 1 with five females whose calves perished due to ticks. Adult female moose whose offspring perished selected habitats in the fall that spatially coincided with areas of high occupancy probability during the spring tick drop-off period. In contrast, adult female moose whose offspring survived selected areas where the probability of occupancy during the spring drop-off was low; at present, natural selection may favor female adults who do not select the same habitats in fall as in spring. Our model coefficients and mapped results define "hotspots" that are likely encouraging the deleterious effects of the tick-moose cycle. These findings fill knowledge gaps about moose habitat selection that may improve the effectiveness of management aimed at reversing declining population trends.

AB  - The current and projected climate change that is represented by increasing temperatures and humidity levels and irregular rainfall patterns promotes the occurrence of preharvest sprouting (PHS) in wheat. PHS results in significant economic losses, globally, which necessitates the need for high-yielding cultivars with increased PHS tolerance; hence, this study was conducted. The current study evaluated two doubled-haploid (DH) wheat populations of Tugela-Dn x Elands and Elands x Flamink across six environments in the Free State Province of South Africa to select genotypes with increased PHS tolerance and further map the underlying loci. Significant effects of DH lines (194) and environments (6) were observed for PHS tolerance. The results of this study validate previous findings that PHS is only expressed when environmental conditions are conducive. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and silicoDArT markers revealed three additive QTLs with major effects on chromosomes 5B and 7B, and these QTLs were detected more than once, when conditions were favourable. These QTLs explained a phenotypic variation (PVE) varying between 10.08% and 20.30% (LOD = 2.73-3.11). About 16.50% of DH lines performed to the level of Elands (the PHS-tolerant parent) and are recommended for further selection in a pre-breeding or breeding programme. The findings of this study are expected to expedite the on-going breeding efforts for PHS tolerance in winter wheat, which will facilitate the development of PHS-tolerant cultivars adapted to the South African environment.

AB  - Active management such as prescribed fire and thinning can restore savanna and prairie ecosystem to maintain a full suite of ecosystem services and create suitable habitat for wildlife species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Active management comes with the cost of management and acceptance of management tools. The south-central transitional ecoregion of the USA, which otherwise was a mixture of forest, savanna, and tallgrass prairie, is increasing in woody plant dominance due to the exclusion of fire and other anthropogenic factors. Deer hunting is a vital source of revenue generation to offset the landowner's management cost in the region. We studied Oklahoma landowners' perceptions regarding active and sustainable management of forest and rangeland for deer habitat using two established theories of reasoned action and planned behavior as well as expanded theories adding moral norms. We analyzed mailed survey data using structural equation modeling. We found that subjective norms and perceived behavior control significantly affected deer hunting intention when moral norms were introduced into the model. Attitudes independently significantly affected intentions of deer hunting but have negative relations with the intentions. The study suggested that landowners have positive social pressure and were interested in active management but associated financial burden and risk could be shaping negative attitudes.

AB  - As biodiversity has decreased dramatically in recent decades, the importance of conservation efforts and, specifically, ecological restoration, in preserving natural ecosystems has grown in importance. To achieve necessary biodiversity outcomes, it is crucial that the public support policies and engage in behaviors that contribute to restoration. Individuals also play a crucial role in the actual process of restoration. This research tests the impact of messaging that emphasizes the effect of human intervention in ecological restoration relative to nature-centric messaging. We conducted a survey with a sample of students, staff, and faculty at a Midwestern university. Respondents were randomly assigned to read a narrative accompanied by a detailed scientific illustration that emphasized responsibility for successful restoration to human volunteers or bison as the primary agents of ecosystem repair. Our results show that centering people in restoration messaging led to respondents being more likely to engage in pro-restoration behaviors than centering nature in messaging. People-centric messaging resulted in similar pro-restoration attitudes and policy preferences when compared to nature-centric messaging. These findings have implications for how restoration managers, science communicators, and others can most effectively message in promoting restoration to the public.

AB  - This study conducted composting experiments using cow manure and wheat straw, employing five different treatment methods (CK, magnetized water treatment-M, magnetized water combined with biochar treatment-SM, magnetized water combined with ferrous sulfate treatment-FM, magnetized water combined with Bacillus megaterium treatment-GM), aiming to accelerate the composting maturation process and reduce carbon loss. The results of the experiments showed that the SM treatment entered the thermophilic phase on the second day and lasted for 9 days, resulting in the best maturation effect. The FM treatment increased the carbon content in the compost, effectively preserving carbon sources. principal component analysis analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community structures due to different treatments. Additionally, structural equation modeling observations indicated that different treatments affected the compost environment, thereby influencing microbial activity and carbon content. Overall, the SM treatment positively affected the compost maturation process, while the FM treatment effectively preserved carbon sources in the compost.

AB  - In July 2020, Japan undertook the first deep-sea mining test of cobalt-rich crusts on the summit of Takuyo-Daigo Seamount within their exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Seabed mining regulations are currently being developed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA)1; however, a lack of experimental data has so far con-strained our understanding of the associated impacts, particularly from the release of sediment plumes.2 The area of sediment re-deposition from the crust mining test was determined using modeled data and in situ observations. To investigate biological impacts, variations in seabed megafauna (animals > 1 cm) were quan-tified from seabed imagery collected around the excavation site before, 1 month, and 13 months after the test in areas both inside and outside (adjacent) expected deposition. Observable responses varied across com-munity components: densities of sessile animals were similar between deposition and adjacent areas throughout the study; mobile epifauna were less abundant only in the deposition area following disturbance; and highly mobile swimmers showed reduced densities after the test in both deposition and adjacent areas following disturbance. These results stress that monitoring of highly mobile taxa may be essential to fully assess disturbance extent and magnitude. Fish may avoid areas even outside plume deposition, possibly owing to the creation of suboptimal feeding patches resulting from deposition. Our findings suggest suffi-ciently large (>300 3 300 m), distant, and representative control areas are essential to optimally map deep-sea mining impacts in ferromanganese crust habitats to ensure impact assessments encompass the full range of functional components in the megabenthic community (including mobile fishes) that typically inhabit seamounts.

AB  - Infectious diseases affecting habitat-forming species can have significant impacts on population dynamics and alter the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. Recently, a fungal infection was described as the causative agent of necrotic lesions on the stipe of the forest-forming macroalga Phyllospora comosa, a disease named "stipe rot" (SR). Here, we developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for rapid detection and quantification of this pathogen, which was applied to evaluate the level of SR infection in eight P. comosa populations spanning the entire latitudinal distribution of this species along southeastern Australia. We also investigated the relationship between the abundance and prevalence of Stipe Rot Fungus (SRF) and potential host chemical defenses as well as its relationship with morphological and ecophysiological traits of P. comosa. qPCR estimates of SRF abundance reflected the levels of infection estimated by visual assessment, with higher numbers of SRF copies being observed in individuals showing high or intermediate levels of visual symptoms of SR. Concordance of conventional PCR and visual assessments was 92 and 94%, respectively, compared to qPCR detection. SRF prevalence was positively related to fucoxanthin content and herbivory, but not significant related to other traits measured (phlorotannin content, total length, thallus diameter, stipe width, number of branches, frond width, fouling, bleaching, gender, and photosynthetic efficiency). These results provide confidence for previous reports of this disease based upon visual assessments only, contribute to the development of monitoring and conservation strategies for safeguarding P. comosa forests, and generate insights into potential factors influencing host-pathogen interactions in this system.

AB  - Human activities are increasing wildfires and livestock activity in arid ecosystems with potential implications for the spread of invasive grasses. The objective of this study was to test whether fire history and cattle activity alter soil resource gradients, thereby affecting patterns of Bromus rubens L. (red brome) invasion. Six paired burned and unburned transect lines (1-km long) were established in the northeast Mojave Desert along the boundaries of four independent wildfire scars. At 100-m transect increment points, we measured the distance to the two nearest cowpats, and two random points and measured the density, height, biomass, and seed production of red brome, soil moisture and inorganic nitrogen (N). Cattle activity was 29% greater along burned transects compared to unburned transects (P < 0.05). Red brome height, density, and seed production were 11-34% greater along burned transects than unburned transects (P < 0.05). Red brome height, biomass, density, and seed production were twofold to tenfold greater next to cowpats compared to random points (P < 0.05). Soils along burned transects and beneath cowpats had greater soil inorganic N (P < 0.05), which was positively correlated with red brome density, height, biomass, and seed production (R-2 = 0.60-0.85, P < 0.0001). Transgenerational effects were evident as seeds from red brome next to cowpats had 27% higher germination than seeds collected from random points. Positive responses of red brome to increased inorganic N related to fire and cattle activity may contribute fine fuel infill that drives invasive grass-fire cycles in deserts.

AB  - Background Defining the spatial distribution, home range, and movement patterns of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) is important to managers and decision-makers given the large migration potential and potamodromous behavior exhibited by the species. A remnant population of lake sturgeon remains in the far eastern basin of Lake Erie and although recent efforts have estimated the population size, described the age distribution, and identified a primary spawning site no study to date has examined the spatial distribution or movements of individuals within this population. Between 2014 and 2018, we acoustically tagged 59 adult lake sturgeon, captured in the Buffalo Harbor area, and monitored their large-scale movements throughout Lake Erie with the Great Lakes Acoustic Telemetry System and small-scale movements with a Vemco Positioning System in the Buffalo Harbor area. After dividing Lake Erie into seven sections, we ran a multi-state mark-recapture model to examine the movement rates into and out of the eastern most section of the lake. Within a heavily utilized lake section, in the Buffalo Harbor area, we identified home ranges with our Vemco Positioning System for each season and year using averaged Brownian bridge movement models. Results Although some sturgeon demonstrated large-scale movements, traversing the entirety of Lake Erie, the majority of individuals spent their time in the eastern basin of the lake. Home ranges appeared to vary among seasons, but were consistent across years with lake sturgeon selecting the northeastern, rocky, and shallow area of our array during pre-spawning and spawning seasons and leaving our array, or selecting a trough running along the northwestern portion of our array comprising sand and bedrock, in the summer and fall seasons. Conclusions Documenting these large-scale movements aligns with previous findings that lake sturgeon on either end of the lake are genetically similar and demonstrates lake sturgeon in the eastern basin exhibit strong philopatry. Our small-scale movement models provide managers with spatial reference points, in the form of utilization distributions, indicating heavily used areas by lake sturgeon within seasons. Future studies should examine what parameters are driving site selection in these areas.

AB  - The Russian Arctic supports wild sympatric ruminants and their data-deficient helminths. In this study, we: (1) collected fecal samples of wild and semiwild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), and snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) across Palearctic North territories: Arkhangelsk Oblast (including Novaya Zemlya archipelago), Karelia and Sakha Republics, Kola, Yamal, Taimyr, and Chukotka Peninsulas, Bering, Svalbard, and Wrangel Islands; (2) conducted a coprological survey (noninvasive life-time method preferable for protected animals) to obtain eggs and larvae of helminths inhabiting digestive, respiratory, nervous, and muscular systems; (3) identified helminths according to their morphology and DNA sequences; (4) estimated parasite load per host; (5) analyzed our findings. Varestrongylus eleguneniensis (in reindeer) was reported for the Palearctic for the first time, while Orthostrongylus sp. was reported both for R. tarandus and for the Palearctic for the first time. Capillarid-type eggs were reported for snow sheep for the first time. The question of the role of wild Arctic ruminants as vectors for rotifers was raised.

AB  - Cowvine (Ipomoea lonchophylla J.M. Black) is a native and widely spread summer broadleaf weed in Australia. It contains glycoresins, which are toxic to livestock. However, limited information is available on seed germination ecology and growth phenology of this species. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the response of I. lonchophylla to different environmental conditions. Results showed that the primary dormancy exhibited by I. lonchophylla is due to the physical impediment of the hard seed coat. The seed germination percentage was the highest at the constant temperature of 27 C and alternating temperatures of 35/25 C. Germination of I. lonchophylla was not stimulated by light, suggesting that this species is non-photoblastic. Ipomoea lonchophylla germination was intolerant of a medium to high level of salt stress, and germination was completely inhibited at 250 mM NaCl. The emergence of I. lonchophylla was not restricted by seeding depth up to 8 cm, but only 5% emergence was recorded when seeds were planted at a 16-cm depth. The germination percentage was also drastically reduced by 90% to 100% after exposure to either 3 mo in silage, 48-h digestion in steers, or silage plus digestion treatments. The growth and reproductive phenology of I. lonchophylla was affected by emergence time. Plants that emerged in late spring (November 15) were able to produce more berries per plant than those that emerged in midsummer (January 15) in southern New South Wales. Information gained in our study concerning high soil salinity, ensiling, and digestion will help to develop more sustainable and effective integrated weed management strategies for controlling and reducing the spread of this weed.

AB  - Soil acidification in Chinese tea plantations is widespread, and it has significantly affected the growth of tea trees; it was important to explore soil remediation of acidified tea plantations in depth for the sustainable development of tea industry. In this study, the effects of sheep manure fertilizer with different application depths on soil acidification, tea yield and quality, and soil nitrogen transformation in tea plantations were analyzed for five consecutive years from 2018 to 2022. The results showed that long-term use of sheep manure fertilizer significantly reduced soil acidification (P< 0.05) in tea plantations, improved soil pH and soil ammonium nitrogen content, enhanced root activity and root nitrogen uptake capacity of tea trees, and thus improved tea yield and quality. The effect of different application depths of sheep manure fertilizer on tea yield and quality was mainly reflected in the transformation ability of soil ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, which showed that high transformation ability of soil ammonium nitrogen and high ammonium nitrogen content were beneficial to high tea yield and vice versa, and the best effect was achieved when sheep manure was applied at a depth of 50 cm and 70 cm. The topsis analysis confirmed that sheep manure fertilization had a greater effect on root activity, ammonium nitrogen, ammonia intensity, and nifH gene. This study provided an important practical basis for the restoration of acidified tea plantation soil through sheep manure fertilizer management.

AB  - The present study is aimed at the analysis of possibilities for shading southern frontage of street oriented along the E-W axis by the single row of trees, parallel to the southern elevations. The effectiveness of solar control shading was tested depending on the geometric relationships between trees and buildings. Numerical simulation analyses were conducted in Rhinoceros (R) program for the street located in humid continental climate in city Plock, Poland (52 degrees 32 ' 50 "N 19 degrees 42'00 "E), for the day of the highest degree of total solar radiation in the year i.e. June 7th, during hours: 8.00a.m - 5.00 p.m. The analysis has proved that a row of 20-25 year old Sycamore Maple 'Rotterdam' in the street 30 m wide and 18 m high (H/W = 0.6), can provide solar protection for the southern frontage, especially when trees are located no more than 4 m away. Location of greenery within the range of 4 to 5 m from the buildings leads to a radical reduction in the possibility of shading the wall surfaces (at 5 m to 0%). Over 90% of the shading area of the ground floor facade walls was found when trees were within the distance 2 and 3 m away from the building.

AB  - Despite expanding in-situ observations of marine ecosystems by new-generation sensors, information about intermediate trophic levels remains sparse. Indeed, mid-trophic levels, while encompassing a broad range of zooplankton and micronekton organisms that represent a key component of marine ecosystems and sustain large and diverse communities of marine predators, are challenging to sample and identify. In this study, we examined whether an animal-borne miniature active echosounder can provide information on the distribution and movements of mid-trophic level organisms. If so, such a sonar tag, harnessing the persistent diving behaviour of far-ranging marine mammals, could greatly increase the density of data on this under-studied biome. Highfrequency (1.5 MHz) sonar tags were deployed simultaneously with oceanographic tags on two southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), at the Kerguelen Islands and Valde ' s Peninsula (Argentina), and recorded acoustic backscatter while the seals foraged respectively in the Indian and the Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean. The backscatter varied widely over time and space, and the seals attempted to capture only a small fraction of the insonified targets. Diel vertical migration patterns were clearly identifiable in the data, reinforcing our confidence in the ability of the sonar tags to detect living mid-trophic organisms along with possibly sinking biological detritus. Moreover, CTD tags attached to the same animals indicated how the abundance, size distribution, and diel migration behaviour of acoustic targets varied with water bodies. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential for animal-borne sonars to provide detailed in-situ information. Further validation effort will make it a valuable tool to refine the estimation of carbon export fluxes as well as for assessing the variation of mid-trophic level biomass according to oceanographic domains and seasons.

AB  - Native forests can support wild and domestic herbivores, but their nutritional potential of understory vascular plants is rarely explored. We analysed the composition of understory plant species and their biochemical components to reveal the nutritional potential of forest types (deciduous, evergreen, mixed) and their associated open-lands (e.g. grasslands in forestlands) in Northern Patagonia. We proposed an approach combining our data (e.g. plant composition, occurrence frequency) with bibliographic research (e.g. Scopus database) to develop our findings. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistical analyses and multivariate analyses. This study presents the nutritional values for the 20 pivotal species under examination. The results highlight the significant impact of taxonomic families on nutritional profiles, where the species that presented the most relevant occurrence frequency: the herbs T. officinale (60.4 % of total occurrence frequency-TOF) and T. repens (47.9 % TOF), the graminoid H. lanatus (58 % TOF), and the fern B. penna marina (44.4 % TOF). Multivariate analyses showed that the first two PCA axes explained 76.1 % (p = 0.001) and 10.5 % (p = 1.000) of forest type variation, with nire forests and open-lands having the highest palatable plant coverage. Biochemical PCA axes explained 52.1 % (p = 0.024) and 22.5 % (p = 0.874) of the variation, distinguishing species by protein content and structural components. The deciduous forests exhibited the highest coverage of palatable plants, while target plants with low palatability and high coverage were predominantly found in evergreen forest types. The confirmed presence of pivotal species across forest types and open-lands underscores its nutritional potential, characterised by highly digestible dry matter, crude protein, highly digestible non-nitrogenous nutrients, and relative feed value. Considering their widespread distribution and nutritional factors, the native and non-native plants merit attention due to their pivotal nutritional potential.

AB  - Background Extreme fire seasons in the Mediterranean basin have received international attention due to the damage caused to people, livelihoods, and vulnerable ecosystems. There is a body of literature linking increasingly intense, large fires to a build-up of fuel from rural land abandonment exacerbated by climate change. However, a better understanding of the complex factors driving fires in fire-prone landscapes is needed. We use a global database based on the MODIS Fire CCI51 product, and the Greater C & ocirc;a Valley, a 340,000-ha area in Portugal, as a case study, to investigate the environmental drivers of fire and potential tools for managing fires in a landscape that has undergone changing agricultural and grazing management. Results Between 2001 and 2020, fires burned 32% (1881.45 km2) of the study area. Scrublands proportionally burnt the most, but agricultural land and forests were also greatly impacted. The risk of large fires (> 1 km2) was highest in these land cover types under dry conditions in late summer. Areas with higher sheep densities were more likely to burn, while cattle density had no apparent relationship with fire occurrence. There was also a 15% lower probability of a fire occurring in protected areas. Conclusion Future climatic changes that increase drought conditions will likely elevate the risk of large fires in the Mediterranean basin, and abandoned farmland undergoing natural succession towards scrubland will be at particularly high risk. Our results indicate that livestock grazing does not provide a simple solution to reducing fire risk, but that a more holistic management approach addressing social causes and nature-based solutions could be effective in reducing fire occurrence.

AB  - Single-population species (SPS) consist of only one natural population and often are at high risk of extinction. Although almost all species must go through this special stage in their evolutionary process, there is little understanding of how SPS survives. Camellia azalea C. F. Wei is a typical SPS, and has precious breeding values for its special flowering period. This study surveyed the age structure and spatial distribution of C. azalea, analyzed its genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) using microsatellite markers for 629 individuals, and estimated the effect of human disturbances on its population dynamics. Results showed that this species had a relatively moderate genetic diversity (I = 0.989, He = 0.509, and Ho = 0.497), high rate of sapling (similar to 35%), and a narrow habitat (similar to 6 km long, similar to 10 m wide). Although the construction of dams and roads did not lead to a significant loss of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0096 similar to 0.0128, N-m = 19 similar to 26), it limited C. azalea's seed flow (adults, 95 m; juveniles, 60 m), which was a reason for juveniles having a stronger SGS than adults. These results indicate that as an SPS, C. azalea still possesses the potential capacity for self-evolution and regeneration, however, it is at risk of extinction due to its small range, narrow habitat, and human distances. Furthermore, the results are also of enlightening significance to the conservation of other SPS, especially those distributed along the riparian zone.

AB  - Modern hunting is an ambivalent practice, torn between leisure and labor. Nowhere are these conflicting dimensions better manifested than for wild boar-a simultaneous game and pest species in many countries. Here, we consider the sociological, political and cultural phenomenon of wild boar hunting from a change perspective, starting at its historical roots to future implications concerning the changing demographics, drivers, needs and practices of a modernizing hunting community. Using the case context of France, we present an approach to deconstructing each component of wild boar hunting firstly, and subsequently the external forces that change the nature of hunting. The objective of this manuscript is to discuss of the wild boar optimal harvesting to be applied in changing social and ecological environment. Findings show that the challenges facing wild boar management will likely intensify in the future, especially under the spotlight of a controversial public debate.

AB  - Understanding the changes in population size, distribution and threats, is essential for assessing the status of threatened species. Northern China is believed to be an important stronghold for the Near Threatened Asiatic wild ass or khulan (Equus hemionus), but a recent assessment of the species has been lacking. To document change and updated the current status of khulan in China, we conducted a literature review targeting peer-reviewed and grey literature, newspaper articles, and summarized the results own field surveys and interviews from part of the species range. For a better understanding of the threats to khulan in China, we summarized the results of studies on environmental habitat factors and human disturbances for khulan, most of which are only available in Chinese language. Our results suggest that khulan in China have experienced a dramatic decline and fragmentation of their distribution range caused by excessive anthropogenic interferences. The remaining khulan range in China covers probably less than 40,000 km2 and is scattered over several nature reserves and the border areas in northern Xinjiang, northwestern Gansu, and western Inner Mongolia. We estimate the remaining population at about 4000 individuals, with ~80% found in Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang. The occurrences along the border with Mongolia are small and dependent on cross-border movements, which are currently severely hindered by border fences. Over the past 15 years, Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve was exposed to various human pressures and experienced dramatic population fluctuation in the khulan population size. Key factors which negatively influenced khulan were habitat loss, fragmentation, and disturbance due to mining exploration and infrastructure development. No systematic monitoring of khulan is done in the rest of the khulan range, but whereas illegal hunting seems no longer a serious threat, infrastructure development and land use changes (including increasing livestock numbers) are happening throughout the remaining range of khulan in China. Hence there is an urgent need to develop a national khulan conservation strategy and initiate cross-border cooperation with Mongolia to safeguard the long-term survival of the species in the Gobi region.

AB  - Temperate insectivorous bats value high prey abundance and appropriate vegetative structure when selecting foraging habitats. Forests, particularly in the eastern United States, provide prime foraging habitats for bats but can be heavily impacted by non-native plants, which may alter arthropod diversity and abundance, as well as vegetative structure. To investigate the associations between non-native plants and insect abundance, vegetative structure, and, consequently, bat activity, we performed vegetation surveys, insect trapping, and acoustic monitoring at 23 forested plots in northern New Jersey, USA. We predicted that non-native vegetation would either positively influence bat activity by increasing structural openness (thus, facilitating flight) or negatively influence bat activity by lowering the abundance of putative prey. We also hypothesized that vegetative characteristics, and therefore non-native vegetation, impact bats differently depending on their foraging habitat preferences. The percent of non-native cover of the ground and midstory vegetative layers of our study plots ranged from 0 to 92.92% (x<overline> = 46.94 +/- 5.77 SE) and was significantly correlated with structural vegetative characteristics, such as midstory clutter (beta = 0.01 +/- 0.006 SE), but not putative prey abundance (beta = -0.81 +/- 2.57 SE). Generalized linear models with only vegetative characteristics best predicted overall bat activity and foraging, which were greatest in areas with a high percent non-native vegetation and low midstory clutter. Although percent non-native vegetation and midstory clutter were also significant effects for bats that prefer to forage in open areas, neither vegetative characteristics nor prey abundance were significant effects for clutter-loving bats. Such findings suggest that vegetative structure is more important than prey availability for predicting overall insectivorous bat activity, but other factors, such as foraging strategy and life history traits, can impact how bat guilds respond to non-native vegetation. Therefore, more research is required to reveal additional mechanisms by which non-native plants impact bats.

AB  - Overlap between marine megafauna and maritime activities is a topic of global concern. Basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus; CM) are listed as Globally Endangered under the IUCN, though reported sightings appear to be increasing in Ireland. While such trends in the region are welcome, increasing spatiotemporal overlap between CM and numerous water users poses an increased risk of boat strikes to the animals. To demonstrate the risk and impact of boat strikes on marine megafauna, we present camera-enabled animal-borne inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from a non-lethal boat strike on a CM within a proposed National Marine Park in Ireland. We tagged a similar to 7-m female CM in County Kerry, Ireland, which was struck by a boat similar to 6 h after tag deployment. Comparison of pre-strike data with 4 h of video and similar to 7.5 h of IMU data following the boat strike provides critical insight into the animal's response. While the CM reacted momentarily with an increase in activity and swam to the seafloor, it quickly reduced its overall activity (i.e., overall dynamic body acceleration, tailbeat cycles, tailbeat amplitude, and vertical velocity) for the remainder of the deployment. Notably, the animal also ceased feeding for the duration of the video and headed towards deep offshore waters, which is in stark contrast to the pre-strike period where the animal was consistently observed feeding along the surface in shallow coastal water. This work provides insight into a CM's response to acute injury and highlights the need for appropriate protections to mitigate risks for marine megafauna.

AB  - In the Archipelago Sea as in most other parts of the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) is a foundation species of the littoral communities of the rocky shores. It sustains a community of epiphytic algae, herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs and var-ious fish. Recently we have noticed a steep decline in the occurrence of the herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs in many sites in the Archipelago Sea. We hypothesise that a key factor contributing to this decline is the recent introduction of the Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), which was first sighted in 2009 in this region. Importantly, because there are no native crabs in the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, the mud crab is a completely novel kind of predator in the ecosystem and the herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs may be particularly susceptible to it. Here, we document a dramatic de-cline of the typical herbivores occurring on the bladder wrack, possibly indicating an ongoing regime shift, by comparing our recent samples from across the Archipelago Sea with data collected a decade before the sighting of the mud crab. Moreover, we demonstrate a spatio-temporal association between the decline, particularly of the key herbivore species, the isopod Idotea balthica, and the establishment of the mud crab. We also present experimental evidence for a strong predator-prey-link between the mud crab and the isopod I. balthica. Finally, we discuss the possible consequences of the community change and scrutinise alternative explanations for our observations.

AB  - Habitat edges between two forest types significantly affect the community structure and dynamics of soil organisms Nematodes are a major group of soil microfauna and the most abundant animals on Earth. This study aimed to determine the edge effects of two forest types on soil nematode community composition. We hypothesized that nematode diversity and abundance would be greater in forest edges due to increased heterogeneity of aboveground litter and belowground root traits at the boundary between two forest types, as well as microclimatic variation, enhanced resource inputs, higher plant diversity, and unique soil moisture dynamics characteristic of edge environments. The soil was collected from two adjacent forests, a broadleaf Quercus serrata forest and a coniferous Cryptomeria japonica plantation, with the zone where the two forests transition into one another being referred to as the "forest edge". Soil nematodes were morphologically identified at the genus/ family level and examined for both community structure and trophic composition. Our results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of herbivorous nematodes and the physical distance from the broadleaf forest to the C. japonica plantation. The diameter of coniferous C. japonica fine roots were greater than those of broadleaf Q. serrata, suggesting that herbivorous nematodes had easily access to edible resources leading to an increase their populations. Moreover, the nematode community structures had a spatial autocorrelation within a 32 m range, their community structures changed significantly from broadleaf forests to C. japonica plantations and that soil pH and C/N significantly influenced the structuring of nematode communities. This study showed that nematode taxonomic and trophic compositions can be influenced by tree root traits within a range of several tens of meters around forest edges facing different forest types. Our results highlighted that forest edges enhance soil nematode taxonomic turnover.

AB  - Carrion is a valuable resource exploited not only by obligate scavengers but also by a wide variety of facultative scavengers. These species provide several important ecosystem services which can suffer if the scavenger community composition is altered, thus reducing the ecosystem provided. We studied the response of the Mediterranean facultative scavenger community to the exclusion of larger scavenger species (red fox Vulpes vulpes, European badger Meles meles, and wild boar Sus scrofa) using an exclusion fence permeable to small scavenger species (mainly Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon, common genet Genetta genetta, and stone marten Martes foina). The exclusion of dominant facultative scavengers led to a significant reduction in the amount of carrion consumed and an increase in carrion available for smaller species and decomposers, over a longer period of time. Although carrion consumption by the non-excluded species increased inside the exclusion area relative to the control area, it was insufficient to compensate for the carrion not eaten by the dominant scavengers. Of the small scavenger species, only the Egyptian mongoose significantly increased its carrion consumption in the exclusion area, and was the main beneficiary of the exclusion of dominant facultative scavengers. Therefore, altering the facultative scavenger community in Mediterranean woodlands can reduce the efficiency of small carcass removal and benefit other opportunistic species, such as the Egyptian mongoose, by increasing the carrion available to them. This interaction could have substantial implications for disease transmission, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem function.

AB  - High-latitude environments are characterised by strong seasonality, with resident animals experiencing a very short plant-growing season for reproduction and acquisition of resources before the long and demanding winter. These seasonal fluctuations in food availability are likely to affect density-dependent processes, with density-dependent food limitation expected to be stronger outside the plant-growing season. Density dependence and environmental variability can have both direct and indirect effects on reproductive success through their influence on important indicators of individual quality, such as body mass. Untangling the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors and population density on life-history tactics is fundamental for understanding population and food-web dynamics. We developed a mechanistic path model to quantify the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of density dependence and environmental variability on body mass and reproductive success of female reindeer. Long-term individual measurements before and after lactation allowed quantifying simultaneously the direct negative effect of reproductive success on autumn body mass and the strong positive seasonal covariation among the individuals' body mass measurements. This emphasises the co-occurrence of a cost of reproduction and individual heterogeneity. We show that the estimated impact of density dependence on female body mass at the end of the summer is only 25% of the impact of density dependence during winter, as failed reproduction induced by low spring body mass leads to a large compensatory growth over summer. While such a pattern is expected, our estimates provide a unique and robust quantification of its importance. This result challenges the use of body mass data of adult individuals harvested in autumn when studying temperate large herbivores, as density dependence during winter and compensatory adjustments of reproductive effort may not be revealed without considering body mass both before and after lactation.

AB  - Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is rapidly expanding for the dietary estimation of extinct animals. There has been an extensive accumulation of microwear texture data from herbivorous mammals, especially for ruminant artiodactyls, but suids are still underrepresented. Microwear varies depending on the diet, and suids are naturally more flexible than other artiodactyls. Thus, their microwear is prone to greater variability. In this study, we examine the tooth microwear texture of wild boars from Toyama Prefecture, Japan, for which detailed ecological and dietary information by stomach content analysis is available. We first investigated 205 individuals of wild-shot Toyama boars with known sex, age class, localities (the eastern high latitude region vs. the western low latitude region), and season of collection. The tooth surfaces of boarlets were rougher than those of juvenile and adult animals. The decrease in surface roughness with age implied that the frequency of tooth-tooth contact, which seemed to result in cracking of enamels and thus rough surfaces, decreased after the boars started feeding on solid foods (food-tooth contact), with progressive involvement of rooting behavior in mature adults. We further found that surface roughness showed significant differences between localities, with the western Toyama boars having flatter surfaces, possibly because they were involved in more rooting and feeding on soil-contaminated rhizomes than the eastern ones, as implied by the available stomach content data. The frequency of rooting was also evident in the broader comparison among Japanese boar populations with different habitat environments. The mainland boars inhabiting deciduous broad-leaved forests had a flatter and less rough tooth surfaces than those in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests of the southern islands. This corresponds to the fact that above-ground dietary resources were more abundant in the habitat of the southern island boars, where crops like succulent vegetables and fruits, as well as naturally fallen acorns, were abundant, whereas underground plant parts were the dominant diet component for the mainland boars. This study proved that DMTA can identify the difference in foraging modes in suids and make it possible to estimate the frequency of rooting, which is informative for inferring breeding methods of boars/pigs from archaeological sites.

AB  - Interspecific interactions are a common occurrence in nature, and, in some instances, two species form very close associations. Such symbiotic relationships vary, though, in terms of the relative advantages and disadvantages accrued by both species during interspecific interactions. Symbiotic relationships whereby both species benefit are thought to occur between oxpeckers and large mammals in Africa because while oxpeckers benefit by preying upon ticks and blood-sucking flies on the mammal's bodies, the mammals also benefit from the removal of ticks and flies. However, there is also evidence that the interactions between oxpeckers and mammals may not benefit both species because oxpeckers may not significantly reduce the abundance of ticks and may also deliberately keep wounds open, making such interactions harmful for mammals. Here, we respond to calls for further observations to help clarify the nature of such interactions by reporting a newly discovered symbiotic relationship between giant cowbirds (Molothrus oryzivorus) and South American tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) in Suriname. The cowbirds were observed feeding on ticks on the bodies of the tapirs and while it appeared that the tapirs were generally tolerant of the cowbirds, we did observe the tapirs attempting to repel the cowbirds when they appeared to target wounds on their bodies. The interactions we observed therefore appeared to benefit the cowbirds by providing them with prey and while the tapirs benefit from a reduction in tick abundance, the cowbirds did appear to target wounds on their bodies. Consequently, we tentatively conclude that the relationship between giant cowbirds and South American tapirs that we observed was beneficial to the birds and yet potentially harmful to the mammals and so further observations are needed to confirm if such interactions are context dependent. The interactions between giant cowbirds and South American tapirs provide an interesting opportunity to examine the nature of the evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of symbiotic interactions between birds and mammals.

AB  - Despite previous treatment as herbivores, largely omnivorous tadpoles may exhibit both consumptive (CEs) and non-consumptive effects (NCEs), but the roles of additional biotic and abiotic factors in mediating these effects, such as body size and habitat shading, are poorly understood. We compared freshwater invertebrate abundance and community composition across tadpole body size and habitat shading treatments to assess whether these factors influence the strength of tadpole CEs and NCEs. Macroinvertebrate and zooplankton abundances and community composition were characterized in mesocosms with either large or small wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles either shaded or not in separate CE (uncaged tadpole) and NCE (caged tadpole) treatments. Invertebrates were least abundant in mesocosms with larger tadpoles under shade. Macroinvertebrates suffered declines associated with CEs and NCEs, whereas zooplankton experienced positive NCEs but negative CEs. Our results suggest larger predators can predate more diverse prey (CEs) due to their wider gapes, but also that increased production of cues associated with predation risk can elicit stronger prey behavioral responses, such as changes in foraging time (NCEs). Predator body sizes and habitat shading are shifting with climate change, and such shifts may alter strength and direction of CEs and NCEs exerted by amphibians on freshwater invertebrates.

AB  - Managed plantations of saltbush have the potential to increase the productivity and climate resilience of the farming systems of the low rainfall areas of the world, where livestock are important. The objective was to dynamically simulate the behaviour of grazing saltbush plantations with a new modelling capacity in the APSIM framework to enable the dynamic grazing of forage systems. Scenarios simulated included: the choice of plant species growing in the interrow area between shrub-rows, density of saltbush spatial arrangement, locations with different climates and soils, and grazing strategy by sheep. Comparisons of scenarios across systems were insightful during rainfall years when the shrub systems are of high value (i.e., driest/lowest 20% rainfall years in the simulation period). Overall, the efficient grazing of shrubs by dry sheep with little supplementary feeding, required the availability of a large amount of low quality interrow. Shrub plantations with an interrow of standing oats required least supplementation. Summer grazing was the optimal time for grazing shrub plantations in low rainfall years. Plantations with more shrubs relative to interrow increased the need for supplementary feeding but reduced the variation between years. This is one of the first uses of systems modelling to explore forage shrub system designs that maximise the grazing value of shrub plus interrow.

AB  - The human dimension of wildlife is increasingly addressed in socioecological studies on the growth of some wildlife populations in Europe, which frequently leads to conflicts, particularly when wild populations inhabit or reach humanized landscapes. In Europe, ungulates have been increasing in number and distribution, especially the wild boar (Sus scrofa). This has been a cause of concern, given the increase in traffic accidents, diseases, and crop damage caused by the wild boar. These impacts could shape people's perception regarding this species, but sociocultural factors can influence a favorable perception. This study examines people's perception of the wild boar in Portugal, collecting responses from 1532 individuals, including farmers, hunters, and the general public. Three indexes were created to analyze perception: interest in wildlife, perception of benefits, and perception of damage associated with wild boar. Respondents had, in general, a positive perception of the wild boar. Farmers were more aware of wild boar increasing trends and had a higher damage perception and a lower perception of species benefits. This was expected, considering the increasing damages caused by wild boar to crops. Hunters showed an intermediate perception between the farmers and the general public that mainly highlighted the benefits. This study is valuable in providing data to orientate awareness-raising actions, as well as management strategies to tackle wild boar densities, such as hunting coupled with other methods. It is of the utmost importance the application of compensatory schemes, through the government, as an end-of-line measure. Future research should focus on adaptive management involving multidisciplinary teams.

AB  - When ecosystems are under severe pressure or environments change, trophic position and intraspecific niche width may decrease or narrow, signalling that conservation action is required. In New Zealand, alpine and subalpine ecosystems have been extensively modified through farming since 19th-century European settlement, with consequences for indigenous species such as the kea Nestor notabilis. We investigated feather stable isotope values in the kea and predicted a lower trophic position in modern kea populations, to reflect reduced lowland habitat and a mixed diet with more plant material. We predicted that size and sex would influence trophic values in this sexually dimorphic species, with larger birds more likely to have a high protein diet. We examined potential dietary changes in 68 museum collected kea from 1880s to 2000s, first recording accession details including provenance and sex and measuring culmen length. We used bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses (BSIAs) of feathers and a further feather subset using compound-specific stable isotope analyses of amino acids (CSIA-AA) to obtain isotopic values and estimate trophic position. BSIA showed delta N-15 values in kea feathers declined through time and could indicate that early century kea were highly omnivorous, with delta N-15 values on average higher than in modern kea. Variance in delta N-15 values was greater after 1950, driven by a few individuals. Few differences between males and females were evident, although females in the south region had lower delta N-15 values. There was a tendency for large male birds to have higher trophic values, perhaps reflecting dominant male bird behaviour noted in historical records. Nonetheless, CSIA-AA performed on a subset of the data suggested that variation in BSIA is likely due to baseline changes rather than relative trophic position which may be more homogenous than these data indicate. Although there was more variability in modern kea, we suggest caution in interpretation. Stable isotope data, particularly CSIA-AA, from museum specimens can reveal potential change in ecological networks as well as sexually dimorphic feeding patterns within species. The data can reveal temporal and regional variation in species trophic position and changes in ecosystem integrity to inform conservation decision-making.

AB  - We analysed the possibility of reintroducing the European bison (Bison bonasus L.) in the north of Romania-in Suceava, Neamt,, and Maramures, counties-as well as increasing the wild European bison population in Neamt, county to improve the genetic quality of the existing population. Currently, there is a population of over 50 individuals in the wild in Vanatori Neamt, Natural Park, Romania. At the same time, an attempt was made to identify the connecting corridors between the free European bison in Neamt, county and other populations through new nuclei of European bison released in Suceava and Maramures, counties. In this regard, the hunting grounds with the highest ecological potential for the analysed species were identified using GIS spatial analysis techniques. The aim was also to trace possible ecological corridors linking different reintroduction locations, taking into account the ecological claims of the species. The analysis also followed the size of the European bison groups to be released, the sex ratio of each group, and the periodicity of their releasing. In order to reach viable populations, scenarios and simulations were carried out depending on the age, number, and sex of the relocated specimens. In this regard, the dynamics and the minimum viable population that could survive without risk of extinction were highlighted. The analysis showed that the analysed area has a high potential for the reintroduction of European bison in the wild. The release and creation of new European bison nuclei in the wild creates the premises for natural contacts with the existing free populations in the wild, genetic improvement, and increasing fauna diversity with ecological, social, and economic implications.

AB  - Understanding how individuals within populations are connected genetically and through shared space-use is critical to understanding the demographic patterns of at-risk populations. In recent years, non-invasive genetic sampling methods have allowed us to begin addressing these questions. Using a network analysis framework, we examined the spatial co-occurrence and genetic relatedness of boreal and central mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in populations varying in sizes and trend from across western Canada. Using 15 microsatellites loci and a sex-specific marker, we developed pedigree networks for each population, including first to third order relationships. We constructed networks of individual spatial co-occurrence, and using multilayer network analysis, we determined the degree to which caribou that co-occurred spatially were related. Caribou populations varied in the extent and classes of familial relationships which cooccurred in space. In most populations, spatial co-occurrences were greater than expected only for parent-offspring relationships. A sex-specific analysis of the longest sampled population revealed that this was driven by a significant overlap between mothers and their offspring. Whereas in populations where very few parent-offspring relationship were detected, no significant overlap was found between any relationship categories. The lack of overlap in these populations may be an indication of poor calf survival. On the other hand, the higher degree of overlap with more distant relations (i.e., grandparents) seen in some populations may indicate a population that lacks mobility. Our research presents a new approach to explore both spatial and genetic overlap at the individual level in support of the conservation of threatened populations.

AB  - Rising ocean temperatures are the primary driver of coral reef declines throughout the tropics. Such declines include reductions in coral cover that facilitate the monopolization of the benthos by other taxa such as macroalgae, resulting in reduced habitat complexity and biodiversity. Long-term monitoring projects present rare opportunities to assess how sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) influence changes in the benthic composition of coral reefs across distinct locations. Here, using extensively monitored coral reef sites from Honduras (in the Caribbean Sea), and from the Wakatobi National Park located in the center of the coral triangle of Indonesia, we assess the impact of global warming on coral reef benthic compositions over the period 2012-2019. Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect models revealed increases in the sponge, and hard coral coverage through time, while rubble coverage decreased at the Indonesia location. Conversely, the effect of SSTAs did not predict any changes in benthic coverage. At the Honduras location, algae and soft coral coverage increased through time, while hard coral and rock coverage were decreasing. The effects of SSTA at the Honduras location included increased rock coverage, but reduced sponge coverage, indicating disparate responses between both systems under SSTAs. However, redundancy analyses showed intralocation site variability explained the majority of variance in benthic composition over the course of the study period. Our findings show that SSTAs have differentially influenced the benthic composition between the Honduras and the Indonesian coral reefs surveyed in this study. However, the large intralocation variance that explains the benthic composition at both locations indicates that localized processes have a predominant role in explaining benthic composition over the last decade. The sustained monitoring effort is critical for understanding how these reefs will change in their composition as global temperatures continue to rise through the Anthropocene.

AB  - Cameroon Blackbelly sheep are a domestic breed of hair sheep from West/Central Africa. They are popular with small-holder farmers in Cameroon as they are highly resilient to local environmental challenges and are prolific a-seasonal breeders. The aim of this study was to characterise the genetics of Cameroon Blackbelly sheep in relation to global sheep populations and to investigate their relationship to Caribbean hair sheep. We first examined the genetic diversity of the Cameroon Blackbelly breed relative to global sheep populations using 50K SNP data. We also used whole genome sequence data to further investigate relationships between Cameroon Blackbelly and breeds from Africa and Europe, as well as the Barbados Blackbelly breed from the Caribbean, which is phenotypically similar to Cameroon Blackbelly. ADMIXTURE results based on 50K and WGS data demonstrated both West/Central African and European ancestries for the Barbados Blackbelly sheep. Results from f4-statistics-based qpAdm analyses supported these findings. Local ancestry inference identified several genomic regions in Barbados Blackbelly with high proportions of West/Central African ancestry. One of these, on OAR3, includes various keratin genes, suggesting that these genes may play a role in the shared coat phenotypes of the Barbados Blackbelly and Cameroon Blackbelly. This result is consistent with previous reports of adaptive introgression of coat characteristics in both wild and domesticated species. The findings of our study support the view that sheep were transported from West/Central Africa to the Caribbean as part of the transatlantic slave trade and European colonisation, similar to introductions proposed for cattle and goats.

AB  - The population density of susceptible animals, including domestic pigs and wild boar, is a major risk factor for the emergence of African Swine Fever outbreaks. The ASF foci in wild boar in Russia is sustained by the presence of the virus in the environment, which is primarily determined by the number of infected carcasses found. This study investigates the risk factors related to the occurrence of ASF virus among wild boar, identified through passive monitoring and depopulation control measures, by employing generalized logistic regression models and random forest analysis. The random forest regression outperformed logistic regression coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.98 and R2 = 0.88) according to the statistical modeling of ASF using different regression types. When comparing regression models, the results showed that wild boar population density, the number of hunting farms, the presence of infected carcasses, and ASF outbreaks among domestic pigs were the main predictors of epidemic in wild boar. The application of a multiple logistic regression model confirmed the significance of the identified risk factors, determining of the probability of ASF outbreaks among wild boar. Given the prolonged affected area across most regions of Russia, the random forest model proved to be the most effective and interpretable based on quality indicator assessments. By highlighting the important role of geographical conditions, identifying these risk factors enhances our understanding of ASF dynamics in specific regions and offers valuable information for decision-makers in developing targeted control strategies against this disease.

AB  - Stress often induces plant trait plasticity, and microbial communities also alter plant traits. Therefore, it is unclear how much plasticity results from direct plant responses to stress vs indirect responses due to stress-induced changes in soil microbial communities. To test how microbes and microbial community responses to stress affect the ecology and potentially the evolution of plant plasticity, I grew plants in four stress environments (salt, herbicide, herbivory, and no stress) with microbes that had responded to these same environments or with sterile inoculant. Plants delayed flowering under stress only when inoculated with live microbial communities, and this plasticity was maladaptive. However, microbial communities responded to stress in ways that accelerated flowering across all environments. Microbes also affected the expression of genetic variation for plant flowering time and specific leaf area, as well as genetic variation for plasticity of both traits, and disrupted a positive genetic correlation for plasticity in response to herbicide and herbivory stress, suggesting that microbes may affect the pace of plant evolution. Together, these results highlight an important role for soil microbes in plant plastic responses to stress and suggest that microbes may alter the evolution of plant plasticity.

AB  - Vitamin D has a well-established role in skeletal health and is increasingly linked to chronic disease and mortality in humans and companion animals. Despite the clear significance of vitamin D for health and obvious implications for fitness under natural conditions, no longitudinal study has tested whether the circulating concentration of vitamin D is under natural selection in the wild. Here, we show that concentrations of dietary-derived vitamin D-2 and endogenously produced vitamin D-3 metabolites are heritable and largely polygenic in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Vitamin D-2 status was positively associated with female adult survival, and vitamin D-3 status predicted female fecundity in particular, good environment years when sheep density and competition for resources was low. Our study provides evidence that vitamin D status has the potential to respond to selection, and also provides new insights into how vitamin D metabolism is associated with fitness in the wild.

AB  - Group-dwelling mammalian herbivores (e.g., impala) often have to balance between the amount of time spent foraging and being vigilant. Vigilance behaviour (scanning for predators) helps reduce predation risk while prey are vulnerable during foraging events. Impalas typically occur in either territorial herds containing dominant males, females and juveniles, or bachelor herds that contain only subordinate males. To assess how factors such as sex, social structure and the presence or absence of predators may affect impala behaviour, we examined the vigilance and foraging behaviour of impalas, both inside a game reserve with limited large predators as well as in the Kruger National Park, in eastern South Africa, with many predators present. In the low-predator environment, dominant males in territorial herds spent more time vigilant than females and juveniles, and males in territorial herds spent more time vigilant than males in bachelor herds. When comparing vigilance behaviour in areas with and without predators, females and bachelor males exhibited no difference in their behaviour between locations. Surprisingly, dominant males in territorial herds were more vigilant in low-predator environments than in high-predator environments (Kruger), which may suggest that vigilance by dominant males is directed towards competitor males rather than predators.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is a major threat to marine megafauna such as seabirds. Population monitoring has revealed low survival of juvenile seabirds over recent decades, potentially because naive individuals are more susceptible to bycatch than adults. However, major gaps remain in our knowledge of behavior and interaction of juveniles with fisheries. Here, we tracked juvenile grey-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma) from South Georgia the largest global population of this endangered species, and in rapid decline - to investigate their at-sea distribution and assess bycatch risk. Fledged juveniles dispersed to the northeast, overlapping with a bycatch hotspot for grey-headed albatrosses reported by the Japanese pelagic longline fleet in the southeast Atlantic Ocean. Given adult grey-headed albatrosses use regions less exposed to fishing activity (< 40<degrees>S), the majority of birds bycaught in this area are probably juveniles, and possibly immatures, from South Georgia, likely representing a key factor explaining the sustained population decline. Our study highlights the urgent need to uncover the 'lost-years' for marine megafauna to enable focused conservation efforts.

AB  - Human wildlife conflict (HWC) impacts the livelihood of many rural communities worldwide. This study investigated the impact of HWC on people living near community forests (CF) in Nepal. Using databases provided by the Division of Forest Offices and data obtained from surveys between October 2019-March 2020, we quantified the financial loss of HWC to the local people. Between 2015 and 2019, 3315, or 27%, of the livestock owned by the survey respondents were killed by wild predators in the Kaski and Tanahun Districts. Chicken (Gallus spp.) was the most common prey taken (80%), followed by sheep (Ovis spp.) and goats (Capra spp.) (15%), cows (Bos spp.) (2%), pigs (Sus spp.) (2%), and buffalo (Bubalus spp.) (1%). Leopards (Panthera pardus) were the primary predators, followed by golden jackals (Canis aureus), jungle cats (Felis chaus), yellow-throated martens (Martes flavigula), and Himalayan black bears (Ursus thibetanus). The financial loss of livestock during this period was USD $115,656.00, equivalent to USD $142.61 per household. Crops were also damaged and eaten by wildlife, and 2165 crop-raiding events were recorded between 2015 and 2019. Rice (Oryza sativa), followed by maize (Zea mays), millet (Panicum miliaceum), and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) were the main crops lost. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were the most common crop raiders, causing 74% of the damage, followed by Indian field mice (Mus booduga) (12%). From 2015 to 2019, crop losses equated to USD $83,424.00. Forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land expanded wildlife habitats, enabling wild animals to come within reach of human settlements, which increased the likelihood of HWC events. Although the success of the community forest restoration program resulted in increased forest-cover, marginally increasing biodiversity, the reduced distance between human settlements and wildlife habitat, compounded by a lack of natural prey, may have unwittingly exacerbated HWC in this region. We recommend surveying predator and prey populations in the forest habitat, and implementing a habitat management program to improve prey populations within the community forests. Meantime, we propose establishing a financial relief and insurance program for crop and livestock losses at the local community level to alleviate any financial difficulties to the local communities caused by HWC.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species in the United States. They damage agriculture, degrade water quality and ecological communities, and host a number of viruses, parasites, and bacteria transmissible to humans and animals. In states such as Texas, USA, where wild pigs cause extensive damage to agriculture and property, officials have considered allowing for the use of toxicants to control wild pig populations. To provide decision-makers with information regarding stakeholders' perceptions of the use of toxicants to control wild pigs, we surveyed Texas hunters in 2019 to assess the level of acceptance of a hypothetical wild pig toxicant, the sociodemographic and other factors most closely associated with acceptability of such a toxicant, and the specific concerns that underlie hunters' positions on the use of such a toxicant. We received 37,317 completed responses to an online, self-administered survey. Respondents were divided over the use of a toxicant, with 43% finding a toxicant acceptable, 18% neutral, and 39% finding a toxicant unacceptable. The factor most closely associated with acceptance of a wild pig toxicant was respondents' desired wild pig population size in Texas (chi(2) = 3,657.7, P < 0.001, V = 0.26), with 70% of respondents who preferred that wild pigs be completely removed from Texas finding the use of a toxicant to be acceptable, compared to 14% of respondents who preferred that wild pig populations increase or stay the same. The most commonly raised concerns in connection with toxicant usage were potential negative impacts to nontarget animals (33%) and negative impacts to human health (24%). Our research suggests that while achieving a consensus among Texas hunters on toxicant usage is unrealistic, building majority support may be possible if the identified concerns are sufficiently addressed in product development and outreach.

AB  - Context Wildlife tourism is becoming increasingly popular and often uses bait and berley to attract the target species and enhance customer experience. However, few studies have assessed the effects of food-based attractants on non-target species. Understanding the impacts of provisioning on the marine ecosystem, including non-target species, is required to assess the effects of wildlife tourism comprehensively. Aims We compared fish assemblages at a white shark cage-diving site to those at other offshore islands to assess whether any detectable differences could be observed and attributed to shark diving operations. Methods We used baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to quantify and compare fish assemblages across a 6-year timespan at the Neptunes Islands Group (South Australia) and six reference locations. The Neptunes Islands Group consist of one high provisioning site, where most (similar to 85%) of the bait and berley input takes place, and one lower provisioning site, where operators visit less frequently. Key results Fish assemblages at the Neptunes Islands Group and all other offshore islands had similar levels of variability. There was a higher total abundance of fish at both Neptune Islands sites than at reference sites, driven by higher abundances of horseshoe leatherjacket, Meuschenia hippocrepis, and barber perch, Caesioperca rasor. However, there were no detectable differences in species richness or evenness between the Neptunes Islands Group and other offshore islands. Conclusions Despite operators using food-based attractant on a near daily basis and some fishes feeding on bait and berley continuously, the cage-diving industry has minimal effects on demersal fish abundance and diversity. Implications This suggests that the current level of provisioning has limited ecological impacts on the reef fish community and highlights that the management regulations are currently suitable for non-target fish assemblages.

AB  - Ungulate habitat use and movements are highly variable among individuals, populations, and regions. Factors that influence annual and seasonal movements are important to understand for management purposes. Within some populations, moose (Alces alces) are known to migrate between seasonal ranges, generally in response to changes in the environment. A total of 45 female moose were fitted with GPS collars between March 1, 2014, and February 28, 2018, in and around the John Prince Research Forest in north-central British Columbia, Canada, to determine the prevalence and timing of migration. Using the model-based net squared displacement approach, we classified 67 (74%) annual trajectories as migratory, of which 43 (48%) were migrant and 24 (27%) were mix-migrant. We classified 22 annual trajectories (24%) as resident and one (1%) as a disperser. Moose with migratory trajectories exhibited a consistent pattern of leaving their winter range (WR) in April and returning from November to February after spending the majority of the year in their non-winter range (NWR). There was a significant negative correlation between mean monthly elevation and mean monthly snow on the ground for migratory moose. The mean distance separating migratory moose WR and NWR ranges (delta) was 32 km (SD = 30 km) but varied greatly from a minimum of 5 km to a maximum of 61 km. We discuss the potential implications of our results on surveys used to estimate moose population abundance and trends. We contend that a better understanding of moose seasonal habitat use patterns would aid moose management, help delineate important seasonal rangelands and migration corridors, inform population survey designs, and expand our understanding of moose populations in general.

AB  - Controlling persistent infectious disease in wildlife populations is an ongoing challenge for wildlife managers and conservationists worldwide, and chronic diseases in particular remain a pernicious problem. Here, we develop a dynamic pathogen transmission model capturing key features of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae infection, a major cause of population declines in North American bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis. We explore the effects of model assumptions and parameter values on disease dynamics, including density- versus frequency-dependent transmission, the inclusion of a carrier class versus a longer infectious period, host survival rates, disease-induced mortality and recovery rates and the epidemic growth rate. Along the way, we estimate the basic reproductive ratio, R-0, for M. ovipneumoniae in bighorn sheep to fall between approximately 1.36 and 1.74. We apply the model to compare efficacies across a suite of management actions following an epidemic, including test-and-remove, depopulation-and-reintroduction, range expansion, herd augmentation and density reduction. Our results suggest that test-and-remove, depopulation-and-reintroduction and range expansion could help persistently infected bighorn sheep herds recovery following an epidemic. By contrast, augmentation could lead to worse outcomes than those expected in the absence of management. Other management actions that improve host survival or reduce disease-induced mortality are also likely to improve population size and persistence of chronically infected herds. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic transmission models like the one employed here offer a structured, logical approach for exploring hypotheses, planning field experiments and designing adaptive management. We find that management strategies that removed infected animals or isolated them within a structured metapopulation were most successful at facilitating herd recovery from a low-prevalence, chronic pathogen. Ideally, models like ours should operate iteratively with field experiments to triangulate on better approaches for managing wildlife diseases.

AB  - The ecological roles of large predators are well recognized, but quantifying their functional impacts remains an active area of research. In this study, we examined the metabolic requirements and nutrient outputs of the estuarine crocodile population (Crocodylus porosus) in northern Australia over a 50-year period, during which the population increased from a few thousand to over 100 000 individuals. Bioenergetic modelling showed that during this period, the crocodile population's annual prey consumption increased from <20 kg km(-2) in 1979 to approximately 180 kg km(-2) in 2019. Further, the prey consumption increase was accompanied by a significant dietary shift from predominantly aquatic prey (approx. 65% in 1979) to a terrestrial-based diet (approx. 70% in 2019). A substantial portion of these terrestrial-derived nutrients was excreted into the water, significantly increasing the input rates of nitrogen (186-fold) and phosphorus (56-fold). The study shows that, despite being ectothermic, the high biomass of crocodiles within the environment generated nutrient inputs comparable to terrestrial endothermic predator populations. While crocodiles are apex predators, they are not considered to influence ecosystems in the same manner that large-bodied endothermic predators do. However, in the oligotrophic freshwater systems of northern Australia, the large volume of crocodile biomass is likely to impact the ecosystem through top-down and bottom-up processes.

AB  - Organic amendment often affects both crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Yet the impact of organic amendment on yield gains and GHG emissions is still unclear, particularly in long-term soybean-wheat cropping system. Based on a 30-year soybean-wheat cropping system experiment, the impact of organic amendments (i.e. straw and manure) on soil properties, crop yield, N2O and CH4 emissions, and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) were investigated. The treatments were: chemical NPK fertilizer (NPK), chemical NPK plus low amount of wheat straw (NPKLS), chemical NPK plus high amount of wheat straw (NPKHS), chemical NPK plus pig manure (NPKPM), chemical NPK plus cattle manure (NPKCM), and a control with no fertilizer applied (CK). The long-term straw and manure amendments enhanced soybean yield by 13.1% and 44.0%, and improved wheat yield by 6.4% and 9.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, they stimulated N2O emissions by 25.1% and 49.0% respectively, without significant effect on CH4 emissions, compared to the chemical NPK fertilizer treatment (NPK). The results of structural equation model showed that soil properties tested explained 76% of the variations observed in N2O emissions, which were directly affected by soil nitrification capacity, pH and denitrification capacity. Although straw and manure amendments increased the total GHG emissions investigated by 25.7% and 48.6% respectively, they showed insignificant effects on the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and increased NEEB by 8.6% and 21.1%, respectively, compared to the NPK treatment. This indicates that the benefits arising from crop yield improvement through the use of organic amendments can cover the carbon fees caused by increased GHG emissions. Our findings suggest that organic amendment can be an effective strategy to simultaneously increase crop yield while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the perspective of carbon fees.

AB  - Elephants are essential ecological engineers, creating and maintaining landscape structure and ecosystem function. The recently distinguished and critically endangered forest elephant is currently classified as a selective, non-destructive frugivorous browser that maintains forest diversity, while the savanna elephant is a mixed feeder, often pushing over trees while maintaining grasslands. The presence and diets of forest elephants on grasslands and the potential maintenance of these systems remain largely unexplored. In the ecotone between the Guinea-Congolian forest and Sudanian-Guinean savanna ecosystems in Garamba National Park, DRC, we investigated forest elephant diet selection as a function of sex, age, and habitat using diet DNA (dDNA) metabarcoding of non-invasively collected dung. GPS collar data were used to determine annual habitat use. Dietary niche partitioning was assessed among megaherbivores in the grasslands. Fecal samples represented the diet of individuals within each habitat, providing valuable insight into the plant biodiversity. Ecological patterns of diet were also revealed using a taxonomically free exact sequence variance approach, highlighting useability in a poorly characterized region. In the early wet season, these typically frugivorous forest elephants were consuming mostly grasses in both the woodland and grassland habitats and showing no sexual dimorphism in diet selection when in the same habitats. However, males were greater risk-takers, entering the human-altered landscape to forage on fruit. The forest elephants play a distinctive role within this tropical grassland when compared to other megaherbivores and utilize the unique ecosystem throughout the year. This elephant population is exhibiting behavioral plasticity and shifting their gardening efforts to a novel resource in the grasslands as opposed to their standard role in the forests, which is key to understanding their impact as ecosystem drivers within this landscape. This shift in behavior may result in this recovering elephant population playing a functional role in the restoration and maintenance of these grasslands.

AB  - Introduced macroalgae becoming invasive may alter ecological functions and habitats in recipient ecosystems. In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), non-native strains of the native macroalgae Eucheuma denticulatum were introduced for farming practices and consequently spread into the surrounding seascape. We investigated potential effects of non-native and native strains of this macroalgae on a branching coral. We conducted a four-factor field experiment where we examined growth and holdfast development of introduced and native E. denticulatum on live and dead branches of Acropora sp. in the presence and absence of herbivores in Unguja Island, Zanzibar. Moreover, we estimated coral and macroalgae condition by visual examinations, gene expression analyses, and photosynthetic measurements. Macroalgae did not attach to any live coral and coral condition was not impacted by the presence of E. denticulatum, regardless of geographical origin. Instead, necrotic tissue on the macroalgae in areas of direct contact with corals indicated damage inflicted by the coral. The biomass of E. denticulatum did not differ between the replicates attached to live or dead corals in the experiment, yet biomass was strongly influenced by herbivory and replicates without protection from herbivores had a significantly lower biomass. In the absence of herbivory, introduced E. denticulatum had significantly higher growth rates than native algae based on wet weight measurements. These results contribute to an increased understanding of environmental effects by the farming of a non-native strain of algae on corals and stresses the importance to maintain viable populations of macroalgal feeding fishes in such areas.

AB  - Ecosystems are commonly organized into trophic levels-organisms that occupy the same level in a food chain (e.g., plants, herbivores, carnivores). A fundamental question in theoretical ecology is how the interplay between trophic structure, diversity, and competition shapes the properties of ecosystems. To address this problem, we analyze a generalized Consumer Resource Model with three trophic levels using the zero-temperature cavity method and numerical simulations. We derive the corresponding mean-field cavity equations and show that intra-trophic diversity gives rise to an effective "emergent competition" term between species within a trophic level due to feedbacks mediated by other trophic levels. This emergent competition gives rise to a crossover from a regime of top-down control (populations are limited by predators) to a regime of bottom-up control (populations are limited by primary producers) and is captured by a simple order parameter related to the ratio of surviving species in different trophic levels. We show that our theoretical results agree with empirical observations, suggesting that the theoretical approach outlined here can be used to understand complex ecosystems with multiple trophic levels.
   Ecosystems are commonly organized into trophic levels-organisms that occupy the same level in a food chain (e.g., plants, herbivores, carnivores). In this study, we use methods originating from spin glass physics to theoretically analyze the statistical properties of large and diverse ecosystems with multiple trophic levels. Our analysis successfully quantifies the strength of intra-level competitions and results in a simple criteria for determining whether an ecosystem exhibits top-down control (e.g. herbivores populations are limited by predators) or bottom-up control (e.g. herbivores populations are limited by the availability of plants). Somewhat surprisingly, we find that whether a system exhibits top-down or bottom-up control dependent solely on the ratio of surviving species at different trophic levels.

AB  - Simple Summary The water buffalo is found in many tropical countries worldwide. In the current world scenario, where meeting the protein requirements of the population is one of the biggest future challenges, buffalo meat could be a good source of protein and other nutrients. Currently, very little information is available regarding buffalo meat quality attributes. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of aging time and muscle type on meat quality attributes (pH, color, tenderness, water holding capacity, and sensory acceptance) of buffalo meat. The results showed that color, tenderness, and sensory attributes were improved with aging time; the suitable aging time required to enhance meat quality attributes in Longissimus lumborum and Gluteus medius muscles is 28 and 21 days, respectively. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of wet aging on meat quality characteristics of Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Gluteus medius (GM) muscles of buffalo bulls. Meat samples from six aging periods, i.e., 0 day (d) = control, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, 28 d, and 35 d, were evaluated for pH, color, metmyoglobin content (MetMb%), cooking loss, water holding capacity (WHC), myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), and sensory evaluation. The pH, instrumental color redness (a *), yellowness (b *), chroma (C *), and MetMb% values were increased, while the lightness (L *) and hue angle (h *) values showed non-significant (p > 0.05) differences in both LL and GM muscles in all aging periods. The cooking loss increased while WHC decreased till 35 days of aging. MFI values significantly (p < 0.05) increased, while WBSF values decreased; in addition, sensory characteristics were improved with the increase in the aging period. Overall, the color, tenderness, and sensory characteristics were improved in LL and GM muscles until 28 and 21 days of aging, respectively. Based on the evaluated meat characteristics, 28 days of aging is required to improve the meat quality characteristics of LL, whereas 21 days of aging is suitable for GM muscle.

AB  - Missing an estrus event is an economic problem in buffaloes because of lack of a simple and accurate estrus identification method. Saliva, a non-invasive fluid available every time, showed typical fern-like crystallization patterns at early estrus in buffaloes. However, to implement this salivary ferning based estrus identification method in the field conditions, the present study, for the first time, validated this method in four buffalo population samples (PS) representing four different field scenarios, an organized herd (PS1, 10 buffaloes monitored daily for a year (149 estrus events)), artificial insemination (AI) centers (PS2, 114 buffaloes brought for AI), induced estrus condition (PS3, 44 buffaloes) and farmers' doorsteps (PS4, 275 random buffaloes with unknown reproductive history and no estrous signs). Totally, 582 saliva samples were collected from 443 buffaloes. Salivary smears were observed under a simple microscope and/or a less expensive (< 1USD) paper microscope, Foldscope. On the basis of salivary fern-like patterns, the proportions of estrus identification were significantly different among PS. Specifically, the proportions in the PS1 (0.74, P < 0.0001) and PS4 (0.08, P < 0.05) were significantly higher than their population proportion estimates, 0.5 and zero, respectively. Therefore, this estrus identification method is much useful in the PS1 and PS4, the practical field scenarios requiring an accurate estrus prediction method, compared to the PS2 and PS3. Especially, this method is 91 % confirmatory to detect early estrus in PS4. Therefore, salivary ferning is a useful technique to identify early estrus in buffaloes in the field conditions at farmers' doorsteps.

AB  - Himalayan tahr is a group-living animal of high-altitude Himalaya, distributed all across the subalpine range that also formed an important prey base for large carnivores in Himalaya. The species is threatened due to habitat fragmentation, illegal poaching, and anthropogenic activities. We undertook population genetic assessment of Himalayan tahr from Western Himalaya and observed comparable genetic diversity at both mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci. Bayesian skyline plots showed stable demography in the past several thousand years. We identified 27 unique individuals with a select panel of seven loci and the Bayesian structure analysis inferred two genetic clusters. The present study is the first report on the population genetic make-up of Himalayan tahr and can be used for long-term genetic monitoring of the species.

AB  - The distribution and population density of red deer (Cervus elaphus) are increasing in several regions of Europe. The deer may cause severe damage in commercial forestry and agriculture. Bark stripping is the main problem in forests, especially on Norway spruce (Picea abies), and is thought to mostly occur during winter when other forage is scarce. It has been suggested that an imbalance in the nutrient intake, and especially a diet including high amounts of easily-digestible macronutrients, such as agricultural crops, can lead to an increased urge to consume bark. Feeding on brassicas, for example rapeseed (Brassica napus) might have this effect. The aim with this study was to investigate the relationship between intake of rapeseed and bark stripping on Norway spruce by red deer during early spring. We did this by a controlled feeding experiment with four groups of captive red deer in southern Sweden. All groups were given spruce logs every week, while only two groups had access to freshly harvested rapeseed plants. In addition, influence of air temperature and forage nutritional composition was taken into account. Our results show that red deer bark stripping can be considerable not only during winter but also during spring green-up. We found no significant influence of rapeseed on bark stripping performed by the deer. However, at a threshold temperature, deer suddenly started to ingest large amounts of bark biomass, coinciding with a significant change in the bark's concentration of starch. We suggest that the lack of effect of rapeseed feeding can partly be explained by overshadowing effects caused by such seasonal changes of bark character-istics, and partly by the fact that the rapeseed plants in our study contained lower than expected concentrations of easily-digestible macronutrients (apart from protein). We conclude that the risk of damage on spruce can be especially high during certain periods, something that is important to consider when mitigating bark stripping. However, several interactive effects are involved and must be considered in order to more efficiently mitigate damage.

AB  - To investigate the potential long-term consequences of environmental warming in subtropical systems, we compare the trophic structure of shallow lakes in tropical and subtropical regions. In total, 25 meso-eutrophic lakes with piscivorous fish were sampled during summer along a latitudinal gradient in South America. The fish catch per unit of effort and the omnivorous fish to zooplankton biomass ratios were significantly lower in the tropical lakes. Despite the lower fish biomass, no significant difference was found in zooplankton or phytoplankton communities or in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio between the two sets of lakes. Nevertheless, regression models based on the combined dataset show higher cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton biomass at lower zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and higher omnivorous fish to zooplankton biomass ratio. Cyanobacteria biomass was dominated by non bloom-forming taxa and was inversely related to the biomass of calanoid copepods suggesting that these herbivores may play an important role in controlling edible cyanobacteria in warm shallow lakes. Overall, our results, however, suggest that warming will have relatively minor impacts on the pelagic trophic structure of shallow subtropical lakes supporting the idea of weaker trophic cascades in warm (sub)tropical lakes in comparison to temperate ones.

AB  - Selection on plant functional traits may occur through their direct effects on fitness (or a fitness component), or may be mediated by attributes of plant performance which have a direct impact on fitness. Understanding this link is particularly challenging for long-lived organisms, such as forest trees, where lifetime fitness assessments are rarely achievable, and performance features and fitness components are usually quantified from early-life history stages. Accordingly, we studied a cohort of trees from multiple populations of Eucalyptus pauciflora grown in a common-garden field trial established at the hot and dry end of the species distribution on the island of Tasmania, Australia. We related the within-population variation in leaf economic (leaf thickness, leaf area and leaf density) and hydraulic (stomatal density, stomatal length and vein density) traits, measured from two-year-old plants, to two-year growth performance (height and stem diameter) and to a fitness component (seven-year survival). When performance-trait relationships were modelled for all traits simultaneously, statistical support for direct effects on growth performance was only observed for leaf thickness and leaf density. Performance-based estimators of directional selection indicated that individuals with reduced leaf thickness and increased leaf density were favoured. Survival-performance relationships were consistent with size-dependent mortality, with fitness-based selection gradients estimated for performance measures providing evidence for directional selection favouring individuals with faster growth. There was no statistical support for an effect associated with the fitness-based quadratic selection gradient estimated for growth performance. Conditional on a performance measure, fitness-based directional selection gradients estimated for the leaf traits did not provide statistical support for direct effects of the focal traits on tree survival. This suggested that, under the environmental conditions of the trial site and time period covered in the current study, early-stage selection on the studied leaf traits may be mediated by their effects on growth performance, which in turn has a positive direct influence on later-age survival. We discuss the potential mechanistic basis of the direct effects of the focal leaf traits on tree growth, and the relevance of a putative causal pathway of trait effects on fitness through mediation by growth performance in the studied hot and dry environment.

AB  - According to the alternative prey hypothesis (APH), the temporal synchrony in population fluctuations of microtine rodents and other small herbivores in boreal areas is caused by generalist predators with numerical and functional response to microtines, leading to an increased predation of prey alternative to microtines in the low phase of the microtine population fluctuations. The tree-climbing pine marten (Martes martes) is a food generalist that includes bird eggs among its alternative prey, also eggs of the cavity-nesting common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula). We used long-term data to test whether pine marten predation of goldeneye eggs in nest boxes varied as predicted by the APH. As a measure of microtine abundance at the time of nesting, we applied two measures. First, for goldeneye nests located <40 km from our microtine trapping site, we applied the trapping index of microtine rodents. Second, to also use data from nests located >40 km from our microtine trapping site, and from nests in years when trapping was not conducted, we used two proxies for the microtine abundance: whether boreal owls (Aegolius funereus) nested in any of our boxes <40 km from each goldeneye nest and the average clutch size of these boreal owls. The probability of predation of a goldeneye nest was independent of the microtine trapping index and independent of the proxies for microtine abundance. However, it increased with cavity age, taken as the number of nesting seasons elapsed since the actual nest box was installed, and declined with distance from habitat with forest canopy. The effect of cavity age confirms that the long-term spatial memory of pine marten is an important factor in the pattern of its predation on nests in tree cavities.

AB  - Fish inhabiting similar environments face space and resource constraints, develop diverse feeding strategies, and adjust their trophic niches during ontogeny to reduce competition. To investigate this process, we reconstructed the trophic trajectory of five species of the family Sciaenidae by analyzing delta 13C and delta 15N values in otolith organic matter along the growth axis of the otolith. We developed and optimized the approach by aligning isotope values with an age range estimated using growth ring counts and three-dimensional scanning of otolith morphology during organic matter extraction. delta 13C values indicated habitat shifts, and delta 15N values provided insights into trophic level changes, showing that sciaenids use benthic resources throughout their lifespan and may move closer to estuarine environments at approximately an age range from 1.5 to 3 yr old. During the early life stages, their diet consists of herbivores. As they grow, competition among age groups and species appears to be minimized.

AB  - Persistence of species in the Anthropocene depends on human willingness-to-coexist with them, but this is rarely incorporated into habitat suitability or conservation priority assessments. We propose a framework of sustainable coexistence potential that integrates human willingness-to-coexist with habitat suitability assessments. We demonstrate its applicability for elephants and rhinos in the socio-ecological system of Maasai Mara, Kenya, by integrating spatial distributions of peoples' willingness-to-coexist based on Bayesian hierarchical models using 556 household interviews, with socio-ecological habitat suitability mapping validated with long-term elephant observations from aerial surveys. Willingness-to-coexist was higher if people had little personal experience with a species, and strongly reduced by experiencing a species as a threat to humans. The sustainable coexistence potential framework highlights areas of low socio-ecological suitability, and areas that require more effort to increase positive stakeholder engagement to achieve long-term persistence of large herbivores in human -dominated landscapes.

AB  - Small mammals such as mice and voles play a fundamental role in the ecosystem service of seed dispersal by caching seeds in small hoards that germinate under beneficial conditions. Pilferage is a critical step in this process in which animals steal seeds from other individuals' caches. Pilferers often recache stolen seeds, which are often pilfered by new individuals, who may recache again, and so on, potentially leading to compounded increased dispersal distance. However, little research has investigated intraspecific differences in pilfering frequency, despite its importance in better understanding the role of behavioural diversity in the valuable ecosystem service of seed dispersal.
   We conducted a field experiment in Maine (USA) investigating how intraspecific variation, including personality, influences pilferage effectiveness.
   Within the context of a long-term capture-mark-recapture study, we measured the unique personality of 3311 individual small mammals of 10 species over a 7-year period. For this experiment, we created artificial caches using eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) seeds monitored with trail cameras and buried antennas for individual identification.
   Of the 436 caches created, 83.5% were pilfered by 10 species, including deer mice ((Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We show how individuals differ in their ability to pilfer seeds and that these differences are driven by personality, body condition and sex. More exploratory deer mice and those with lower body condition were more likely to locate a cache, and female southern red-backed voles were more likely than males to locate caches. Also, caches were more likely to be pilfered in areas of higher small mammal abundance.
   Because the risk of pilferage drives decisions concerning where an animal chooses to store seeds, pilferage pressure is thought to drive the evolution of food-hoarding behaviour. Our study shows that pilferage ability varies between individuals, meaning that some individuals have a disproportionately strong influence on others' caching decisions and disproportionately contribute to compounded longer-distance seed dispersal facilitated by pilferage. Our results add to a growing body of knowledge showing that the unique personalities of individual small mammals play a critical role in forest regeneration by impacting seed dispersal.

AB  - The Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA) is home to one of the largest populations of African savanna elephants (approximately 227,000), a species iconic for ecological balance but also a major driver of human-elephant conflict (HEC). This study investigates how spatial and socio-economic factors shape household perceptions and tolerance towards elephants in the Zimbabwean part of KaZa TFCA. Using a survey sample of 668 households experiencing HEC, we analysed the impact of proximity to forests, protected areas and water points on conflict intensity and community responses. Our findings reveal that households closer to these conflict-prone features experience higher exposure to elephants, resulting in significant tangible costs, such as crop loss and property damage, and increased emotional stress. Among these features, proximity to forests emerged as the strongest predictor of HEC, followed by protected areas, with water points having a lesser influence. Distance to these features was found to mediate tolerance through its effects on tangible costs, intangible benefits and mitigation efforts. Intangible benefits, including an appreciation of elephants' ecological roles and aesthetic value, emerged as the strongest determinants of tolerance, highlighting the importance of nurturing positive perceptions. However, the absence of tangible benefits, such as tourism revenue or financial incentives, coupled with the tangible costs of living alongside elephants, such as crop damage, significantly undermine household tolerance. The study stresses the need for spatially informed mitigation strategies, including participatory spatial planning, early-warning systems and livelihood diversification through community-based conservation initiatives. Establishing community conservancies in high-conflict wards could provide tangible benefits while empowering communities to engage in wildlife management. These findings highlight the importance of integrating conservation objectives with the socio-economic realities of local communities, offering pathways for coexistence in biodiversity hotspots like KaZa TFCA.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Thermal imaging drones have transformed wildlife monitoring by facilitating the efficient and noninvasive monitoring of animal populations across large areas. In this study, an optimized flight path design was developed for monitoring wildlife on Guleopdo Island, South Korea using the DJI Mavic 3T drone equipped with a thermal camera. We employed a strata-based sampling technique to reclassify topographical and land cover information, creating an optimal survey plan. Using sampling strata, key waypoints were derived, on the basis of which nine flight paths were designed to cover similar to 50% of the study area. The results demonstrated that an optimized flight path improved the accuracy of detecting Formosan sika deer (Cervus nippon taiouanus). Population estimates indicated at least 128 Formosan sika deer, with higher detection efficiency observed during cloudy weather. Customizing flight paths based on the habitat characteristics proved crucial for efficient monitoring. This study highlights the potential of thermal imaging drones for accurately estimating wildlife populations and supporting conservation efforts.

AB  - The north periphery of the Persian leopard range is situated in the Russian Caucasus, where leopards were exterminated by humans in the 1950s. Currently, the Persian leopard is returning to the Caucasus Mountain area and relevant habitat suitability for this species is in demand. In this study, we have mapped the habitats in the Chechen Republic area due to a lack of data from the 1980s onwards. We used remote sensing (RS) datasets, combined them with geobotanical and zoological field surveys data, and assessed the potential habitats of the main mammal species connected with leopards' ecologically (preys and competitors) using machine learning approaches, such as supervised classification and modeling. The main material for the study is an up-to-date map of habitat types, based on multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field geobotanical data. Zoological field data were combined with environmental raster datasets covering the ecosystem properties and the effect of various factors (relief, climate, anthropogenic factors, etc.) on the probability of foraging, migration, nomadism, and hiding conditions for the studied species. Based on this information, habitat suitability modeling was conducted for leopard prey and competitor species (tur, bezoar goat, chamois, wild boar, roe deer, hare, badger, jackal, wolf, and bear). The suitability maps for each species were used to produce an integrated final map, taking into account the weighted impact of each species on the leopard's habitat. A preliminary ecological network assessment was performed by overlay the habitat type map with the integrated suitability map. This investigation fully estimates the suitable area for the restoration of leopard grouping in the territory of Chechnya and its characteristics.

AB  - Foliar insect herbivory could affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), yet the underlying mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we examined the response of AMF symbiosis signals to foliar herbivory, using six herbaceous plant species and a generalist herbivorous insect. We found AMF colonisation was suppressed by foliar herbivory. After insect attack, plants allocated more biomass to belowground parts and the attack induced defence responses in aboveground parts. Notably, foliar herbivory increased shoot flavonoid concentrations but decreased root flavonoid concentrations. Moreover, quercetin and strigol concentrations in the root exudates were reduced by foliar herbivory. We further tested effect of the root exudates on the in-vitro germination of spores of two common AMF species. Spore germination was lower in treatments with herbivore-induced root exudates than in treatments with no-herbivore root exudates. Moreover, addition of herbivory-modified root exudates reduced AMF colonisation of healthy plants when compared to addition of root exudates from non-herbivory plants. Our results suggest that foliar herbivory weakened symbiosis signalling in root exudates, which could have contributed to the observed lower AMF colonisation following herbivory. Therefore, herbivore-induced symbiosis signalling needs to be considered when studying plant-mediated interactions between foliar herbivores and root microbes.

AB  - Efforts to understand and protect ecosystem functioning have put considerable emphasis on classifying species according to the functions they perform. However, coarse classifications based on diet or feeding mode often oversimplify species' contributions to ecological processes. Behavioral variation among superficially similar species is easily missed but could indicate important differences in competitive interactions and the spatial scale at which species deliver their functions. To test the extent to which behavior can vary within existing functional classifications, we investigate the diversity of foraging movements in three herbivorous coral reef fishes across two functional groups. We find significant variation in foraging movements and spatial scales of operation between species, both within and across existing functional groups. Specifically, we show that movements and space use range from low frequency foraging bouts separated by short distances and tight turns across a small area, to high frequency, far-ranging forays separated by wide sweeping turns. Overall, we add to the burgeoning evidence that nuanced behavioral differences can underpin considerable complementarity within existing functional classifications, and that species assemblages may be considerably less redundant than previously thought.

AB  - Purpose Roots bridge aboveground and belowground systems, and play a pivotal role in structuring root-associated organisms via influencing food resources and habitat conditions. Most studies focused on the relationships between plant identity and root-associated organisms, however, little is known about how root traits affect nematode communities within the rhizosphere. Methods We investigated the relationships between root traits of four plant species and nematode abundance, community structure and trophic complexity in an ex-arable field. Results While the relative abundance of herbivores was negatively associated with specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), root length density (RLD) and root C: N ratio, free-living nematodes were positively affected by these traits, implying a multifaceted effect of root traits on root-associated organisms. Importantly, we found that finer root systems promoted the complexity of rhizosphere nematode community, by increasing the relative abundance of high trophic-level nematodes (i.e., omnivores and predators) and enhancing nematode diversity.

AB  - Background Holling (Can Entomol 91(5):293-320, 1959) was the first to describe a functional response between a predator's consumption-rate and the density of its prey. The same concept can be applied to the habitat selection of herbivores, specifically, the change in relative habitat use with the change in habitat availability. Functional responses in habitat selection at a home-range scale have been reported for several large herbivores. However, a link to Holling's original functional response types has never been drawn, although it could replace the current phenomenological view with a more mechanistically based understanding of functional responses. Methods In this study, discrete choice models were implemented as mixed-effects baseline-category logit models to analyze the variation in habitat selection of a large herbivore at seasonal and diurnal scales. Thus, changes in the use of land cover types with respect to their availability were investigated by monitoring 11 land cover types commonly used by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Functional response curves were then fitted using Holling's formulas. Results Strong evidence of non-linear functional responses was obtained for almost all of the examined land cover types. The shape of the functional response curves varied depending on the season, the time of day, and in some cases between sexes. These responses could be referenced to Holling's types, with a predominance of type II. Conclusions Our results indicate that Holling's types can be applied to describe general patterns of the habitat selection behavior of herbivores. Functional responses in habitat selection may occur in situations requiring a trade-off in the selection of land cover types offering different resources, such as due to the temporally varying physiological needs of herbivores. Moreover, two associated parameters defining the curves (prey density and predation rate) can aid in the identification of temporal variations and in determinations of the strength of the cost-benefit ratio for a specific land cover type. Application of our novel approach, using Holling's equations to describe functional responses in the habitat selection of herbivores, will allow the assignment of general land cover attraction values, independent of availability, thus facilitating the identification of suitable habitats.

AB  - For millennia, the coastal heathlands of Western Europe were managed by regular burning cycles for improved grazing. In recent decades, this practice has generally been neglected. In Norway, the result is accumulation of degenerated heather and highly combustible Juniperus communis (juniper) encroachment, i.e., an increasing fire threat to a rising number of homes in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). In the present study, goats grazing a 1.2 ha site partly encroached by fire-prone juniper were studied in a living lab approach. Twelve wethers (castrated male goats) wearing solar-powered Nofence GPS collars were virtually fenced to protect villa gardens bordering the site during eight weeks from 18 April 2022. Besides some early operator errors, tree shadows and cloudy days limiting battery charging, the system worked well. Photographs taken prior to and after the grazing revealed that only 39% of the junipers had 90+% remaining foliage while for 41%, the foliage was reduced to below 10%, making them far less fire-prone. The goats were frequently visited by neighborhood residents of all ages, school classes, and kindergartens. Moreover, local newspapers and TV stations broadcasted the initiative. Although divided regarding debarked deciduous trees, the neighbors stated that the goats were well accepted. Despite some limited loss of garden plants, all interviewed residents bordering the site were positive about the goats "bringing life to the forest" and, if possible, welcomed them back for other grazing periods. Virtually fenced grazing goats may represent a sustainable solution for reducing fire hazards in the WUI also elsewhere.

AB  - Managing lands for both wildlife conservation and accessible recreational opportunities can be a delicate balance. General trail use can disturb a range of species in a variety of well-described ways, but the specific effects of mountain biking on wildlife - an important management question - remains controversial in the literature. In the past, collecting data on recreational uses was time-consuming and expensive. Today, on-line recreation apps automatically collect these data. This study used data from a social fitness app, Strava Metro, to assess the differential effects of hiking and mountain biking on wildlife in parks in Marin County, California, USA. Combining user data with mammal frequency data from a community science camera trap project, we compared generalized linear mixed models to assess how mammals spatially and temporally responded to distance from trails and to levels of hiking and mountain biking activity. Of the 5 primarily non-nocturnal mammals in our study area, 4 were either spatially or temporally less frequent near trails: western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus), brush rabbits (Sylvilagus bachmani), coyotes (Canis latrans), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Mule deer were also moderately sensitive to sites with high levels of mountain bike use. When accounting for both hiking and biking use, both mule deer and brush rabbits were less frequent at high-use mountain bike sites. Strava Metro provided useful data for these analyses, showing potential as a resource for managing mountain biking effects on public lands as mountain and e-bike prevalence increases.

AB  - A typical challenge in studies on habitat selection is the creation of a global model at a population level. We focus upon an aspect frequently neglected in studies on habitat preferences - individual variability resulting from the ecological plasticity of a species. We studied European bison (wisent) Bison bonasus, inhabiting Bialowieska Forest (north-eastern Poland), using data from GPS collars fitted on 11 individuals observed during 12-48 months, and demonstrated that habitat selection patterns in this population are highly variable. Even seasonal changes in habitat preference did not mitigate individual variability - during the same months, particular individuals of the same sex preferred certain habitats which were avoided by others. Therefore, even with fuzzy analysis, it was not possible to create clear rules for predicting habitat preferences for a given individual; only general patterns can be specified for seasonal avoidance of some habitats, rather than their positive selection. Hence, flexibility in habitat selection should be considered in planning the reintroduction of this species into new sites because it could considerably enhance the assumed available spectrum of suitable habitats. Moreover, since the natural dispersion of animals is not limited to forest complexes, new challenges for conservation as well as new limiting factors resulting from social conflicts could appear which should be taken into account in conservation planning, especially in agricultural areas.

TI  - Genetic divergence and demography of pudu deer (Pudu puda) in five provinces of southern Chile, analyzed through latitudinal and longitudinal ranges
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Pudu deer (Pudu puda) is endemic to the temperate rainforests of Chile. Genetic studies at different geographic scales for this species are required to better determine the genetic divergence within and among populations and their demography across the distribution range. These data can provide unique insights into the species or population status for conservation plans and decision-makers. We analyzed the mtDNA control region (CR) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) sequences of pudu deer in five provinces of southern Chile located at different latitudinal locations (Cautin, Valdivia, Osorno, Llanquihue and Chiloe Island) and three geographic areas within the studied provinces, representative of different longitudinal sites (Andes range, Central Valley and Coastal Range), to understand their genetic divergence and demography. The haplotype (H) and nucleotide (Pi) diversities of CR and Cyt b ranged from 0.64286 to 0.98333 and from 0.00575 to 0.01022, respectively. CR diversity was significantly different among provinces, with Valdivia showing higher values than Llanquihue and Chiloe Island (H = 0.98333 vs. 0.64286-0.92727, P < 0.05). Cyt b variation also showed significant differences among provinces, particularly, among Cautin and Llanquihue (H = 1.000 vs. 0.222, P < 0.05). Genetic structuring among provinces was relatively high, as indicated by the F-ST index (F-ST = 0.41905). Clustering analysis indicated the presence of a distinctive cluster for Chiloe Island individuals. Fu's F-S and Tajima's D based on CR revealed significant, negative deviations from equilibrium for Chiloe Island (D =-1.65898), Valdivia (Fs =-7.75335) and Llanquihue (Fs =-3.93267), suggesting population expansion in these provinces. Analysis at the longitudinal range showed significant differences among areas based on Pi (P < 0.05), with the Andes range and Central Valley showing higher diversity than the Coastal Range. Neither population structuring (F-ST = 0.01360, P > 0.05) nor distinctive clusters in the longitudinal range were observed. Fu's Fs and Tajima's D were negative and significant for the Coastal Range based on CR (Fs =-6.64752, P < 0.001) and Cyt b (D =-1.74110, P < 0.05), suggesting the existence of population expansion. Our results suggest that pudu deer in the analyzed provinces is a genetically structured species, which could be associated with reduced panmixia among populations. The genetic divergence pattern and the population expansion recorded are likely to be associated with past processes of recolonization after Pleistocene glaciation events.

AB  - Interspecific ecological interactions are inherently context-dependent. They may vary in both magnitude and sign depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions, depicting a mutualism-antagonism continuum. However, how population abundances and the activity of interacting species modulate these interactions remains underexplored. Here, we chose the interaction between the Mediterranean palm Chamaerops humilis and the feral goat Capra hircus in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). We selected three study plots with low, intermediate and high intensities of goat activity where we characterized palm distribution, seed rain, seed predation and early palm recruitment during two consecutive years. Since goats can cause both costs (e.g. florivory) and benefits (e.g. seed dispersal) to C. humilis performance, we investigated the following three questions: 1) does the spatial distribution of adult palms vary depending on the intensity of goat activity? 2) Does the intensity of goat activity influence seed rain and its potential spatial association with adult palms? 3) To what extent does the intensity of goat activity determine post-dispersal events such as seed predation and seedling emergence? We found that adult palms showed a more clumped and complex distribution (double-cluster process) in plots with low and intermediate goat activity compared to that with high goat activity (simple-cluster process). In the low goat activity plot, dispersed seeds were spatially aggregated around adult palms, showing twice as much insect-seed predation and nearly three times lower seed germination success than those in the intermediate goat activity plot. Palm seed dispersal and recruitment were almost nil in the high goat activity plot due to heavy consumption of palm inflorescences and developing fruits by goats. Our findings demonstrate how the net outcome of plant-animal interactions can change from mutualism to antagonism, from reproductive service to reproductive collapse, depending on the abundance and the activity of the interacting species.

AB  - Introduction Strategically managing livestock grazing in arid regions optimizes land use and reduces the damage caused by overgrazing. Controlled grazing preserves the grassland ecosystem and fosters sustainability despite resource limitations. However, uneven resource distribution can lead to diverse grazing patterns and land degradation, particularly in undulating terrains.Methods In this study, we developed a herbivore foraging algorithm based on a resource selection function model to analyze foraging distribution patterns, predict the probability of foraging, and identify the determinants of foraging probability in cattle. The study area was a complex desert landscape encompassing dunes and interdunes. Data on cattle movements and resource distribution were collected and analyzed to model and predict foraging behavior.Results Our findings revealed that cattle prefer areas with abundant vegetation in proximity to water sources and avoid higher elevations. However, abundant resource availability mitigated these impacts and enhanced the role of water points, particularly during late grazing periods. The analysis showed that available resources primarily determine foraging distribution patterns and lessen the effects of landforms and water distance on patch foraging.Discussion The results suggest that thoughtful water source placement and the subdivision of pastures into areas with varied terrain are crucial for sustainable grazing management. By strategically managing these factors, land degradation can be minimized, and the ecological balance of grassland ecosystems can be maintained. Further research is needed to refine the model and explore its applicability in other arid regions.

AB  - The increasing quantities of organic residues are becoming one of the most important problems for climate change mitigation. Sustainable utilization technologies are required to minimize the effect of recycling on the environment. Nevertheless, treated residues should be part of the circular bioeconomy. One of the most promising processes is the biogas system, with the final products biogas and digestate, which contain valuable nutrients and are therefore suitable as agricultural fertilizers. However, there is lack of research data on the effectiveness of digestate on environmental factors including soil quality as well as crop productivity and quality. In this study, we compare the roles of different digestates (chicken manure digestate, cow manure digestate, and pig manure digestate) on spring wheat productivity, soil microbial activities, and greenhouse gas emissions in loam and sandy loam soil under controlled climate conditions. The liquid digestate applied was equivalent to 170 kg N ha(-1) of total N presented. Overall, results showed that the two soil types responded differently to the addition of the digestates, and the benefits depended on soil characteristics as well as on the type of the digestate applied. There was a higher effect on soil microbial activity in sandy loam soil compared to that of loam soil. Chicken manure digestate had the highest value of dehydrogenase activity and soil microbial biomass C of 9.23 mu g TPFg(-1) h(-1) and 175.6 mu g g(-1) across the two soil types. CO2 and N2O emissions were moderately higher in loam soil when compared to that of sandy loam soil. The highest CO2 peak emission at 0.0107 mu g ha(-1) h(-1) occurred in pig manure digestate in the sandy loam soil, and regular peak patterns observed in loam soil fertilized with pig digestate manure. Chicken manure digestate had the highest peak emissions across both soil types at 0.007950 mg ha(-1) h(-1) and 0.5667 mg ha(-1) h(-1) in the loam and sandy loam soil, respectively. The biomass yield varied across the soil types irrespective of the digestate applied. The agricultural benefits of digestates in different receiving soil ecosystems supplying essential nutrients for crop productivity, coupled with its environmental benefits, makes it an encouraging prospect in temperate climate zones.

AB  - The sea urchin Diadema africanum is an herbivore that has a significant influence on subtidal rocky reef communities on the Canary Islands, facilitating transitions between macroalgal beds and barren grounds. Barren grounds in the archipelago are characterized by a dominance of crustose coralline algae and a lack of invertebrates and fishes compared to macroalgal beds, which are mainly dominated by brown algae. To assess the impact of these benthic community states on the early life success of D. africanum, a manipulative study was conducted in September 2021 at four sites on the eastern coast of Tenerife Island, characterized by the availability of historical settlement rates and adult data for this species. For this purpose, experimental larval collectors modified with a hollow algae-container were employed to examine sea urchin settlement rates in response to two dominant algal species, Lobophora schneideri, in macroalgal beds and crustose coralline algae (CCA) in barren grounds. Statistical analysis revealed significant spatial differences in sea urchin settlement and the interaction between site and treatment response. Specifically, the site with higher sea urchin settlement exhibited lower numbers of D. africanum settlers in treatments containing L. schneideri than in the Control and CCA treatments. Three decapod species (the pistol shrimp Alpheus macrocheles, and the crabs Lophozozimus incisus, and Pachygrapsus marmoratus) negatively correlated with D. africanum settlers. These results suggest that larval supply, L. schneideri beds, and micropredator abundance play a role in the early life success of this species. This may imply a community stability mechanism that helps to prevent shifts between alternative stable states.

AB  - Tapirus terrestris is the largest land mammal in the Atlantic Forest and is vulnerable to extinction due to population declines in many parts of the biome. A population of the species occurs in the northern region of the State of Paran & aacute;, Brazil where forest fragmentation is extensive. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) with a binomial error structure, considering all potential predictors, to access information of forest habitat available to the species in 36 fragments, between 2015 and 2016. Camera traps were used to estimate the density of T. terrestris between November 2019 and March 2020, and spatial capture and recapture models to analyze the data. The results suggest that the lowland tapir is more likely to occur in fragments >100 hectares and in closely connected fragments. Density estimates ranged from 0.09 to 0.17 individuals/km2, lower than those found in most other parts of the Atlantic Forest, indicating that the study landscape provides a sub-optimal habitat for the species.

AB  - Locating clandestine graves presents significant challenges to law enforcement agencies, necessitating the testing of grave detection techniques. This experimental study, conducted under Australian field conditions, assesses the effectiveness of time-lapse ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in detecting pig burials as simulated forensic cases. The research addresses two key questions: (1) observability of graves using GPR and ERT, and (2) changes in geophysical responses with reference to changing climatic conditions. The principal novelty of this research is its Australian focus-this is the first time-lapse GPR and ERT study used to locate clandestine graves in Australia. The results reveal that both GPR and ERT can detect graves; however, ERT demonstrates greater suitability in homogeneous soil and anomalously wet climate conditions, with the detectability affected by grave depth. This project also found that resistivity values are likely influenced by soil moisture and decomposition fluids; however, these parameters were not directly measured in this study. Contrastingly, although GPR successfully achieved 2 m penetration in each survey, the site's undeveloped soil likely resulted in inconsistent detectability. The findings underscore the significance of site-specific factors when employing GPR and/or ERT for grave detection, including soil homogeneity, climate conditions, water percolation, and body decomposition state. These findings offer practical insights into each technique's utility as a search tool for missing persons, aiding law enforcement agencies with homicide cases involving covert graves.

AB  - We used linear inverse ecosystem modeling techniques to assimilate data from extensive Lagrangian field experiments into a mass-balance constrained food web for the Gulf of Mexico open-ocean ecosystem. This region is highly oligotrophic, yet Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) travel long distances from feeding grounds in the North Atlantic to spawn there. Our results show extensive nutrient regeneration fueling primary productivity (mostly by cyanobacteria and other picophytoplankton) in the upper euphotic zone. The food web is dominated by the microbial loop (>70% of net primary productivity is respired by heterotrophic bacteria and protists that feed on them). By contrast, herbivorous food web pathways from phytoplankton to metazoan zooplankton process <10% of the net primary production in the mixed layer. Nevertheless, ABT larvae feed preferentially on podonid cladocerans and other suspension-feeding zooplankton, which in turn derive much of their nutrition from nano- and micro-phytoplankton (mixotrophic flagellates, and to a lesser extent, diatoms). This allows ABT larvae to maintain a comparatively low trophic level (similar to 4.2 for preflexion and postflexion larvae), which increases trophic transfer from phytoplankton to larval fish.

AB  - Aim: Climate change has precipitated loss of kelp in temperate regions globally, with further losses projected in response to ocean warming. Projected climate-driven changes to kelp are commonly derived from responses to sea surface temperature and neglect the effects of important ecological interactions, such as herbivory. Here, we use a stacked species distribution model to project impacts of future climate scenarios on kelp distribution and biomass incorporating the effects of key ecological interactions.
   Location: The eastern Australian coastline (28.0-37.5 degrees S).
   Methods: A stacked species distribution model, incorporating ecological interactions with urchins, was used to project future effects of climate change on kelp. This model incorporated key drivers of kelp occurrence and cover (habitat availability, light and in situ temperatures) that are rarely considered when projecting the effects of climate change on kelp.
   Results: Consistent with previous research, we find range contractions of kelp (similar to 275 km) at lower latitudes (<32 degrees S), due to ocean warming under RCP 8.5 (similar to 3.4 degrees C) by 2100. However, in contrast to previous studies, we find range contractions will not occur under RCP 2.6 (similar to 0.8 degrees C), and only moderate contractions are projected (similar to 55 km) under RCP 6.0 (similar to 2.3 degrees C). Instead, vertical migration of kelp, from shallow areas to cooler deep water refugia, is likely under future change. Interestingly, range contractions at lower latitudes are projected to be offset by increased kelp biomass at higher latitudes (32-37.5 degrees S) resulting from reductions in urchin herbivory. Consequently, a net gain in kelp biomass is projected for mainland eastern Australia by 2100 under RCPs 2.6 and 6.0 (up to 29.4%), while relatively small net losses are projected under RCP 8.5 (-3.5%).
   Main conclusions: Considering key ecological interactions when developing species distribution models can significantly change projections of habitat loss and must be integrated into assessments to accurately evaluate future change and enable evidence-based management.

AB  - Biological data collection is entering a new era. Community science, satellite remote sensing (SRS), and local forms of remote sensing (e.g., camera traps and acoustic recordings) have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales and resolution. There is growing interest in developing observation networks to collect and synthesize data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but no examples of such networks have emerged to inform decision-making by agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin, which links synoptic environmental data derived from SRS to biodiversity observations collected continuously from a trail camera network to support management decision-making. We use several examples to illustrate that Snapshot Wisconsin improves the spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent of information available to support management, filling gaps associated with traditional monitoring and enabling consideration of new management strategies. JONs like Snapshot Wisconsin further strengthen monitoring inference by contributing novel lines of evidence useful for corroboration or integration. SRS provides environmental context that facilitates inference, prediction, and forecasting, and ultimately helps managers formulate, test, and refine conceptual models for the monitored systems. Although these approaches pose challenges, Snapshot Wisconsin demonstrates that expansive observation networks can be tractably managed by agencies to support decision making, providing a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making.

AB  - Context Identifying how animals select habitat while navigating landscapes is important for understanding behavioral ecology and guiding management and conservation decisions. However, habitat selection may be spatially and temporally plastic, making it challenging to quantify how species use resources across space and time.Objectives We investigated how landscape context and dispersal shape habitat selection at multiple spatial scales in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).Methods Using step-selection functions, we quantified habitat selection of landcover and topographic covariates at three spatial scales for juvenile males during three movement periods (before, during, after dispersal) in two regions of Missouri, USA-a fragmented, low forest cover region with rolling hills, and a forested, topographically variable region.Results Although selection for forest cover increased after dispersal in both regions, deer selected forest cover at smaller spatial scales in the fragmented, low forest cover region. This result indicates scale of selection was dependent on forest availability and configuration with deer likely perceiving landscapes differently across their distribution. Functional responses to topography differed in magnitude and direction between regions with deer avoiding roads and selecting valleys in the rolling hills region (especially during dispersal) while showing no response to roads and selecting for ridgelines (during dispersal) in the topographically variable region. This result suggests movement behavior is strongly dependent on topography.Conclusions Although deer may select similar habitats among regions, landscape context and movement period shape the scale, strength, and direction of selection. This result has important implications for how animals use landscapes across different regional contexts.

AB  - Variation in individual demographic rates can have large consequences for populations. Female reproductive skew is an example of structured demographic heterogeneity where females have intrinsic qualities that make them more or less likely to breed. The consequences of reproductive skew for population dynamics are poorly understood in non-cooperatively breeding mammals, especially when coupled with other drivers such as poaching. We address this knowledge gap with population viability analyses using an age-specific, female-only, individual-based, stochastic population model built with long-term data for three Kenyan populations of the Critically Endangered eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli). There was substantial reproductive skew, with a high proportion of females not breeding or doing so at very low rates. This had a large impact on the projected population growth rate for the smaller population on Ol Jogi. Moreover, including female reproductive skew exacerbates the effects of poaching, increasing the probability of extinction by approximately 70% under a simulated poaching pressure of 5% offtake per year. Tackling the effects of reproductive skew depends on whether it is mediated by habitat or social factors, with potential strategies including habitat and biological management respectively. Investigating and tackling reproductive skew in other species requires long-term, individual-level data collection.

AB  - Goats are globally invaluable ruminants that balance food security and environmental impacts, and their commensal microbiome residing in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is associated with animal health and productivity. However, the reference genomes and functional repertoires of GIT microbes in goat kids have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we performed a comprehensive landscape survey of the GIT microbiome of goat kids using metagenomic sequencing and binning, spanning a dense sampling regime covering three gastrointestinal compartments spatially and five developmental ages temporally. We recovered 1002 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (termed the goat kid GIT microbial catalog [GKGMC]), 618 of which were novel. They encode more than 2.3 million nonredundant proteins, and represent a variety of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes and metabolic gene clusters. The GKGMC-enriched microbial taxa, particularly Sodaliphilus, expanded the microbial tree of life in goat kids. Using this GKGMC, we first deciphered the prevalence of fiber-degrading bacteria for carbohydrate decomposition in the rumen and colon, while the ileal microbiota specialized in the uptake and conversion of simple sugars. Moreover, GIT microorganisms were rapidly assembled after birth, and their carbohydrate metabolic adaptation occurred in three phases of progression. Finally, phytobiotics modified the metabolic cascades of the ileal microbiome, underpinned by the enrichment of Sharpea azabuensis and Olsenella spp. implicated in lactate formation and utilization. This GKGMC reference provides novel insights into the early-life microbial developmental dynamics in distinct compartments, and offers expanded resources for GIT microbiota-related research in goat kids.

AB  - The woodlands in arid regions are considered very important ecosystems that provide various ecological and economic services. The sustainable management programs for this ecosystem, such as mistletoe interventions relies on integrating socio-cultural valuations of ecosystem services with ecological assessments. However, limited research has been conducted on community perceptions of mistletoe management. This study aims to determine the perceptions of the community in the AlUla county, Saudi Arabia, regarding the effect of mistletoe (Plicosepalus acaciae) on Vachellia woodlands and the current status of management practices, implemented and suggested for co-management with relevant authorities. An analytical framework was designed to analyze community-based management across three main areas: perception of mistletoe, the extent of its spread, and approaches to its management. Through a combination of field observations, tree surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions, the study offers valuable insights into the effects of mistletoe and management strategies. The empirical findings reveal that the local community has a stronger perception of mistletoe's adverse effects on trees, infection levels in wadis (valleys), and its transmission between trees compared to pastoralists. Most of the local community has observed mistletoe for 15-20 years, confirming the infection's progression over time. The study findings also revealed that, historically, the community has managed mistletoe in different ways, including feeding it to camels, using it in traditional medicine, and harvesting it for therapeutic purposes. The community has offered promising suggestions to enhance mistletoe control efforts, such as collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to develop business plans for mistletoe collection, conducting experiments to evaluate its potential as animal feed, and providing incentives to encourage mechanical control methods. A deeper understanding of community perceptions offers valuable insights for policymakers in decision-making and the design of collaborative mistletoe management plans.

AB  - Ticks are the haematophagous arthropods; their prevalence in various areas of Pakistan is associated with huge economic and health losses. In this perspective 6469 tick specimens were collected from goats and sheep breeds of the Hazara Division and identified into seven species on morphometrics basis, in which four species were recorded new to this area. Out of identified seven species, four tick species Rhipicephalus microplus, Hyalomma rufipes, Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides, Haemaphysalis bispinosa were identified from goats and three species Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma excavatum, Rhipicephalus microplus from sheep. Goat breed wise infestation rate was recorded in Kaghani, Kamori, Sindhi, Lehri, Barbari, Beetal and Dera Din Panah. In sheep breeds infestation rate was recorded in Gauder, Balkhi Afghani and Rambouillet. On basis of ITS2 gene and 16SrRNA phylogenetic analysis of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides and Rhipicephalus microplus showed similarity with already reported species in neighbor countries of study area. Number of tick specimens and infestation rate shows direct correlation with temperature but it shows fluctuation with humidity. Current study will be helpful in tick's controlling strategies, goats and sheep breed selection and future research in this area.

AB  - Populations of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), a megaherbivore that maintains distinct areas of seagrass via cultivation grazing, are recovering worldwide. Evaluating seagrass regrowth dynamics in grazed areas following prolonged, known durations of herbivory is challenging in situ, but is critical to understand ecosystem function as meadows return to a natural grazed state. Based on a 27-month study in a subtropical Caribbean seagrass meadow (The Bahamas; 23.46 degrees N, 76.06 degrees W), we evaluate Thalassia testudinum regrowth dynamics over 11 months following two durations of simulated green turtle grazing (11 and 16 months; 11clip and 16clip, respectively). By the end of the clipping treatments, simulated grazing had induced significant changes in most T. testudinum leaf morphology and nutrient variables in clipped plots compared to reference plots, while belowground biomass and nutrient content were unaffected. However, most leaf variables in clipped plots returned to levels comparable to reference plots by 6.5 months after the cessation of clipping, with the exception of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf width. The effects of grazing duration on regrowth in clipped treatments were evident in 11clip and 16clip plots. In 11clip plots, LAI increased to reference plot levels within 6.5 months after cessation of clipping, while leaves did not rewiden until 11 months post-clipping. However, LAI in 16clip plots did not reach reference plot levels until 11 months post-clipping, and leaves remained significantly narrow throughout the experiment. These regrowth patterns indicate the capacity of T. testudinum to rebound following prolonged, repetitive cropping of leaf biomass by green turtles, and that decreased leaf width and LAI after cessation of grazing may be a lingering effect of shifts in plant growth allocation in grazed systems. This study provides a valuable contribution to understand the effects of cultivation grazing and grazing duration on T. testudinum regrowth dynamics and tolerance to herbivory.

AB  - Southeast Europe has played an important role in shaping the genetic diversity of sheep due to its proximity to the Danubian route of transport from the Near East into Europe, as well as its possible role as a post-domestication migration network and long tradition of sheep breeding. The history of Romania and, in particular, the historical province of Dobruja, located on the shore of the Black Sea, has been influenced by its geographical position at the intersection between the great powers of the Near East and mainland Europe, with the Middle Ages being an especially animated time in terms of trade, migration, and conflict. In this study, we analyzed the mitochondrial control region of five sheep originating from the Capidava archaeological site (Dobruja, Southeast Romania), radiocarbon dated to the Early Middle Ages (5-10th century AD), in order to better understand the genetic diversity of local sheep populations and human practices in relation to this particular livestock species. The analyses illustrate high haplotype diversity in local medieval sheep, as well as possible genetic continuity in the region. A higher tendency for North to South interaction, rather than East to West, is apparent, together with a lack of interaction along the Asian route. Continuous interaction between the First Bulgarian Empire, which occupied Dobruja starting with the 7th century AD, and the Byzantine Empire is indicated. These results might suggest expanding trade in Southeast Romania in the Early Middle Ages.

AB  - Epilithic algae dominate cover on coral reefs globally, forming a critical ecological interface between the benthos and reef organisms. Yet, the drivers of epilithic algal composition, and how composition relates to the distribution of key taxa, remain unclear. We develop a novel metric, the Epilithic Algal Ratio, based on turf cover relative to total epilithic algae cover, and use this metric to assess cross-scale patterns. We reveal water quality and hydrodynamics as the key environmental drivers of the Epilithic Algal Ratio across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and reefs globally. On the GBR, the abundance of herbivorous fishes and juvenile corals were also related to the Epilithic Algal Ratio, suggesting that reefs with long-dense turfs support fewer herbivores and corals. Ultimately, epilithic algae represent the interface through which the effects of declining water quality, which impacts a third of reefs globally, can reverberate up through coral reefs, compromising their functioning.

AB  - Trade-offs between food acquisition and predator avoidance shape the landscape-scale movements of herbivores. These movements create landscape features, such as game trails, which are paths that animals use repeatedly to traverse the landscape. As such, these trails integrate behavioral trade-offs over space and time. Here, we used remotely sensed imagery to analyze the density of game trails with spatial environmental variables to understand landscape-scale patterns of herbivore habitat use in an African savanna. Woody plant cover was the best predictor of game trail density, with the highest densities correlating with intermediate woody plant cover. We also explored how patterns of game trail density compared to two known measures of herbivore habitat use (i.e., dung counts and maximum entropy modeling) and found strong quantitative fits. To understand the patterns revealed by the density of game trails, we explored the trade-off between food acquisition and perceived predation risk across a woody plant cover gradient. Using behavioral observations, we found that the relationship between woody plant cover and the distribution of game trails was likely driven by the risk and reward trade-off, with less vigilance and more feeding occurring in areas with a high density of game trails and intermediate woody cover. Ultimately, we show that game trails are a novel data source that can be used to identify broadly-occurring patterns of herbivore habitat use over large spatial scales.

AB  - Soil is a living and dynamic body, which is prone to degradation under conventional agricultural practices. Healthy soil is one of the most important pillars of sustainability as it delivers several ecosystem services along with its control on microbial activity, nutrient recycling, and decomposition. Nature-based solutions can play an important role in restoring soil quality for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. This article discusses various nature-based options available for improving soil quality. Indigenous practices such as sheep penning, tank silt application, green manuring, and refuse from croplands and households have the potential to restore and maintain soil fertility. Biofertilizers can add nutrients (N fixers), fixe up to 300 kg N ha through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and facilitate (nutrient solubilizer and mobilizers) nutrient availability in the soil. Biochar, a commonly used product, can increase soil moisture availability by 8%-10% and aids in mitigating climate change through C-sequestration. Biochar may have a climate change mitigation potential of 1.8 Pg CO2-C equivalent per year. When added to the soil, it not only acts as a nutrient source; but also acts as a soil amendment. Biogas slurry, the effluent from biogas reactors, contains various nutrient elements that can enrich soil fertility. The holistic approach in a farming system, through integration of different enterprises, reduces dependence on off-farm resources. Soil management through nature-based options will maintain crop productivity and sustainability in the long run without any adverse effects on the environment.

AB  - DNA obtained from invertebrates (iDNA) can be metabarcoded in order to survey vertebrate communities. However, little attention has been paid to the interaction between the invertebrate and vertebrate species. Here, we tested for specialization by sampling the dung and carrion fly community of a swamp forest remnant along a disturbance gradient (10 sites: 80-310 m from a road). Approximately, 60% of the baited 407 flies yielded 294 vertebrate identifications based on two COI fragments and 16S. A bipartite network analysis found no statistically significant specialization in the interactions between fly and vertebrate species, but uncommon fly species can carry the signal for vertebrate species that are otherwise difficult to detect with iDNA. A spatial analysis revealed that most of the 20 vertebrate species reported in this study could be detected within 150 m of the road (18 spp.) and that the fly community sourced for iDNA was unexpectedly rich (24 species, 3 families). They carried DNA for rare and common species inhabiting different layers of the forest (ground-dwelling: wild boar, Sunda pangolin, skinks, rats; arboreal: long-tailed macaque, Raffles' banded langur; flying: pin-striped tit-babbler, olive-winged bulbul). All our results were obtained with a new, greatly simplified iDNA protocol that eliminates DNA extraction by obtaining template directly through dissolving fly faeces and regurgitates with water. Lastly, we show that MinION- and Illumina-based metabarcoding yield similar results. We conclude by urging more studies that use different baits and involve experiments that are capable of revealing the dispersal capabilities of the flies carrying the iDNA.

AB  - The decline of white-backed vultures Gyps africanus (hereafter termed vultures) across Africa highlights the need to understand their habitat and nesting requirements, especially in protected areas where African elephants Loxodonta africana can impact the trees in which vultures build their nests. Our study aimed to assess the impact that elephants have on trees containing vulture nests in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) of South Africa's savanna system through three separate but interlinked assessments. We first assessed the tree species used by vultures for nesting and compared their size and elephant impact scores between riparian and woodland habitats. We assessed how elephant presence or absence affects the size of Senegalia nigrescens, a key tree species, and compared vulture nests in an adjacent elephant-free area. Lastly, we modeled environmental factors influencing vulture nest and tree persistence using data from 2008-2020. Vultures utilised 10 tree species, with riparian trees supporting nests being significantly taller, with larger DBHs, and experienced lower elephant impact compared to woodland trees, which were more heavily impacted by elephants. Less robust species like S. nigrescens were more vulnerable to elephant damage, primarily bark-stripping, and less likely to host vulture nests. Our results show that vultures prefer the largest, least impacted trees for nesting, favouring those with greater stability and longevity. We suggest that although elephants influence the overall height range of trees to vultures, strong gusts of wind have a strong negative contribution on vulture nest persistence and that only a relatively small number of trees died during the 12-year study in comparison to fallen nests. We recommend further research into elephant impact thresholds on trees and vulture nest selection. Monitoring treefall and regeneration rates will help predict when vultures may face a shortage of suitable nesting trees.

AB  - The application of manure in agriculture caused the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in soil environments. However, the co-occurrence pattern and host diversity of ARGs and MGEs in soils amended with animal and green manures remains unclear. In this study, metagenomic assembly and binning techniques were employed to comprehensively explore the effects of sheep manure and green manure on soil microbiome, antibiotic resistomes, and ARG hosts. Both rapeseed cake manure and sheep manure increased the abundance and diversity of ARGs, with sheep manure particularly enhancing the abundance of ARGs conferring resistant to multidrug, quinolone, rifampicin, and macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin (MLSB). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids, transposases, and integrases, preferentially enhanced the potential mobility of some ARGs subtypes (i.e. sul2, aadA, qacH, and folp), facilitating the spread of ARGs. Additionally, sheep manure reshaped the bacterial community structure and composition as well as ARG hosts, some opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pantoea) acquired antibiotic resistance and remained recalcitrant. It is concluded that rapeseed cake manure and sheep manure increased the co-occurrence of ARGs and MGEs, enriched the potential ARG hosts, and promoted the dissemination of ARGs in agricultural soils.

AB  - The grazing grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is highly impacted by seasonal temperature variations. During the long cold season, the biomass and nutrient contents of forage grass do not meet the nutritional needs of grazing livestock and seriously affect growth performance and livestock products. This study investigated different feeding strategies on growth performance, meat quality and rumen fungal community of Tibetan sheep in the winter. Twelve one-year-old healthy castrated Tibetan sheep with similar initial body weights were randomly grouped into traditional grazing (TG) and barn feeding (BF) groups. The TG sheep were labelled and grazed on the local cool-season pasture without feed supplementing, while BF sheep were fed a mixed diet in feeding shed. Compared with the TG group, significantly increased body weight and average daily weight gain (ADG) were observed in the BF group (p < 0.001), which resulted in a significant increase in the hot carcase weight, net meat weight, carcase rate and net meat rate (p < 0.01). Moreover, the longissimus dorsi muscle of the BF group showed significantly increased muscle fibre diameter, perimeter, and area and increased crude protein and ether extract contents (p < 0.01), while the meat tenderness and amino acid content were reduced. ITS high-throughput sequencing showed that Ascomycota was the predominant fungal phylum in the rumen of Tibetan sheep. At the genus level, the rumen of TG sheep presented higher proportions of Preussia, Anaeromyces and Pilidium, while the most abundant genera in the BF sheep were Penicillium, Acaulium and Vishniacozyma. In summary, BF strategy enhanced the relative abundance of several dominant fungal genera related to the nutrient absorption and metabolism capacity, and effectively improves the growth and slaughter performance and affects meat quality of Tibetan sheep in the winter.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the genetic structure and genetic diversity of two Bulgarian sheep breeds. A total of 41 individuals from a modern Bulgarian sheep population (Rhodopean Tsigai, RT) and 46 representatives of a local Bulgarian sheep population (Middle Rhodopean Sheep, MRS) were investigated based on 12 STR (short tandem repeat, also known as microsatellite) markers. In total, 121 alleles were found in the two populations using 12 microsatellite loci. The mean number of alleles, the effective number of alleles, and the polymorphism information content (PIC) values per loci were 10.08, 4.96, and 0.73, respectively. When comparing the allelic diversity across the populations, the highest Na was observed in the MRS breed (10.58 +/- 0.87), while the value of this parameter in the RT breed was 9.58 +/- 0.71. The largest genetic diversity was found at locus INRA005 with 14.5 alleles and the smallest polymorphism was noted for locus ETH152 with 5.5 alleles. The level of observed heterozygosity was in the range of 0.60 to 0.860. The expected heterozygosity level range was 0.62 to 0.87. When 12 microsatellite loci were compared, the INRA005 locus showed the highest level of genetic variability. Using Nei's standard genetic distance, the observed genetic distance between the RT and MRS breeds was 0.103. Both sheep breeds demonstrated mixed genetic profiles based on the studied microsatellite markers. The clustering obtained by STRUCTURE analysis showed that the MRS breed is a more homogenous population, whereas the RT breed is more heterogenous.

AB  - Biological control is a major ecosystem service provided by pest natural enemies, even in densely populated areas where the use of pesticides poses severe risks to human and environmental health. However, the impact of urbanization on this service and the abundance patterns of relevant functional groups of arthropods (herbivores, predators, and parasitoids) remain contested. Here, we synthesize current evidence through three hierarchical meta-analyses and show that advancing urbanization leads to outbreaks of sap-feeding insects, declining numbers of predators with low dispersal abilities, and weakened overall biological pest control delivered by arthropods. Our results suggest that sedentary predators may have the potential to effectively regulate sap-feeders, that are one of the most important pests in urban environments. A well-connected network of structurally diverse and rich green spaces with less intensive management practices is needed to promote natural plant protection in urban landscapes and sustainable cities.

AB  - The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a large semi-aquatic rodent with a broad distribution across South America. Although it is a relatively common and well-known species, there are few studies on its evolutionary history. Consequently, we decided to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of capybaras, including new populations from its southern distribution range, by using a 226 bp fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop region. We found 16 haplotypes and populations, with moderate levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity. In addition, the genetic structure analyses suggested high genetic divergence among populations, mainly among Pampean and Chacoan populations. We also found a consistent phylogeographical pattern with the distribution of main rivers. In agreement with palaeontological data, we propose two colonization pathways towards the south driven by main basins: Parana-Paraguay and Uruguay-Atlantic.
   El carpincho (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) es un roedor grande, semiacuatico con una amplia distribucion en toda America del Sur. A pesar de ser una especie relativamente comun y conocida, hay pocos estudios sobre su historia evolutiva. En consecuencia, nos propusimos investigar la diversidad genetica, la estructura poblacional y la historia demografica de los carpinchos, incluyendo nuevas poblaciones de su rango de distribucion meridional, utilizando un fragmento de 226 bp de la region mitocondrial del D-loop. Se encontraron 16 haplotipos, las poblaciones mostraron niveles moderados de diversidad tanto haplotipica como nucleotidica. Ademas, los analisis de la estructura genetica sugieren una alta divergencia genetica entre las poblaciones, principalmente entre las poblaciones Pampeana y Chaquena. Tambien encontramos un patron filogeografico consistente con la distribucion de los principales rios. De acuerdo con los datos paleontologicos, proponemos dos vias de colonizacion hacia el sur impulsadas por las principales cuencas: Parana-Paraguay y Uruguay-Atlantico.

AB  - Biological invasions are key drivers of global ecological change, often involving complex interactions between dispersal, establishment, and local adaptation. Chinook salmon, native to the North Pacific, is an invasive exotic species in Patagonia that causes significant ecological impacts. To contribute to the understanding of invasion mechanisms, we used 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios to assess natal origin areas and describe migration routes in the Santa Cruz River Basin (Argentina). Water 87Sr/86Sr was measured at 22 monitoring stations during both peak-flow and base-flow seasons to evaluate spatial and seasonal variation. The base-flow dataset revealed four distinct isotopic clusters, showing 100% classification accuracy. Spawning-condition fish were captured in two tributary rivers that serve as spawning areas in the upper basin-the Guanaco and De las Vueltas rivers-and their natal origin was assigned by contrasting otolith core 87Sr/86Sr ratio with the water-based isotopic baseline using maximum-likelihood estimation. All fish captured at the Guanaco River spawning site were assigned to the local cluster, while fish from the De las Vueltas originated from three distinct clusters, suggesting greater natal dispersal. Otolith profiles revealed two divergent migratory patterns between spawning areas, with individuals varying in their residence time between nursery areas and the migratory corridor. These findings demonstrate that 87Sr/86Sr ratios are effective for reconstructing natal origin and migratory history in recently colonized systems. More broadly, they offer insight into key invasion processes-such as natal fidelity, early dispersal, and life-history plasticity-that drive the establishment and spread of non-native species.

AB  - Environmental impacts of conventional agriculture have generated interest in sustainable agriculture. Biological pest control is a fundamental tool, and ants are key players providing ecological services, as well as some disservices. We have used a meta-analytical approach to investigate the contribution of ants to biological control, considering their effects on pest and natural enemy abundance, plant damage and crop yield. We also evaluated whether the effects of ants are modulated by traits of ants, pests and other natural enemies, as well as by field size, crop system and experiment duration. Overall (considering all meta-analyses), from 52 studies on 17 different crops, we found that ants decrease the abundance of non-honeydew-producing pests, decrease plant damage and increase crop yield (services). In addition, ants decrease the abundance of natural enemies, mainly the generalist ones, and increase honeydew-producing pest abundance (disservices). We show that the pest control and plant protection provided by ants are boosted in shaded crops compared to monocultures. Furthermore, ants increase crop yield in shaded crops, and this effect increases with time. Finally, we bring new insights such as the importance of shaded crops to ant services, providing a good tool for farmers and stakeholders considering sustainable farming practices.

AB  - Hunting is a method commonly used in several European countries to reduce crop damages by wild boar Sus scrofa. However, results are still controversial and poorly treated. Using data on official claims (i.e., damages to crops) and wild boar local counts and hunting bags collected from 2019 to 2022, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the hunting system (divided into eradication and non-eradication areas) carried out in the north-east of Italy on the number of agricultural damages. The spatio-temporal distribution of wild boar hunting, density and damages as well as the effect of hunting, were evaluated through the hotspot analysis and the zero-inflated models, respectively. The results obtained revealed no clear spatial overlap among wild boar hunting, wild boar density and damages to agriculture in both the eradication and non-eradication areas. Moreover, the current level of harvesting did not significantly affect the number of agricultural damages. A multifaceted approach focused on the numeric control of the species based on accurate local counts and oriented towards more age classes in a similar percentage should be preferred to mitigate damages to cultivars.

AB  - Many studies have examined the performance of stump sprouts across variables such as tree diameter, light availability, and site quality. However, most of these studies created large openings following even-aged silviculture, which is not typically employed in small woodlots typical of the Midwest United States. To address this, we evaluated sprouting performance after felling stems of six common midstory species, simulating a midstory removal treatment. We created 510 stumps across nine sites in Indiana and measured the probability of stumps sprouting, sprout density, and the height of the tallest sprout after 1 year following cutting for hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.), red maple and sugar maple (Acer rubrum L. and A. saccharum Marsh., respectively), northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), sassafras (Sassafras albidum Nutt.), and white ash (Fraxinus Americana L.). We observed that hackberry, northern red oak, red maple, and white ash stumps sprouted prolifically, but sugar maple and sassafras stumps did not. Furthermore, we found that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory depressed sprout heights, whereas the effects of diameter and light availability were variable. Our results suggest that midstory removals may result in vigorous sprouting; thus, follow-up treatments such an herbicide may be needed to reduce competition. Study Implications: Midstory removals are part of a shelterwood sequence used to established advance regeneration prior to a larger overstory harvest. We found that midstory removals resulted in a strong sprouting response by hackberry, red maple, and white ash, which are often less desired species in eastern deciduous forests where management goals generally focus on oak regeneration. Thus, follow-up treatments (e.g., herbicide) might be needed to reduce competition from these species. Furthermore, our results suggest that stumps from midstory stems may sprout vigorously enough be a significant source of reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary For monocot herbs growing in the understory of wet tropical forests face an extreme hazard in falling branches and debris from the canopy. We compared the response of two species of understory herbs to two other species of herbs growing at the forest edge or in large gaps. We made the prediction that the forest edge herb species would be better able to compensate for damage because of compensatory growth made possible in the higher light environment than that experienced by the shade-tolerant understory herbs. Our experimental studies showed that both groups of species were tolerant of defoliation under high and intermediate light conditions, but under low light growth conditions the forest edge species showed higher mortality. This finding suggests that a variety of functional growth traits may be structuring post-damage response in understory and forest edge herbs. Defoliation from falling branches is a major factor in the survival of understory herbs in tropical rainforests. Experimental studies of defoliation under three levels of light environment compared responses to partial and total defoliation in four species of tropical rainforest understory herbs. We predicted that elevated levels of light availability would help compensate for damage to through compensatory growth in both understory and forest edge species and that forest edge species would more effectively compensate under high light conditions than shade-tolerant species from the forest understory All species showed a high tolerance to defoliation under high and intermediate light conditions. Under low-light conditions survival differed dramatically with minimal mortality in forest-edge species compared to high mortality in completely defoliated understory species. Defoliation, and light x defoliation interactions, impacted multiple growth traits in understory species. In contrast, forest-edge species showed no effect of defoliation except on total biomass, and only one light x defoliation interaction was observed. Our results indicate that differences in biomass allocation, leaf ecophysiology, and other growth parameters between forest understory and edge species may be structuring post-damage response in understory and forest edge herbs.

AB  - The endangerment mechanisms of various species are a focus of studies on biodiversity and conservation biology. Hipposideros pomona is an endangered species, but the reasons behind its endangerment remain unclear. We investigated the endangerment mechanisms of H. pomona using mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, and microsatellite loci markers. The results showed that the nucleotide diversity of mitochondria DNA and heterozygosity of microsatellite markers were high (pi = 0.04615, HO = 0.7115), whereas the nucleotide diversity of the nuclear genes was low (THY: pi = 0.00508, SORBS2: pi = 0.00677, ACOX2: pi = 0.00462, COPS7A: pi = 0.00679). The phylogenetic tree and median-joining network based on mitochondrial DNA sequences clustered the species into three clades, namely North Vietnam-Fujian, Myanmar-West Yunnan, and Laos-Hainan clades. However, joint analysis of nuclear genes did not exhibit clustering. Analysis of molecular variance revealed a strong population genetic structure; IMa2 analysis did not reveal significant gene flow between all groups (p > .05), and isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances (p < .05). The mismatch distribution analysis, neutral test, and Bayesian skyline plots revealed that the H. pomona population were relatively stable and exhibited a contraction trend. The results implied that H. pomona exhibits female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. The Hengduan Mountains could have acted as a geographical barrier for gene flow between the North Vietnam-Fujian clade and the Myanmar-West Yunnan clade, whereas the Qiongzhou Strait may have limited interaction between the Hainan populations and other clades. The warm climate during the second interglacial Quaternary period (c. 0.33 Mya) could have been responsible for species differentiation, whereas the cold climate during the late Quaternary last glacial maximum (c. 10 ka BP) might have caused the overall contraction of species. The lack of significant gene flow in nuclear microsatellite loci markers among the different populations investigated reflects recent habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities; thus, on-site conservation of the species and restoration of gene flow corridors among populations need immediate implementation.

AB  - Land abandonment is a major global change driver in the Mediterranean region, where anthropic activity has played an important role in shaping landscape configuration. Understanding the woodland expansion towards abandoned croplands is critical to develop effective management strategies. In this study, we analyze the colonization pattern of abandoned croplands by Quercus pyrenaica in the Sierra Nevada mountain range (southern Spain). We aimed to assess differences among populations within the rear edge of the Q. pyrenaica distribution. For this purpose, we characterized (i) the colonization pattern of Q. pyrenaica, (ii) the structure of the seed source (surrounding forests), and (iii) the abundance of the main seed disperser (Eurasian jay, Garrulus glandarius). The study was conducted in five abandoned croplands located in two representative populations of Q. pyrenaica located on contrasting slopes. Vegetation plots within three habitat types (mature forest, edge-forest and abandoned cropland) were established to compute the abundance of oak juveniles. The abundance of European jay was determined using data of bird censuses (covering 7 years). Our results indicate that a natural recolonization of abandoned croplands by Q. pyrenaica is occurring in the rear edge of the distribution of this oak species. Oak juvenile abundance varied between study sites. Neither the surrounding-forest structure nor the abundance of jays varied significantly between study sites. The differences in the recolonization patterns seem to be related to differences in the previous- and post-abandonment management.

AB  - Interactions among fungi and insects involve hundreds of thousands of species. While insect communities on plants have formed some of the classic model systems in ecology, fungus-based communities and the forces structuring them remain poorly studied by comparison. We characterize the arthropod communities associated with fruiting bodies of eight mycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus species from three different orders along a 1200-km latitudinal gradient in northern Europe. We hypothesized that, matching the pattern seen for most insect taxa on plants, we would observe a general decrease in fungal-associated species with latitude. Against this backdrop, we expected local communities to be structured by host identity and phylogeny, with more closely related fungal species sharing more similar communities of associated organisms. As a more unique dimension added by the ephemeral nature of fungal fruiting bodies, we expected further imprints generated by successional change, with younger fruiting bodies harboring communities different from older ones. Using DNA metabarcoding to identify arthropod communities from fungal fruiting bodies, we found that latitude left a clear imprint on fungus-associated arthropod community composition, with host phylogeny and decay stage of fruiting bodies leaving lesser but still-detectable effects. The main latitudinal imprint was on a high arthropod species turnover, with no detectable pattern in overall species richness. Overall, these findings paint a new picture of the drivers of fungus-associated arthropod communities, suggesting that latitude will not affect how many arthropod species inhabit a fruiting body but, rather, what species will occur in it and at what relative abundances (as measured by sequence read counts). These patterns upset simplistic predictions regarding latitudinal gradients in species richness and in the strength of biotic interactions.

AB  - For decades, the hunting community has used solunar charts to predict activity to predict increased animal activity during daily lunar events (i.e., moonrise, moonset, moon underfoot, and moon overhead) and as the moon approaches a new or full phase, based on gravitational pull. Solunar charts are used by the general public, but research on the accuracy of these charts is limited. Our objective was to examine activity patterns, based on distance between location fixes, of male Deer in relation to the day-rating system used in solunar charts. In December-February of 2009 through 2011, we examined activity patterns of 22 GPS-collared adult male Deer at a high-fenced property in Alabama in relation to a solunar-chart rating system using a 1-4 scale (i.e., 1 being the lowest predicted activity and 4 the highest). We deemed a Deer active if the distance it travelled in the 15-minute span between location fixes was greater than our minimum-distance threshold of 51.78 m. For analysis, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial distribution (active or inactive) comparing Deer activity to a predicted window period and a solunarchart rating scale. We found that during the predicted movement periods of moonrise and moonset, Deer were 0.30 and 0.37 times more likely to be active on the highest rated day versus the lowest rated day, respectively. Whereas during the predicted movement periods of moon underfoot and overhead, Deer were 3.02 and 2.83 times more likely to be active on the highest-rated day versus the lowest-rated day, respectively. Furthermore, we found a decreasing probability of activity as day rating increased during moonrise and an increasing probability of activity as day rating increased during moon overhead and moon underfoot. During moonset we observed an increased probability of activity between day rating 1 and 2 but then a decreasing probability of activity as day rating increased to 3 and 4. This study supports prior findings that solunar charts show inconsistencies in predictions of Deer activon lunar events and phases. As a result, we cannot fully disregard the potential that Deer activity may vary during different periods of the lunar cycle. We believe these findings warrant further research examining lunar effects on activity patterns of Deer across different regions, sexes, and time of the year (i.e., breeding and non-breeding season).

AB  - Simple Summary The destination of agro-industrial residues and deforestation to form new pasture areas are urgent concerns in the Amazon region. Diverse studies have evaluated the inclusion of these residues in ruminant diets and have enabled the intensification of animal production systems. Palm kernel cake (PKC), for example, is generated after oil extraction for the food and cosmetics industry, but it still has crude protein and metabolizable energy levels of around 17% and 7.6 MJ/kg in the matter dry (DM), respectively. This research aims to evaluate the inclusion of a PKC-based supplementation for grazing animals on feed intake, degradability, and productive performance of buffaloes in the eastern Amazon. Although some changes in nutrient intake and degradability were observed, the inclusion of the co-product in the diet did not promote changes in productive performance and reduced forage consumption. Thus, the use of PKC up to 1% of body weight in supplements is recommended as an alternative source of nutrients for grazing animals. The objective was to evaluate the effects of palm kernel cake (PKC) supplementation on voluntary feed intake, in situ rumen degradability and performance in the wettest (WS-January to June) and less rainy seasons (LR-July to December) in the eastern Amazon. A total of 52 crossbred buffaloes that were neither lactating nor gestating were used, with 24 for the LR, aged 34 +/- 04 months and an initial average weight of 503 +/- 48 kg, and 24 for the WS aged 40 +/- 04 months with an average weight of 605 +/- 56 kg. The four treatments (levels of PKC in relation to body weight) were distributed in a completely randomized design, with 0% (PKC0), 0.25% (PKC0.2), 0.5% (PKC0.5) and 1% (PKC1) with six repetitions. The animals were housed in Marandu grass paddocks, intermittently, with access to water and mineral mixture ad libitum. Degradability was evaluated by the in situ bag technique in four other crossbred buffaloes with rumen cannulae, in a 4 x 4 Latin square (four periods and four treatments). The inclusion of PKC increased supplement consumption and production of ether extracts and reduced the intake of forage and non-fibrous carbohydrates. The dry matter degradability of Marandu grass was not affected; however, the fermentation kinetics in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) differed between the treatments. The co-product dry matter colonization time was greater in PKC1 and the highest effective degradability rates were from PKC0, but the productive performance of the animals was not influenced. Supplementation of buffaloes with PKC is recommended for up to 1% of body weight.

AB  - Damages caused by external (biotic and abiotic) factors generally cause losses in forest manage- ment, negatively affect the continuity of providing various ecosystem services, and therefore play an important role in the management of forest resources. The aim of the study was to present the type and extent of natural damages of commercial forests in the temperate climate of north- -eastern Poland (Central and Eastern Europe). In addition, a relationship between the occurrence of damage of a given type and the site type of forest, the age of the stand and species composition was investigated. The necessary information was obtained from the documentation of the State Forests National Forest Holding through an interactive form. Nearly 8% of the stands in north- -eastern Poland were damaged. Vast majority of the damage were attributed to wild herbivores - 65%, followed by pathogenic fungi - 24% and insects - 8%. The degree of damage to stands depends on the source of damage, species and age of trees. 60% of damaged stands were damaged in 20%, and 1/3 in 10%. Animals most often damaged oaks; fungi - alders; insects - spruce. Fires most often damaged juniper, pine and birch. The most frequently damaged pine, oak and birch stands were characterized by the highest average age of trees (73.1; 56.0; 56.5 years, respectively). On the other hand, the least frequently damaged linden stands were characterized by the lowest average age of trees - 45.1 years. Taking into account the influence of the forest site on the probability of damage to stands caused by natural factors, there are no significant differences between most sites. A slightly higher probability of damage to stands occurs in the moist forest site type, but the importance of this site in the study area is small. The paper indicates the exis- tence of a serious problem of damage to the young generation of the forest by wild herbivores. This poses a real threat to the preservation of forest sustainability - the renewal of some tree species, in the study area, animals caused significant damage to oak regeneration. We suggest discussing the necessity to limit the number of wild herbivores in commercial forests. The cur- rently used felling age, adopted for individual tree species, also requires discussion. As we have shown, the higher age of the stands contributes to more frequent damage.

AB  - We still know little about the distributions of trace elements in grassland with long-term grazing exclusion. The contents, stocks, and proportions of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and boron (B) in green plant-litter-root-soil were evaluated by enclosing for 18-, and 39 years inside the fence (F18 and F39) and grazing outside the fence (F0) in Mongolia grassland. Results showed that F18 and F39 decreased the stocks of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant and root compared with F0 (p < .05), while increased the stocks of them in litter (p < .05). The F18 obviously increased the stocks of Fe and Mn in soil, especially B (p < .05). The stock of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant at F39 was 28.6%, 13.9%, and 39.2% higher than that at F18. The stocks of trace elements in undecomposed litter at F39 were increased by 12.7%-52.2% compared with F18, while the stocks of them in complete decomposed litter were decreased by 32.2%-42.5%. The stocks of trace elements in soil at F39 were 9.1%-28.0% lower than that at F18, especially B (p < .05). In conclusion, the trace elements were mainly shifted from green plant and root to soil and complete decomposed litter with 18-year grazing exclusion. The trace elements were shifted from complete decomposed litter and soil to root with 39-year grazing exclusion compared with 18-year grazing exclusion.

AB  - Animals commonly form groups with conspecifics. Hypotheses on the drivers of group size often (but not always) pertain to fear of predation and food availability or quality. However, for a more complete understanding of group forming, multiple, possibly interacting mechanisms should be considered. We used camera traps, detectability estimates from distance sampling, and hierarchical Bayesian modeling to index group size and test multiple additive and interacting group-formation hypotheses in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), within Indiana, USA. We found a strong relationship between our index of group size and (1) a three-way interaction between spatiotemporal pulses in fear of natural predation risk and anthropogenic development and (2) a three-way interaction between the local cover (defined as the amount of vegetative cover in the immediate area of the camera), the area of concealment (defined as forests or wetlands) within the larger landscape, and time of day. Specifically, we documented larger groups in areas near anthropogenic development, in areas with high predator use intensity, and when predators were active. Additionally, we found larger groups during dawn and dusk when deer were most active in locations with sparse local cover when the area of concealment in the surrounding landscape was small, and within dense local cover when the area of concealment in the surrounding landscape was large. Our methods can aid future behavioral and ecological studies, as we present a clear and easily replicable strategy that infers group membership from spatiotemporal proximity, corrects for differences in detectability, and enables sampling across large spatial and long temporal scales. Our findings indicate that fear of natural predators and anthropogenic disturbance interactively explain variation in group size.

AB  - While restoration projects globally scale-up to meet the growing demand to restore degraded ecosystems, data on the long-term benefits of restoration are still rare. Here, we describe the lessons learned from the Sow-A-Seed project in Sabah, Borneo: a long-term and large-scale restoration project launched in 1998 with the aim to rehabilitate 18,500 ha of tropical rainforest degraded by logging and forest fires. The project was built from the ground-up, including establishment of essential infrastructure and knowledge creation via trial-and-error. Three restoration techniques were used depending on the level of degradation; 1) Assisted Natural Regeneration (weeding, climber cutting and selective girdling) to promote natural regeneration of late-successional species in the least disturbed forests, and; 2) Enrichment Planting in gap-clusters in moderately disturbed forests, and; 3) Enrichment Planting in rows (i.e, line-planting) throughout heavily degraded forests with no- or few late successional tree species in the overstory. The project includes successful propagation of 92 native tree species including dipterocarps and fruit trees, and planting of over 5 million trees during the last 25 years. Long-term monitoring shows that the mortality rate of planted seedlings is -15% per year up to 3 years, but decreases to -2% between years 3-10 and 10-20. One of the largest trees, a Shorea leprosula planted in 1998, is now 74 cm in DBH and some planted trees have reached reproductive age and are contributing to natural regeneration. A range of wildlife including orangutans, elephants, hornbills and all five wildcat species in Sabah have been documented in the area. In 2015, the area was classified as a Class 1 protected forest, the highest level of conservation status in Malaysia, and removed from commercial forestry. We highlight that there is much knowledge to be gained by research dove-tailing with operational activities, and we encourage that the lessons learned from operational restoration are shared among practitioners and restoration ecologists. We present 8 key lessons learned from the Sow-a-Seed project.

AB  - As a main method of forest regeneration, stump sprouting plays a crucial role in forest community succession and vegetation restoration. We aimed to investigate the response of stump sprouting capacity to stubble height, unveil its nutrient-accumulation and allocation strategies and determine the appropriate stubble height most favorable for stump sprouting of Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. sinensis. Fifteen-year plants with signs of premature aging were coppiced at 0, 10 and 20 cm from the ground level. With the increase in stubble height, the number of stump sprouts increased linearly, and the survival rate decreased linearly. The height, diameter and cluster width of stump sprouts first increased, reached the highest level at a stubble height of 10 cm and then decreased. The contents and reserves of N, P, K, Ca and Mg showed a similar trend as the growth, positively correlating with each other. Compared with the control (no coppicing), the coppicing increased the nutrient element allocation of leaves, vertical roots and horizontal roots. Magnesium plays an important role in stump sprouting. The findings suggest that coppicing changed the accumulation ability and allocation pattern of nutrient elements, and further affected the sprouting ability of stumps. The best stubble height for stump sprouting and nutrient accumulation potential was 11.0-14.0 cm estimated by the regression.

AB  - Herbivory is a key ecological process that often determines the composition and abundance of plants. Estimates of herbivory in seagrass meadows are typically lower than those in other vegetated coastal ecosystems, but herbivory can be intense when large herbivorous vertebrates are abundant. We surveyed rates of herbivory on 2 species of tropical seagrasses (Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides), the abundance of herbivorous vertebrates, and the diet of 2 abundant herbivorous vertebrates (the green turtle Chelonia mydas and the rabbitfish Siganus lineatus) in lagoons adjacent to remote islands off northwestern Australia. Rates of herbivory in some deployments of tethered seagrass were more than 1000 times higher than rates of production and were among the highest recorded. Consumption exceeded production in half the deployments (9 of 18). Remote underwater video revealed that S. lineatus was the most abundant herbivore. Stomachs of S. lineatus contained mostly seagrass, and models based on stable isotopes indicated that seagrass was the primary source of nutrition. Stomach contents of C. mydas were more variable, containing seagrass and macroalgae (although the sample size was low), but models based on stable isotopes indicated that seagrass was likely the primary source of nutrition. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the high rates of herbivory on the seagrasses T. hemprichii and E. acoroides are mainly due to direct consumption by the abundant S. lineatus, and perhaps also C. mydas. Seagrass is the primary contributor to the nutrition of both species.

AB  - Evaluating the factors that promote coexistence between ecologically similar species is crucial to understanding the evolution and assembly of herbivore communities. The Jarman-Bell principle presents a trade-off between diet quality and quantity as an axis for dietary niche segregation and has been suggested as a mechanism facilitating species coexistence. This idea holds that larger-bodied herbivores consume greater amounts of relatively low-quality plant resources, while smaller-bodied herbivores typically feed selectively on higher-quality resources. Most studies investigating the Jarman-Bell principle have examined free-living ungulates in African savannas. The diverse ungulate community in Yellowstone National Park, USA offers an opportunity to investigate the applicability of this principle in a temperate North American ecosystem. In this study we use fecal nitrogen (FN) and stable carbon isotope values (delta 13C) to examine the relationship between body size and seasonal patterns of dietary niche segregation among five species of wild ungulates. Specifically, we test the predictions that: (1) diet quality decreases with increasing body mass, (2) interspecific differences in diet are greatest between the largest- and smallest-bodied species, and (3) smaller-bodied species have narrower dietary breadth than larger-bodied species. Diet quality, as indicated by digestibility, declined significantly with body mass, consistent with the empirical pattern predicted by the Jarman-Bell hypothesis. Significant interspecific differences in diet quality generally aligned with variation in body mass. When resources were limited during the winter, the relationship between body mass and diet quality was more pronounced, suggesting increased dietary niche segregation during the lean season. The results showed little evidence indicating that dietary breadth scaled allometrically with body mass, as the two species most similar in body mass displayed the greatest and least range of seasonal variation in both FN and delta 13C. This study adds to the weight and breadth of evidence that diet quality is negatively correlated with body size in wild ungulate assemblages. Our findings underscore the importance of body size as a factor facilitating dietary niche segregation and promoting coexistence among ecologically similar ungulate species.

AB  - To gain insights into the trichurid diversity in pre-Hispanic remains of South American camelids (SACs), as well as into modern SAC populations, a bibliographic search was carried out to find parasitological studies. Results showed that a total of 17 studies were performed at archaeological and paleontological sites, in which a total of 213 samples were examined. The sample set was used as the unit of analysis, and 83% of 52 pre-Hispanic sample sets were positive for parasites. Parasitological studies confirmed the pre-Hispanic presence of diverse trichurids: two Trichuris species and capillariid eggs with morphological differences that allowed them to be assigned to three different species. Currently, the richness of the native trichurid assemblages in SACs has been extended by the inclusion of two species (Trichuris sp. 2 and Capillariinae gen. sp. 1). Modern T. tenuis Chandler, 1930, considered SAC-specific, would have invaded SAC populations during the European colonization. The estimate of regional and temporal trichurid prevalence and paleoecological information allowed us to propose a possible origin for some of them. Although the present analysis is exploratory, it should stimulate future studies about the biogeographic history of SAC helminths, provide relevant information to improve descriptions of the Holocene ecology, and identify threatened helminths.

AB  - Parasite-induced modification of host behavior increasing transmission to a next host is a common phenomenon. However, field-based studies are rare, and the role of environmental factors in eliciting host behavioral modification is often not considered. We examined the effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH), time of day, date, and an irradiation proxy on behavioral modification of the ant Formica polyctena (Forster, 1850) by the brain-encysting lancet liver fluke Dicrocoelium dendriticum (Rudolphi, 1819). This fluke induces ants to climb and bite to vegetation by the mandibles in a state of temporary tetany. A total of 1264 individual ants expressing the modified behavior were observed over 13 non-consecutive days during one year in the Bidstrup Forests, Denmark. A sub-set of those ants (N = 172) was individually marked to track the attachment and release of infected ants in relation to variation in temperature. Infected ants primarily attached to vegetation early and late in the day, corresponding to low temperature and high RH, presumably coinciding with the grazing activity of potential herbivorous definitive hosts. Temperature was the single most important determinant for the induced phenotypic change. On warm days, infected ants altered between the manipulated and non-manipulated state multiple times, while on cool days, many infected ants remained attached to the vegetation all day. Our results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of the infected ants serves the dual purpose of exposing infected ants to the next host at an opportune time, while protecting them from exposure to high temperatures, which might increase host (and parasite) mortality.
   Our study asks whether environmental factors influence behavior change in ants infected with a liver fluke. We investigated the influence of date, time of day, temperature, relative humidity, and a proxy for irradiation. We found that, on warm days, infected ants altered their behavior multiple times, while on cool days, many infected ants remained attached to the vegetation all day. Temperature, therefore, seems to play a meaningful role with respect to inducing behavior modification.

AB  - Context. Establishing baseline environmental characteristics of demersal fish habitat is essential to understanding future distribution changes and to identifying shorter-term anomalies that may affect fish density during monitoring efforts. Aims. Our aim was to synthesise environmental data to provide near-bottom oceanographic baseline information on the Pacific halibut fishing grounds, to establish geographic groupings that may be used as co-variates in fish-density modelling and to identify temporal trends in the data. Methods. Water-column profiler data were collected from 2009 to 2018 along the North American continental shelf, during summer fishery surveys focused on Pacific halibut. Key results. In addition to establishing baseline information on the fishing grounds, this analysis illustrated that environmental variables can be grouped geographically into four regions that correspond to the four biological regions established by the International Pacific Halibut Commission. A spatio-temporal modelling approach is presented as an example of how to describe the relationship between environmental data and Pacific halibut distribution. Conclusions. This study has highlighted the efficacy of environmental data in analysing fish distribution and density changes. Implications. Oceanographic monitoring provides the ability to detect annual anomalies such as seasonal hypoxic zones that may affect fish density and to establish baseline information for future research.

AB  - Complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations. Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 +/- SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 +/- SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 +/- SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 +/- SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services. It is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity.

AB  - Empirical evidence suggests that the attractiveness of a plant to herbivores can be affected by the investment in defense by neighboring plants, as well as investment in defense by the focal plant. Thus, the payoff for allocating to defense may not only be influenced by the frequency and intensity of herbivory but also by defense strategies employed by other plants in the environment. We use a combination of spatial evolutionary game theory and stochastic dynamic programming to predict the proportion of plants in the population investing in defense (cooperators) and the proportion of plants that do not (defectors). Our model accounts for metabolic costs of maintenance of stored resources when predicting optimal resource allocation to growth, reproduction, and storage; this cost is not commonly accounted for in previous models. For both annual and perennial plants, our model predicts an evolutionarily stable proportion of cooperators and defectors (mixed stable strategy), but the proportion of cooperators is higher in a population of perennial plants than in a population of annual plants. We also show that including a metabolic cost of maintaining stored resources does not change the proportion of cooperators but does decrease plant fitness and allocation to overwinter storage.

AB  - This study proposed combining food waste (FW) and cattle manure (CM) in composting to improve the product maturity. The findings suggested that the inclusion of CM effectively extended the thermophilic stage, facilitated the decomposition of cellulose, and enhanced the production of humus-like substances by enhancing beneficial microbial cooperation. Adding 40 % CW was optimal to reduce the nitrogen loss, increase the cellulose degradation rate to 22.07 %, increase germination index (GI) to 140 %, and reduce normalized antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundances. Adding CW could promote the transformation of protein-like compounds, thereby enhancing the humification process of organic substances. Structural equation modeling further verified that the temperature was the key factor affecting humification production, while the main driver for ARGs was physiochemical parameters. This study shows that co-composting of FW and CM offers the potential to promote humification, reduce ARG abundance, and improve fertilizer quality for utilization of both biowastes in the field.

AB  - The Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique and Zimbabwe harbour diverse and unique flora and fauna. Because of these unique floral characteristics, this region has received considerable attention by botanists. In contrast, the vertebrates occurring here have received little attention. The aim of this paper was to synthesise data collected on multiple recent surveys into the first annotated checklist of the mammals of the Mozambican side of the Chimanimani Mountains. We identified medium-sized and large mammals by exterior appearance, mostly as captured on camera traps. We combined morphological and molecular methods to identify small mammals, and we report on echolocation calls of some of the poorly known bat species. In total, we recorded 69 species, including 23 species of bats (Chiroptera),15 species of rodents (Rodentia),11 species of carnivores (Carnivora), nine species of ungulates (Cetartiodactyla), and the rest comprising Primates, Eulipotyphla, Lagomorpha, Proboscidea, and Pholidota. Of these, five species are listed as threatened, demonstrating the importance of the Chimanimani Mountains for mammalian biodiversity conservation in South Eastern Africa.

AB  - Livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) are utilized worldwide as a non-lethal strategy to alleviate human-wildlife conflict. However, while studies show their effectiveness, resulting in reductions of livestock loss, there is limited research into the factors that influence individual dog variation. One factor which may be important is the proximity of the dog to the herd it is guarding, as well as subtle aspects of its behavior. This small-scale study investigates individual differences in proximity and behavior and the potential influencing environmental factors. It compares these to the dog's perceived effectiveness, as rated by the herder who regularly works with them. We attached GPS collars to 8 LGDs and a 'lead' goat from their respective herd to track proximity during grazing visits to the Namibian bush. For 4 dogs, the data spanned 2 years, so we examined consistency of proximity, both within, and between, years. We also examined associations between temperature, time of day and vegetation density and the LGD's proximity to the herd. In addition, behavioral observations were conducted for 3 of the dogs to compare to the data derived from the collars. Individual dogs varied in their proximity to the herd and showed consistency within (F (7,4180) = 36.8, P < 0.001) and between the 2 years (r = 0.99. P = 0.012). Proximity was significantly associated with time of day (F (1,4180) = 19.3, P < 0.001), but not with daily temperature (F (1,4180) = 0.003, P = 0.96). Dogs tended to be closer to the herd at the start and end of the day. Whilst vegetation density did not have a universal effect (F (2,4180) = 0.99, P = 0.393), some dogs showed distinct patterns of change in proximity with differences in vegetation density (F (14,4180) = 3.60, P < 0.01). This suggests some dogs were modifying their behavior in response to relative predation risk. The herder tended to rate those dogs, which were recorded to be closest, as more effective. Behavioral observations of distance correlated well with the data gathered from GPS collars but, in most cases, the dog was observed to be closer to other herd members than to the collared lead goat. We conclude that measuring dog proximity to the herd is a useful way to monitor behavior, but that monitoring multiple sheep or goats, and also conducting behavioral observations is integral to understanding ways to maximize performance.

AB  - Grazing can potentially affect grassland soil carbon storage through selective feeding, trampling and fecal excretion of livestock. The numerous case studies and a few meta-analyses have focused on grazing-induced changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, but the effects of grazing on SOC in major grassland types of China are not clear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify the impact of grazing on soil carbon in China. We found that the key factors affecting the SOC content of grazing grasslands is grazing intensity. Heavy grazing (HG) significantly decreased the SOC content by 7.5 % in major grassland types of China (95 % confidence interval (CI), -11.43 % to -3.57 %, P < 0.001). The SOC content in temperate desert steppes (7.22 %), temperate meadow-steppes (10.89 %) under heavy grazing (HG) showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. HG resulted in significant (P < 0.01) decreases in SOC content (6.91 %) of Kastanoze. Our study highlighted that formulating rational grazing strategies according to grassland and soil types was the key to increasing SOC storage and sequestration under climate change and increased human pressure.

AB  - Context. Many prey species exhibit antipredator behaviours when threatened, yet prey response to temporal variation in predation risk is not well-understood, despite being foundational to predator-prey dynamics and an important consideration among game population managers and recreationalists. Aims. To examine white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) behaviour in response to temporal variation in predation risk imposed by recreational hunters and to assess the effect of deer sex and age on antipredator response. Methods. Global positioning system (GPS) collars were used to monitor behaviour of female and male deer in response to diel and weekly patterns of recreational hunting in Alabama, USA. Key results. Deer behaviour on weekends (i.e. Friday-Sunday), corresponding to periods of elevated risk, was similar to behaviour on weekdays (i.e. Monday-Thursday). However, when behaviour was examined by individual day of the week, movement rate decreased by 17%, net displacement decreased by 31%, and the probability of activity decreased by 24% during daylight hours on Sundays compared with Fridays. Behavioural changes among days were not detected at night. Daytime behavioural shifts persisted until Wednesdays, despite lower weekday hunting activity. Behavioural variation by deer sex and age was also observed. Conclusions. Deer perceive temporal variation in predation risk and modify their behaviour to reduce the likelihood of predation. Variation in response across sex and age classes may be driven by previous experience with hunters and/or survival- and fitness-related trade-offs that affect prey decisions at the individual level. Antipredator response was not initially detectable when examined at a broad temporal scale (i.e. weekend vs weekday); however, a behavioural response was shown with a finer-scale analysis (i.e. individual day of the week), which more closely reflected the pattern of risk fluctuation. Implications. Our findings demonstrated the acute awareness of a large ungulate to temporal changes in predation risk and provided insight into ways in which these prey behaviourally respond to reduce the likelihood of predatory encounters. Future studies should consider the temporal scale of risk fluctuation when examining antipredator response to avoid false conclusions. Ungulate hunters and managers can use this information to more efficiently achieve their goals.

AB  - Argyrosomus inodorus is a cool water Sciaenid, important to the recreational and commercial coastal fishery in Namibia, the northern Benguela. Given recent findings on the northern Benguela as an ocean-warming hotspot and A. inodorus being more sensitive to warm temperatures than its congeneric A. coronus, it is important to study long-term growth responses of this Sciaenid. We developed a 34-year otolith biochronology for A. inodorus. The linear mixed-effects models fitted to A. inodorus' otolith biochronology indicated that the best linear unbiased predictor of growth was significantly positively correlated with mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in September of the year of formation and significantly negatively correlated with mean summer SSTs (November y1), in the central Namibian area (20-24 degrees S, 12-14 degrees E). Thus, faster annual growth was observed during warmer winter/spring temperatures (up to 16 degrees C) and slower growth was noted during warmer summer temperatures (> 16 degrees C). These results indicate that the species has a narrow range of thermal plasticity, and highlight the recent reductions in growth of this species in response to rapid thermal change observed in the ocean warming hotspot. Our findings suggest that A. inodorus would not be able to adapt readily with future climate warming predicted to happen and already happening along the northernmost part of the Namibian coast.

AB  - The discovery of inactive hydrothermal vent sulfide features near 9 degrees 50 ' N degrees 50 ' N on the East Pacific Rise provides an opportunity to investigate the distribution and feeding ecology of communities inhabiting this type of habitat. We quantify megafaunal distributions on two features, Lucky's Mound and Sentry Spire, to determine how taxonomic composition and feeding traits vary with vertical elevation. Fifty-one morphotypes, categorized by feeding mode, were identified from three levels of the features (spire, apron, and base) and the surrounding flat oceanic rise. About half of the morphotypes (26 of 51) were only observed at the sulfide features. Passive suspension feeders were more abundant on the spires, where horizontal particulate flux is expected to be elevated, than the base or rise. Deposit feeders tended to be more abundant on the base and rise, where deposition is expected to be enhanced, but were unexpectedly abundant higher up on Sentry Spire. Community differences between the two sulfide features suggest that other processes, such as feature-specific chemoautotrophic production, may also influence distributions.

AB  - It is essential to understand how the built environment affects transit ridership to prioritize public transit and make it more appealing, particularly in mid-sized cities on the Rust Belt due to the experience of population decrease and urban sprawl in the U.S. Although many studies have looked at factors that influence ridership, there is still a need for a methodological design that considers both route and environment characteristics for bus ridership. This study examined the daily ridership of 3794 bus stops across 57 routes in the Buffalo area of New York State and used random coefficients models to account for different levels of characteristics (bus stop level, route level, and transportation analysis zone (TAZ) level). The study found that bus frequency and bus stop centrality were positively correlated with ridership, while total route stops had a negative effect. By controlling the impact of bus routes, the study showed that the multi-level design using random coefficients models was more effective than traditional OLS and spatial lag models in quantifying the impact of bus routes and TAZs. These findings provide local policy implications for route design, bus operation, and transit resource allocation.

AB  - Non-renewable resource extraction contributes greatly to degradation of wildlife habitats in boreal landscapes. In western Canada, oil and gas exploration and extraction have left a dense network of linear disturbances (seismic lines) and abandoned well pads that have fragmented boreal forest. Among multiple ecological effects, these disturbances have increased predator access to the preferred habitat of some wildlife taxa, most notably boreal woodland caribou, resulting in population declines. Restoration of seismic lines and abandoned well pads is a critical activity to improve the recovery of woodland caribou populations. We present a linear programming model that optimally allocates restoration efforts to maximize the access of caribou to nearby undisturbed habitat in a fragmented landscape. We applied the model to examine restoration scenarios in the Cold Lake First Nations area in northeastern Alberta, Canada, which includes caribou habitat but also areas of active oil and gas extraction. The model depicts the landscape as a network of interconnected habitat patches and combines three network flow sub-problems. The first sub-problem enforces the spatial connectivity of the remaining network of unrestored sites. The second sub-problem maximizes access to suitable habitat from the restored locations and the third sub-problem ensures the allocation of restoration activities in as few spatially contiguous restoration projects as possible. The approach is generalizable and applicable to assist restoration planning in other resource extraction regions and for other taxa.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts increasingly involve multi-factor changes to resource pools and flows, whose outcomes on ecosystem function are difficult to predict. Here, we factorially manipulated drought with eutrophication (nitrogen fertilization) in C-3 and C-4 grassland, testing for impacts on aboveground community- and species-level plant biomass. Drought and eutrophication may be especially detrimental to plant production, with elevated water demand by drought-stressed and fertilized plants hypothesized to limit growth while potentially triggering insect outbreaks given changes to foliar-nitrogen (N). Despite eliminating precipitation for two months, biomass was stabilized by treatment-induced biomass increases in some species offsetting declines by others (i.e. 'niche complementarity'), even in drought-sensitive C-3 grassland: community-level plant biomass remained stable via significant species-level biomass shifts among the 61 taxa in both communities. These compensatory responses occurred despite increased water demands by fertilized plants, greater drought-tolerance by C-4 grasses compared to C-3 taxa, elevated plant mortality, and the reduction of soil moisture below the field-calculated plant wilting point by mid-summer. A key mechanism for resilience appeared to be variation in rooting depth, given that soil moisture reductions were greatest within the top 30 cm. There was no detectable change in foliar-N with drought nor any increase in insect abundance or herbivore damage. We imposed one of the lowest rainfall totals of the past three decades in our study region yet observed resilience via species-specific compensatory responses. Our results confirm short-term drought-tolerance in grasslands, with co-occurring rainfall reductions and eutrophication unable to alter community-level production of standing biomass.

AB  - Optimal foraging and landscape of fear theories provide frameworks which can be useful for investigating animal's space and prey use decisions. Predators, such as African lions Panthera leo, are likely to respond to prey abundance, accessibility, profitability and potential risks, often anthropogenic in nature, while making foraging decision. Identifying the relative role of these processes has important conservation implications. We investigated the relative role of responses to a pastoralist landscape of fear within lion feeding and spatial ecology in a landscape at the human-wildlands interface. We collected spatial and predation data from 12 GPS-collared lions and ungulate count data from transects, along the South Africa-Mozambique border, including parts of Kruger, Limpopo and Banhine National Parks. We calculated Jacobs' Index values from 80 kills to investigate lion selection of wild and domestic ungulates as prey, used maximum entropy modelling to predict multi-season ungulate spatial occurrence and used resource selection functions to estimate the relative probability of use of wild and domestic ungulate areas by lions. All lions had access to wild prey and domestic livestock within their home ranges. Lions showed a strong selection for large-bodied wild ungulates as prey taking waterbuck, zebra, kudu and buffalo more frequently then predicted by their availability. Lions showed a slight avoidance of cattle as prey, with cattle outnumbering larger ungulates across much of the study area. Lions showed the greatest selection for habitats with high occurrences of wild prey, specifically areas with kudu, then nyala and buffalo, during the dry seasons and showed strong avoidance of cattle areas during the wet season; a season when cattle are kept closer to settlements and thus better protected and easier to predict and avoid. These results suggest that lions select for wild prey and habitats optimally, yet show a fear response to cattle and cattle areas. This duality in the foraging behaviour of lions suggests that efforts to mitigate human-lion conflict and preserve vulnerable lion populations should focus on both increasing wild ungulate populations as well as exploiting lion's fear of humans with careful consideration of the risks of livestock presence acting as an ecological trap for vulnerable lion populations.

AB  - Nest predation is reported as a cause of reproductive failure of ground-nesting bird species whose populations in Europe are declining. Conversely, European populations of the wild boar Sus scrofa have been expanding, leading to increasing threats to habitats and ecological communities. The impacts of wild boar on ground-nesting bird species are poorly known and have never been explicitly assessed. We conducted an artificial ground-nest experiment in Mediterranean habitats of central Italy using camera traps to assess predator identities. Deployed nests contained quail or chicken eggs, and predation occurred within one week for 47/48 deployments carried out during March-July 2020. The wild boar was the most common predator (36% deployments), followed by the magpie Pica pica (18%), the red fox Vulpes vulpes (10%) and the pine marten Martes martes (10%). Predation by other species was occasionally observed. Egg type and deployment habitat did not significantly influence time to predation or the likelihood that a nest was preyed upon by wild boar, respectively. The presence of a stuffed gull close to the nests significantly delayed predation. Nests preyed by birds and mammals other than wild boar were often subsequently scavenged by wild boar, which consumed the remaining eggs or eggshells. Time to predation increased from spring to summer, suggesting a reduction of predation intensity during periods when the availability of natural eggs is lowest. The likelihood of a nest being preyed upon by the wild boar compared to other predators increased when wild boar frequency of occurrence in 1-week camera trap shootings was the highest, suggesting that higher abundance/activity of this species triggered increased egg predation. The wild boar might act as major predators of ground-nesting bird species in Mediterranean habitats and the large-scale population increase of this ungulate should be considered a significant threat to ground-nesting species of European conservation concern.

AB  - Simple Summary Urban green spaces (UGS), such as parks and wooded streets, are open areas with vegetation that provide sustainability to urban areas. The aim of this study was to analyze the variation of bird assemblages in non-wooded streets, wooded streets, and parks in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. We compared bird taxonomic and functional diversity between these habitat types. We selected five non-wooded streets, five wooded streets, and five parks. Bird surveys were performed in 100 m long and 50 m wide transects. We found that taxonomic diversity had the greatest value in the parks, followed by wooded streets, and then the non-wooded streets. Functional diversity was similar between habitats. The taxonomic and functional composition changed between habitats. The positive association between UGS and bird diversity highlights the role of UGS as biodiversity conservation sites in neotropical citiesAbstract Urban green spaces (UGS), such as parks and wooded streets, are open areas with vegetation that provide sustainability to urban areas.

Bird surveys were performed in 100 m long and 50 m wide transects. We found that taxonomic diversity had the greatest value in the parks, followed by wooded streets, and then the non-wooded streets. Functional diversity was similar between habitats. The taxonomic and functional composition changed between habitats. Non-wooded streets were dominated by the Rock Dove (Columba livia) and the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata), whereas parks had the highest abundance of the Picazuro Pigeon (Patagioenas picazuro) and the Rufous-bellied Thrush (Turdus rufiventris). Non-wooded streets were dominated by omnivorous and granivorous species, whereas parks had a higher abundance of herbivorous and frugivorous species. The positive association between UGS and bird diversity highlights the role of UGS as biodiversity conservation sites in neotropical cities.

AB  - Among other approaches, camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) is used to estimate animal abundance from unmarked populations. It was formulated for videos and observation distances are measured at predetermined 'snapshot moments'. Surveys recording still images with passive infrared motion sensors suffer from frequent periods where animals are not photographed, either because of technical delays before the camera can be triggered again (i.e. 'camera recovery time') or because they remain stationary and do not immediately retrigger the camera following camera recovery time (i.e. 'retrigger delays'). These effects need to be considered when calculating temporal survey effort to avoid downwardly biased abundance estimates. Here, we extend the CTDS model for passive infrared motion sensor recording of single images or short photo series. We propose estimating 'mean time intervals between triggers' as combined mean camera recovery time and mean retrigger delays from the time interval distribution of pairs of consecutive pictures, using a Gamma and Exponential function, respectively. We apply the approach to survey data on red deer, roe deer and wild boar. Mean time intervals between triggers were very similar when estimated empirically and when derived from the model-based approach. Depending on truncation times (i.e. the time interval between consecutive pictures beyond which data are discarded) and species, we estimated mean time intervals between retriggers between 8.28 and 15.05 s. Using a predefined snapshot interval, not accounting for these intervals, would lead to underestimated density by up to 96% due to overestimated temporal survey effort. The proposed approach is applicable to any taxa surveyed with camera traps. As programming of cameras to record still images is often preferred over video recording due to reduced consumption of energy and memory, we expect this approach to find broad application, also for other camera trap methods than CTDS.

AB  - The ecotype population of goats (Capra hircus) was created by long-term artificial selection and natural adaptation. Mile red-bone goat is an indigenous breed with visible red bones, and its special bone structure has received extensive attention. This study aimed to identify genetic variants and candidate genes associated with specific bone phenotypes using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). The results revealed that 31,828,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 72 goats (20 Mile red-bone goats and 52 common goats) by NGS. A total of 100 candidate genes were identified on the basis top 1% window interaction from nucleotide diversity (pi), pi ratio (pi(A)/pi(B)), and pairwise fixation index (F-ST). Exactly 77 known signaling pathways were enriched. Specifically, three coding genes (NMNAT2, LOC102172983, and PNLIP) were annotated in the vitamin metabolism signaling pathways, and NCF2 was annotated to the osteoclast (OC) differentiation pathway. Furthermore, 5862 reliable copy number variations (CNVs) were obtained, and 14 and 24 genes were annotated with the top 1 parts per thousand CNV based on F-ST (>0.490) and V-ST (>0.527), respectively. Several pathways related to bone development and metabolism of exogenous substances in vivo, including calcium signaling pathway, OC differentiation, and glycerophospholipid metabolism, were annotated. Specifically, six genes from 19 candidate CNVs, which were obtained by interaction of the top 1 parts per thousand CNVs with F-ST and V-ST, were annotated to mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. Briefly, the results implied that pseudopurpurin and specific genetic variants work together to contribute to the red-bone color and specific bone structure of Mile red-bone goat. This study is helpful to understanding the genetic basis of the unique bone phenotype of Mile red-bone goats.

AB  - There is a long history of humans either intentionally or accidentally moving plant species to areas outside of their native ranges. In novel environments, populations of many of these plant species exhibit explosive population growth and spread, in part due to the absence of coevolved enemies such as herbivorous insects. However, over time such enemies can 'catch up' with their host and re-establish host-herbivore relationships. Though this phenomenon has been documented in several systems, little evidence exists on how this re-assembly of enemies results in increased levels of herbivory. In this study we focus on the case of black locust Robinia pseudoacacia, a sparsely populated tree species when growing on undisturbed sites in its limited native range in the eastern USA but a highly invasive species, especially in disturbed environments, in most temperate world regions. We recorded folivore damage on invasive populations in five continents, including both native and invaded portions of North America. Here, we investigated 1) how total foliage damage and damage caused by different groups of folivores differs among regions; 2) how seasonal development of folivore damage differs among regions; 3) how folivory varies with distance from the native range within North America; and 4) how the number of recorded specialist folivores correlates with the amount of folivory. We observed strong differences among regions in the amount and type of folivore damage, with the native range experiencing the highest damage, especially that caused by the native chrysomelid beetle Odontota dorsalis, which is limited to the native and invaded North American range of R. pseudoacacia. Among world regions, total folivory is negatively associated with the distance from the native range and positively associated with the number of established R. pseudoacacia specialist folivore species, supporting the hypothesis that global patterns of herbivore invasions are associated with diminished enemy release.

AB  - Microsporidia comprises a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, and spore-forming parasites that infect a wide range of animals. Among them, Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most frequently reported species in humans and other mammals and birds. Data on the epidemiology of E. bieneusi in wildlife are limited. Hence, E. bieneusi was investigated in eight wild ungulate species present in Spain (genera Ammotragus, Capra, Capreolus, Cervus, Dama, Ovis, Rupicapra, and Sus) by molecular methods. Faecal samples were collected from free-ranging (n = 1058) and farmed (n = 324) wild ungulates from five Spanish bioregions. The parasite was detected only in red deer (10.4%, 68/653) and wild boar (0.8%, 3/359). Enterocytozoon bieneusi infections were more common in farmed (19.4%, 63/324) than in wild (1.5%, 5/329) red deer. A total of 11 genotypes were identified in red deer, eight known (BEB6, BEB17, EbCar2, HLJD-V, MWC_d1, S5, Type IV, and Wildboar3) and three novel (DeerSpEb1, DeerSpEb2, and DeerSpEb3) genotypes. Mixed genotype infections were detected in 15.9% of farmed red deer. Two genotypes were identified in wild boar, a known (Wildboar3) and a novel (WildboarSpEb1) genotypes. All genotypes identified belonged to E. bieneusi zoonotic Groups 1 and 2. This study provides the most comprehensive epidemiological study of E. bieneusi in Spanish ungulates to date, representing the first evidence of the parasite in wild red deer populations worldwide. Spanish wild boars and red deer are reservoir of zoonotic genotypes of E. bieneusi and might play an underestimated role in the transmission of this microsporidian species to humans and other animals.
   Lay Summary The fungal-related intracellular parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a worldwide public health and veterinary problem. Here we demonstrated that it was present in wild boar, and wild and farmed red deer in Spain, with genotypes potentially capable of infecting humans, posing a public health risk.

AB  - Determining the factors influencing reproductive rates is important for modeling and managing wildlife populations. In ungulates, these vital rates are often related to intrinsic characteristics such as age and body condition. We studied mid-winter pregnancy and early reproductive outcomes (offspring viability) in a reintroduced elk (Cervus canadensis) population in southeastern Kentucky, USA, modeling these rates as a function of age, body condition score, and body mass with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) fit within an information-theoretic framework to determine which factors best predicted reproductive potential. Our models for pregnancy status suggested that pregnancy was strongly correlated with body mass and weakly with age and body condition, while models for offspring viability suggested that none of the covariates measured were predictive of parturition and offspring viability. While body mass appeared to be the strongest correlate of reproductive potential in this population, other physiological and nutritional variables likely play a role in pregnancy or fetal survival, and future work should aim to understand how these parameters both influence reproduction and are influenced by habitat management.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to study the effect of phenological phases on forage nutrient composition, rumen fermentation parameters and content of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in milk of grazing yak. In this study, 10 female Gannan yaks with an average body weight of 234.9 & PLUSMN;10.5 kg were selected for research purpose (natural grazing) in Gannan Pastoral Area of Gansu Province. The forage, rumen fluid and milk samples were collected during green-up time, flowering time and withering time of forage to determine nutrient composition of forage, fermentation parameters of rumen fluid, and CLA in milk fat. The correlation analysis was studied in order to find out the influence of forage and rumen fluid parameters on the content of CLA in milk of grazing yak. The results showed that the phenological phases significantly affected the content of lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, total fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) (P<0.05), and these were significantly higher in flowering time (P<0.05). The content of fatty acid and total fatty acid in yak milk were significantly higher in flowering time than green-up time and withering time (P<0.05). The phenological phases significantly affected the content of CLA isomer c9t11, t10, c12 and CLA in yak milk (P<0.05), and these were significantly higher in grazing yak milk at flowering time than green-up time and withering times (P<0.05). The rumen pH, acetic acid, propionic acid, acetic/ propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, total volatile acid and trans-11 -oleic acid in the rumen of yak were also significantly affected by phenological phases (P<0.05). There was a significant positive correlation of rumen pH, forage crude protein, crude fat, nitrogen free extract, tannic acid and total fatty acid with CLA content in grazing yaks (P<0.05). A significant negative correlation (P<0.05) of crude fiber and crude ash with CLA content in milk of grazing yak was recorded, while no significant correlation (P>0.05) of PUFAs and TVFA with CLA content was observed. This study is helpful to improve the grazing management of alpine grassland and the production performance of yaks (milk yield and milk quality).

   center dot There is little information on the fate of individual birds in and following fire, but those of more mobile species may have fled, with reports of forest species in suburbs and other unusual habitats in the days and months after the fire.
   center dot Many also died, with burnt birds as large as eagles washed up on beaches. Those that survived lost food and shelter. There is also likely to have been a net loss of tree hollows used for nesting by many species; replacement will take a long time.
   center dot Studies to date suggest that recolonisation is rapid as habitat recovers its structure, but recovery may take years and possibly decades for species associated with rainforest and other wetter habitats.
   center dot Active management is expected to help a few species to recover, particularly through nest box erection.
   Main findings
   center dot The ranges of 180 million individual birds from more than 350 terrestrial bird taxa intersected with the 2019-20 megafires.
   center dot The 2019-20 wildfires burnt > 25% of the range of 51 bird taxa, much of it severely; the most extreme overlap (68% of range burnt) was for the Kangaroo Island southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus halmaturinus).
   center dot Of the most fire-affected birds, eight were meeting the IUCN Red List criteria as threatened or Near Threatened before the fire. Another 19 were assessed as meeting the criteria directly because of the fires.
   center dot The IUCN Red Index for all Australian birds declined by over 9% as a direct result of the fires.
   center dot Bird communities in burnt rainforests were at lower densities after the fires and were recovering more slowly than those in adjacent burnt dry sclerophyll communities.
   center dot Populations of the glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami) did better than expected in the year after fire, though may face future food shortages.

AB  - Disease outbreaks induced by humans increasingly threaten wildlife communities worldwide. Like predators, pathogens can be key top-down forces in ecosystems, initiating trophic cascades that may alter food webs. An outbreak of mange in a remote Andean protected area caused a dramatic population decline in a mammalian herbivore (the vicuna), creating conditions to test the cascading effects of disease on the ecological community. By comparing a suite of ecological measurements to pre-disease baseline records, we demonstrate that mange restructured tightly linked trophic interactions previously driven by a mammalian predator (the puma). Following the mange outbreak, scavenger (Andean condor) occurrence in the ecosystem declined sharply and plant biomass and cover increased dramatically in predation refuges where herbivory was historically concentrated. The evidence shows that a disease-induced trophic cascade, mediated by vicuna density, could supplant the predator-induced trophic cascade, mediated by vicuna behaviour, thereby transforming the Andean ecosystem.

AB  - Ecological context-the biotic and abiotic environment, along with its influence on population mixing dynamics and individual susceptibility-is thought to have major bearing on epidemic outcomes. However, direct comparisons of wildlife disease events in contrasting ecological contexts are often confounded by concurrent differences in host genetics, exposure histories, or pathogen strains. Here, we compare disease dynamics of a Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae spillover event that affected bighorn sheep populations in two contrasting ecological contexts. One event occurred on the herd's home range near the Rio Grande Gorge in New Mexico, while the other occurred in a captive facility at Hardware Ranch in Utah. While data collection regimens varied, general patterns of antibody signal strength and symptom emergence were conserved between the two sites. Symptoms appeared in the captive setting an average of 12.9 days postexposure, average time to seroconversion was 24.9 days, and clinical signs peaked at approximately 36 days postinfection. These patterns were consistent with serological testing and subsequent declines in symptom intensity in the free-ranging herd. At the captive site, older animals exhibited more severe declines in body condition and loin thickness, higher symptom burdens, and slower antibody response to the pathogen than younger animals. Younger animals were more likely than older animals to clear infection by the time of sampling at both sites. The patterns presented here suggest that environment may not be a major determinant of epidemiological outcomes in the bighorn sheep-M. ovipneumoniae system, elevating the possibility that host- or pathogen-factors may be responsible for observed variation.

AB  - In the United States, Rhizophora mangle L. populations have established in saltmarsh communities at the northern extent of its range in Guana Tolomata Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, near St. Augustine, FL. This two-year study monitored the growth and survivorship of propagules planted in the intertidal band dominated by Spartina alterniflora Loisel and mangroves. Propagules in the S. alterniflora microhabitat grew more than twice as fast, had a greater number of leaves per plant, and produced more sets of branches and flower buds than those growing under the mangrove canopy. Differences in growth were likely due to the 2.7 times greater mean monthly insolation in the Spartina microhabitat during the spring-summer growing season. Individuals persisted beneath the mangrove canopy and may take advantage of increased light availability from canopy gaps created by extreme storm events. Despite the 67% mortality from herbivory, wind gusts, storm surge, and extreme high tides, surviving R. mangle seedlings reached maturity in the unshaded and warmer microclimate of the low-lying saltmarsh vegetation. Spartina alterniflora may serve as a facilitator during the cotyledon phase of R. mangle and did not inhibit the success of the seedling establishment, providing a mechanism by which dispersed R. mangle propagules may spread northward into saltmarsh communities.

AB  - Floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems are increasingly deployed on gravel pit lakes to generate renewable energy and mitigate land-use conflicts. However, their environmental impacts on hydrological and ecological processes remain insufficiently studied. This study investigates the effects of a 1.5-MWp FPV system covering 8% of a 19-ha gravel pit lake in Germany. The General Lake Model (GLM-AED2) and Delft3D-FLOW were used to simulate FPV-induced changes. Meteorological data-including irradiance, air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity-were recorded above and below the PV modules. Water quality data-including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll-a-were collected beneath the FPV and in open water. Mussel colonisation of the FPV substructure was assessed, and its filtration impact on water quality analysed. Macrophyte distribution was assessed beneath the FPV system and along the shorelines. Results showed a modelled 88% solar irradiance and 57% wind speed reduction beneath the FPV system. Water quality impacts were minimal and primarily influenced by mussels colonising the substructure. Macrophytes occurred in littoral zones up to 5.25 m deep up to 5.25 m deep, but habitat-typical species were scarce due to gravel extraction and herbivorous fish. These findings highlight complex interactions between FPV, mussel filtration, macrophytes, and human activities, suggesting that other anthropogenic factors may outweigh FPV impacts. Model simulations indicated that FPV coverage above 45% could destabilise thermal stratification and alter primary production. This study underscores the need for empirical monitoring and modelling to optimise FPV deployment and inform regulatory frameworks for sustainable development.

AB  - While nutrient enrichment and herbivory have been well recognized as the main driving factors of seagrass meadow fragmentation and degradation, there is limited understanding of how their relative importance shifts across large spatial scales where environmental factors such as turbidity can vary. In this study, a field control experiment was conducted in two Zostera japonica meadows distributed on the two banks of the Yellow River Estuary with different turbidity, to investigate the combined effects of nutrient enrichment and herbivory on seagrass and macroalgae. Our results showed that turbidity had the mediating force of shifting the relative importance of nutrient enrichment and herbivory to seagrass and macroalgae. While herbivory played a vital role in maintaining the balance between the two primary producers in a turbid environment, nutrient enrichment tended to offset herbivory-induced biomass loss by promoting seagrass growth in a less turbid system. Additionally, two potential mechanisms that might regulate the responses of seagrasses and macroalgae to nutrient enrichment and herbivory under different turbidity are proposed. On the one hand, turbidity might mediate the feeding preference of herbivores. On the other hand, nutrient enrichment favors the growth of opportunistic macroalgae over seagrass in turbid systems. Our study emphasizes the mediating force of turbidity on seagrass ecosystems, and provides references for the protection and restoration of seagrass meadows under multiple environmental stressors, and prompts further studies on the feedback between sediment dynamics and seagrass meadows in the context of ecogeomorphology.

AB  - In the wet season of southern Africa's savannahs, surface water is extensive, allowing elephants to move widely. However, when surface water is restricted in the dry season, elephant use of the landscape is highly dependent on water availability and varies across the southern African region due to an aridity/rainfall gradient and different levels of supplementary provisioning of water. Movement analyses of elephants in the Kruger National Park (KNP), where water sources are mapped in detail, revealed that elephants make high turn angles at water sources; that is, they at least partially retrace the route taken to the water source. This insight allows us to posit water sources in other places where water sources are not adequately mapped and to ask whether elephant movements indicate that they find water easily (while roaming), or whether they must change direction to encounter water. Put simply, is water a waypoint or the destination? Using high-resolution satellite imagery, and data for 101 collared elephants in six reserves, we studied a west to east rainfall gradient from Namibia to South Africa. We used a quasi-experimental approach to compare protected areas along the rainfall gradient with highly supplemented water against areas with little or no water supplementation. Three patterns emerged from the analysis of the movement data. First, along rivers, where one might have expected widespread, ready access to water, there are particular, favoured destinations, suggesting that elephants use some places along rivers more than others, or that accessible water is not widely available. Second, along apparently dry riverbeds, elephants were able to access water. Finally, movement data uncovered water sources away from rivers where GIS layers on water availability are unavailable or incomplete. Our results further indicate that some protected areas have so many artificial water holes that they become waypoints - places that do not require unusual deviations from their roaming directions, allowing elephants to access food across wide areas during both wet and dry seasons. Where accessible water sources are few, elephant use is localised and intense, impacting surrounding vegetation.

AB  - On the flanks of > 6000 m Andean volcanoes that tower over the Atacama Desert, leaf-eared mice (Phyllotis vaccarum) live at extreme elevations that surpass known vegetation limits. The diet of these mice in these barren, hyperarid environments has been the subject of much speculation. According to the arthropod fallout hypothesis, sustenance is provided by windblown insects that accumulate in snowdrifts ("aolian deposits"). Mice may also feed on saxicolous lichen or forms of cryptic vegetation that have yet to be discovered at such high elevations. We tested hypotheses about the diet of mice living at extreme elevations on Atacama volcanoes by combining metagenomic and DNA metabarcoding analyses of gut contents with stable isotope analyses of mouse tissues. Genomic analyses of contents of the gastrointestinal tract of a live-captured mouse from the summit of Volcan Llullaillaco (6739 m) revealed an opportunistic but purely herbivorous diet, including lichens. Although we found no evidence of animal DNA in gut contents of the summit mouse, stable isotope data indicate that mice from elevations at or near vegetation limits (similar to 5100 m) include a larger fraction of animal prey in their diet than mice from lower elevations. Some plant species detected in the gut contents of the summit mouse are known to exist at lower elevations at the base of the volcano and in the surrounding Altiplano, suggesting that they may occur at higher elevations beneath the snowpack or in other cryptic microhabitats.

AB  - The activity budget of giraffe in various African populations has been studied extensively, revealing that it is affected by body size, foraging patterns, and sex. Foraging patterns show an animal's feeding choices in its environment and are influenced by resource availability, competition, and predation risk. The ability of giraffe to survive and reproduce is significantly impacted by the variation in activity budget and foraging across different ecosystems. Our study focused on evaluating the seasonal activity budgets and foraging patterns of Nubian giraffe in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. We used the scan sampling method to record the activity budget of giraffe which included foraging, movement, resting, and drinking water. We then evaluated if activities varied with the seasons. A total of 11,280 activities were documented, with 4560 (40.4%) occurring during the dry season and 6720 (59.6%) during the wet season. Foraging accounted for 53% of the time budget during the dry season, but increased to 57% during the wet season. There was a slight drop in records of movement (22%; n = 995 of 4560) and resting (25%; n = 1145 of 4560) from the dry season to the wet season (20%; n = 1375 out of 6720 and 22%; n = 1515 of 6720). During the dry season, females (53%) foraged longer than males (47%), whereas males (44%) had longer resting periods than females (56%). Giraffe frequently fed on Vachellia xanthophloea (67%; n = 4136 of 6215 foraging records), Maytenus senegalensis (19%), and Solanum incanum (9%) over both seasons. Overall, seasons had little impact on giraffe activity time budgets and foraging patterns in Lake Nakuru National Park. A better insight into the behavioural patterns of this subspecies will allow managers to enhance the protection and conservation of the species and its habitat. Heavy foraging on Vachellia by giraffe at LNNP has been associated with a population decline in number, so perhaps planting more of this species in LNNP could promote a rebound in numbers.

AB  - The dynamics of animal social structures are heavily influenced by environmental patterns of competition and cooperation. In folivorous colobine primates, prevailing theories suggest that larger group sizes should be favored in rainforests with a year-round abundance of food, thereby reducing feeding competition. Yet, paradoxically, larger groups are frequently found in high-altitude or high -latitude montane ecosystems characterized by a seasonal scarcity of leaves. This contradiction is posited to arise from cooperative benefits in heterogeneous environments. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a six-year field study on two neighboring groups of golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), a species representing the northernmost distribution of colobine primates. Results showed that the groups adjusted their movement and habitat selection in response to fluctuating climates and spatiotemporal variability of resources, indicative of a dynamic foraging strategy. Notably, during the cold, resource-scarce conditions in winter, the large group occupied food-rich habitats but did not exhibit significantly longer daily travel distances than the smaller neighboring group. Subsequently, we compiled an eco-behavioral dataset of 52 colobine species to explore their evolutionary trajectories. Analysis of this dataset suggested that the increase in group size may have evolved via home range expansion in response to the cold and heterogeneous climates found at higher altitudes or latitudes. Hence, we developed a multi-benefits framework to interpret the formation of larger groups by integrating environmental heterogeneity. In cold and diverse environments, even smaller groups require larger home ranges to meet their dynamic survival needs. The spatiotemporal distribution of high-quality resources within these expanded home ranges facilitates more frequent interactions between groups, thereby encouraging social aggregation into larger groups. This process enhances the benefits of collaborative actions and reproductive opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing travel costs through a dynamic foraging strategy.

AB  - The effects of human disturbance represent one of the major threats for wildlife conservation. Many studies have shown that wildlife avoids or reduces direct contact with human activities through changes in activity patterns, and by minimizing spatiotemporal overlap. In this study, we investigated the possible effects of human presence on the temporal activity of medium-to-large mammals using two areas in Myanmar that differ in the intensity of human disturbance. We monitored temporal segregation mechanisms using camera trapping data and with two statistical approaches: daily activity overlaps between humans and wildlife and circular statistics. We did not find a significant difference in overlapping activity between areas but, thanks to circular statistics, we found that some species show changes in activity patterns, suggesting temporal avoidance. We observed that the daily activity of five species differed between areas of Myanmar, likely adopting mechanisms to reduce overlap in areas highly frequented by humans. Interestingly, these species are all threatened by hunting or poaching activities, four of which have been described in literature as "cathemeral", or species that are active through day and night. This study suggests that some species adapt their behavior, at least partially, to avoid human presence in habitats with higher anthropic occurrence and increase our knowledge on the status of medium-large mammals in a poorly studied country as Myanmar.

AB  - Tapirs are common hosts of ticks and an individual can be infested by up to seven different tick species. We explored the parasitic tick fauna associated with wild Baird's tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) from the Yucatan Peninsula. A total of 326 ticks of 10 species of the Family Ixodidae were collected from 15 tapirs. We found a range of one to six tick species per host, but most of the tapirs were parasitized by two or three tick species. We tested the relationship between body condition, sex, and age classes of the tapirs versus the number of tick species on each host. The most common tick species was Amblyomma mixtum found on 93% of the hosts. Amblyomma pecarium, Amblyomma tenellum, Ixodes affinis and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato were recorded for the first-time parasitizing Baird's tapirs. We did not find a relationship between body condition, sex, and age classes of tapirs versus the number of parasitizing tick species. Our finding demonstrates that the richness of ticks parasitizing tapirs does not depend on the biological characteristics and health status of the host, but could be determined by other factors such as habitat use and the rate of contact with domestic animals.

AB  - The cleaning symbiosis in coral reef fish is one of the most remarkable mutualist marine interactions; the main actors are cleaner and client fishes, that communicate via tactile and visual stimulation, and the specific sites where this interaction happens are called cleaning stations. The removal of ectoparasites is a contribution to the health of clients, which may have an important role as herbivores or carnivores, and therefore also a contribution for a healthy ecosystem. The aim of this work was to identify the cleaning interaction as an indicator of reef health in the center-south of the Mexican Caribbean. Hence, we located and described the cleaning stations and the attributes of cleaner and client fishes for three climatic seasons in four locations with different degrees of conservation (i.e., time since declaration as protected areas), in the biosphere reserves of Sian Ka'an and Mexican Caribbean. Bluehead Thalassoma bifasciatum was the dominant cleaner fish in the dry and north-wind seasons, and it interacted with 27 species of client fishes year-round. The frequency of client fishes changes with the seasons; parrotfishes are the favorite clients in the dry season, and surgeonfishes for the north-wind season. We recorded for the first time high-hat Pareques acuminatus acting as a cleaner. Cleaning stations are more numerous in Mahahual, the location with the highest human impact; however, the higher structural complexity and area of this reef can explain the observed diversity of the client and cleaner species.

AB  - This work was aimed to identify androgen receptors (AR) in the spermatozoa of wild and domestic ruminants and to assess the effect of testosterone on sperm localization of aquaporin-3 (AQP3) and cryopreservation process. Sperm samples from wild species were incubated with testosterone (T group), 1,3-propanediol (PDO group), phloretin (PHL group), PDO+T group, PHL+T group. Western blot identified the presence of AR as a single band of about 48 KDa. Immunolabelling of AR was located in the equatorial segment of the sperm head. In mouflons, the cryoresistance ratio for acrosome integrity was lower (p < 0.05) in the PHL+T than in Control and T groups. In ibexes, the cryoresistance ratio for acrosome integrity was lower (p < 0.05) in the PHL+T, PHL, and T group than in the Control group; the cryoresistance ratios for sperm kinematic variables were lower (p < 0.05) in PDO+T than in Control. No changes were found among treatments in the proportion of spermatozoa showing AQP3 in the different membrane domains after incubation and thawing in both mouflon and ibex. In conclusion, testosterone negatively affected sperm cryoresistance expressed as acrosome integrity, enhancing the effects of the AQP blocker PHL. Our findings provide a sound knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that explain the seasonal variation in sperm freezability from ruminants.

AB  - Farmland abandonment reflects the decline of rural areas, resulting in a series of vicious chain reactions, hindering the promotion of the comprehensive rural revitalization strategy. From the perspective of ecological restoration, this paper integrated multi-source data such as Landsat, GF-1, and Google Earth images and household survey data, aiming to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern, attribution, and mechanism of farmland abandonment in typical mountainous areas over the past 20 years by employing spatial analysis and mathematical models and to promote comprehensive management of abandoned farmland. The results are as follows. (1) The scope of abandoned farmland in Chongqing has been expanding, with the abandoned area growing from 142,385.8 hm2 to 345,778.4 hm2 from 2000 to 2020, with the initially abandoned farmland mostly concentrated in the northeastern areas, such as Chengkou, with an abandonment rate of 21.8%, and thereafter, spreading in all directions; In the end, abandoned farmland was concentrated in northeastern and southeastern Chongqing, such as Wuxi and Youyang, with abandonment rates of approximately 25.1% and 20%, respectively. (2) The attribution of farmland abandonment mainly includes wild boar damage, labour shortage, and natural conditions, among which wild boar proliferation has become an important factor under the background of ecological restoration. (3) Ecological restoration has produced a counter-servicing effect of the ecosystem on human beings, forming a vicious circle in the mountainous countryside where ecological restoration continues to aggravate farmland abandonment. The contribution of this study is to investigate the pattern of farmland abandonment from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. At the same time, this paper explores the intrinsic mechanism between ecological restoration and farmland abandonment and proposes scientific countermeasures to break the vicious cycle of ecological restoration that continues to exacerbate farmland abandonment in mountainous areas.

AB  - Monitoring and assessing cardiac activity in animals, especially heart rate variability, has been gaining importance in the last few years as an indicator of animal health, well-being and physical condition. This pilot study tested the sensors based on ballistocardiography sensing the mechanical vibrations caused by the animal's cardiovascular system, which have proved useful in measuring cardiac activity in humans. To verify the accuracy of these measurement systems, the conventional measurements based on electrocardiography were carried out and the outcomes were compared. The main objectives were to verify the suitability of these sensors in measuring cardiac activity in animals, to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these sensors, and to identify future challenges. Measurements were performed on various animals, specifically a goat, a cow, a horse, and a sheep. Electrocardiographic measurement, which has demonstrated high accuracy in procedures for animals, was used as the study's gold standard. A disadvantage of this method, however, is the long time required to prepare animals and shear spots to attach electrodes. The accuracy of a ballistocardiographic sensor was compared to reference electrocardiographic signals based on Bland-Altman plots which analysed the current heart rate values. Unfortunately, the ballistocardiographic sensor was highly prone to poor adhesion to the animal's body, sensor movement when the animal was restless, and motion artefacts. Ballistocardiographic sensors were shown only to be effective with larger animals, i.e., the horse and the cow, the size of these animals allowing sufficient contact of the sensor with the animal's body. However, this method's most significant advantage over the conventional method based on electrocardiography is lower preparation time, since there is no need for precise and time-demanding fixation of the sensor itself and the necessity of shaving the animal's body.

AB  - Understanding responses of habitat suitability of migratory birds to the water level is significant for providing countermeasures of wetland protection. East Dongting Lake serves critical wintering habitat for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However, the response relationships between the water level and the weighted usable area (WUA) for migratory birds remain largely unknown. Therefore, we established a habitat suitability model of migratory birds based on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and recognized the change of WUA by comparing the transition of land-cover of similar hydrologic years before and after the operation of Three Gorge Dam (TGD). The results demonstrated that (1) the ecological water level of migratory birds in East Dongting Lake is 20.47-21.55 m. (2) Compared with the preTGD period, the start date of the ecological water level advanced by 25 days, the duration of the ecological water level increased by 16 days, and the fluctuation range of water level was more concentrated near the ecological water level, indicating that the TGD provides benefits for the migratory birds. (3) The most prominent transition among changes of land-cover was that the Reed beach (RB) (155.07 km(2)) and Marsh land (ML) (150.66 km(2)) changed to Tender Marsh land (TML) during dry hydrologic years, and the RB (171.90 km(2)) and ML (174.30 km(2)) changed to TML during normal hydrologic years. The findings show that water level changes habitat suitability of migratory birds by changing vegetation distribution at different elevations.

AB  - Background Despite recent advances in understanding the drivers of tree-level delayed mortality, we lack a method for mapping delayed mortality at landscape and regional scales. Consequently, the extent, magnitude, and effects of delayed mortality on post-fire landscape patterns of burn severity are unknown. We introduce a remote sensing approach for mapping delayed mortality based on post-fire decline in the normalized burn ratio (NBR). NBR decline is defined as the change in NBR between the first post-fire measurement and the minimum NBR value up to 5 years post-fire for each pixel. We validate the method with high-resolution aerial photography from six wildfires in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, and then compare the extent, magnitude, and effects of delayed mortality on landscape patterns of burn severity among fires and forest types.Results NBR decline was significantly correlated with post-fire canopy mortality (r(2) = 0.50) and predicted the presence of delayed mortality with 83% accuracy based on a threshold of 105 NBR decline. Plots with NBR decline greater than 105 were 23 times more likely to experience delayed mortality than those below the threshold (p < 0.001). Delayed mortality occurred across 6-38% of fire perimeters not affected by stand-replacing fire, generally affecting more areas in cold (22-41%) and wet (30%) forest types than in dry (1.7-19%) types. The total area initially mapped as unburned/very low-severity declined an average of 38.1% and generally persisted in smaller, more fragmented patches when considering delayed mortality. The total area initially mapped as high-severity increased an average of 16.2% and shifted towards larger, more contiguous patches.Conclusions Differences between 1- and 5-year post-fire burn severity maps depict dynamic post-fire mosaics resulting from delayed mortality, with variability among fires reflecting a range of potential drivers. We demonstrate that tree-level delayed mortality scales up to alter higher-level landscape patterns of burn severity with important implications for forest resilience and a range of fire-driven ecological outcomes. Our method can complement existing tree-level studies on drivers of delayed mortality, refine mapping of fire refugia, inform estimates of habitat and carbon losses, and provide a more comprehensive assessment of landscape and regional scale fire effects and trends.

AB  - Europe is currently undergoing dynamic land use changes causing the expansion of urban habitat, which is driving wildlife species to colonise conurbations, resulting in an increased likelihood of human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Understanding people's attitudes toward wildlife is essential to manage these conflicts. This study assessed people's attitudes toward urban wildlife, the types of conflicts that existed, preferences for managing conflict situations, and determined any changes in perceptions of urban wildlife over a decade. A questionnaire survey of residents of Krakow, the second-largest city in Poland, was conducted in 2010 (n = 721) and repeated in 2020 (n = 887). We found that encounters with certain urban wildlife such as wild boars, red squirrels, roe deer, brown hares, and red foxes had increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2010. Respondents reported that wild boar and beavers did not show fear when encountering humans. Stone martens were considered the most nuisance wildlife species in 2010, while in 2020 wild boar were the most conflictual wildlife species. There were additional reports of conflicts with roe deer and red foxes. The most frequent HWC responses were personal anxiety, intrusion into property and destruction of crops, which increased significantly over the decade, independent of respondents' gender. Respondents preferred nonlethal methods to mitigate conflicts. The study provides valuable information and knowledge on changes in people's attitudes toward urban wildlife that can help with wildlife management in urban areas. Incorporating perception and attitude data from the public, along with a multi-stakeholder approach that includes wildlife professionals, in the planning and design of future urban environments is critical to minimise HWC.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that closely related species can coexist if they segregate in space, time, or diet to reduce competitive overlap when resources are limited. These differences in ecological niche are presumably driven by concomitant differences in morphology. The link between form and functional segregation may only occur at 1 period of the year, and while examining behavioural differences among closely related species across the whole annual cycle can answer this question, it is rarely tested. Here, we investigated niche partitioning between sister species within the puffin clade: tufted puffins Fratercula cirrhata with high wing loading and rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata with low wing loading, breeding in sympatry on Middleton Island, Alaska. We collected data for horizontal movement, dive depth, and trophic ecology. Tufted puffins dived deeper, foraged closer to the colony during breeding, and migrated shorter distances relative to rhinoceros auklets. Examination of allometric patterns further revealed that puffins exceeded the predicted dive duration limit with exceptionally long dives. However, isotopic niches of the 2 species were very similar. Rhinoceros auklet breeding phenology was about 3 wk earlier than tufted puffin phenology, and breeding success during the study period was always higher for auklets than puffins. We conclude that the 2 species of sympatric puffin partitioned both in space and time throughout the annual cycle, illustrating how such partitioning can facilitate the coexistence of seabirds sharing apparently similar space.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB  - The biology of the weed goat's-rue, Galega officinalis (Fabaceae), is reviewed. Introduced to Canada in the late 19th Century as an ornamental, it has become established at scattered localities and is spreading locally in southern Ontario. The plant is considered a noxious weed and is legally regulated in many jurisdictions due to the production of toxic alkaloids and its invasive characteristics. Primarily a weed of pastures, grasslands and perennial crops, it also displaces native vegetation in areas where it becomes established. Originally endemic in the Black Sea region, it was spread by humans through Europe and eastward to Pakistan as a herbal medicine. More recently it has been introduced widely as a forage and ornamental plant. As a folk remedy it has been used primarily to treat diabetes in humans and to enhance milk production in both humans and livestock. The plant has also been used as a forage by limiting consumption to early growth stages and the quantity ingested. Effective control has been achieved with 2,4-D, dicamba, tryclopyr, metsulfuron methyl and other herbicides. Goat's-rue forms a highly specific nitrogen-fixin g symbiosis with the soil bacterium Neorhizobium galegae symbiovar officinalis. Successful establishment of Goat's rue in new regions depends on the co-introduction of plant and bac-terium. The lack of long-distance dispersal adaptations, soil pH requirements and its symbiont dependency, reduces the ability of G. officinalis to spread into novel areas without anthropogenic activities. These constraints to establishment may facilitate management and eradication strategies.

AB  - Context. Thermal imaging has been shown to be a valuable technique for detecting a range of terrestrial mammals across different environments. The limited studies looking at its effectiveness in detecting arboreal mammals in rainforest ecosystems have had mixed success due to the complexity of the environment and limitations of the technology itself. Aims. We investigated whether using a hand-held thermal imaging device would detect more individuals of six species of nocturnal arboreal mammal in tropical rainforests than the most-used detection method of spotlighting. We determined whether environmental variables effecting either equipment operation or mammal behaviour would influence these results. Methods. We surveyed eight transects across the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland for six species of arboreal mammals using both a hand-held thermal imager and a spotlight. We used a measure of underestimation to compare counts of individual species, and then modelled total mammal counts with detection method and environmental variables to find the best approximating model. Key results. Spotlighting underestimated the total number of each species by between 33 and 100% when compared with thermal imaging. Detection method alone without any environmental interaction term provided the best approximating model (AICc = 275.58, marginal pseudo R-2 = 0.286), with thermal imaging technology detecting almost double the number of our target individuals (12.3 +/- 1.76) compared with spotlighting (6.7 +/- 1.02). Conclusions. Despite recorded operational limitations, thermal imaging technology greatly improved our ability to locate both small and large nocturnal, arboreal mammals, including a species that is rarely observed in the wild.

AB  - We review the recent rise to prominence in Aotearoa New Zealand of predation-focused conservation management, critically assessing the likelihood that this will deliver outcomes consistent with national biodiversity goals. Using a review of literature describing the impacts and control of three groups of introduced mammals (wild ungulates, brushtail possums, and predators), we identify shifts in management emphasis over a century of conservation decision-making in Aotearoa. Predators are now a major focus and wild ungulates are left largely uncontrolled, despite increasing populations and evidence for their negative impacts on a wide range of indigenous species and ecosystems. This imbalance in management effort, which appears to be influenced increasingly by socio-political pressures, is much less likely to deliver outcomes consistent with Aotearoa's biodiversity goals than a systematic approach that addresses a full range of biodiversity threats. Overall, we interpret these shortcomings as reflecting long recognised issues with the governance and leadership of Aotearoa's biodiversity system. Changes are required to provide adequate, stable funding, improve clarity around goals, leadership, responsibilities and accountabilities, strengthen planning and prioritisation of management actions, and coordinate management among various conservation actors. We also argue for (1) a stronger role for ecological sciences through independent research aimed at strengthening the evidence base for management actions, and (2) explicit inclusion of science expertise in conservation policy development and management decision making. While recent extensive, landscape-scale predator control has caught the imagination of many and has undoubtedly delivered some gains for a small subset of indigenous species, it also risks creating a false sense of achievement that diverts attention away from other serious gaps in progress towards achieving national biodiversity goals. We make 12 recommendations to address these shortcomings.

AB  - Author summary
   Worldwide, ecosystems are collapsing or in danger of collapse, but the precise causes of these collapses are often unknown. Observational and experimental evidence shows that all ecosystems are characterized by strong interactions between and among species, and that these webs of interactions can be important contributors to the preservation of ecosystem diversity. But many of the interactions-such as those involving pathogenic microorganisms and the chemical defenses that are mounted by their prey-are not easily identified and analyzed in ecosystems that may have hundreds or thousands of species. Here we use our equal-area-annulus analytical method to examine census data from over three million trees in forest plots from around the world. We show how the method can be used to flag pairs and groups of species that exhibit unusual levels of interaction and that are likely on further investigation to yield information about their causative mechanisms. We give a detailed example showing how some of these interactions can be traced to defense mechanisms that are possessed by one of the tree species. We explore how our method can be used to identify the between-species interactions that play the largest roles in the maintenance of ecosystems and their diversity.
   When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands' physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees' distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.

AB  - Most studies of species interactions in rocky intertidal communities focus on invertebrate predators and herbivores interacting with sessile invertebrates and macrophytes. However, shorebirds are usually a conspicuous presence on rocky shores and eat sessile and mobile invertebrate prey, often including invertebrate predators and herbivores. Inspired by classic studies of strong bird predation effects in rocky intertidal habitats in Washington state (USA) and South Africa, I tested the effects of bird and invertebrate (sea stars, whelks) predation at multiple sites, wave exposures, and zones on the central Oregon coast from spring 1996 to fall 1997. To gain insight into the effects of birds relative to the effects of invertebrate predators, I used a crossed design, with bird exclusions (present and absent) and invertebrate predator removal (present and reduced). Compared to Washington state and South Africa, birds had little effect on the abundance of sessile or mobile prey in wave-exposed mid, wave-exposed low, and wave-protected mid zones at 2-4 sites. I suggest that differences between Oregon results and those in Washington and South Africa were driven by differences in bird abundance associated with whether the study site had resident colonies of shorebirds (primarily gulls, crows, and oystercatchers). That is, offshore islands often have resident breeding colonies such as in the Washington and South African studies, while sites in this study were all on the mainland where gulls were mostly transient visitors, while resident oystercatchers were usually limited to one or two pairs per site. Comparison with other marine and terrestrial experimental tests suggests that top-down effects of birds often vary in strength, and thus, future investigations should seek to understand the factors that underlie this variation.

AB  - Aims The spread of invasive weeds threatens biodiversity and stability of ecosystems. Jacobaea vulgaris is an invasive weed in some countries and an outbreak species in its native European range. Although biological control using specialist herbivores is available, controlling with soil microorganisms remains far less explored.Methods Twenty bacteria strains isolated from roots of J. vulgaris were used to examine bacterial effects on seed germination, root morphology and early plant growth. Moreover, we tested direct effects of the bacteria on a specialist herbivore of J. vulgaris, the leaf chewing caterpillar (Tyria jacobaeae), commonly used in biocontrol. We also tested indirect effects of bacteria, via the plant, on the performance of T. jacobaeae and the aphid species Aphis jacobaeae. Lastly, we examined the host specificity of two tested bacteria on three other forbs.Results Two Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonas brassicacearum and Serratia plymuthica, significantly reduced root growth of seedlings in-vitro, while seed germination was unaffected. However, these negative effects were observed across other forb species as well. Bacillus spp. injection led to the highest T. jacobaeae caterpillar mortality, while ingestion had no effect. Inoculation of the plants with bacteria did not affect aphid performance, but significantly affected T. jacobaeae preference. Specifically, P. syringae and one Bacillus sp. strain significantly increased T. jacobaeae preference.Conclusions Our results show that two root-associated bacteria inhibit J. vulgaris growth, but their lack of host specificity restricts their potential for biocontrol. Our study also highlights that belowground microorganisms can hamper or enhance the performance of aboveground insects.

AB  - Since prehistory, humans have altered the composition of ecosystems by causing extinctions and introducing species. However, our understanding of how waves of species extinctions and introductions influence the structure and function of ecological networks through time remains piecemeal. Here, focusing on Australia, which has experienced many extinctions and introductions since the Late Pleistocene, we compared the functional trait composition of Late Pleistocene (130,00-115,000 years before present [ybp]), Holocene (11,700-3,000 ybp), and current Australian mammalian predator assemblages (>= 70% vertebrate meat consumption; >= 1 kg adult body mass). We then constructed food webs for each period based on estimated prey body mass preferences. We found that introduced predators are functionally distinct from extinct Australian predators, but they rewire food webs toward a state that closely resembles the Late Pleistocene, prior to the megafauna extinctions. Both Late Pleistocene and current-day food webs consist of an apex predator and three smaller predators. This leads to food web networks with a similar total number of links, link densities, and compartmentalizations. However, this similarity depends on the presence of dingoes: in their absence, food webs become simplified and reminiscent of those following the Late Pleistocene extinctions. Our results suggest that recently established predators, even those implicated in species extinctions and declines, can restore complexity to food webs simplified by extinction.

AB  - Plants that bear oversized fruits, but do not co-occur with present-day large-bodied frugivores to disperse their seeds, are considered to represent seed dispersal anachronisms. It is hypothesized that these plants were originally dispersed by the megafauna that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. Accordingly, many plant species in South America bearing the so-called megafaunal fruits occur in ecosystems lacking native modern megafauna. In Chile, Lardizabala biternata is an endemic vine that produces a large edible fruit, with a morphology suggesting a megafaunal seed dispersal syndrome. This species grows across the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests and has a rather wide distribution, along which there are currently no large native vertebrates that could ingest its fruits and disperse the seeds. We hypothesized that foxes may be its present-day surrogate dispersers, because they are the only remnant mesofauna across L. biternata's range that include fruits in their diet. We collected fox scats periodically for 1 year and analyzed their contents, which revealed the presence of intact L. biternata seeds. These results suggest that foxes may be acting as present-day dispersers of this vine; however, it is unknown whether they provide effective dispersal. Our findings stress the fragmentary state of the knowledge of ecological interactions among species in Chilean ecosystems, opening new perspectives in terms of the role of terrestrial fauna in maintaining ecosystem functions.

AB  - Biostimulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a major concern in the environment due to their toxic nature and ubiquitous occurrence. The study aimed to determine the best animal supplement of organic carbon source (cow dung, goat dung, pig dung and poultry (fowl droppings) and indigenous microbes capable of mineralizing pyrene in clay soil. Clay soil sample was collected from the top surface soil (0 - 15 cm) in Ikpoba River and upper Lawani river bank, both in Benin City with the aid of stainless steel trowel and gloved hands and stored in a polyethylene bag. The isolation and identification process were evaluated by staining method, microscopic examination and biochemical tests. The degradation experiment was conducted in bioreactors and supplemented cow dung, pig dung, goat dung and fowl droppings were added in varying amounts of 25 g/l, 50 g/l, 75 g/l and 100 g/l. The potential effects of animal organic carbon as nutrient supplements to enhance mineralization of pyrene were investigated. The rates of mineralization of pyrene were studied for a remediation period of 35 days at room temperature of about 25 degrees C. Results obtained from microbial isolation showed that B. substilis and A. niger were the most populated in the soil and were therefore selected. The degradation experiment showed that mixed culture of B. substilis and A. niger using 50 g/l supplement with the dungs and droppings gave the highest percentage degradation with fowl droppings 98.3%, pig dung 98.1%, goat dung 97.8%, and cow dung 97.7%. The least degradation was observed in supplement with 100 g/l in a single culture of A. niger with fowl droppings yielded 64.5% degradation, pig dung 63.8%, goat dung 63.7% and cow dung 62.7%. The overall results of the study showed that 50 g/l of animal wastes supplement in the ratio of 1:4 with pyrene contaminated soils are most effective in degradation processes. Also the mixed culture of bacteria and fungi enhanced pyrene mineralization and degradation more than single culture.

AB  - Achieving ethically responsible decisions is crucial for the success of biodiversity conservation projects. We adapted the ethical matrix, decision tree, and Bateson's cube to assist in the ethical analysis of complex conservation scenarios by structuring these tools so that they can implement the different value dimensions (environmental, social, and animal welfare) involved in conservation ethics. We then applied them to a case study relative to the decision-making process regarding whether or not to continue collecting biomaterial on the oldest of the two remaining northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cotton:), a functionally extinct subspecies of the white rhinoceros. We used the ethical matrix to gather ethical pros and cons and as a starting point for a participatory approach to ethical decision-making. We used decision trees to compare the different options at stake on the basis of a set of ethical desiderata. We used Bateson's cube to establish a threshold of ethical acceptability and model the results of a simple survey. The application of these tools proved to be pivotal in structuring the decision-making process and in helping reach a shared, reasoned, and transparent decision on the best option from an ethical point of view among those available.

AB  - Little is known of insect biodiversity on Isla Guadalupe, a large (c. 250 km(2)) Pacific island located off the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, which has undergone more than 150 years of extensive habitat degradation owing to grazing by feral goats. Goats were successfully eradicated in 2007, and thus Isla Guadalupe provides a rare opportunity to study changes in biodiversity in the flora and fauna as the habitat in this isolated geographic region begins to recover. We conducted a preliminary survey of Lepidoptera biodiversity by collecting and observing mainly adult individuals during July-August, 2019. We also included previous observations from 2003-2016, and two historical records dating back to 1874 and 1922. Our annotated inventory includes 31 species of Lepidoptera (10 species of butterflies from four families, and 21 species of moths from seven families), and includes one butterfly species recorded 100 years ago that we did not find and which may be extirpated. Although life history stages were not recorded (except for the cosmopolitan Vanessa cardui), we also comment on the availability of potential larval host plants based on literature records from other regions. Most of the Lepidoptera species in our inventory (n = 22) have also been recorded from at least one of the comprehensively studied Channel Islands in southern California, USA, and all 31 species are also present on the California mainland. Thus, the Lepidoptera fauna on Isla Guadalupe recorded here corresponds to that associated with Californian Biogeographic Province.

AB  - Temperate deciduous forests by definition include a large proportion of woody species that shed their leaves each autumn and are completely leafless during winter months. Leaf senescence in deciduous trees is an active, complex process typically involving the physiological formation of an abscission layer causing the petiole to mechanically detach from the branch. However, several deciduous species retain all or some senesced leaves on branches through much of winter, a phenomenon called leaf marcescence. Marcescence has long fascinated botanists, including Pehr Kalm as early as 1749. Yet, surprisingly little research has been done to date. Here, we review and explore patterns and mechanisms of leaf marcescence in temperate forests, bringing together six nonmutually exclusive but separately proposed hypotheses: (1) Marcescence has no adaptive function but rather an evolutionary byproduct; (2) Marcescent leaves deter winter browsing herbivores; (3) Leaf retention through winter improves nutrient resorption during autumn senescence; (4) Prolonged leaf shedding into spring minimizes nutrient leaching and promotes decomposition; (5) Marcescent leaves protect overwintering buds from frost or desiccation; and (6) Marcescent canopies provide winter cover for animals (including insects, birds, bats), thereby affecting plant nutrient availability via excrement. No hypothesis has complete support and few tests of multiple hypotheses have been done. It is likely that any adaptive value of marcescence is species and context dependent. Despite increased interest in plant phenology and prevalence of this trait, much remains to be understood on the physiology, evolution, function, and ecological implications of leaf marcescence.

AB  - Natural habitats have been converted to urban areas across the globe such that many landscapes now represent matrices of developed and protected lands. As urbanization continues to expand, associated pressures on wildlife will increase, including effects on animals in adjacent protected habitats. For prey species (e.g., ungulates), an understanding of the ecological impacts of urbanization is typically confounded by coincident effects from cooccurring predators. Yet, understanding how urbanization affects prey behaviors in the absence of predators is becoming increasingly relevant as many top predators face extirpation. We placed camera traps at varying distances from urban areas within protected areas in the Florida Keys, USA, to evaluate the influence of urbanization on the behavior of the key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium), an endangered species that has been without non-human mammalian predators for ~ 4000 years. We predicted that as distance to urban areas decreased, key deer would use sites at the same rate, exhibit bigger group sizes, and shift activity patterns to be more nocturnal. Our results indicate that intensity of site use decreased with proximity to urban areas, potentially reflecting human avoidance. Group size increased closer to urban areas, consistent with other studies relating this behavior to anthropogenic subsidies and vigilance for humans. Activity patterns changed but did not become more nocturnal near urban areas as predicted by global analyses relating human disturbance to wildlife nocturnality. Our results have important implications for ungulate behavioral ecology and, taken together, suggest that influences on protected species from adjacent land uses are an important consideration when planning land use and designing protected areas.

AB  - In this study, sheep manure fertilizers with different dosages were used for five consecutive years to treat acidified tea plantation soils, and the effects of sheep manure fertilizer on soil pH value, nitrogen transformation, and tea yield and quality were analyzed. The results showed that soil pH value showed an increasing trend after a continuous use of sheep manure fertilizer from 2018 to 2022. After the use of low dosage of sheep manure fertilizer (6 t/hm(2)-15 t/hm(2)), tea yield, the content of tea quality indicators (tea polyphenols, theanine, amino acid, and caffeine) and soil ammonium nitrogen content, ammoniating bacteria number, ammoniating intensity, urease activity and protease activity showed increasing trends and were significantly and positively correlated to soil pH value, while the related indexes showed increasing and then decreasing trends after the use of high dosage of sheep manure fertilizer (18 t/hm(2)). Secondly, the nitrate nitrogen content, nitrifying bacteria number, nitrifying intensity, nitrate reductase activity, and nitrite reductase activity showed decreasing trends after the use of low dosage of sheep manure fertilizer and showed significant negative correlations with soil pH value, while the related indexes showed decreasing trends after the use of high dosage of sheep manure and then increased. The results of principal component and interaction analysis showed that the effects of sheep manure fertilizers with different dosages on tea yield and quality were mainly based on the transformation ability of ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the soil, and the strong transformation ability of ammonium nitrogen and the high ammonium nitrogen content in the soil were conducive to the improvement of tea yield and quality, and vice versa. The results of topsis comprehensive evaluation and analysis showed that the most influential effect on the fertilization effect was the ammonium nitrogen content in the soil and long-term treatment with 15 t/hm(2) of sheep manure fertilizer had the highest proximity to the best fertilization effect. This study provided an important practical basis for the remediation and fertilizer management in acidified tea plantation soils.

AB  - Animal migrations are some of the most ubiquitous and one of the most threatened ecological processes globally. A wide range of migratory behaviours occur in nature, and this behaviour is not uniform among and within species, where even individuals in the same population can exhibit differences. While the environment largely drives migratory behaviour, it is necessary to understand the genetic mechanisms influencing migration to elucidate the potential of migratory species to cope with novel conditions and adapt to environmental change. In this study, we identified genes associated with a migratory trait by undertaking pooled genome-wide scans on a natural population of migrating mule deer. We identified genomic regions associated with variation in migratory direction, including FITM1, a gene linked to the formation of lipids, and DPPA3, a gene linked to epigenetic modifications of the maternal line. Such a genetic basis for a migratory trait contributes to the adaptive potential of the species and might affect the flexibility of individuals to change their behaviour in the face of changes in their environment.

AB  - We examined dietary preferences of wild pigs to discern possible bait alternatives to corn. Captive trials were conducted during spring and fall 2021 in the Wild Pig Research Facility at Kerr Wildlife Management Area, Hunt, Texas, USA. We conducted 2-choice tests by allowing wild pigs to feed ad libitum on soybeans, split peas, mealworms, and peanuts (spring 2021), and oats, acorns, earthworms, and peanuts (fall 2021), always with corn available as a second choice for reference. In each trial, we used proportion of test bait eaten versus total bait eaten, and relative access to both food sources as indices of bait preference. We found that a higher proportion of corn was consumed than that of any test bait in the spring, but not in the fall. However, we found that earthworms were consumed more than any other test bait in the fall. We also found that corn was accessed more than test baits in the spring, but not more than earthworms or peanuts in the fall. Greater consumption of earthworms relative to other baits, and access rates comparable to corn indicated that earthworms could be an effective alternative bait to corn. Our work suggests that alternative baits may be equally or more effective for attracting wild pigs than corn.

AB  - Native forest establishment is an important mechanism to sequester carbon, increase biodiversity, prevent erosion, and improve water quality. Designing incentive programmes to encourage rural landholders to plant native trees on their land requires knowing what factors influence their decisions. We used a choice experiment to evaluate the impacts of various incentives to encourage native afforestation and regeneration on private lands in Aotearoa-New Zealand. The survey was completed by over 600 rural landholders, including dairy, sheep, beef and other livestock farmers and lifestyle block (smallholding or hobby farm) owners. We estimated a hurdle negative binomial model to quantify the impact of programme attributes and farm characteristics on both the probability of enrolment and the area committed to native forest establishment. Rural landholders showed interest in joining voluntary programmes to establish native forests if provided with appropriate monetary and non-monetary incentives and when native forest establishment aligned with their properties' characteristics. Differences in preferences existed between afforestation/planting and reversion/regeneration programmes. Monetary incentives were key to increasing enrolment and area commitment to both afforestation/planting and reversion/regeneration programmes. Providing seedlings or finding seedlings suppliers were the most important non-monetary incentives to encourage enrolment. Help with application and paperwork and help with planning and species selection encouraged enrolment in afforestation/planting programmes but not reversion/regeneration programmes. Property characteristics were important determinants of both enrolment and area commitment to the programmes. These results have important implications for policymakers charged with designing and implementing programmes encouraging native forest establishment.

AB  - Taking into account trophic relationships in seagrass meadows is crucial to explain and predict seagrass temporal trajectories, as well as for implementing and evaluating seagrass conservation policies. However, this type of interaction has been rarely investigated over the long term and at the scale of the whole seagrass habitat. In this work, reciprocal links between an intertidal seagrass species, Zostera noltei, and a herbivorous bird feeding on this seagrass species, the migratory goose Branta bernicla bernicla, were investigated using an original combination of long-term Earth Observation (EO) and bird census data. Seagrass Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) such as seagrass abundance and phenology were measured from 1985 to 2020 using high-resolution satellite remote sensing over Bourgneuf Bay (France), and cross-analysed with in situ measurements of bird population size during the goose wintering season. Our results showed a mutual relationship between seagrass and Brent geese over the four last decades, suggesting that the relationship between the two species extends beyond a simple grass-herbivore consumptive effect. We provided evidence of two types of interactions: (i) a bottom-up control where the late-summer seagrass abundance drives the wintering population of herbivorous geese and (ii) an indirect top-down effect of Brent goose on seagrass habitat, where seagrass development is positively influenced by the bird population during the previous wintering season. Such a mutualistic relationship has strong implications for biodiversity conservation because protecting one species is beneficial to the other one, as demonstrated here by the positive trajectories observed from 1985 to 2020 in both seagrass and bird populations. Importantly, we also demonstrated here that exploring the synergy between EO and in situ bird data can benefit seagrass ecology and ecosystem management.

AB  - 1. Foraging on crops by wild ungulates may create human-wildlife conflicts through reducing crop production. Ungulates interact with and within complex socio-ecological systems, making the reduction of crop damage a challenging task. Aside from ungulate densities, crop damage is influenced by different drivers affecting ungulate foraging behaviour: food availability and food quality in the landscape (i.e. the foodscape) as well as fear from hunting and scaring actions (i.e. the landscape of fear) may together affect the degree of damage via both direct and indirect effects. A better understanding of the individual effects of these potential drivers behind crop damage is needed, as is an appreciation of whether the effects are dependent on ungulate density.
   2. We investigated this by applying path analysis to test indirect and direct links between ungulate density, foodscape, landscape of fear and human management goals on crop damage of oats and grass, respectively.
   3. Our results suggest that crop type is the major driver behind crop damage, with more damage to oats than to leys, implying that human decisions (i.e. changing crop type) influence the level of crop damage.
   4. We found that management goals and actions influenced the foodscape and the landscape of fear, by affecting the amount of forage produced in the agricultural landscape and the amount of scaring actions. Additionally, we found that supplementary feeding influenced the local ungulate densities in the area.
   5. Our results highlight the importance of including human actions on multiple levels when assessing drivers behind damage by ungulates in managed landscapes. We suggest that more studies using path analysis on multiple scales are needed in order to tackle complex issues, such as crop damage and other human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Trapa natans L. (water caltrop and water chestnut) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity. 2. The water caltrop is an annual herbaceous hydrophyte rooted in the sediment of water bodies, forming flexuous underwater stems that create a buoyant, light-capturing leaf rosette at the water surface. The submerged stem nodes additionally bear linear leaves. These are replaced by photosynthetically active, pinnately branched structures and unbranched adventitious roots early on, which complement previously established roots on the hypocotyl, altogether facilitating anchorage, nutrient and water absorption, aeration and capture of subsurface irradiance. Solitary flowers pollinated primarily through autogamy and incidentally through entomophily give rise to a fully developed edible single-seeded drupe with two to four barbed horns. Fruits are dispersed with the help of hydrochory, epizoochory and anthropochory. 3. Throughout its lowland, global temperate, subtropical and tropical distribution in Eurasia and Africa, the thermophilic macrophyte is found in shallow, sun-exposed, nutrient-rich freshwater bodies with low-velocity flows and steady water levels. These offer slightly acidic to mildly basic conditions. The accompanying soft substrate is usually characterized by a high organic matter content. Regularly co-occurring with other macrophytes, some of which are also of conservation concern, such as those in rare stands of the association Trapetum natantis in Europe, the water caltrop has at times been outcompeted, though it may form monodominant stands, due to several competitive features. 4. Formerly widespread in Europe, T. natans is today recognized as a rare, strictly protected macrophyte. It has been introduced to Australia and North America; on the latter continent, its naturalization, spread and aggressive overgrowth have led to extensive control efforts. Having been used as a crop since Neolithic times, it is still exploited in Asia for means of food production, phytoremediation, ornamental purposes, medication and alternative uses.

AB  - Uncovering the patterns and structure in species interactions is central to understanding community assembly and dynamics. Species interact via their phenotypes, but identifying and quantifying the traits that structure species-specific interactions (links) can be challenging. Where these traits show phylogenetic signal, link properties (such as which species interact and how often) may be predictable using models that incorporate phylogenies in place of trait data. However, quantification of phylogenetic patterns in link properties is conceptually and methodologically challenging because it requires coestimation of multiple phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic pattern types in interaction data for multiple sites while controlling for confounding effects and making biologically plausible assumptions about which species can interact. Here we show how this can be done in a Bayesian mixed modeling framework, using data for trophic interactions between oak cynipid galls and parasitoid natural enemies. We find strong signatures of cophylogeny (i.e., related parasitoids attack related host galls) in both link incidence (presence/absence) and link frequency data, alongside patterns in link incidence/richness and identity across sites that are independent of either parasitoid or gall wasp phylogeny. Our results are robust to substantially reduced sample completeness and are consistent with structuring of trophic interactions by a combination of phylogenetically conserved and phylogenetically labile traits in both trophic levels. We show that incorporation of phylogenetic relationships into analyses of species interactions has substantial explanatory power even in the absence of trait data, with potential applied use in prediction of natural enemies of invading pests and nontarget hosts of biocontrol agents.

AB  - Large-bodied animals play irreplaceable roles in seed dispersal, partly due to their capacity to disperse large seeds. Understanding this role at a community level has been limited by the paucity of network studies that include large vertebrates, and the almost complete absence of studies including synzoochoric dispersers. Synzoochoric dispersers can disperse seeds disproportionately large for their body size, potentially overlapping the roles of large-bodied animals. A comprehensive network, inclusive of large vertebrates and synzoochorous dispersers, is imperative to understand seed dispersal at a community level. Here, we analysed the seed dispersal network of a hyper-diverse Sundaic forest in Malaysia using local ecological knowledge and including multiple forms of endozoochorous and synzoochorous dispersal. We evaluated the extent to which three disperser traits: body mass, seed-handling ability (size of the largest seed dispersed) and diet explained the importance of animals in the network. We evaluated dispersers' relative importance using four network metrics-degree of specialisation (nested rank), species strength, within-module connectivity (z-value) and between-modules connectivity (c-value). We found that seed-handling ability had the biggest effect on a disperser's importance, with strong effects on three network metrics (species strength, ecological specialisation and z-value) and moderate effects on connectivity between modules. Body mass was important in defining interactions within modules, and dietary differences defined the ecological specialisation of species in seed dispersal. Important dispersers in our network were large-seed dispersers (e.g. rats, gibbons), large-bodied animals, in particular the Asian elephant, and animals with frugivorous diets such as hornbills. Synthesis. Our work uncovers the significance of seed-handling ability in identifying pivotal seed dispersal roles in tropical rainforests. Key dispersers include large-bodied herbivores and medium-sized frugivores that could disperse large seeds by endozoochory, and smaller rodents that dispersed similar-sized seeds by synzoochory. Many of the species that emerged as particularly important for the seed dispersal network are currently threatened (e.g. the Asian elephant, gibbons and hornbills). Their protection or reintroduction should be a top conservation priority.

AB  - Plant-soil microbe interactions are a key determinant of plant community composition and structure, with each plant species generating a unique soil microbiota. However, the degree of intraspecific variation in plant-soil microbe interactions in controlling plant performance has been much less investigated. We examined the strength of plant-soil microbe interactions across Solidago altissima and Schizachyrium scoparium seedlings grown in soils cultured by 24 genotypes of S. altissima in a greenhouse setting to determine the level of variation within these two target species. We also quantified leaf chemical variation across S. altissima genotypes using HPLC characterization of foliar constituents as a potential driver of below-ground processes. The impacts of soil microbe-mediated effects of genotypes ranged from negative to positive for both target species. Target species responses to the 24 soil microbial communities were positively correlated, although the strength of plant-soil microbe interactions was related to foliar chemistry for S. scoparium, but not for S. altissima. The magnitude of impacts in soils pooled from all 24 S. altissima genotypes was more negative than the average impact of genotypes tested individually, suggesting that this methodology cannot be used to assess 'average' effects. Our results strongly argue that intraspecific variation in plant-soil microbe interactions may be a quite large source of variation in systems dominated by clonal plants. Furthermore, simple inocula pooling obscured this variation and resulted in a marked bias toward the more antagonistic components of the soil microbial community.

AB  - The decomposition of wetland plant litter is pivotal in the functioning of wetland ecosystems in terms of organic matter mineralization progress and nutrient cycling. Aiming to investigate the effects of the droppings of wintering herbivorous waterbirds on the decomposition of Carex cinerascens Kukenth litter a newly designated Ramsar Site, decomposition patterns of three types of samples were characterized and compared by waterbird dropping addition and litterbag in situ experiment. The three types of samples are OCL (only C. cinerascens litter), OWD (only waterbird droppings) and CMD (C. cinerascens litter mixed with waterbird droppings), respectively. A total of 105 decomposition bags were placed and the experiment lasted 150 days. The results showed that the average decay rate of C. cinerascens cellulose increased by approximately 32.12% by the addition of bird droppings, while the C. cinerascens lignin decay rate increased by approximately 83.05%. And the release of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous of C. cinerascens increased by approximately 18.3%, 61.09%, and 66.71%, respectively. We concluded that the addition of waterbird droppings significantly accelerated the decomposition of C. cinerascens litter and the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. We have a preliminary deduction that waterbird droppings (1) altered the original stoichiometric ratio of the litter, (2) increased the available nutrient content, (3) increased the colonization ability of the microorganisms, and (4) stimulated the production of a series of extracellular degradation enzymes. This study provides a thinking that the important role of waterbirds should be given full attention in wetland restoration planning and management.

AB  - Small rodent population cycles characterise northern ecosystems, and the cause of these cycles has been a long-lasting central topic in ecology, with trophic interactions currently considered the most plausible cause. While some researchers have rejected plant-herbivore interactions as a cause of rodent cycles, others have continued to research their potential roles. Here, we present an overview of whether plants can cause rodent population cycles, dividing this idea into four different hypotheses with different pathways of plant impacts and related assumptions. Our systematic review of the existing literature identified 238 studies from 150 publications. This evidence base covered studies from the temperate biome to the tundra, but the studies were scattered across study systems and only a few specific topics were addressed in a replicated manner. Quantitative effects of rodents on vegetation was the best studied topic, and our evidence base suggests such that such effects may be most pronounced in winter. However, the regrowth of vegetation appears to take place too rapidly to maintain low rodent population densities over several years. The lack of studies prevented assessment of time lags in the qualitative responses of vegetation to rodent herbivory. We conclude that the literature is currently insufficient to discard with confidence any of the four potential hypotheses for plant-rodent cycles discussed herein. While new methods allow analyses of plant quality across more herbivore-relevant spatial scales than previously possible, we argue that the best way forward to rejecting any of the rodent-plant hypotheses is testing specific predictions of dietary variation. Indeed, all identified hypotheses make explicit assumptions on how rodent diet taxonomic composition and quality will change across the cycle. Passing this bottleneck could help pinpoint where, when, and how plant-herbivore interactions have - or do not have - plausible effects on rodent population dynamics.

AB  - Sea stars (class Asteroidea) can play powerful and wide-ranging roles as consumers of algae and other prey in benthic ecosystems worldwide. In the Gal ' apagos rocky subtidal zone, sea stars are abundant and diverse, but their distribution, feeding habits and ecological impacts have received little attention. We compared diets and distributions of the six most abundant sea star species to examine their functional roles. Bi-annual censuses carried out between 2006 and 2014 at two depths (6-8 m, 12-15 m) at 12 sites in Gal ' apagos identified two abundance "hotspots" and revealed higher densities at locations with more heterogeneous benthic topographies. Field surveys showed a high incidence of feeding (35-68% of individuals across species) and distinct diets were evident for each species in terms of food items and dietary breadth, suggesting niche partitioning. Most species can be classified as facultative herbivores, with diets dominated by crustose and turf algae supplemented by a small proportion of sessile invertebrates. The two most abundant species, Pentaceraster cumingi and Nidorellia armata, had the narrowest diets. Field prey selectivity experiments identified P. cumingi as a size-selective predator of small pencil urchins Eucidaris galapagensis. In field caging experiments, N. armata reduced biomass of unbleached crustose coralline algae by 72%. In the context of emerging threats such as disease, ocean acidification and climate change, a deeper understanding of the distinct functional roles of sea stars can inform ecological models and management plans.

AB  - As one of the last remaining naturally grazed ecosystems on Earth, the Serengeti National Park is an ideal location to study the influence of migratory mammals on the structure of microbial communities and the factors that generate biogeography of soil microbes. Furthermore, volcanic inputs generate environmental gradients that may also structure microbial communities. We studied 16S rRNA amplicons in a 13-year herbivore removal experiment to examine the influence of grazing and environmental gradients on the natural distribution of soil microbes. Removal of mammalian herbivores shifted microbial community structure, with 31 taxa that were significant indicator taxa of the ungrazed treatment and three taxa that were indicators of the grazed treatment. The abundance of many taxa were correlated with soil texture, phosphorus, iron, calcium and rainfall, and the evenness of taxa within samples was also correlated with these variables. Bayesian general linear mixed effects models with single predictors of multiple, highly correlated variables of beta diversity were consistent with a significant, but weak (2%), effect of grazing, and stronger effects of phosphorus (14%). Beta diversity of microbial communities was greater in grazed than in ungrazed plots; suggesting that the impacts of grazing on community assembly of microbes results from deterministic environmental filtering caused by the influence of herbivores on plant communities and soil properties rather than stochastic dispersal via herds of large mammals. These herbivore effects are superimposed on deterministic environmental filtering by natural soil and precipitation gradients across the Serengeti. (C) Higher Education Press 2020

AB  - Understanding how species adapt to environmental change is necessary to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Growing evidence suggests species can adapt rapidly to novel selection pressures like predation from invasive species, but the repeatability and predictability of selection remain poorly understood in wild populations. We tested how a keystone aquatic herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, evolved in response to predation pressure by the introduced zooplanktivore Bythotrephes longimanus. Using high-resolution 210Pb-dated sediment cores from 12 lakes in Ontario (Canada), which primarily differed in invasion status by Bythotrephes, we compared Daphnia population genetic structure over time using whole-genome sequencing of individual resting embryos. We found strong genetic differentiation between populations approximately 70 years before versus 30 years after reported Bythotrephes invasion, with no difference over this period in uninvaded lakes. Compared with uninvaded lakes, we identified, on average, 64 times more loci were putatively under selection in the invaded lakes. Differentiated loci were mainly associated with known reproductive and stress responses, and mean body size consistently increased by 14.1% over time in invaded lakes. These results suggest Daphnia populations were repeatedly acquiring heritable genetic adaptations to escape gape-limited predation. More generally, our results suggest some aspects of environmental change predictably shape genome evolution.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are immensely important for the livelihoods, nutrition, and cultural identities of millions of people, but their impacts are less understood than those of industrial fisheries. On the island of Teraina in Kiribati's Northern Line Islands, sharks have traditionally been harvested only occasionally for cultural purposes. At the turn of the century, growing access to international markets drove sharp increases in harvests, but the fishery remained small, comprising only 17 fishers in 2013, and a ban on commercial shark fishing and trade was implemented in 2016. To understand the possible impacts of this fishery, we interviewed each fisher, obtaining estimates of catch and effort as early as 1983 and validating these estimates with storehouse inventories. We combined these data with previously published tag-recapture data for grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos at nearby Palmyra Atoll to inform a Bayesian production model for Teraina's grey reef shark population. Our model suggests that a small number of fishers and motorized boats could plausibly have driven a significant reduction in grey reef shark abundance on surrounding reefs, declining by as much as 75% in as few as 15 yr. Recent ecological and social surveys confirm that shark populations in the Line Islands are likely severely depleted. These results highlight the vulnerability of sharks and other slow-growing marine megafauna to relatively modest small-scale fishing efforts. As few communities, even those that are relatively geographically isolated, remain disconnected from global trade networks, our research suggests a need for management and trade regulations at trans-national scales.

AB  - The Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze agroforestry system has been a dominant driver of land transformation for over a century. However, most previous studies have not captured the dynamics of tea plantations since their inception. To address this research gap, this study investigates 150 years (1876 to 2023) of tea area dynamics and two decades (2001-2022) of tree loss in the Bengal-Dooars region (Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts). Various data sources were employed, including Sentinel-2A imagery (10 m), early twentieth century topographic maps at a 1:50,000 scale, and historical records from the British colonial period. Results revealed that the tea area expanded from 331 to 95,800 ha (a 70% increase) during the study period. The 1-km grid-wise spatial analysis indicated that approximately 70% of the increase was attributed to the 60-90% and > 90% grid categories, signifying the expansion of large tea estates. Most tea gardens (TG) are sustained with trees, which can significantly contribute to carbon stock. Tree loss within and outside TG for 2001-2022 was analyzed using annual tree loss data at 30 m from the Global Forest Watch (GFW) platform. Between 2001 and 2022, about 52.7% of tree loss was attributed to TG, although tea covers only 15.3% of the geographic area of the study region. Our findings highlight the historical expansion of tea plantations and their impact on natural land cover. We suggest that future studies address the mean age of TG along with tree fractions for improved carbon estimates.

AB  - IntroductionLarvae of the invasive emerald ash borer [EAB, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)], kill over 99% of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) trees they infest, yet a small percentage of green ash ("lingering ash") survive years of heavy EAB attack. In the face of an ongoing invasion that threatens multiple North American Fraxinus species with extinction, any evidence for reproducible defensive responses in the native species merits investigation. MethodsWe evaluated the capacity of three families of green ash F-1 progeny to kill EAB larvae when challenged in greenhouse studies by infestation with a uniform density of EAB eggs followed by dissection 8 weeks post-infestation and comparison of the host metabolomic profiles. ResultsThe mean proportions of host-killed larvae in the two families of F-1 progeny from lingering ash parents were significantly higher than that of host-killed larvae in the family of F-1 progeny from susceptible ash parents (p < 0.001). Untargeted metabolomics comparing F-1 progeny in the quartile with the highest percent host-killed larvae (HHK) to F-1 progeny in the quartile with the lowest percent host-killed larvae (LHK) and to the uninfested F-1 progeny within each family revealed evidence for induced biochemical responses to EAB. Infested trees produced significantly higher levels of select secoiridoids than uninfested trees, and LHK progeny produced significantly higher levels of select secoiridoids than the HHK progeny. HHK progeny produced significantly higher abundances of three metabolites annotated as aromatic alkaloids than the LHK and uninfested individuals. DiscussionBased on these results, we hypothesize that green ash responds to EAB infestation. However, only certain trees have the genetic capacity to tailor a response that kills enough EAB larvae to prevent lethal damage to the vascular system. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis will require 15-20 years of additional crossing, phenotyping, and omics analyses. The results of this investigation will encourage the establishment and continuation of breeding programs that, in concert with biocontrol and management, could provide trees that slow, if not halt, the decimation of the Fraxinus gene pool. At the same time, ongoing work on host-insect interaction will contribute to our understanding of how forest trees recognize and defend themselves against phloem-feeding insects.

AB  - The race is on to achieve an important level of efficiency in the attainment of a circular economy in agriculture especially with the aim of sustainable nitrogen management. This cycle in the agricultural sector cuts across livestock farming, agriculture-induced waste generation, recycling and utilization, energy generation, crop production, ecosystem protection and environmental management through the mitigation of climate changes. In this work, we assess the process and functionalities of livestock waste generated from the piggery farm and their combinations with other by-products such as biochar and ash in comparison with mineral fertilization as sources of nitrogen applied in agricultural soil. The experiment was performed in a controlled environment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a neutral and an acidic soil. Pig manure was used as the primary feedstock, fed and processed to biogas and nutrient-rich digestate by the anaerobic digestion process. The results revealed that the co-amendments of pig manure digestate with biochar and ash had complimentary positive effect on measured indices such as mobile potassium, phosphorus, biomass yield and nitrogen use efficiency. The mineral nitrogen fertilizer significantly induced carbon dioxide emissions from day 35 when compared to emissions from the organic amendments. In contrast, the organic amendments influenced nitrous oxide emissions from the onset till day 30 before flattening out. The individual combination of pig manure digestate with biochar and ash had a negative influence on enzymatic activity (dehydrogenase). Soil microbial biomass carbon was induced across all treatments in both soil types. Pig manure digestate + ash and pig manure digestate had 32.1 and 48.8% soil microbial biomass increase in neutral soil and acidic soil, respectively. Overall, the processing and application of single-use amendment or in combination with biochar and ash holds huge potential in the optimization of nitrogen and carbon efficiency towards sustainable soil management via improving soil quality, carbon sequestration and climate change.

AB  - Paleontological remains retrieved from permafrost represent the most informative records of Pleistocene ecosystems. Different levels of past microbial activity affecting fossil material preservation are presented for two selected bone samples-an almost intact Bison sp. metacarpus (45.0 +/- 5.0 C-14 ka BP) and a weathered Equus sp. metacarpus (37.8 +/- 1.7 C-14 ka BP) from the recently exposed cryogenic geo-contexts in the Yana River basin, NE Yakutia. Diagenetic changes in bone porosity and chemical composition as a result of the past microbial activity were investigated by multiple analytical methods. In the bison bone, which was permafrost-sealed shortly after death of the animal and conserved for ca. 45 ka in a frozen state in a cryolithic formation, only superficial microbial degradation processes were detected. Progressive microbial attacks characterize the horse bone, which was exposed to MIS 3 sub-aerial biogenic decay and modern surficial weathering. This is evidenced by extensive bacterial micro-boring with the typical focal destructions, an increase in microbial porosity, and de-mineralized osseous zones due to waterlogged and poorly oxygenated past depositional conditions. New information contributes to better understanding of the diagenesis particularities and the associated chemical and biological agents of the fossil osteological assemblages with respect to their taphonomic and paleoenvironmental implications.

AB  - Integrated agricultural systems have been greatly expanding in Brazil and currently cover over 30 million hectares. Although these land use systems help soil and environmental quality, little is known of their impacts on earthworm communities. In the present study we evaluated earthworm abundance, biomass and species richness in various integrated and conventional agricultural production systems (pasture, crops), as well as native forest and Eucalyptus plantations. The research was carried out at Fazenda Canchim (Embrapa Livestock Southeast) and at the neighboring campus of the University de Sao Carlos (UFSCar), in Sao Carlos municipality in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Two earthworm sampling methods, i.e., quantitative (25 x 25 x 20 cm deep monoliths) and qualitative (holes of similar size and niche sampling), were used in three integrated production systems, three conventional systems and two forest systems, totaling 232 quantitative samples and over 160 qualitative samples. Earthworms were counted and identified using available keys. Eight earthworm species of five families (Rhinodrilidae, Ocnerodrilidae, Megascolecidae, Benhamiidae and Glossoscolecidae) were found, with most of the 2,145 individuals being exotic or peregrine species, particularly Pontoscolex corethrurus (88% of total) and various Dichogaster spp. (8% of total). Two native species were encountered in low abundance (55 individuals), both of which are new to science (Fimoscolex n.sp.7 and Glossoscolex n.sp.9) and must still be formally described. The new species were found in the agricultural systems, but not in the native forest and the Eucalyptus plantation, where P. corethrurus and Megascolecids predominated. One unidentified Ocnerodrilid sp. was found only in the intensive pasture. Species richness was highest in the intensive pasture (7 spp.), followed by the agrosilvopastoral and agropastoral systems, highlighting the importance of integrated and pastoral systems in preserving earthworm richness and native species.

AB  - High-quality natural regeneration is the key to close-to-nature management, but forest inventories often fail to provide sufficient information. In 2023, we conducted additional sampling of regeneration in a network of permanent sampling plots on the Pahernik property. We found acceptable average densities for seedlings below 130 cm height, with 15,924 individuals hat, less satisfactory densities for saplings above 130 cm height and < 5 cm diameter, with 994 individuals hat, and low densities for saplings between 5 and 10 cm diameter, with 276 individuals ha(-1). On average, regeneration covered 24% of the forest floor, while ground vegetation covered 11%. There were no major differences in regeneration density and cover between elevations and spatially separated parts of the property. The regeneration was dominated by Norway spruce (38%), followed by silver fir (32%) and beech (26%). The high proportion of silver fir was due to its high densities in the height class up to 20 cm. In the higher classes, silver fir was less represented and increasingly browsed by ungulates. The average browsing rate of regeneration up to 1.3 m was 33%, and specifically for silver fir, 39%. This study indicates possibilities for improving the forest inventory.

AB  - The effects of sediment elutriate, prepared from a sediment resuspension simulation process, on the growth of bacterioplankton and of different sized phytoplankton as well as on their grazing by protozooplankton were investigated in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems during spring phytoplankton bloom. In parallel, the response of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and protozooplankton to sediment elutriate enrichment was assessed in microcosm experiments. Elutriate addition provoked a high enrichment in nutriments of the overlying water, particularly in ammonium, dissolved organic matter but also in trace metal elements and herbicides. Overall, elutriate addition significantly increased the biomass of bacterioplankton and of total phytoplankton, but the phytoplankton size fractions responded differently to elutriate enrichment. The picophytoplankton showed a significant strong enhancement in both growth and production rates, relatively to control, while these rates significantly decreased for nano- and micro-phytoplankton. Accordingly, the phytoplankton size structure shifted in elutriate microcosm toward a dominance of the picophytoplankton concomitant with a significant reduction in larger size fractions. The elutriate addition caused also a clear shift in the taxonomic composition of protozooplankton, associated with a significant modification of its functional diversity, with the dominance of pico-sized cell consumers (such as aloricate ciliates, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and mixotrophic dinoflagellates) in the detriment of grazers of nano- and microphytoplankton (such as heterotrophic dinoflagellate). The protozooplankton grazing on small prey (bacterioplankton and picophytoplankton) increased, while feeding on nanoand micro-sized phytoplankton decreased after elutriate addition. These results have implication for the carbon transfer pathway, which could change from an herbivorous food web to a microbial food web, influencing so the exportation of biogenic carbon through the other trophic compartments.

AB  - Keymessage Populus nigra and Picea abies achieved the largest standing volume at 50 years of age in basalt mountainous sites in Central Europe, but they also present the highest risk in the case of rising temperature and drought extremes. The most climatically resistant tree species were Larix decidua and Alnus glutinosa, which had a lower productivity in the current conditions. Based on carbon sequestration, growth, and damage rate, a revision of selected tree species capable of fulfilling production and non-production functions of the forest in the setting of global climate change was performed. Stands of Norway spruce, European larch, sycamore maple, black alder, and black poplar on abandoned farmland in the Doupovske hory Mts., Czech Republic, were analyzed. At about 52 years of age, spruce had the significantly highest average stand volume (417 m(3) ha(-1)), while the highest carbon sequestration in tree biomass was found in poplar (169 t ha(-1)). On the contrary, maple showed the lowest average stand volume (183 m(3) ha(-1)) and the amount of carbon (90 t ha(-1)). While maple radial increment was mostly negatively influenced by precipitation, the growth of spruce and poplar generally correlated positively (r = 0.26-0.33) with precipitation. For other tree species, the correlation was non-significant. Alder and larch were the most robust to climate factors, while the most climate-sensitive tree species was maple in relation to radial growth. The lowest tree damage was observed in alder (8% trees of the same species were damaged) and maple (9%). Larch (36%) and poplar (51%) differed from the previous two, due to many breaks, while the most damage was confirmed in spruce (74%) because of bark stripping and rot. The establishment of mixed stands of spruce with larch and maple may be regarded as a climate-smart silvicultural approach with clear environmental and economic benefits. On sites with high groundwater levels, poplar and alder represent a feasible alternative.

AB  - An unexpected human-wildlife conflict between vultures and livestock has emerged in Europe during the last two decades. Farmers attributed changes in vulture behavior, due to food shortages caused by sanitary regulations, to increasing livestock interactions ('vulture attacks'). To disentangle this conflict, we analyzed 683 farmer complaints between 1996 and 2020 in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) and investigated the eco-anthropological factors driving their frequency. We also assessed farmers' perception through 127 interviews. Most complaints (80 %) occurred during the birthing season, mainly involving cattle (76.5 %), followed by horses (14.9 %) and sheep/goats (8.6 %). From 2008 to 2020, vulture-livestock conflicts cost the government (sic)192,000 (similar to 22 % of claims compensated). The frequency of complaints was positively associated with extensive livestock density, griffon vulture Gyps fulvus abundance (breeding and non-breeding), shorter distances to landfill sites and, to a lesser extent, to supplementary feeding stations. In contrast, there was a negative relationship between complaints and the number of griffon vulture breeding pairs, suggesting that long-distance foraging movements by both breeding and non-breeding individuals may play a major role in determining the occurrence of conflicts. Farmers (88 %) said that vultures attack livestock and that attacks had increased in recent years because of significant vulture population increases and food shortages due to sanitary regulations. They considered government policies and compensation ineffective. We highlight the critical need for mitigation in areas with high extensive livestock numbers, particularly during birthing times. Scientific assessments and interdisciplinary awareness campaigns on the coexistence of vultures and livestock are necessary to harmonize biodiversity conservation and agro-pastoral practices in rural economies.

Folia Biologica (Krakow) 71: 01-11. Domestic pigs and wild boars have undergone frequent interspecies crossbreeding; therefore, the presence of hybrids makes it challenging to find genetic markers that distinguish both subspecies. The aim of this research is to identify the DNA regions that underwent strong selection during the domestication of the pig and to give an insight into the genetic diversity of the Polish wild boar and domestic pigs by implementing the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique. We studied two groups of animals: one consisted of do-mestic pigs (Landrace, Large White, Duroc, Pulawska and Pietrain), while the second group included wild boars from Poland. The filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panel used in this study included 7,298 markers that were spread across 18 porcine autosomes and unmapped contigs. The maximum -like-lihood phylogenetic trees and multidimensional scaling (MDS) clearly separated the populations of pigs from the wild boars. We also detected genome regions that demonstrated the most significant genetic differences between the domestic pigs and wild boars. These regions were distributed on eight different autosomes and overlapped with 48 different pig RefSeq genes. The KEGG pathway, Reactome and GO terms were further used to assign a functional significance to the identified genes that were associated with inter alia muscle development (MYOG, MEOX2), pre-weaning mortality stress (MYO7A) and sensory perception (TAS1R3).

AB  - Rana uenoi, a common brown frog inhabiting South Korea and the Japanese Tsushima Island, has a long history of taxonomic discussion. Although R. uenoi was described in 2014 as being distinct from R. dybowskii, the taxonomic status and distribution of the South Korean clade of R. uenoi has remained uncertain, particularly with respect to the related species R. dybowskii. Considering the species' importance as a biological indicator of climate change, resolving the taxonomic equivocacy and clarifying its genetic structure is a matter of urgency. To do this, we included samples from across its distribution in South Korea, sequenced and analyzed Cytochrome b sequences, and developed novel microsatellite markers for population genetic analyses. Our phylogenetic analyses verified the absence of R. dybowskii or another species in South Korea and confirmed the genetic divergence between R. uenoi and R. dybowskii. Population genetic analyses showed two distinct groups within R. uenoi, one on the Korean mainland and Japanese Tsushima Island and the second on Jeju Island, with the likely scenario being the Jeju Island population originating from mainland Korea during the Pleistocene. Demographically, we found evidence of population bottleneck events. Based on these results, we propose the English common name "Korean large brown frog" and a Korean common name "(SIC)" [keun-san-gaeguri] for R. uenoi. These results provide an important baseline data for understanding future climate change impacts. Key words. Amphibia, Anura, Ranidae, Rana uenoi, R. dybowskii, brown frogs, taxonomic

AB  - Legume-based livestock forage systems are widespread and socially relevant agroecosystems that are essential for delivering high-quality forage. Therefore, it is critical to determine how climate change and management might affect the functioning of forage agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of sainfoin swards under different management regimes by combining results from an experiment on species diversity effects on yield developed under extreme climatic conditions and a survey of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) swards and nutritive value in mountain regions in Catalonia, Western Mediterranean. Our results show that 12-59% of the variability in forage nutritive value parameters was accounted for by management. Young cattle-grazed swards showed higher nutrition quality that decreased faster than sheep-grazed or only mown swards. Mixing sainfoin with orchardgrass increased fiber content (e.g., +22% neutral detergent fiber) and decreased protein (-26%) and lignin (-11%) compared to sainfoin monocultures. However, under the extreme climatic conditions of the last three years, the only diversity effect found on yield was the identity of the species present. We propose that a combination of different sainfoin management regimes might be beneficial regionally for both quality forage production and overall biodiversity conservation, whereas traditional systems may be vulnerable to changing climatic conditions.

AB  - Daily activity patterns of animals can be dynamic across seasons in response to changing environmental conditions. Daily activity, though, has rarely been evaluated in relation to multiple factors (e.g., seasons, demographics, and data collection methods), which could be important for understanding what drives activity patterns. Here, we evaluated the daily activity patterns of a widespread invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), across two ecologically different study areas at Buck Island Ranch, FL, and Tejon Ranch, CA, from 2015 to 2018. Using GPS telemetry data (62 individuals in FL, 21 individuals in CA) and detections from grids of systematically placed motion-activated cameras (44 cameras in FL, 48 cameras in CA), we compared activity patterns among seasons, sexes, and data collection methods (GPS and camera traps). Overall, wild pigs were mostly active during crepuscular and nocturnal periods, with their lowest activity during diurnal periods; however, activity patterns varied due to several factors. Daily activity patterns were similar between methods, among seasons, and between sexes in the subtropical climate of Florida. In contrast, daily activity patterns exhibited greater differences between methods and among seasons in California, where seasonal differences in temperature and precipitation were more pronounced. Overall, daily activity patterns estimated using GPS telemetry and camera-based methods not only exhibited a high degree of overlap in several comparisons but also exhibited marked differences that should be recognized. Given the increasing evaluation of daily activity patterns of animals using multiple types of datasets, our study provides ecologists with valuable information to consider when designing ecological studies, interpreting their results, and comparing research across systems and studies.

AB  - In mountain ecosystems, plant regeneration might be constrained by multiple factors that change along elevation gradients and promote traits differentiation. Drought is a strong filter for seedling establishment that might be modified by herbivory co-occurrence. Populations of the tree Maytenus boaria support lower soil moisture and higher herbivory pressure at low elevations than at mid-elevations in Cordoba Mountains, central Argentina. Consequently, we expect that populations from the low elevation perform better in response to drought than populations from mid-elevations and that herbivory modifies these responses. Seedlings from the two elevation origins were exposed to two levels of simulated drought and herbivory in a greenhouse experiment. The selected elevations corresponded to the lowest edge of species distribution (with driest soils and highest herbivory pressure) and the central mid-elevation. Performance-related variables, biomass allocation patterns and several morphological and physiological traits were measured. Mortality patterns and most of morphological and physiological variables showed that drought is a stressful factor at the regeneration stage of M. boaria. The drought effect was increased by simulated herbivory in some variables (LMF, RM:SM and SPAD). In most variables, origin did not influence seedling performance, suggesting that drought response of seedlings is independent of populations' elevation. Only leaf number and water potential were in line with our predictions and showed an origin response to drought.

AB  - The use of silvopastoral systems improves the sustainability of resources, enhancing the efficiency of the production system, with potential to offer local and global ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to evaluate the persistence of Andropogon grass (Andropogon gayanus cv. Planaltina) in nine years of growth and the ingestive behavior of goats under continuous stocking in a silvopastoral system during the rainy season, in comparison to the monoculture. The treatments were two production systems: monoculture (Andropogon grass) and silvopastoral system-SPS (native trees mixed with Andropogon grass). The persistence was evaluated between the years of 2011 and 2019 and, the ingestive behavior was evaluated in the grazing periods of 2019 (March, April, May and June). No effect of the interaction between cultivation systems and years was found on forage dry mass yield (P = 0.17) and leaf/stem ratio (P = 0.21), however, the forage dry mass yield was higher (P < 0.01) in the silvopastoral system. There was effect of interaction on the crude protein content (P < 0.01). In addition, there was effect of the different systems on the NDF content (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences (P > 0.10) for the ingestive behavior variables, except for the bite mass that was higher in the monoculture. Significant differences were found for the bite rate, with a mean value of 17.8 bites/min(-1). The DM intake in relation to the body weight was equivalent to 2.86% of the BW. There was no difference in the variation of the mean body weight of the goats between the cultivation systems of Andropogon grass. The Andropogon grass pasture grown in monoculture system and SPS remains perennial for nine years of grazing. Goat grazing in the two cultivation systems of Andropogon grass showed similar performance.

AB  - Woody structure, particularly that created by large trees, is crucial to savanna biodiversity pattern and process. We assessed changes in vertical and horizontal canopy over 15 years of saplings of Vachellia (Acacia) erioloba (camelthorn), a keystone species and one of the only trees to grow large in arid savanna on low rainfall areas of Kalahari sands, southern Africa. We also assessed whether the fastest growing saplings over the 2003-2004 growing season were also the fastest growing over the following 15 years. We measured height, canopy extent, and diameter of largest stem at ground level of 120 saplings of V. erioloba in November 2003, remeasuring these in March 2004. In November 2019, we were able to find 67 of these saplings, and we measured them again to assess growth between 2004 and 2019. We modeled interindividual explanatory variables for growth (i.e., measures taken in 2004 of height, diameter, number of stems, evidence of fire, and largest stem diameter). We also compared residuals of growth between 2003 and 2004 with those between 2004 and 2019, to assess whether individuals showed similar progress relative to their peers over the two periods considered. Height increase was extremely variable, but mean increase over 15 years was only 45.4 mm, similar to that measured for the 2003-2004 growing season (43.1 mm). Mean horizontal canopy showed far greater growth (mean 120.2 mm over 15 years, compared with 7.12 mm over 2003-2004) than vertical growth. Individuals that had shown the fastest increase in horizontal canopy in 2003-2004 tended to be the same individuals that grew fastest over the following 15 years, but even the highest "achievers" showed increases of only 47.2 mm and 37.5 mm year(-1) in average horizontal canopy extent and height, respectively. This study demonstrates how crucial long-term studies are, particularly in arid systems. Many individuals may be trapped in the "sapling" class and could take decades to become large trees. Woody sapling growth was not cumulative, and modeling studies in savannas should be cautious in extrapolating growth from one season to several years.

AB  - Botrytis cinerea is the causative agent of gray mold, a fungal disease affecting a broad array of food crops and resulting in considerable agricultural and economic losses. Currently, chemical fungicides are the most effective control measure, but this practice is challenged by the growing resistance of pathogens to these fungicides. Scopoletin, a major phytoalexin of tobacco plants, has shown promise as an antifungal treatment. Here, we found that scopoletin was effective against B. cinerea infection of tomato leaves. It inhibited mycelial growth and conidial germination of B. cinerea and disrupted cell wall, cell membrane, and infection structure formation. Transcriptomic analysis identified 3495 differentially expressed genes in response to scopoletin treatment. Interestingly, scopoletin seems to deactivate the HOG pathway of B. cinerea. The growth defect caused by hyperactivation of the pathway, such as iprodione treatment and deletion of BcPtc1, the negative regulator of this pathway, was partly rescued by scopoletin. Moreover, it could downregulate phosphorylation levels of BcSak1 treated with iprodione and NaCl. In addition, the control efficiency of triadimefon was significantly increased by scopoletin. Thus, scopoletin is a promising, naturally derived, and sustainable treatment for gray mold, especially when combined with triadimefon.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the effects of the Royal Highland Festival (RHF) from the perspective of yak herders in Laya, Bhutan. Sixty-six respondents were randomly selected from amongst the domicile herders who were regular visitors to the festival. A survey was carried out through a questionnaire with mixed questions. Herders' opinions suggest good progress of RHF as reflected by improved community vitality and networking with stakeholders. Tourists, both international and domestic, were the major contributors to the income of yak herders during the festival. Livestock products were the biggest income earner, followed by homestays. Herders were encouraged to produce more quantities of livestock products and desired to diversify yak products. Animal shows were adequate and encouraged breed improvement. The grazing resources and the environment were unharmed by the presence of animals in the festival. However, yak herders expressed concerns over the lack of skills and knowledge for yak product diversification and management of festival waste. Herders felt the need to shift the festival venue to benefit highlanders in other areas of Bhutan. The study recommends authorities to consider imparting skills to Laya communities on developing diverse and value-added yak products. Homestay owners require more capacity to manage and maintain farmhouses with proper sanitation. Effective management of festival wastes calls for a farsighted plan. Finally, to inculcate a sense of pride and ownership, the communities of Laya must be empowered to self-organize the festival, while government authorities should consider shifting the festival venue to other highland areas.

AB  - (1) Background: In managing ecological tea gardens, litter composed of pruned and fallen tea leaves from companion tree species is an important component of tea garden soil. The decomposition of litter plays a crucial role in regulating nutrient cycling in tea garden ecosystems. (2) Methods: This study employed the litterbag method to investigate chemical stoichiometry characteristics and enzyme activity changes during the decomposition process of pruned and fallen Camellia sinensis leaves from companion tree species in an ecological tea garden located in central Guizhou Province. (3) Results: With decomposition duration, the general trend of changes in the C/N and C/P ratios showed a decrease in the activity of UE (urease), AP (acid phosphatase), and PPO (polyphenol oxidase) followed by an increase, while CAT (catalase) and CEL (cellulase) activity decreased, then increased, and then decreased again. On the other hand, the N/P and the activity of SC (sucrase) first increased and then decreased. The C/N and the activities of UE, PPO, and AP generally reached their maximum values during the late decomposition stage (366-428 d), while the N/P and the CAT activity peaked during the mid-decomposition stage (305 d). In contrast, the activity of SC and CEL reached its maximum value during the early decomposition stage (123 d). The N/P ratios were significantly higher than those of the CS (C. sinensis) litter in the mixed treatment, while C/N and C/P ratios were significantly lower than those in the CS during decomposition for 184-366 days. The UE, CAT, AP, and SC activities of CBL (C. sinensis + B. luminifera) litter were significantly higher than those of the CS litter during decomposition. During the experiment, antagonistic effects were observed in the C/N and C/P ratios of the different litter types. Most mixed litter exhibited additive effects on enzyme activity, while a few showed nonadditive effects. For the nonadditive effects, most were antagonistic effects, mainly in the CPM (C. sinensis + C. glanduliferum) litter. A small portion, mainly observed in the CBL and CCG (C. sinensis + C. glanduliferum) litter, showed synergistic effects. (4) Conclusions: Selecting B. luminifera and C. glanduliferum to be part of the tree species composition in ecological tea gardens can produce positive mixed effects on enzyme activity during litter decomposition, increase nutrient return capacity, maintain tea garden fertility, and achieve the ecological development of tea gardens.

AB  - Carnivores are important drivers of ecological processes around the world. However, medium-large carnivores are often the focus of human-wildlife conflicts and are subject to control efforts. Determining the effectiveness of predator control efforts in reducing predator abundance or impact is critical to ensuring control is achieving its intended aims. This information is also vital to understanding any impacts of control efforts on the ecological functions of carnivores. In this study, we deployed camera traps on two properties in the southern rangelands of Western Australia to examine the effectiveness of repeated rounds of landscape-scale toxicant baiting in reducing dingo populations. Biannual baiting at each property was temporally offset from the other to provide a comparison of short-term changes in dingo activity and density over 16 months' monitoring. While there were significant differences in dingo density between properties, there was no significant differences between months categorised as 'month of baiting', 'month immediately post-baiting' or 'between baiting'. Further, there was no overall decline in dingo density on either property over the duration of the study and survival of dingoes exceeded 84% on each site. Neither individual nor sequential rounds of baiting therefore resulted in a reduction in dingo density approaching 75%, which is necessary for dingo population control in this environment. Several factors are likely to have contributed to the limited effect of baiting, including bait uptake by non-target species, low encounter rate with baits and aversive responses to baits. Consideration of baiting practices, including bait rate, frequency and attractiveness, as well as evaluation of the net returns of baiting should be addressed in future work to ensure dingo control achieves its intended aims to reduce dingo abundance and/or impacts.

AB  - Context. The ability to accurately estimate age of animals is important for both research and management. The two methods for age estimation in ungulates are tooth replacement and wear (TRW) and cementum annuli (CA). Errors in estimated TRW ages are commonly attributed to environmental conditions; however, the influence of environmental variables on tooth wear has not been quantified. Further, the performance of CA in environments with weak seasonality has not been thoroughly evaluated.
   Aims. The study had the following three goals: identify environmental and morphological factors that influenced estimated ages, quantify accuracy of TRW and CA, and develop TRW ageing criteria that minimise error.
   Methods. We used data from harvested (n = 5117) and free-ranging, known-age white-tailed deer (n = 134) collected in southern Texas, USA, to quantify environmental and morphological influences on estimated TRW ages, and assess biases in both methods.
   Key results. We observed substantial variation in age estimates for both TRW and CA. Soil, drought and supplemental nutrition had minor effects on tooth wear, insufficient to alter age estimates by >= 1 year. Body mass and antler size influenced age estimates for TRW only for extreme outliers. Both methods were biased and tended to under-estimate ages of adult deer, especially TRW. Wear on the first molar was most correlated with the known age (r(2) = 0.78) and allowed biologists to correctly place known-age deer into age classes of 2, 3-5, and >= 6 years old 72%, 73% and 68% of the time, an improvement compared with the 79%, 48% and 28% accuracy from pooled TRW.
   Conclusions. We observed substantial inter- and intra-individual variation in tooth-wear patterns that became more pronounced in older deer. Individual variation had a greater influence on TRW ages than did environmental covariates, whereas CA ages appeared unaffected by environment. Although variable, age estimates were +/- 1 year of the true age 87% and 93% of the time for TRW and CA respectively.
   Implications. Managers, ecologists and epidemiologists often incorporate ages into population models. The high inter-individual variation in estimated ages, the tendency to underestimate ages of older deer, and the ageing method need to be considered.

AB  - In order to gain an initial impression of the current parasite situation in wildlife enclosures across Germany, 17 enclosures of six animal species were examined for parasites in soil and fecal samples in seven facilities. Of particular interest in this context are helminths and protists. Despite the potential risks, however, there are only a few studies on parasites in animal enclosures due to the taboo subject. The study examined 661 fecal samples from fallow deer ( Dama dama, N = 247), wild boar ( Sus scrofa, N = 207), red deer ( Cervus elaphus, N = 111), mouflon ( Ovis orientalis musimon N = 76), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus, N = 12) and bison ( Bison bonasus, N = 8) as well as 136 soil samples from 12 single-species enclosures and 5 mixed-species enclosures. Three hundred and sixty fecal samples (54.46 %) tested positive for parasites using flotation and sedimentation methods. In addition, parasites were detected in 62.5 % (N = 85) of the soil samples. Examination of the faecal samples revealed that the most common parasite species were Strongyloides sp., Trichostrongylus sp. and Trichuris sp. With the help of a Geographic Information System (GIS), the findings could be displayed on an enclosure map and initial hypotheses on environmental relationships could be made. Particularly high parasite samples were mostly located near feeding and resting areas. The results underline the need for more regular monitoring and targeted parasite management to protect the health of the animals. GIS can be used as an additional tool to help identify hotspots and to specifically incorporate the environment into management in order to take animal-friendly measures. This will play a greater role in the future in the context of anthelmintic resistance.

AB  - As traditional meat production has become stigmatized for several reasons, consumer interest in game as an ethical and ecological meat alternative has increased. However, game meat is typically harvested through hunting, toward which consumers may have very divided attitudes. Concurrently, game meat is still valued as food. This interesting mismatch raises questions as to what types of game meat consumer segments exist and whether the value of ecological food can surpass the negative attitudes toward hunting. This pilot study focused on consumer segments interested in European moose meat in Finland and analyzed how attitudes toward hunting reflect opinions on moose meat. The data were based on a survey (n = 199) conducted in 2018. The results indicated three potential consumer segments (established, skeptical, and ambivalent) for moose meat and show that respondent attitudes toward hunters constitute a large part of the attitudes toward hunting in general.

AB  - Simple Summary Grazing animals have a major impact on rangelands through the consumption and trampling of vegetation along with excreta deposition. In turn, forage availability and quality, shaped by environmental and grazing impacts, affect animal performance and health. This study investigated the interaction between amount and nutritional quality of vegetation on offer and animal feed intake on alpine pastures in the Chinese Altai Mountains. To this end, daily grazing routes, vegetation on offer along the pathways, and forage consumption of goats were monitored during spring and the early and late summer season of two consecutive years. Grazing routes were longer in spring than in summer, leading to larger pasture areas utilised in spring. Despite marked differences in vegetation on offer between the two study years, quantitative feed intake did not exhibit seasonal or annual differences, indicating that the goats' nutrient intake was not restricted on the mountain ranges. Forage availability and quality directly impact animal performance, ultimately affecting productivity and health. This study aimed to understand the interaction between qualitative and quantitative vegetation availability and feed intake of goats on alpine pastures in the Chinese Altai Mountains. The daily grazing routes of three goats from a local herding family were monitored with GPS devices set at a logging rate of 64 s during spring and the early and late summer season in 2013 and 2014. The quantity and quality of vegetation along their grazing routes was determined, and the amount of feces excreted was measured in a total of five goats per season for the indirect determination of the animals' feed intake. The grazing routes were longer in spring than in summer, leading to larger grazing areas visited in spring. Vegetation on offer ranged from 980 to 2400 kg dry mass per hectare and was similar in the spring and summer seasons but higher in 2013 than in 2014. Feed consumption of forage and nutrients did not significantly differ between seasons and years, respectively, suggesting that the goats' nutrient intake was not restricted by interannual variability of forage on offer. Regular monitoring of animal numbers and of vegetation quantity and quality on the mountain rangelands can help responsible government agencies to estimate forage offtake of small ruminants in order to timely adjust grazing pressure in the study region.

AB  - Competition between apex predators can alter the strength of top-down forcing, yet we know little about the behavioral mechanisms that drive competition in multipredator ecosystems. Interactions between predators can be synergistic (facilitative) or antagonistic (inhibitive), both of which are widespread in nature, vary in strength between species and across space and time, and affect predation patterns and predator-prey dynamics. Recent research has suggested that gray wolf (Canis lupus) kill rates decrease where they are sympatric with brown bears (Ursus arctos), however, the mechanisms behind this pattern remain unknown. We used data from two long-term research projects in Scandinavia (Europe) and Yellowstone National Park (North America) to test the role of interference and exploitation competition from bears on wolf predatory behavior, where altered wolf handling and search time of prey in the presence of bears are indicative of interference and exploitation competition, respectively. Our results suggest the mechanisms driving competition between bears and wolves were dependent on the season and study system. During spring in Scandinavia, interference competition was the primary mechanism driving decreased kill rates for wolves sympatric with bears; handling time increased, but search time did not. In summer, however, when both bear and wolf predation focused on neonate moose, the behavioral mechanism switched to exploitation competition; search time increased, but handling time did not. Alternartively, interference competition did affect wolf predation dynamics in Yellowstone during summer, where wolves prey more evenly on neonate and adult ungulates. Here, bear presence at a carcass increased the amount of time wolves spent at carcasses of all sizes and wolf handling time for small prey, but decreased handling time for the largest prey. Wolves facilitate scavenging opportunities for bears, however, bears alter wolf predatory behavior via multiple pathways and are primarily antagonistic to wolves. Our study helps to clarify the behavioral mechanisms driving competition between apex predators, illustrating how interspecific interactions can manifest into population-level predation patterns.

AB  - Studies concerning the role of livestock farming on the regional budget of CO2 in Northeast of Brazil are scarce. Thus, our main objective was to evaluate the variability of CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) of a cultivated tropical forage C4 grass (Brachiaria brizantha) grazed by sheep for meat production. The experiment was conducted during the period from 2015-oct-01 to 2017-sep-30 using an eddy covariance flux tower. The pasture acted as a moderate CO2 sink, with mean annual net ecosystem exchange of -215 +/- 22 g C m(-2)y(-1), while the average uncertainty associated with the calculation procedure was 15 g C m(-2) +/- 7.20% of NEP. The mean annual ET was 967 +/- 245 mm. Carbon use efficiency at the ecosystem level was 0.20 +/- 0.03, which is more efficient compared to similar experiments in grazed environments around the world. Water use efficiency at the ecosystem level was 1.14 +/- 0.01 g C (kg H2O)(-1).

AB  - Homeowners whose landscape plants are repeatedly browsed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) desire repellent products that are effective and long-lasting. We conducted a 12-week trial from January 6 through April 5, 2021 to test the duration and efficacy of a novel deer repellent (Trico((R))) relative to Plantskydd((R)), a commonly used deer repellent, and untreated plants. We placed treated and control Japanese yew shrubs (Taxus media 'Hicksii') at 4 homeowner sites (Birch Hills Drive, Fairview Crescent, Pinegrove Ave., and St. Paul Blvd.) near Rochester, New York, USA, where we detected deer presence. Yews are frequently eaten by deer during winter and provide a good bioassay for testing repellents. To gauge the efficacy of the repellents, we photographed the yews and scored the level of deer browsing. We used ordinal logistic regression to determine the change in efficacy over time. Trico deer repellent reduced deer damage to yews (chi-square = 97.273, P < 0.0001). Damage to yews treated with Plantskydd did not differ from control plants (chi-square = 0.24, P = 0.621) after 12 weeks. The performance of deer repellents varied considerably among sites (chi-square = 109.460, P < 0.0001). Where there was intense deer browsing pressure (Pinegrove Ave. site), both repellents failed to protect the yews. However, at 3 of 4 sites, the Trico repellent effectively protected yews from deer browsing during winter through spring green-up in April. We found Trico to be an effective, long-lasting repellent for protecting ornamental shrubs from deer browsing during winter.

AB  - This work examines the effect of equilibration time with extender on ultra-rapidly frozenthawed wild ruminant epididymal (origin: Iberian ibex) and ejaculated (origin: mouflon) sperm variables. Sperm samples were prepared either without prior equilibration, or equilibrated for 30 min before freezing. Higher quality (p < 0.05) frozen-thawed spermatozoa were obtained when equilibration was allowed, for ejaculated sperm in terms of sperm motility, acrosome apical ridge integrity, sperm viability, and percentage of normal cells, and for epididymal sperm in terms of linearity and straightness of sperm movement. The sperm head area, head perimeter, head length and head width were smaller (p < 0.01) in the equilibrated than non-equilibrated frozen-thawed epididymal sperm; no such dimensional changes were recorded for ejaculated sperm. In conclusion, equilibration prior to ultra-rapid freezing improves the cryoresistance of sperm cells, although viable sperm cells can be obtained without equilibration. The epididymal sperm showed greater cryoresistance, supporting the idea that it is more resistant to freeze-thawing than ejaculated sperm.

AB  - The density and distribution of resources shape animal movement and behavior and have direct implications for population dynamics. Resource availability often is "pulsed" in space and time, and individuals should cue in on resource pulses when the energetic gain of doing so exceeds that of stable resources. Birth pulses of prey represent a profitable but ephemeral resource and should thereby result in shifting functional responses by predators. We evaluated movements and resource selection of coyotes (Canis latrans) across a gradient of reproductive stages ranging from late gestation to peak lactation of female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in southwest Wyoming, USA, to test whether coyotes exhibited shifts in selection and movement behavior relative to the availability and vulnerability of neonatal mule deer. We expected coyotes to track pulses in availability of neonatal mule deer, and such behavior would be represented by shifts in resource selection and search behavior of coyotes that would be strongest during peak parturition of mule deer. Coyotes selected areas of high relative probability of use by female mule deer and did so most strongly during peak parturition. Furthermore, searching behavior of coyotes intensified during pulses of availability of deer neonates. Our findings support the notion that coyotes exploit pulses of neonatal deer, presumably as an attempt to capitalize on a vulnerable, energy-rich resource. Our work quantifies the behavioral mechanisms by which coyotes consume ungulate neonates and provides one of the first examples of a mammalian predator-prey system centered on a pulsed resource.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa receives large investments in biodiversity conservation, and if these investments can be concentrated on the highest threats to biodiversity, the benefits to conservation from the investments would increase. Yet there is no available prioritization of the many direct threats to biodiversity to inform organizations developing sub-Saharan or sub-regional conservation strategies. Consequently, regional investments by funders of biodiversity conservation such as international conservation organizations, foundations, and bilateral and multilateral donors may be suboptimal. The objective of this study was to determine what are the highest direct threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa and its sub-regions. To do this, we collected threat data using standardized IUCN threat categories from a Delphi consensus of sub-Saharan Africa biodiversity experts, known threats to IUCN Red-listed sub-Saharan African species, and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans from 40 sub-Saharan African countries. After averaging the threat ranking from the three sources, the highest threats were: (1) annual and perennial crops (non-timber); (2) fishing and harvesting aquatic resources in marine and freshwater areas; (3) logging and wood harvesting in natural forests; and (4) hunting and collecting terrestrial animals. The highest-ranked sub-regional threats were hunting in Central Africa and agriculture in East Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Aligning biodiversity investments to address these threats and tailoring activities to reflect local socio-ecological contexts would increase the conservation of biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Odor and bioaerosols have serious impacts on the biological safety of animal production and the ecological environment. Thus, it is particularly important to explore synergistic air cleaning technology to solve these problems. In this study, a pilot-scale air cleaning equipment were applied to an experimental manure storage house to determine the removal efficiency of gaseous pollution using four treatments groups. These treatment groups include acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing (AC), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + photocatalytic oxidation (ACP), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + biological scrubbing (ACB), and acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + biological scrubbing + photocatalytic oxidation (ACBP). Results showed that ACP can synergistically remove odor and bioaerosol, with ammonia, odor concentrations, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, methyl sulfide, bacterial aerosol, and fugal aerosol removal efficiencies of 89.1 %, 76.3 %, 100 %, 94.2 %, 91.2 %, 75.6 %, and 83.6 %, respectively. Furthermore, ACBP has the highest removal efficiency of 79.2 % for odor concentration, but this combination has a low inactivation efficiency (< 25 %) for bacterial aerosols. Moreover, adding biological scrubbing before photocatalytic can reduce the conversion from aromatic hydrocarbons to Oxygenated VOCs. Findings of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the application of air cleaning technology in livestock houses.

AB  - Habitat loss is a leading threat to many species at risk, and as such, the need for habitat restoration is widespread. In the boreal forests of Western Canada, habitat restoration is a key habitat management action needed to achieve self-sustaining populations of woodland caribou, a federally threatened species in decline. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers of linear features were created during the exploration or extraction of oil and gas that are no longer used, yet natural regeneration remains stagnated. Only a fraction of these linear features is restored each year, sparking the need for managers to prioritize efforts. We developed an algorithm to prioritize habitat restoration and demonstrate how it can be used to predict and monitor progress towards restoration goals. Our approach is based on the idea of maximizing the gain in unaltered caribou habitat per unit cost, while allowing for the inclusion of different goals, costs, and weighting criteria. Our algorithm ranked landscape units into five zones of restoration priority. The largest gain in unaltered habitat occurred following restoration of the highest priority zones, with diminishing returns as restoration proceeded. None of the caribou ranges reached habitat management targets when not considering restoration within energy project boundaries, even after all candidate linear features were restored. Our results highlight the need for ambitious, coordinated restoration, and the need for improved land-use planning to minimize alteration within caribou range. We demonstrate the flexibility of our algorithm by applying the framework to a case study in a mountain ecosystem.

AB  - Freshwater lake soundscapes yield crucial information regarding biological, geological, and anthropogenic activity, yet is a relatively unexplored area of study. These soundscapes are particularly important to aquatic life that may use sound to navigate, find food, avoid predators, and communicate. Further research is required to understand how aquatic species, such as native fishes, are impacted by increased anthropogenic interference. Many wilderness lakes restrict the use of motorized boats and equipment, providing an opportunity to compare fish behavior in the presence and absence of anthropogenic sound. Underwater videos and passive acoustic monitoring were used to evaluate fish behavior under different soundscapes in the upper Midwest United States: John Lake (nonmotorized, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, MN), Rush Lake (nonmotorized, Huron Mountain Club, MI), and Caribou Lake (motorized, Duluth, MN). Intermittent short and long anthropogenic sound playback experiments showed behavioral changes in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus, centrarchids), bluntnose minnows (Pimephales notatus, cyprinids), mimic shiners (Notropis volucellus, cyprinids), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens, percids). Overall, cyprinids in wilderness lakes were the most responsive to boat sound 36-52 dB above ambient sound levels, with bluegills in the public lake more likely to remain in the area during longer duration sound stimuli. Taken together, these results indicate that behavioral responses are species specific and depend on environmental variables such as anthropogenic exposure and fishing pressure.

AB  - Plant dwarfism, a syndrome characterised by a significant reduction in plant height and organ size, is a widely observed pattern of stress-tolerant life-form evolution that results from local adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. The drivers of assemblage-level dwarfism have primarily been attributed to abiotic factors, such as low temperature, aridity, poor soil fertility or frequent fires. While biotic factors such as grazing pressure from herbivores can contribute to the establishment of plant dwarfism, these factors have rarely been tested at assemblage levels. Focusing on a dwarf plant assemblage comprising over 80 taxa on a small continental island in Japan with a high deer density, we hypothesised that historical deer grazing could also be a factor contributing to the large-scale convergent evolution of dwarfism. To test this hypothesis, we measured the size of 1908 individual plants of 40 taxa pairs, comprising both palatable and unpalatable pairs from the island and their counterpart taxa from neighbouring regions, and sought to assess which factors (i.e. low solar radiation, estimated divergence time, low nutrient conditions and grazing pressure from deer) may have contributed to the formation of the dwarf plant assemblage on the island. We also performed genetic analysis to infer the time frames for the establishment of dwarf taxa. Statistical analyses revealed that plant size was significantly reduced mainly among the palatable taxa growing on the island, with preferential grazing by deer being identified as the most significant factor influencing plant size. Furthermore, genetic analyses revealed that dwarf ecotypes may have evolved over tens of thousands of years. Synthesis: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that interactions with herbivores can shape the assemblage-level convergence of plant dwarfism. These findings enhance our current understanding of the formation of plant functional diversity.
   Plant dwarfism is a widely observed phenomenon worldwide, with abiotic factors such as low temperature, aridity, strong winds, and poor soil fertility commonly considered its major drivers. This study investigated the triggering factor of a dwarf plant assemblage comprising over 80 taxa from nearly 40 families in a small island. Through multispecies comparison analysis, compelling evidence was found that, among the candidate factors (climatic conditions, nutrient availability, and demographic history), deer preference significantly influenced the variation in plant size within the island. This suggests that dwarf plant assemblages may have evolved in response to herbivore grazing pressure. This study provides the first demonstration that plant-herbivore interactions can drive assemblage-level convergent evolution of dwarfism, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of plant diversity.image

AB  - With the accelerated construction of biogas plants, the amount of biogas residues are expanding. Composting has been widely implemented to deal with biogas residues. Aeration regulation is the main factor affecting the post -composting treatment of biogas residues as high-quality fertilizer or soil amendment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of different aeration regulations on full-scale biogas residues compost maturity by controlling oxygen concentration under micro-aeration and aeration conditions. Results showed that micro -aerobic extended the thermophilic stage of 17 days at above 55 celcius and facilitated the mineralization process of organic nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen to retain higher N nutrition levels compared to aerobic treatment. For biogas residues with high moisture, aeration should be regulated at different full-scale composting stages. Total organic carbon (TOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N, total potassium (TK), total phosphorus (TP) and the germination index (GI) could be used to evaluate stabilization, fertilizer efficiency and phytotoxicity of compost with frequent monitoring times. However, seedling growth trials were still necessary in full-scale composting plants when changing of composting process or biogas residues feedstock.

AB  - Carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry plays a vital role in regulating P transformation in agriculture ecosystems. However, the impact of balanced C:N:P stoichiometry in paddy soil, particularly regarding relative soil P transformation, remains unknown. This study explores the response of C:N:P stoichiometry to manure substitution and its regulatory role in soil P transformation, along with the associated release risk to the environment. Based on a 5-year field study, our findings reveal that replacing 30 % of chemical P fertilizer with pig manure (equal total NPK amounts with chemical P fertilizer treatment, named CFM) increased soil total C without altering soil total P, resulting in an elevated soil C:P ratio, despite the homeostasis of crop stoichiometry. This increase promoted microbial diversity and the accumulation of organic P in the soil. The Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria produced lower C:PEEA EEA metabolism together, and enhanced in vivo turnover of P. Additionally, by integrating high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper), diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT), DGT-induced fluxes in the soil (DIFS), and sediment P release risk index (SPRRI) models, we observed that, in addition to organic P, CFM simultaneously increased soil Al-P, thereby weakening the diffusion and resupply capacity of P from soil solids to the solution. Consequently, this decrease in P release risk to the environment was demonstrated. Overall, this study establishes a connection between crop-soil-enzyme C:N:P stoichiometry, soil microorganisms, and soil P biogeochemical processes. The study further evaluates the P release risk to the environment, providing a novel perspective on both the direct and indirect effects of manure substitution on soil P cycling.

AB  - Large carnivore populations have increased in many areas of Europe, resulting in socio-political conflicts, especially in areas with extensive outfield grazing systems. In Norway, the occurrence of large carnivores, especially brown bears (Ursus arctos) and grey wolves (Canis lupus), are largely separated from outfield grazing areas via carnivore management zones. However, the overall drivers of livestock losses in the outfields and the contribution of large carnivores are not well understood. Here, we investigated (1) correlates of cattle and sheep losses across organized grazing areas of Norway to evaluate which factors, including large carnivore densities, livestock density, the size of the grazing area, tick density, landscape characteristics, and climatic variables, are responsible for livestock losses in the outfields, and (2) spatio-temporal correlates of cattle losses suspected of being attacked by large carnivores. Based on our analyses investigating cattle and sheep losses in organized outfield grazing areas, we found no evidence that large carnivore densities correlated with cattle losses, but the proportion of sheep losses increased with increasing large carnivore densities, especially of bears and wolverines (Gulo gulo). Importantly, factors other than large carnivores, such as tick density and landscape composition, were related to higher probabilities of cattle losses. Our study provides important information concerning the overall causes of livestock losses in the outfields, indicating that large carnivores contribute little to total cattle losses.

AB  - Simple Summary The sika deer (Cervus nippon) was introduced in South Korea from Japan and Taiwan for commercial farming. They have become invasive to mainland South Korea and Jeju Island due to escape from confinement and illegal release. Native species and ecosystems may be threatened by the presence of non-native species. To deal with ecological risk and evolutionary processes, information on the phylogeny of these non-native sika deer is necessary. Genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome B (CytB) gene sequences were conducted to determine the subspecies of Jeju sika deer and their phylogenetic relationship. On Jeju Island, we confirmed the presence of two distinct groups of CytB haplotypes: Cervus nippon yakushimae, native sika to Japan, and Cervus nippon taiouanus, native to Taiwan. Non-native species threaten native ecosystems and species, particularly on islands where rates of endemism and vulnerability to threats are high. Understanding species invasion will aid in providing insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. To identify the non-native sika deer (Cervus nippon) population in Jeju, South Korea, and their phylogenetic affinities, we collected tissue samples from roadkill and the World Natural Heritage Headquarters in Jeju. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome B (CytB) gene sequences were analyzed to determine two distinct CytB haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood tree revealed two haplotypes of CytB clustered into two different groups representing two subspecies: C. n. yakushimae, native to Japan, and C. n. taiouanus, native to Taiwan. The tentative divergence time between the two subspecies was estimated at 1.81 million years. Our study confirmed that the two subspecies of sika deer are sympatric in the natural ecosystem of Jeju Island. This study provides valuable information to help government and conservation agencies understand alien species and determine control policies for conserving native biodiversity in South Korea.

We report sightings of 10 individuals across their historical stronghold and present the first published photograph of a live specimen. This study provides the first documented records since the species was described in 2005, and the first survey attempt in over 50 years. With an estimated population likely numbering fewer than 100 in an area with little protection, this species faces imminent extinction due to poaching. Urgent conservation measures are essential to prevent its disappearance.

AB  - Despite the fact that the climate of North-East (NE) India is suitable for tick diversity, no systematic study has been done regarding the prevalence of ticks and tick-borne pathogens affecting small ruminants. A total of 1053 goats belonging to different age groups, breeds, and sex were examined from April 2019 to March 2020. Blood smear examination and PCR assays were conducted to detect tick-borne pathogens in the collected samples. The tick species recorded were Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, and Haemaphysalis bispinosa. The overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens was 32.28%. Mixed infection with Theileria sp. and Anaplasma sp. was most common followed by single infections of Anaplasma sp. and Theileria sp. A significantly higher rate of infection was observed in female animals. Species-specific PCR revealed different tickborne pathogens like Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma centrale, and Theileria luwenshuni in goats. Isolated DNA samples of ticks were found to be positive for A. marginale, A. centrale, and T. luwenshuni and Coxiella burnetii in three genera of ticks with PCR assay. The results showed that vector-borne intracellular haemoprotozoa and Anaplasma are prevalent in the study area in apparently healthy small ruminants and the identified ticks have an endosymbiotic relationship with C. burnetii.

AB  - Ivory poaching continues to threaten African elephants. We (1) used criminology theory and literature evidence to generate hypotheses about factors that may drive, facilitate or motivate poaching, (2) identified datasets representing these factors, and (3) tested those factors with strong hypotheses and sufficient data quality for empirical associations with poaching. We advance on previous analyses of correlates of elephant poaching by using additional poaching data and leveraging new datasets for previously untested explanatory variables. Using data on 10 286 illegally killed elephants detected at 64 sites in 30 African countries (2002-2020), we found strong evidence to support the hypotheses that the illegal killing of elephants is associated with poor national governance, low law enforcement capacity, low household wealth and health, and global elephant ivory prices. Forest elephant populations suffered higher rates of illegal killing than savannah elephants. We found only weak evidence that armed conflicts may increase the illegal killing of elephants, and no evidence for effects of site accessibility, vegetation density, elephant population density, precipitation or site area. Results suggest that addressing wider systemic challenges of human development, corruption and consumer demand would help reduce poaching, corroborating broader work highlighting these more ultimate drivers of the global illegal wildlife trade.

AB  - Human???elephant conflict (HEC) is a multifaceted complex phenomenon, and managing it requires multiple strategies. However, HEC remains prevalent in tropical areas due to a lack of ???synergy of options???. Establishing synergistic HEC management strategies is thus crucial. We applied a choice experiment to capture the preference heterogeneity of the human population in Dong Nai Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam, regarding synergistic HEC management strategies and evaluate their marginal willingness to participate (MWTP) under multiple scenarios of HEC management. The following characteristics were found to affect this human population???s preferences regarding a HEC management program: 1) their attitude toward elephant conservation, 2) education and income level, and 3) employment status. Three promising guide scenarios were suggested based on the positive-preference attributes regarding HEC management. Among these, the scenario of a human???elephant coexistence program generated the highest MWTP compared to the scenarios of ???building HEC prevention and mitigation??? and ???protecting elephants and forest???. These outcomes can help managers adopt sustainable policies for mitigating HEC and facilitating human???elephant coexistence.

AB  - The seasonal species succession of phytoplankton from Phaeocystis antarctica to diatoms in the Ross Ice Shelf Polynya (RISP) plays a fundamental role in food webs and ecosystem functioning. Previous studies have revealed that this seasonal succession is affected by differences in light, iron demand, aggregation, and subsequent sinking between these two taxa. This study further investigated the dominant process of species succession by analyzing the results of a bulk mixed-layer ecosystem model. The mechanism of processes leading to the replacement by diatoms differs from that for triggering the initial P. antarctica bloom. Light triggered the spring bloom dominated by P. antarctica in iron-rich surface water, which is resupplied by winter convective mixing from the lower layer pool. After reaching its maximum in mid-November, the biomass of P. antarctica declined progressively due to the severe iron limitation. Seasonal species succession can be enhanced by a small amount of predation on P. antarctica by microzooplankton. The long-term iron enrichment promotes the transition by supporting diatom growth. The balance between bottom-up and top-down processes plays a critical role in shaping the phytoplankton composition and promoting the seasonal species succession in the iron-limited upper mixed layer of the RISP.Plain Language Summary Understanding how living things in the high-latitude Southern Ocean are impacted by climate change requires knowledge of how the base of food webs (i.e., marine plants) responds to the environment and predators nowadays. It is especially important to understand the natural behaviors of plants in individual regions that are highly productive and less affected by human activities. The southern Ross Sea is one such region, which remains ice-free all year round and iron-limited during the growing seasons. Typical of this environment is the sequential occurrence of two plant species, but it is not known why they flourish in order. In this study, numerical simulations give us an idea of the different responses of the two plants to irradiance, water temperature, iron concentrations, and predators at different periods of the growing season. The simulations show us that low light conditions favor one species to grow first, iron limited its growth, then the predator's feeding on this species gives another species a chance to grow thereafter. The comparison of feeding process and iron-limiting effects on plants according to the simulations highlights the balance between growth and ingestion in regulating the base of food webs in this unique environment.

AB  - The 4,461 shrimp species worldwide correspond to approximately 25% of the diversity of crustacean decapods. We surveyed the shrimp species known for Brazil based on the Cat & aacute;logo Taxon & ocirc;mico da Fauna do Brasil (Taxonomic Catalog of the Brazilian Fauna). A total of 373 shrimp species are so far recorded from Brazil, of which 79% are Caridea, 19% Dendrobranchiata, and 2% Stenopodidea. Caridea is represented by 24 families and 294 species, Dendrobranchiata by seven families and 72 species, and Stenopodidea by three families and seven species. The Brazilian representatives of the three taxa respectively represent 8%, 14%, and 7% of the global species diversity and 21%, 49%, and 29% of the global generic biodiversity. Forty-three species of Caridea, three of Stenopodidea, and one of Dendrobranchiata are endemic to Brazil. Twelve non-native, alien species belonging to seven genera are reported for Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. The vast majority of all species are marine and brackish-water (328 species), 112 of which are from deep water (> 500 m), and 45 from fresh water. Brazil is the confirmed type locality of 81 species, but this number may be higher. The authors of these species were only from Europe and the USA until 1950, but mostly Brazilian since. This compilation aims to provide information about Brazilian shrimps to assist future research in all areas and to help governmental or non-governmental (NGO) agencies in making decisions and recommendations about conservation issues.

AB  - Northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) is a species of high ecological and economic value whose abundance has been declining since the pre-industrial period. It is an important element of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) habitat, but its regeneration can be compromised by excessive browsing. This situation is especially critical in deeryards, where deer concentrate during winter. In 2018 and 2019, deer culling operations were carried out by the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec over 400 km(2) in response to the occurrence of chronic wasting disease cases on a red deer farm. This operation offered an opportunity to look at how variations in deer pressure influence cedar regeneration and how cedar responds to a sudden reduction in browsing. We conducted regeneration surveys within and outside mapped deeryards both in the deer reduction zone and in a control zone. We performed dendrochronological analyses of cedar seedlings and saplings to quantify radial growth response to a reduction in browsing pressure. The results show that cedar basal area influences the abundance of small seedlings but that the effect of browsing becomes dominant for seedlings taller than 50 cm. Cedar growth responds to a reduction in browsing, but a two-year period was not sufficient to translate into changes in regeneration structure. The duration of the windows of opportunity at low browsing pressure required for cedar to reach a safe height remains to be determined. However, canopy openness had a significant influence on growth, suggesting that silvicultural measures could be taken to shorten the period of vulnerability to deer browsing.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes play important functional roles in coral reef ecosystems, and their influence on mediating competitive dynamics between corals and macroalgae is well studied. Nonetheless, direct interactions between herbivorous fishes and corals may also be relevant, although these are less studied. Here, we describe a series of observations of schools of the herbivorous streaked rabbitfish (Siganus javus) nibbling on black corals (order Antipatharia) at the SS Yongala wreck, within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We provide a hypothesis that may explain this behaviour, which, if confirmed, would represent a mechanism influencing the health of the corals. Moreover, this interaction extends the typical coral-algae competition for space paradigm and furthers knowledge of complex relationships between coral reef organisms.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are generally tackled using single-species studies and ensuing management solutions, ignoring species interactions that may moderate or augment these issues. We investigate the effects of interactions between four goose species foraging in the province of Friesland, the Netherlands, on species distributions, energetics, and consequent economic costs of agricultural damages and management, using an individual-based model. In Friesland, geese are allowed to graze on (semi-)natural grasslands and selected agricultural grasslands (accommodation areas), while they are scared off other agricultural grasslands (scaring areas). We show that interspecific competition and facilitation drive spatial redistribution of goose species. With increasing population sizes, most species are forced to increase foraging in the scaring areas, leading to more scaring events and more additional foraging to compensate for energy spent on fleeing behaviour. Our modelling results underline that careful consideration should be given to how management may affect the spatial distribution of foraging geese.

AB  - Linear infrastructure represent a barrier to movement for many species, reducing the connectivity of the landscapes in which they reside. Of all linear infrastructure, roads and fences are two of the most ubiquitous, and are understood to reduce landscape connectivity for wildlife. However, what is often neglected consideration is a holistic approach of modelling the effects of multiple types of linear infrastructure simultaneously. Few studies have examined this, typically assessing the impacts of a singular kind of infrastructure on landscape connectivity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to address the relative importance of considering multiple kinds of linear infrastructure in landscape connectivity modelling. We utilised presence data of red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa in Donana Biosphere Reserve (Spain) to generate a sequential approach of scenarios of landscape connectivity; firstly only with environmental variables, secondly with roads as the sole infrastructure, thirdly with the addition of fences, and finally with the further addition of fences and wildlife road-crossing structures. We found that the connectivity of the landscape was greatly affected by the addition of fences and wildlife road-crossing structures in both species, with fences in particular causing considerable alterations to estimated movement pathways. Our finding impresses a need to consider multiple different types of linear infrastructure when modelling landscape connectivity to enable a more realistic view of wildlife movement and inform mitigation and conservation measures more accurately.

However, the effect of species mixing on tree growth and drought resilience in semi-arid areas remains unclear. Hence, we established tree-ring chronologies of Robinia pseudoacacia L. in pure Robinia pseudoacacia L. plantation (RP) and mixed plantations with Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Populus simonii Carr. at differ-ent proportions of 8:2 and 5:5 (RH 8:2, RH 5:5, RC 8:2, RC 5:5) in the typical semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau (LP), China. The mean annual growth, climate-growth relationships, and tree resilience (Rs) to drought, including resistance (Rt) and recovery (Rc), were analyzed using dendrochronological methods. The results showed that the growth of R. pseudoacacia L. in mixed plantations was lower when Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) >0, but much higher than that in monoculture under drought stress (PDSI <0 or after drought event). Meanwhile, the relationship between PDSI and tree growth was significantly positive in the pure plantation, but weakened in the mixed plantations, indicat-ing that species mixing alleviated drought stress to some extent. The resilience results showed that, although the Rc was higher in monoculture after drought events, species mixing could enhance Rt and mitigate the growth decline of R. pseudoacacia L. during drought events. Moreover, the Rt varied significantly among mixing species and propor-tions and was also affected by the magnitude and timing of drought. The RC 5:5 and RH 8:2 had higher resistance to moderate and severe drought stress. However, RC 8:2 and RH 5:5 could cope better with mild drought stress. These results indicate that species mixing can alleviate drought stress and improve the drought resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to expand species mixing to maximize plantation functions and minimize the potential impacts of warming and drought in semi-arid regions.

AB  - One of the most important achievements of the Tuvans in the process of adaptation to the nomadic culture and to the extreme continental climate of Central Asia was the breeding of various domestic animals adapted to different ecological conditions of the region. The main wealth of a nomad is livestock: horses, camels, cattle, sheep and goats, yaks, and reindeer. The article analyses the problems of livestock theft in Tuva from the mid-nineteenth century to the current state, as well as structure and dynamics of livestock theft. The main reasons for livestock theft and its reduced detection are analysed. On the basis of the conducted research, the authors have revealed a subjective portrait of a Tuvan livestock thief. Grazing as one of the factors of stock theft was studied. Suggestions on preventing livestock theft and recommendations on counteracting this crime are made.

AB  - Copepoda is the most abundant taxon in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hard substrate is available. Despite the increasing interest in seafloor massive sulphides exploitation, there have been no population genomic studies conducted on vent meiofauna, which are known to contribute over 50% to metazoan biodiversity at vents. To bridge this knowledge gap, restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, specifically 2b-RADseq, was used to retrieve thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from abundant populations of the vent-obligate copepod Stygiopontius lauensis from the Lau Basin. SNPs were used to investigate population structure, demographic histories and genotype-environment associations at a basin scale. Genetic analyses also helped to evaluate the suitability of tailored larval dispersal models and the parameterization of life-history traits that better fit the population patterns observed in the genomic dataset for the target organism. Highly structured populations were observed on both spatial and temporal scales, with divergence of populations between the north, mid, and south of the basin estimated to have occurred after the creation of the major transform fault dividing the Australian and the Niuafo'ou tectonic plate (350 kya), with relatively recent secondary contact events (<20 kya). Larval dispersal models were able to predict the high levels of structure and the highly asymmetric northward low-level gene flow observed in the genomic data. These results differ from most studies conducted on megafauna in the region, elucidating the need to incorporate smaller size when considering site prospecting for deep-sea exploitation of seafloor massive sulphides, and the creation of area-based management tools to protect areas at risk of local extinction, should mining occur.

AB  - Shifts between the alternate stable states of sea urchin barren grounds and kelp forests correspond to sea urchin density. In the Aleutian Archipelago, green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus polyacanthus are the dominant herbivores that graze kelp forests. Sea urchin recruitment is an important driver that influences sea urchin density, particularly in the absence of top-down control from a keystone predator such as the sea otter Enhydra lutris. To understand how the biological community may influence patterns of sea urchin recruitment, we compared sea urchin recruit (size <= 20 mm) densities with biomass of other benthic organisms in both barren ground and kelp forest habitats at 9 islands across the Aleutian Archipelago. Patterns of biological community structure between the 2 habitats did not explain patterns of sea urchin recruits; however, the same 10 specific taxa were found to correlate with sea urchin recruits in each habitat. Taxa that showed strong positive correlations included Codium, Constantinea, Schizymenia, and hydrozoans, while strong negative correlations were observed with Pachyarthron and Pugettia. Weak positive correlations were observed with Alcyonidium and ascidiaceans in both habitats, while weak variable relationships were detected with Polysiphonia and Corallina between habitats. The observed species-specific relationships may be due to small sea urchin displacement by larger conspecifics, larval responses to settlement cues, post-settlement survival via biogenic refugia, or potentially predation. These potential species-specific interactions were apparent, regardless of habitat, and it can be inferred that they would be preserved in the presence or absence of keystone predation.

AB  - Simple Summary Black flies, also known as buffalo gnats, are major pests to humans and animals. Females of some black fly species serve as vectors for transmitting several pathogens (i.e., filarial nematodes, blood protozoa, viruses, and bacteria) to humans and animals via their bites. In Thailand, some human-biting species are considered as natural vectors of zoonotic onchocerciasis. This study was the first to contribute baseline data on the community structure, biodiversity and spatial and temporal distribution of adult black flies in tropical forests of the highest mountain in northern Thailand, Doi Inthanon National Park, by using malaise traps. Adult black flies were captured monthly at low to high elevation sites, using malaise traps across three seasons during a one-year period. A total of 44 species were identified among 9406 specimens. It was found that species richness was greatest at the mid elevation. Black fly populations peaked in the rainy season at all elevation sites. The findings of this study showed that varied elevations and seasons are important factors that influence the distribution and abundance of black flies in this region. Black flies form a group of small blood-sucking insects of medical and veterinary importance. This study aimed to investigate the community structure, biodiversity and spatial and temporal distribution of adult black flies in tropical rain forests, by using malaise traps in Doi Inthanon National Park, northern Thailand. Malaise traps were placed along six elevational gradients (400 m to 2500 m, above sea level) at Doi Inthanon National Park, Chiang Mai province, from December 2013 to November 2014. A total of 9406 adult female black flies belonging to five subgenera-Daviesellum (2%), Gomphostilbia (23%), Montisimulium (11%), Nevermannia (16%) and Simulium (48%)-were collected. Among 44 taxa found, S. tenebrosum complex had the highest relative abundance (11.1%), followed by the S. asakoae species-group (9.6%), the S. striatum species-group (7.7%), S. inthanonense (6.6%), S. doipuiense complex (6.4%), S. chomthongense complex (5.3%), S. chumpornense (5.1%) and S. nigrogilvum (4.1%). Two human-biting species-S. nigrogilvum and species in the S. asakoae species-group-were found in all of the collection sites with 100% species occurrence. Species richness was highest at mid elevation (1400 m), which is represented by 19 black fly species. The peak and lowest seasonal abundance was observed in the rainy and hot season, respectively. Seasonal species richness was highest in the cold season, except for that from elevation sites at 700 m, 1700 m and 2500 m. This study revealed that the malaise trap is effective in providing important data for further monitoring of the effects of environmental changes and conservation planning on the biodiversity of black flies in Doi Inthanon National Park.

AB  - <ol><li>Infectious disease can shape community structure, particularly when pathogens affect foundation species. Seagrasses are foundation species that form meadows along coasts worldwide, controlling sediment deposition and biogeochemical cycling while supporting a diverse community of fish and invertebrates. These plants are hosts to wasting diseases that cause necrotic tissue lesions, which could alter seagrass value as food, habitat and mediators of ecosystem processes. However, such biotic interactions and influences on disease dynamics are still not well understood.</li><li>We investigated whether a common herbivore affected the development of wasting disease on eelgrass. We measured the severity and prevalence of eelgrass wasting disease in a meadow across two summers through repeated field surveys. We assessed the role of the eelgrass herbivore on disease spread and growth using microcosm and mesocosm experiments. We further explored herbivore feeding preferences in a choice trial, which was paired with chemical analysis of plant tissue and analysed using a structural equation model.</li><li>While the herbivore facilitates the growth of new disease lesions among isolated leaves, on balance they reduce lesion severity by more than 50% in comparison with no-herbivore controls in field-realistic settings. This was likely because the herbivore strongly prefers to eat diseased rather than healthy tissue, consuming nearly twice as much lesion area in choice trials. This preference arises from pathogen-driven changes in the host plant; lesioned tissue requires less force to penetrate than non-lesioned tissue. Additionally, as lesions increase in size, their polyphenolic concentrations drop, which further increases the magnitude of preference for lesioned tissue.</li><li>Synthesis: These results suggest that these herbivores could help maintain disease in this system at a high prevalence (by facilitating disease development) but low severity (through preferential consumption), which is consistent with our field observations of nearly 100% prevalence and low severity in a natural bed where herbivore density is high. Describing such multi-species interactions in marine systems will advance our predictions of future disease states, as current understandings focus primarily on how environmental change contributes to pathogen outbreaks.</li> </ol>

AB  - Overcompensation to herbivory is prevalent among plant species. However, we do not yet fully understand why plant species vary in their compensatory abilities. It is highly likely that overcompensation is determined by the ability of plants to elevate photosynthesis in response to herbivory, which is dictated by evolutionary exposure to grazing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic overcompensation should be predictable based on plant life form by simulating herbivore damage on four plant species: two common range grasses with long evolutionary exposure to grazing (Andropogon gerardii, Bouteloua curtipendula) and two common understory forbs that are resistant to, and therefore experience little, grazing (Alliaria petiolata, Symplocarpus foetidus). We measured leaf-level gas exchange in a high-resolution time series that extended throughout the growing season. We found no evidence of photosynthetic compensation for three of the four plant species. Interestingly, only A. petiolata, a highly invasive species, demonstrated increased photosynthesis and stomatal conductance following clipping. Further, the effects were short-lived, as both photosynthesis and stomatal conductance returned to baseline levels within 24 h. Our results suggest that elevated photosynthesis to herbivory might not be a general mechanism by which plants either resist or tolerate herbivory.

AB  - Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) forests in the western United States have experienced reduced fire frequency since Euro-American settlement, usually because of successful fire suppression policies and even without such human impacts at remote sites in the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. In an effort to improve our understanding of long-term environmental dynamics in sky-island ecosystems, we developed tree-ring chronologies from ponderosa pines located in the Sheep Mountain Range of southern Nevada, inside the Desert National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR). After comparing those dendrochronological records with other ones available for the south-central Great Basin, we analyzed their climatic response using station-recorded monthly precipitation and air temperature data from 1950 to 2024. The main climatic signal was December through May total precipitation, which was then reconstructed at annual resolution over the past five centuries, from 1490 to 2011 CE. The mean episode duration was 2.6 years, and the maximum drought duration was 11 years (1924-1934; the "Dust Bowl" period), while the longest episode, 19 years (1905-1923), is known throughout North America as the "early 1900s pluvial". By quantifying multi-annual dry and wet episodes, the period since DNWR establishment was placed in a long-term dendroclimatic framework, allowing us to estimate the potential drought resilience of its unique, tree-dominated environments.

AB  - Insects have limited ability to regulate their body temperature and have thus required a range of strategies to withstand thermally stressful environments. Under unfavorable winter conditions, insects often take refuge under the soil surface to survive. Here, the mealybug insect family was selected for the study. Field experiments were performed in fruit orchards in eastern Spain. We used specifically designed floor sampling methods combined with fruit tree canopy pheromone traps. We found that in temperate climates, the large majority of the mealybugs move from the tree canopy to the roots during the winter, where they turn into belowground root-feeding herbivores to survive and continue underground the reproductive process. Within the rhizosphere, mealybugs complete at least one generation before emerging on the soil surface. The preferred area to overwinter is within 1 m in diameter around the fruit tree trunk, where more than 12,000 mealybug flying males per square meter can emerge every spring. This overwintering pattern has not previously been reported for any other group of insects showing cold avoidance behavior. These findings have implications at the winter ecology level but also at the agronomical level since treatments to control mealybug pests are, until now, only based on the fruit trees' canopy.

AB  - Understanding how carnivores impact ecological communities is essential for guiding effective management actions and conserving biodiversity. Quantifying predators' diets, including prey selectivity, allows for the assessment of the relative effects native and invasive predators may have on prey populations.
   In Australia, populations of a native, terrestrial apex predator, the dingo Canis dingo/C. familiaris, and introduced and invasive subordinate mesopredators, the European red fox Vulpes vulpes and feral cat Felis catus, co-occur, but there is limited understanding of their relative impacts on native and invasive prey in different ecosystems. To assess the possible effects of dingoes, foxes and cats on prey, we examined their diet and prey selectivity across a similar to 10,000 km(2) semi-arid mallee ecosystem.
   Using macroscopic scat analysis, we identified strong dietary niche separation. Larger-bodied dingoes primarily consumed large marsupial herbivores, whereas foxes and cats primarily consumed smaller prey, including introduced and native rodents and birds. Foxes had the broadest diet, and the greatest dietary overlap with cats (O-jk = 0.81), compared with dingoes (O-jk = 0.50) or between dingoes and cats (O-jk = 0.36).
   Livestock were identified in 2% of dingo and 7% of fox scats. Cats and foxes consumed more than 15 times the volume of small native mammals compared with dingoes, including threatened species such as fat-tailed dunnarts Sminthopsis crassicaudata. Cats and foxes also selectively consumed small mammals relative to their estimated availability and consumed fewer large mammals. In contrast, dingoes consumed fewer birds and more echidnas relative to their availability.
   Our results suggest limited intraguild competition within this semi-arid ecosystem, as dingoes are primarily exerting top-down pressure on large herbivores, whereas invasive mesopredators are disproportionately impacting smaller prey, including threatened native mammals.
   Practical implication. Our findings suggest that ongoing conservation management of dingoes, red foxes and feral cats must consider the variation in diets, impacts on prey and ecological roles of these different predator species, and avoid indiscriminate lethal control methods. Quantifying actual, rather than assumed, impacts of predators on threatened native species, large herbivores and livestock is essential to achieve effective and integrated ecosystem management.

AB  - Transrectal ultrasonic-guided massage of the accessory sex glands (TUMASG) is a technique that allows collecting semen requiring few electrical stimuli or even no pulse. A long-acting analogue of oxytocin (carbetocin, 0.1 mg) was i.v. administered before TUMASG in 10 conscious bucks (Experiment 1) and 10 anaesthetized Iberian ibexes (Experiment 2) to shorten the time of semen collection, decrease the number of electrical stimuli and/or improve the semen quality. The ejaculated volume, concentration, quality parameters and kinetics variables of the sperm were determined in fresh semen. The time length of the procedures and the number of electric pulses applied were recorded. Furthermore, stress response indicators (number of vocalizations in Experiment 1; heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, cortisol levels, totals proteins and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in Experiment 2) were documented. In bucks, the administration of carbetocin tended to shorten the time needed for semen collection but no-showed differences in the fresh seminal quality. In the Iberian ibexes, there were no significant differences between groups in the time length of procedures or in the number of animals that ejaculated. Carbetocin administration only reduced the respiratory rate, did it modify fresh semen characteristics in ibexes. In conclusion, the administration of carbetocin did not appear as a useful tool to improve welfare during semen collection with TUMASG or semen quality in conscious bucks and anaesthetized ibexes, having only slight advantages related to the procedure.

AB  - Based on resource availability hypothesis, increasing exogenous nutrient inputs may favour herbivores by improving quality and quantity of host plants. Such plant-herbivore interactions have been demonstrated under nitrogen (N) addition, but less examined in the context of simultaneous inputs of N and phosphorus (P). Here, we conducted a multiple-nutrient addition experiment (Control, N addition alone, P addition alone, both N and P additions) in a Tibetan alpine grassland, to explore how N addition interacts with P to affect the larval density of the grassland caterpillar Gynaephora menyuanensis. We showed that P addition alone did not obviously affect the larval density, but P suppressed N-induced increases in larval density when N and P were simultaneously added. We further found that changes in leaf N:P of host plants induced by nutrient additions regulated larval density more strongly than leaf N or P content. Both increased plant productivity and shifted species composition under nutrient additions contributed less to the larval density. Interactive effects of N and P suggest that the simultaneous inputs of multiple nutrients may boost the carrying capacity of grasslands and reduce the risk of herbivorous insect outbreaks. The work also reveals that the resource availability hypothesis does not well predict the response of insect herbivore to all nutrient inputs, implying the necessity of incorporating N:P stoichiometry in this hypothesis.

AB  - In this paper, I examine the potential of studying living things archaeologically. I adopt and expand the term 'vivifact' first proposed by Kawa, Painter, and Murray [2015. "Trail Trees: Living Artifacts (Vivifacts) of Eastern North America." Ethnobiology Letters 6 (1): 183-188. doi:], defined in this paper as any living plant or animal the appearance, features, or distribution of which can be understood as the product of past human action. The ethical considerations required by living artefacts are discussed. Different types of living things that can be grouped under the vivifact concept are then reviewed, including culturally modified trees, patterns of vegetation growth and living populations having traits selected for by past human activity. Practical approaches are described by which archaeologists can approach these resources. Two case studies are presented from Virginia, one describing vegetation survey in a wooded landscape and one examining modern sheep populations to better understand eighteenth-century sheep. However, the techniques described could be applied anywhere in the world. I propose that vivifacts are best understood through the lens of the systems that create and maintain them. The common ground uniting all living things is that they are produced and maintained by systems, and it is the examination of these systems that can serve to create a unified archaeology of living things.

AB  - Alpine ungulates exemplify climate vulnerability through their spatiotemporal adaptation strategies, yet integrated analyses of these dimensions remain scarce. Here, we investigated how bharal (Pseudois nayaur) in Giant Panda National Park adjusts both time-activity budgets and spatial distributions under extreme seasonal conditions. We deployed a network of 50 infrared cameras along altitudinal transects (3300-4500 m) during summer and winter. We extracted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite imagery for each camera site and calculated the Relative Abundance Index (RAI) to quantify activity intensity and assess its seasonal variation. Our results revealed two key adaptations. (i) Temporal compression: Activity intensity in winter was reduced by 66% compared to summer (RAI: 0.85 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.21; p < 0.01) and exhibited a weaker diurnal-nocturnal contrast (p < 0.05). (ii) Spatial contraction: The bharal's altitudinal range narrowed by 73% from summer (3685-4248 m) to winter (3859-4012 m), accompanied by a significant decrease in NDVI (summer: 0.70 +/- 0.14 vs. winter: 0.14 +/- 0.06; p < 0.05). These findings reveal a dual-phase adaptation in bharal: expanding activity and range in resource-rich summers and contracting both in winter to conserve energy. By integrating infrared camera data with satellite-derived NDVI, our approach highlights how alpine ungulates respond to seasonal challenges and provides a foundation for predicting climate-driven shifts in high-elevation ecosystems.

AB  - The population dynamics of most tropical insects are unknown and long-term monitoring programmes are urgently needed to evaluate a possible insect decline in the tropics. In this context, functional groups can be used effectively to summarise time-series for species-rich taxa. Neotropical dung beetles have often been catalogued into functional groups, but close relatives also of ecological significance, the Dynastinae, are awaiting such a classification. Here, we examine the functional groups of Dynastinae at the regional (Panama: 147 species) and local (Barro Colorado Island, BCI: 56 species) scales. Our optimum classification of Panamanian species distinguished five groups, one of which is probably artificial and accounts for species ecologically poorly known. Ecological attributes or species traits mainly influencing the delineation of groups were geographical distribution, body length, seasonal aggregation, larval food and whether the adult may be present in decaying wood. Our analyses indicated that (1) missing trait values and the high percentage of 'cryptic' species (25%) influenced the delineation of groups; (2) the dendrogram similarity of functional groups versus phylogenetic tree was low, although some traits were phylogenetically conserved; and (3) the overall structure of functional groups was conserved when comparing regional and local data, suggesting no drastic loss of functional groups locally. To proceed with the functional classification of poorly known tropical insects, we recommend a cautious selection of traits a priori, inclusion of 'cryptic' species recognised by DNA barcoding, and building phylogenies, which may allow a careful taxonomic imputation to complete species-traits matrices.

AB  - The cultivation of forage crops on wastewater-irrigated soils, while common in many developing countries, poses significant risks due to heavy metal pollution, particularly Lead (Pb) and Nickel (Ni). This practice, aimed at addressing water scarcity challenges and providing affordable irrigation, was investigated for its ecological and human health implications across three diverse sites (site A, site B, and site C). Our study unveiled increases in Pb concentrations in contaminated soil, cultivated with Sesbania bispinosa showing the highest Pb accumulation. The Ni concentrations ranged from 5.34 to 10.43 across all forage crop samples, with S. fruticosa from site C displaying the highest Ni concentration and S. bicolor from site A exhibiting the lowest. Trace element concentrations in the specimens were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The Pb levels in the blood, hair, and feces of farm ruminants (cows, buffaloes, and sheep) varied across the sites, with buffaloes consistently displaying the highest Pb levels. Insights into daily Pb intake by ruminant's highlighted variations influenced by plant species, animal types, and sites, with site C, the cows exhibiting the highest Health Risk Index (HRI) associated with lead exposure from consuming forage crops. Soil and forage samples showed Pb concentrations ranging from 8.003 to 12.29 mg/kg and 6.69-10.52 mg/kg, respectively, emphasizing the severe health risks associated with continuous sewage usage. Variations in Ni concentrations across animal blood, hair, and feces samples underscored the importance of monitoring Ni exposure in livestock, with sheep at site B consistently showing the highest Ni levels. These findings highlight the necessity of vigilance in monitoring trace element (Pb and Ni) exposure in forage crops and livestock, to mitigate potential health risks associated with their consumption, with variations dependent on species, site, and trace element concentrations.

AB  - Ensuring food security in the Anthropocene presents a significant socio-ecological challenge, especially in rapidly changing coastal seascapes that sustain critical fisheries. Herbivorous fishes are essential for food and financial security through fisheries, however, their contributions to regional catches, and the factors influencing them, are not well understood. Analysing reported and reconstructed catch data across 69 Exclusive Economic Zones, we identify shallow-reef area and coastal population density as significant predictors of herbivorous fish catches. However, between-realm (i.e. Indo-Pacific vs. Western Atlantic) differences are marked, with rabbitfishes contributing disproportionately to herbivorous fishery catches. While rabbitfishes have the potential to support productive fisheries due to their relatively faster life-history traits, a 60% decline in catch-per-unit-effort suggests that their production potential, along with parrotfishes and surgeonfishes, may be decreasing globally. Our study highlights contrasting social-ecological outcomes for human populations in the Western Atlantic vs. Indo-Pacific; a difference primarily driven by rabbitfish catches.

AB  - Macroalgae constitute an important habitat for several marine invertebrates, and their biomass and structural complexity modulates the abundance and diversity of species that live on them. Overall, fluctuations in algae biomass inflict fluctuations in the abundance of the associated mobile macrofauna, but the structure of the community may vary according to how each group/species uses the resources provided by the algal habitat. Here, we evaluated how temporal variations in the biomass of Sargassum algal bed (increase, decrease, or maintenance) can affect the abundance, density, and assemblage structure of distinct associated faunistic groups. The collections were performed in three rocky shores located on the north coast of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil, during Fall and Spring. We observed different patterns of algal substrate variation between sampling events, and this reflected on variable effects on the associated fauna. The algal substrate reduction was accompanied by the reduction in the abundance and density of all associated faunal groups. However, the increase or maintenance of the algal substrate was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of peracarids, due to the dominance of herbivorous species, while other taxonomic groups like mollusks and polychaetes decreased or maintained their abundance, although with higher species evenness of gastropods when alga increases. Seasonal biomass variations in macroalgae beds are relevant for the dynamics of its associated fauna, and our results indicate that some taxonomic groups may preferentially use the available extra resources originated from biomass increment when compared to other groups.

AB  - Population density is a valuable metric used to manage wildlife populations. In the Russian Far East, managers use the Formozov- Malyushev-Pereleshin (FMP) snow tracking method to estimate densities of ungulates for hunting management. The FMP also informs Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) conservation since estimates of prey density and biomass help inform conservation interventions. Yet, climate change and challenges with survey design call into question the reliability of the FMP. Camera traps offer a promising alternative, but they remain unexplored for monitoring tiger prey density. Over three years (2020-2022), we used the FMP and camera-based methods to estimate densities of four prey species of the Amur tiger in the Sikhote- Alin Biosphere Reserve, Russian Far East: wild boar (Sus scrofa), red deer (Cervus canadensis), roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), and sika deer (Cervus nippon). We compared FMP results from snow track survey routes either along trails, or along routes representative of the study area, and estimates derived from camera data using the random encounter model (REM), space-to-event model (STE), and time-to-event model (TTE). We found that density estimates from representative routes were typically lower than routes along trails and indicated different relative densities of prey. Density estimates from camera traps and representative track surveys were generally similar with no significant relative bias, but precision was poor for all methods. Differences between estimates were amplified when converted to prey biomass, particularly with larger, more abundant prey, which poses a challenge for their utility for tiger managers. We conclude camera traps can offer an alternative to snow track surveys when monitoring unmarked prey, but we caution that they require considerably more resources to implement. Tiger managers should be especially cautious when extrapolating density to estimates of prey biomass, and we encourage future research to develop more robust methods for doing so.
   Плотность популяции - важный показатель, используемый для управления популяциями диких животных. На Дальнем Востоке России в целях управления охотничьим хозяйством для оценки плотности популяций копытных животных специалисты используют метод зимних следовых учетов (ЗМУ), основанный на формуле Формозова-Малышева-Перелешина (ФМП). Метод ЗМУ также используется для сохранения амурского тигра (Panthera tigris altaica), поскольку оценки плотности и биомассы его видов-жертв помогают обосновать проведение природоохранных мероприятий. Тем не менее, изменение климата и проблемы с организацией исследований ставят под сомнение надежность ЗМУ. Фотоловушки являются многообещающей альтернативой, но они пока остаются неизученными инструментом для мониторинга плотности популяций видов-жертв тигра.
   В течение трех лет (2020-2022 гг.) мы использовали ЗМУ и фотоловушки для оценки плотности популяций четырех видов-жертв амурского тигра - кабана (Sus scrofa), изюбря (Cervus canadensis), косули (Capreolus pygargus) и пятнистого оленя (Cervus nippon) в Сихотэ-Алинском биосферном заповеднике на Дальнем Востоке России. Мы сравнили результаты ЗМУ, полученные на маршрутах, проложенных вдоль троп, или на маршрутах, репрезентативных для территории исследования, и оценки, полученные по данным с фотоловушек с использованием модели случайных встреч (REM), модели << пространство-событие>> (STE) и модели << время-событие>> (TTE). Мы обнаружили, что оценки плотности, полученные на репрезентативных маршрутах, обычно ниже, чем на маршрутах, проложенных вдоль троп, и указывают на разную относительную плотность видов-жертв.
   Оценки плотности, полученные с помощью фотоловушек и на маршрутах, репрезентативных для территории исследования, были в целом схожими, без значительных относительных отклонений, но точность этих оценок была низкой для всех методов. Различия между оценками усиливались при пересчете на биомассу видов-жертв, особенно если речь шла о более крупных и многочисленных животных, что ставит под сомнение полезность таких данных для специалистов по сохранению тигра. Мы пришли к выводу, что фотоловушки могут стать альтернативой следовым учетам при мониторинге животных, особей которых невозможно идентифицировать индивидуально, но предупреждаем, что для их применения требуется значительно больше ресурсов.
   Специалистам по сохранению тигра следует быть особенно осторожными пересчете показателей плотности на биомассу видов-жертв, и мы призываем к проведению дальнейших исследований для разработки более надежных методов для этого.

AB  - The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is one of the survivors of the Late Quaternary megafauna extinctions. However, despite being widely distributed across the Holarctic, brown bears have experienced extensive range reductions, and even extirpations in some geographical regions. Previous research efforts using genetic data have provided valuable insights into their evolutionary history. However, most studies have been limited to contemporary individuals or mitochondrial DNA, limiting insights into population processes that preceded the present. Here, we present genomic data from two Late Pleistocene brown bears from Honshu, Japan and eastern Siberia, and combine them with published contemporary and ancient genomes from across the Holarctic range of brown bears to investigate the evolutionary relationships among brown bear populations through time and space. By including genomic data from Late Pleistocene and Holocene individuals sampled outside the current distribution range, we uncover diversity not present in contemporary populations. Notably, although contemporary individuals display geographically structured populations most likely driven by isolation-by-distance, this pattern varies among the ancient samples across different regions. The inclusion of ancient brown bears in our analysis provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of brown bears and contributes to understanding the populations and diversity lost during the Late Quaternary.

AB  - By their paternal transmission, Y-chromosomal haplotypes are sensitive markers of population history and male-mediated introgression. Previous studies identified biallelic single-nucleotide variants in the SRY, ZFY and DDX3Y genes, which in domestic goats identified four major Y-chromosomal haplotypes, Y1A, Y1B, Y2A and Y2B, with a marked geographical partitioning. Here, we extracted goat Y-chromosomal variants from whole-genome sequences of 386 domestic goats (75 breeds) and seven wild goat species, which were generated by the VarGoats goat genome project. Phylogenetic analyses indicated domestic haplogroups corresponding to Y1B, Y2A and Y2B, respectively, whereas Y1A is split into Y1AA and Y1AB. All five haplogroups were detected in 26 ancient DNA samples from southeast Europe or Asia. Haplotypes from present-day bezoars are not shared with domestic goats and are attached to deep nodes of the trees and networks. Haplogroup distributions for 186 domestic breeds indicate ancient paternal population bottlenecks and expansions during migrations into northern Europe, eastern and southern Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara. In addition, sharing of haplogroups indicates male-mediated introgressions, most notably an early gene flow from Asian goats into Madagascar and the crossbreeding that in the 19th century resulted in the popular Boer and Anglo-Nubian breeds. More recent introgressions are those from European goats into the native Korean goat population and from Boer goat into Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe. This study illustrates the power of the Y-chromosomal variants for reconstructing the history of domestic species with a wide geographical range.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), an important economic crop in China, is highly favored by the population. Microorganisms can help plants acquire soil nutrients and cope with various stresses, and the diversity and structural composition of the rhizosphere microbial community of tea plants are crucial for ensuring the growth and quality of tea leaves. Therefore, we studied the differences in soil nutrients, enzyme activities and microbial communities between two different tea gardens (a tableland tea garden and an ancient tea plantation) in different ecological niches (rhizosphere and bulk soil), as well as the impacts they experienced. The results show that the soil pH levels in the ancient tea plantation were within the optimal range (4.5-5.5), and both rhizosphere and bulk soil nutrients in the ancient tea plantation were higher than those in the tableland tea garden, except for TP; the nutrients in the rhizospheres of ancient tea trees were more abundant. Moreover, higher enzyme activities were observed in the rhizosphere soil than those in the bulk soil in both tea gardens, and both the tableland and ancient tea garden soils were subjected to a certain degree of C&N limitations. The microbial communities of the two tea gardens were dominated by bacteria, but the alpha-diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil of the tableland tea garden was higher than that in the ancient tea plantation. The bacterial communities were largely dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteriota, and the fungal communities were largely dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota in the two tea gardens. The structure and composition of soil bacterial communities in the two tea gardens were similar, whereas significant differences were observed in the fungal communities. In addition, soil pH and SWC were the key factors influencing the fungal community in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil in the two tea gardens, whereas the bacterial community was more significantly affected by soil TN, NH4+-N, SWC and DON. These findings provide essential foundational information for the preservation of ancient tea plantations, the ecological adaptability of ancient tea trees and the management of tableland tea gardens.

AB  - Urbanization drastically alters landscapes in ways that can threaten local biodiversity. Although species loss has been well documented in urban habitats, why some species persist and not others, and how species interactions change remain poorly understood, especially for species with specialized niche requirements. Here, we test the hypothesis that urbanization disrupts specialized plant-herbivore interactions, and these effects vary according to the characteristics of both cities and the features of the organisms themselves. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed milkweed specialist herbivore communities in the early and late growing season of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) across six cities that varied in size by two orders of magnitude. Four results are most important to answering our research questions: (1) the abundance of herbivore species was higher in urban than in rural habitats, whereas leaf herbivory was higher in rural than in urban habitats, and these effects varied between seasons and among cities; (2) the higher species diversity and abundance are likely due to a few species being more associated with rural habitats and other species more common in urban habitats, and thus, urbanization alters insect community composition; (3) the species with the lowest dispersal abilities, Rhyssomatus lineaticollis and Liriomyza asclepiadis, were those that were most strongly affected by urbanization, with R. lineaticollis less abundant and L. asclepiadis more abundant in urban areas; and (4) urbanization influenced plant-herbivore interactions by reducing herbivory, but it did not alter species interactions among herbivorous insects. Biodiversity loss, particularly declines of habitat and host specialists, in urban areas remains a critical concern for conservation. Our results indicate that at least some specialist herbivores are more abundant in urban areas than in rural areas and that species interactions remain intact.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict studies of high-altitude areas are rare due to budget constraints and the challenging nature of research in these remote environments. This study investigates the prevalence and increasing trend of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in the mountainous Gaurishankar Conservation Area (GCA) of Nepal, with a specific focus on leopard (Panthera pardus) and Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus laniger). The study analyzes a decade of HWC reports and identifies goats as the livestock most targeted by leopards. The Dolakha district of GCA received the highest number of reports, highlighting the need for mitigation measures in the area. In GCA, livestock attacks accounted for 85% of compensation, with the remaining 15% for human injuries. We estimate that the number of reported wildlife attacks grew on average by 33% per year, with an additional increase of 57 reports per year following the implementation of a new compensation policy during BS 2076 (2019 AD). While bear attacks showed no significant change post-rule alteration, leopard attack reports surged from 1 to 60 annually, indicating improved compensation may have resulted in increased leopard-attack reporting rates. The findings emphasize the economic impact of HWC on local communities and suggest strategies such as increasing prey populations, promoting community education and awareness, enhancing alternative livelihood options, developing community-based insurance programs, and implementing secure enclosures (corrals) to minimize conflicts and foster harmonious coexistence. This research addresses a knowledge gap in HWC in high-altitude conservation areas like the GCA, providing valuable insights for conservation stakeholders and contributing to biodiversity conservation and the well-being of humans and wildlife.
   Recent policy changes have reduced hurdles to receiving compensation for wildlife attacks on people and livestock within the mountainous Gaurishankar Conservation Area of the Himalayas. We show that over the last decade, the number of reported attacks have increased by approximately 33% per year, after accounting for the boost in reporting due to improved compensation. The reported number of injuries by Himalayan black bears was overshadowed by a rise in reports of leopard predation on livestock, particularly goats, an important source of income for local farmers.image

AB  - Blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is considered a pest in several north Indian states. It is destroying many crops both by trampling and eating plants and its damage is more in fields that are close to forest areas. Blue bull harshly affects trees and timber resources by feeding upon tree bark and flowers. Its damage in crop fields can be identified by signs of hoof marks, crop damage, the presence of faecal pellets, uprooted plants etc. Reasons for its increasing population include, a long breeding period, high rate of multiple births, lack of natural predators and its protection under the Wild Life Protection Act (1972). Mitigation strategies for blue bull losses developed using their behaviour comprise co-operative guarding of matured crops and use of preventive methods like olfactory, acoustic and visual repellents, fencing, translocation, sterilization, changing cropping pattern etc. and creation of awareness among farmers. The systematic study on behaviour, bio-ecology, factors responsible for increase in their population density, inflicted losses and development of automated effective integrated technology for their management is the need of the day.

AB  - Impoundment and increased flood duration are some of the most common stressors to declining forested wetlands in coastal Louisiana, USA. One type of restoration that has shown itself to be cost-effective is spoil bank gapping. This type of hydrologic restoration has occurred within the Lac des Allemands swamp of Barataria Basin. After 60 years of impoundment, the hydrogeomorphic processes in the study area were improved. The study area included eight paired 625 m2 sites. Basal area growth over the 7-year period varied between 5.93% and 14.39%, with an average of 8.31%, or just over 1% wood growth per year. Post-restoration basal areas indicate that all our study areas are improving. Pooled together, the 2018-2023 years had significantly higher net production than the pre-project 2017 growing season. The distribution between leaf and wood production was remarkably similar within species types across years, with leaf production consistently exceeding wood production, particularly due to Taxodium distichum. Canopy cover has increased by 20 percent since project construction, and as a result, herbaceous cover tends to decrease over time.

AB  - Since 1983 the Ontario Ministry of Environment (MECP) monitored and identified Niagara River contaminant sources using caged mussels, and recently (2012-2018), passive samplers. Source identification was consistent among monitoring tools. The advantage of passive samplers was the capability to estimate dissolved water contaminants concentrations enabling comparisons with Water Quality Criteria (WQC) and ambient river concentrations. Dieldrin, p, p'-DDE, p, p'-DDD, hexachlorobenzene, and total PCBs exceeded WQC throughout the river. The highest concentrations of mirex (1.4 ng/L), octachlorostyrene (2.8 ng/L), and hexachlorobutadiene (16 ng/L) were at Occidental Chemical Co. Buffalo Ave. sewer 003, and the highest concentrations of a-HCH were at Cayuga Creek (36 ng/L) and Gill Creek (68 ng/L): all were >WQC. The Pettit Flume cove, Little Niagara River downstream of the 102nd St. Waste Site, Bloody Run Creek (associated with the Hyde Park Hazardous Waste site) and Occidental sewer 003 had the highest concentrations of chlorinated benzenes. Sources of dioxins to the Niagara River included; Pettit Flume cove: (water: 3.9-10 pg TEQ/L; sediment: up to 989,400 pg/g), and Bloody Run Creek: (water: 1.2 pg TEQ/L; sediment: 35,098 pg/g-101,113 pg/g). Total PCBs remain high at known and newly identified sources along the Tonawanda Channel (USA): concentrations ranged up to 387 ng/L with most sites between 5 and 19 ng/L compared with the Chippawa Channel (Canada) (<1 ng/L). Generally, contaminant concentrations on the Canadian side were <0.1 ng/L. Continued contaminant track-downs of storm sewers, sediment and groundwater contributions from historical waste sites is needed to determine required remedial actions.Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - Beginning in the nineteenth century, scientists speculated that the Pleistocene megafauna-species such as the giant ground sloth, wooly mammoth, and saber-tooth cat-perished because of rapid climate change accompanying the end of the most recent Ice Age. In the 1950s, a small network of ecologists challenged this view in collaboration with archeologists who used the new tool of radiocarbon dating. The Pleistocene overkill hypothesis imagined human hunting, not climate change, to be the primary cause of megafaunal extinction. This article situates the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis in a broader history of the emergence of historical ecology as a distinct sub-discipline of paleoecology. Tracing the work of the Yale Geochronometric Laboratory and an interdisciplinary research network that included Paul Sears, Richard Foster Flint, Edward Deevey, Kathryn Clisby, and Paul S. Martin, it reveals how both the methods and the meaning of studying fossil pollen shifted between the 1910s and 1960s. First used as a tool for fossil fuel extraction, fossil pollen became a means of envisioning climatic history, and ultimately, a means of reimagining global ecological history. First through pollen stratigraphy and then through radiocarbon dating, ecologists reconstructed past biotic communities and rethought the role of humans in these communities. By the 1980s, the discipline of historical ecology would reshape physical environments through the practice of ecological restoration.

AB  - Plant-insect associations have been a significant component of terrestrial ecology for more than 400 Myr. Exploring these interactions in the fossil record through novel perspectives provides a window into understanding evolutionary and ecological forces that shaped these interactions. For the past several decades, researchers have documented, described, and categorized fossil evidence of these interactions. Drawing on powerful tools from network science, we propose here a bipartite network representation of fossilized plants and their herbivore-induced leaf damage to understand late Paleozoic plant-insect interactions at the local community level. We focus on four assemblages from north-central Texas, but the methods used in this work are general and can be applied to any well-preserved fossil flora. Network analysis can address key questions in the evolution of insect herbivory that often would be difficult to summarize using standard herbivory metrics.

AB  - In the current period of unprecedented global change, urgent action is needed to establish proactive management strategies for vulnerable species. The obligate avian scavenger guild is a group that provides important ecosystem services and 80 % of the species within the group are threatened. In this study, we applied species distribution models incorporating the favourability function to the threatened bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), to predict the best areas for this species in NE Spain, the home of nearly 50 % of its European breeding population. The model incorporated various environmental variables, including the sheep stocking rate as a proxy for food availability. We also correlated environmental favourability with breeding performance (productivity, breeding success and mating behaviour) taken from 141 reproductive territories, compiled over the last 10 years. Five variables were supported in the favourability model: steepness of slope, distance to an unpaved road, surrounding human population density, minimum temperature, and sheep stocking rate. Favourability was positively correlated with productivity and breeding success, suggesting that high quality habitats are associated with high breeding performance. Regarding the association between environmental favourability and mating behaviour, we found that environmental favourability was only marginally statistically significantly correlated with the event of polygamous reproductive trios. Considering the prevailing environmental conditions, including topography, land use, and livestock density, our findings suggest that NE Spain still has unused potentially suitable breeding sites for the future geographical expansion of the species. Our results identified specific areas that should be prioritized for future landscape protection, management, and conservation action.

AB  - The role of animals in geomorphology remains largely understudied, even though animal energy remains an important factor in exogenic geomorphology. To better understand the coupling of geophysical and ecological processes, annual montane water vole (Arvicola scherman) burrowing impacts were monitored in a high-altitude grassland ecosystem in the Swiss Pre-Alps. Considered an engineer species, the montane water vole generated significant geomorphic impacts for 2021-2022. With an average density of 14.4 burrows ha- 1, the sediments excavated in the form of earth tumuli erode easily under the effect of gravity, with a slope of over 20 degrees. The sediment volumes calculated correspond to an average excavation rate of 100 t/ha yr- 1. According to the literature, apart from marmots, pocket gophers and other vole species, few burrowing mammals have such a high sediment potential displacement. The data collected show the importance of monitoring water vole populations, given the multiannual large-amplitude fluctuations in populations, which appear at least, partially related to agricultural land use and landscape patterns. Finally, the study of cascading environmental effects linked to animal activity can provide information on the geo-ecosystem from a functional point of view, particularly in the light of ongoing climate change, biodiversity loss and anthropogenic transformations.

AB  - The role of keystone species in maintaining ecosystem stability is a crucial aspect of ecology. Identifying key mammalian species within an ecosystem requires a systematic approach, utilizing criteria and indicators derived from species characteristic variables. This study presents a framework to identify key mammalian species based on various ecological, structural, and functional factors. By developing a mechanistic model of energy flow in food webs and trophic levels, the model aims to pinpoint each species' role in the stability and sustainability of biomass flow within the ecosystem. Known as KVT version 1.0, the model explains the role of each characteristic variable of mammalian species, predicts population growth, elucidates species interactions at trophic levels, and assesses species-specific dietary compositions, including food requirements, reproduction, and activity. Factor analysis of model outputs has produced equations to determine the value of keystone species (Kv), indicating the role of mammalian species in the stability and sustainability of biomass flow in the ecosystem. Keystone species, as identified by this model, are primarily small mammals of the families Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae, Ptilocercidae, Hystricidae, Viverridae, and Herpestidae, demonstrating omnivorous and herbivorous trophic levels. This model can serve as a valuable framework for conservation management of biodiversity in an ecosystem, with potential for expansion to include characteristics of non-mammalian species in future research.

AB  - The overabundance of sika deer has become a significant threat to plant communities across Japan. As a result of the deer overgrazing, rare plants are undergoing a demographic bottleneck, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is crucial for the reproductive success of self-incompatible plants, and it also provides evolutionary potential, which increases their long-term population viability. Therefore, it is essential to appropriately manage the remaining genotypes to conserve local genetic resources. In this study, we exemplify this, via a conservation genetic analysis of Parasenecio peltifolius populations impacted by deer. Genetic data revealed that the small populations confined to isolated refugial sites consisted of effectively single genets. Recent reproductive failures in these populations may be attributed to the loss of genotypic diversity. Despite the bottlenecks, the remaining genets exhibited high individual heterozygosity, which is a good indicator that they have not been affected by severe inbreeding. Hybrid simulations suggested that interpopulation outbreeding between the unique genotypes can be a viable option to promote sexual reproduction and re-establish genetic diversity within the local populations. Establishing artificial progenies in botanical gardens can serve as a vital genetic resource for the long-term viability of threatened P. peltifolius populations.
   This study genetically investigated the endangered Parasenecio peltifolius populations threatened by deer overgrazing to reveal that the remaining populations consisted of single genetic clones. Hybrid simulations suggested that artificial crosses between the unique genotypes can be a viable option to re-establish genetic diversity within the local populations and promote sexual reproduction. The artificial progenies in ex situ botanical gardens can serve as a vital genetic resource for the long-term survival of threatened populations. image

AB  - For wide-ranging species, it is often too expensive or politically challenging to effectively implement conservation action across their range. In these cases, conservation actions may be vigorously applied where the situation appears most dire, but inadvertently at the expense of where success is more probable. Consequently, it is prudent to use a prioritization approach that highlights areas of probable success. Using Southern Mountain Caribou as a target species, we develop a simple algorithm that integrates scaled habitat quality measures and population characteristics known to affect the demographics of caribou and weights them according to their relative importance as defined by expert opinion. The algorithm ranks subpopulations by their relative conservation status and, as a result, how likely they are to respond to additional conservation efforts and contribute to long-term species persistence. Sensitivity analyses are then used to measure the implications of variance among key criteria and the potential variance in expert weighting. The transparent method quickly allows for real, or potential changes in criteria values, scaling, or their relative weighting, thus providing a baseline metric for conservation discussion, subpopulation comparisons, and adaptive management action. A web-based application of the algorithm can be used directly or adapted for other species. This transparent framework can be used by conservation scientists and managers for prioritizing populations for receiving recovery actions to maximize long-term conservation impact.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) can induce changes in marine organisms and species interactions. We examined OA effects on intertidal macroalgal growth, palatability, and consumption by a specialist crab (Pugettia producta) and a generalist snail (Tegula funebralis) herbivore. Moderate increases in pCO2 increased algal growth in most species, but effects of pCO2 on C:N and phenolic content varied by species. Elevated pCO2 had no effect on algal acceptability to herbivores, but did affect their preference ranks. Under elevated pCO2, electivity for a preferred kelp (Egregia menziesii) and preference rankings among algal species strengthened for both P. producta and T. funebralis, attributable to resilience of E. menziesii in elevated pCO2 and to changes in palatability among lesspreferred species. Preferred algae may therefore grow more under moderate pCO2 increases in the future, but their appeal to herbivores may be strengthened by associated shifts in nutritional quality and defensive compounds in other species.

AB  - The relationship between plant diversity and ecosystems functions such as regulation of insect herbivory is complex and context-dependent. The empirical data necessary to account for these interactions are scarce. Our objective is to test the top-down effects of predation and bottom-up effects of plant traits to understand what drives patterns of herbivory in managed systems. We established single- and multiple-variety willow field plots with up to four varieties, to study herbivory and predation, and greenhouse experiments to investigate the effects on insect preference and performance. Herbivore damage in the field was higher in single- as opposed to multiple-variety plots for the two most prevalent insect types in one of the 3 years. Predation was higher in multiple-variety plots than in pure plots during 2016 but the opposite occurred in 2018. Predation on leaf beetle eggs was higher in multiple-variety plots, but the result was related to specific variety mixtures rather than increased numbers of varieties. Leaf beetle feeding choice and egg-laying were influenced to some extent by plant diversity. Our results give insights into the links between plant diversity, composition and levels of herbivore damage. They also spark questions about how temporal aspects influence these links.

AB  - Wild ungulate population management in Europe and North America is mainly based on hunting. However, populations continue to grow despite hunting pressure, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations, with significant economic and environmental consequences. Meanwhile, hunters' number is declining. In order to understand the hunting effectiveness and to improve management strategies, the cullability conceptual framework, derived from fisheries science, can be applied to the harvesting of terrestrial species. Cullability refers to the probability of culling an individual under specific hunting conditions and can vary in space and time depending on the behavior of the animals and the conditions affecting hunters. While cullability represents a probability of cull, combined with hunting effort, the result is the hunting success, i.e. number of harvested individuals, corresponding to hunting bag result. Using a unique hunting bag dataset including 330,000 hunting trips collected over more than 10 years in Southern France based on daily hunting and weather data, we seek to understand the impact of weather conditions on hunting success and hunting effort using a Bayesian model selection approach. We found that weather conditions significantly affect both hunting success and effort and reveal a reduction in hunting success under rainy and cold conditions, in contrast to a significant increase in success under frost and snowfall. Interestingly, all weather conditions outside the comfort zone of hunters lead to a decrease in hunting effort. This raises interesting questions about the hunters' perception of hunting success, as weather can negatively impact the allocation of hunting effort in situations of potentially greater hunting success. The cullability framework provides a clear understanding of the hunting process by separating all its components, proposing a clear glossary, and identifying the factors that enable hunting success to be interpreted. In a context where hunting is a management tool, each component can represent one of these tools, which can either be controlled or accounted for better in space and time.Graphical AbstractCullability framework and Bayesian modelling reveal non-concomitant impact of weather conditions on hunting success and effort for wild boar.

AB  - Studies of habitat-related behaviour of mammals are time-consuming. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring the behaviour of mammals in different habitat types using drones mounted with thermal cameras in combination with a YOLO object detection model. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) were used as model species. The data were collected in the nature reserve, Hanstholm, Northern Denmark. The aim is to develop an AI model capable of distinguishing between four behaviours, "foraging", "locomoting", "lying" and "standing", allowing for insights into the rumination and foraging cycle of the two species. At the same time, the behaviour was linked to habitat types by geocoding individuals. The method developed in this study proved to be time-efficient and provided information about how the two deer species used vegetation types and interspecific interaction between the two species. Technical challenges were to follow individuals and the possibility of missing cyclical behaviour. It was found that the degree to which the ungulates actively foraged was significantly different between the two species and that they were clearly geographically separated within the study area.

AB  - Spiny shrubs can generate positive interactions with palatable trees in sites affected by abiotic and biotic stress (e.g. fire, and consumption by herbivores). The objective of this study was to assess the role of native shrubs (Berberis microphylla) in mitigating large herbivore browsing on tree saplings (Nothofagus antarctica) in degraded (burnt) forests of the central area of Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. For that, we assessed, in 16 forest sites, the browsing intensity and the browsing height in N. antarctica saplings that were alone (n = 10 per site), and in saplings that were spatially associated with B. microphylla shrubs (n = 10 per site). The tree and shrub height were also measured. The results indicated that browsing damage on hire trees occurred at a higher height and with lower intensity in the tree-shrub association than in trees that were alone. Furthermore, the browsing height was positively related with the shrub height and with the tree height. The shorter trees with greater shrub cover were more protected. Our results indicate that the presence of spiny shrubs decreases the damage caused by browsing, and protects trees during the early regeneration stage. However, the structural characteristics of shrubs are determinant of the protecting effect in these Patagonian forests. This tree-shrub interaction is highly relevant in the dynamics of degraded forests to ensure the system continuity in ecological and productivity terms.

AB  - The concurring effect of herbivory by wild ungulates and drought events is experiencing a notable increase in Mediterranean and temperate forests. While many studies have addressed the influence of drought on plant susceptibility to herbivory, it appears crucial to comprehend the impact of prolonged browsing on the physiological response of plants to increasing water deficit. To this end, we analyzed the effect of long-term recurrent herbivory by ungulates on physiological, biochemical, anatomical and morphological variables of Ilex aquifolium and Fagus sylvatica saplings during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 in a mixed sub-Mediterranean forest. We compared plants growing within an exclosure fence since 2006 (unbrowsed) with plants growing outside (browsed) that were also fenced during the study to investigate herbivory legacy. Twelve years of herbivory pressure modified significantly plant functional performance. Independently of the species, browsed plants showed higher root-to-shoot ratio, stem cross-sectional area-to-leaf area ratio, predawn leaf water potential, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf gas exchange rates than unbrowsed plants. Moreover, browsed plants had lower leaf bulk modulus of elasticity, and higher osmotic potential at full turgor and turgor loss point. Thus, herbivory modified the leaf economic spectrum towards a more resource-acquisitive and less water stress tolerant type. These results suggest that, once browsing has subsided, plants continue to reflect some legacy effects that make them more vulnerable to further abiotic and biotic stresses, which has implications for forest regeneration.

AB  - Natural green pastures, weeds and tree fodders support commercial goat rearing under semi-intensive system. This study, conducted at Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Tiruppur District, Tamil Nadu, aimed to assess the growth, production and reproductive performance of Salem black goats reared under a semi-intensive method in the garden land ecosystem. Data were collected from 10 male and 23 female Salem black goats and analysed. Body weight was recorded at birth and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months of age. The mean (+/- SE) birth weights of male and female kids were 2.45 +/- 0.06 Kg and 2.12 +/- 0.01 Kg, respectively. The mean (+/- SE) weaning weights of male and female kids were 11.22 +/- 0.36 Kg and 9.56 +/- 0.09 Kg, respectively. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated based on body weight, with the highest ADG recorded at three months of age-108 g/day for males and 77 g/ day for females. The age at first kidding, kidding percentage, kidding rate, twinning percentage and kidding interval of Salem black females were 14.42 +/- 0.13 months, 100%, 1.39 +/- 0.25, 39.13% and 7.760 +/- 0.09 months, respectively. The overall liveability percentage of Salem black goats in the study was 95.03%. The results indicate that Salem black goats perform well under the garden land ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Biologists increasingly use translocation to restore animals to areas where they have been extirpated. However, we know little about how translocation decisions influence translocation-mediated social dynamics. Breeding in polygynous ungulate mating systems is typically dominated by prime age males, but founding males within translocated ungulate populations often are comprised of only young individuals. We investigated the influence of releasing exclusively young-aged males on mating system and male reproductive success during an elk (Cervus canadensis) restoration program in Missouri. From 2011 to 2013, we translocated and released 106 elk from Kentucky to Missouri, U.S.A. We collected tissue samples for DNA from all translocated elk and subsequently captured adults and calves in Missouri during 2014-2018 for paternity analysis. Initial levels of polygyny were low but increased and acclimated over the initial years following translocation, commensurate with advancing sire age structure and increasing population density. Sire age was positively associated with individual male reproductive success initially, but the effect of age decreased as polygyny acclimated and sire age structure became older and more variable. Polygyny levels in the reintroduced population were restored to expected values within 4 years of the last translocation event, demonstrating the acclimation of mating structure despite a translocation tactic favoring young-aged males. Importantly, initial dampened polygyny may facilitate retention of genetic variation by maximizing the genetic contribution of more founding individuals; however, benefits to genetic variation retention should be considered against potential demographic consequences to calves sired by young males.

AB  - This study assesses habitat suitability and identifies conservation priority areas for the endangered Marco Polo sheep throughout Khunjerab National Park (Pakistan) and Tashkurgan Natural Reserve (China). We analyzed species occurrence records against environmental variables (elevation, slope, climate, land cover) using MaxEnt modeling. Model performance was validated through AUC-ROC analysis and response curves, generating spatial predictions of suitable habitats to inform conservation strategies. Spatial predictions were generated to map potential distribution zones, aiding conservation planning for this endangered species. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, yielding an AUC of 0.919, indicating strong discriminatory capability. Elevation (43.9%), slope (25.9%), and September precipitation (15.9%) emerged as the most influential environmental predictors, collectively contributing 85.7% to the model. The total percentage contribution and permutation significance values were 98.6% and 77.8%, respectively. Jackknife analysis identified elevation (bio-1), slope (bio-7), hillshade (bio-2), and the maximum July temperature (bio-9) as the most significant factors influencing the distribution of Marco Polo sheep, Conversely, variables such as viewshade (bio-14), land cover (bio-3), and precipitation in August (bio-4) contributed a minimal gain, suggesting that they had little impact on accurately predicting species distribution. The habitat suitability map reveals varying conditions across the study area, with the highest suitability (yellow zones) found in the northern and western regions, particularly along the Wakhan Corridor ridgelines. The southern regions, including Khunjerab Pass, show predominantly low suitability, marked by purple zones, suggesting poor habitat conditions. The eastern region displays moderate to low suitability, with fragmented patches of green and yellow, indicating seasonal habitats. The survival of transboundary Marco Polo sheep remains at risk due to poaching activities and habitat destruction and border fence barriers. This study recommends scientific approaches to habitat restoration together with improved China-Pakistan cooperation in order to establish sustainable migratory patterns for this iconic species.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that land-use intensification contributes to destabilization of trophic networks of insect communities in agriculture resulting in a loss of biodiversity. However, a more detailed understanding of the causes and consequences of the widely reported insect decline is still lacking. Here, we used standardised daily long-term data on the activity of flying insects (similar to 250 d/year) to describe the interactive effects of climate warming in intensively cultivated regions and changes in predatory taxa on the general long-term trend of insects and the regulation of herbivores. While the intensely managed landscapes examined in this study show a substantial decline in several taxonomic groups (95.1% total biomass loss in 24 year), the data on aphids support a general assumption that biodiversity loss is often closely associated with arising pest problems. Aphids being pests in agroecosystems develop earlier in spring in overall higher annual abundances. The data highlight that regional insect abundances have declined over recent decades in agricultural landscapes, thus indicating fundamental effects on food webs and insect herbivore performance.

AB  - There has been accumulating evidence for effects of tree species composition on herbivory with many examples of lower damage by specialist feeders in tree species rich forests. In a joint study in five Central and Southeastern European countries, we studied the effect of tree species richness on infestation intensity of the oak lace bug, Corythucha arcuata (Say) (Heteroptera, Tingidae), an invasive pest on oak trees that has spread rapidly across the Balkan Peninsula and Central Europe. Intensity of infestation by C. arcuata on oaks was assessed on three or four study plots with high (pure stands) and three or four plots with low percentage of oak (mixed stands) in each country. Ordinal regression analysis showed that intensity of infestation of trees by C. arcuata differed between countries; no significant effect of stand type (mixed or pure) on infestation levels was detected. When analysing the percentage of trees in the highest infestation class, stand type had a significant effect with more intensive infestation in pure stands. We conclude that mixed stands will not prevent severe infestation but may help mitigating the impact of established C. arcuata populations.

AB  - The nature reserve was founded in 1939 in the limits of the Barsa Kelmes Island (the Aral Sea, Kazakhstan) for the conservation of the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). In 1953 kulan from Turkmenistan (Equus hemionus kulan) were introduced to the island. The drying up of the Aral Sea led to a junction with the mainland, in the late 1990s. In search of water animals began migrating. For more than 20 years, the rangelands of the former island have not been grazed. A comparative analysis of rangeland productivity between the modern period and the 1970-80s of the last century showed that it has been increased by almost 2 times due to 20 years break of grazing pressure. The natural diet of wild ungulates in the reserve includes 105 species of vascular plants belonging to 26 families and 70 genera. A rangeland map has been compiled based on the interpretation of satellite imagery and field data. The legend to the map contains 16 mapped units. Each mapping unit corresponds to a rangeland type. For each type of rangeland, the total yield is calculated for seasons of the year. The map provides important information for understanding the available forage resources for wild ungulates.

AB  - Concrete-lined water conveyance canals can be a significant source of mortality for ungulates and other wildlife, which can drown or become entrapped. Various types of wildlife escape structures have been deployed in canals with limited success. From 2011 to 2018, we used camera traps to monitor mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) use of three different temporary wildlife escape structure designs with the goal of developing an effective escape structure for fawns. We monitored three to five locations at a hydroelectric water conveyance canal, operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company in the foothills of Central California on the Sierra National Forest, in which trapped fawns had been detected previously during the maintenance period when the canal was dry. Mule deer activity and ramp use varied by year. During the monitoring period, deer were detected in the canal in all years except 2016 and 2017. Fawns and adults used the temporary escape structures to exit the canal in four of these years and 50% of mule deer detections showed ramp use overall. No deer were detected using the escape structures until jute netting and debris were added to the surface of the escape ramps in the third monitoring year. Prior to this modification, fawns were detected trapped in the canal investigating the ramps, but not using them to exit the canal. Deer may be more likely to utilize ramps covered with materials that mimic native ground cover. Seven other wildlife species were detected entering and exiting using the ramps with a general increase in use over years. Our temporary escape ramp design for small canals, when dry, appears to be novel and may be applicable in other areas. When compared to fencing or covering the canal, it is a relatively low-cost solution to reduce animal entrapment.

AB  - Phenotypic variability results from interactions between genotype and environment and is a major driver of ecological and evolutionary interactions. Measuring the relative contributions of genetic variation, the environment, and their interaction to phenotypic variation remains a fundamental goal of evolutionary ecology.
   In this study, we assess the question: How do genetic variation and local environmental conditions interact to influence phenotype within a single population? We explored this question using seed from a single population of common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, in northern Michigan. We first measured resistance and resistance traits of 14 maternal lines in two common garden experiments (field and greenhouse) to detect genetic variation within the population. We carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment with three of these maternal lines to assess effects of local environment on phenotype. Finally, we compared the phenotypic traits measured in our experiments with the phenotypic traits of the naturally growing maternal genets to be able to compare relative effect of genetic and environmental variation on naturally occurring phenotypic variation. We measured defoliation levels, arthropod abundances, foliar cardenolide concentrations, foliar latex exudation, foliar carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and plant growth.
   We found a striking lack of correlation in trait expression of the maternal lines between the common gardens, or between the common gardens and the naturally growing maternal genets, suggesting that environment plays a larger role in phenotypic trait variation of this population. We found evidence of significant genotype-by-environment interactions for all traits except foliar concentrations of nitrogen and cardenolide. Milkweed resistance to chewing herbivores was associated more strongly with the growing environment. We observed no variation in foliar cardenolide concentrations among maternal lines but did observe variation among maternal lines in foliar latex exudation.
   Overall, our data reveal powerful genotype-by-environment interactions on the expression of most resistance traits in milkweed.

AB  - During cryopreservation, the spermatozoa faces osmo-chemical, mechanical and thermal stresses, which are predominant at dilution, cooling, equilibration, freezing and thawing stages. They damage functional and morphological characteristics of sperms. Beside these exogenous stresses there is an oxidative stress which damages the spermatozoa endogenously. These stresses can be controlled with the inclusion of antioxidants in semen extender at the time of cryopreservation. In the current study, semen from four (n=4) healthy Nili Ravi buffalo bulls was collected through artificial vagina and Gallic acid was added to the semen at 1 mu M, 15 mu M, 30 mu M, 45 mu M, 60 mu M, and 100 mu M. A total of six groups were prepared. One group was kept as control where no Gallic acid was added. After the addition of extender, semen was cooled to 4 degrees C, filled in 0.5mL straws for 4 h and frozen in liquid nitrogen at-196 degrees C. The parameters evaluated were percentage motility, plasma membrane integrity (HOST assay), acrosomal integrity (NAR), viability (Live/Dead), DNA integrity (Acridine orange assay) and oxidative stress (TBARS assay). Five straws from each Gallic acid group were thawed individually in water bath at 37 degrees C for 30 seconds. The addition of 15 mu M GA to semen extender improved marginally the buffalo bull spermatozoa motility, viability and membrane integrity but still not sufficient to reach the statistical significance, while it has no protective effects on other parameters like Acrosomal integrity, DNA status and oxidative stress. However further studies are needed to assess the role of Gallic acid in different concentrations and in other animals.

AB  - Due to high costs and time constraints, it can be difficult for traditional field-based methods to acquire sufficient data to identify priority species or areas in marine conservation planning. Local ecological knowledge (LEK) is increasingly used as an important source of information for evidence-based management strategies, but its usefulness for informing conservation prioritization for threatened marine species has rarely been assessed. Here, we conducted the first range-wide systematic survey of five marine megafauna (Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Indo-Pacific finless porpoise, dugong, whale shark, sea turtles) using interviews with fishers in the northern South China Sea (SCS), one of the richest marine biodiversity hotspots in the world, to assess the ability of LEK to highlight priority species and areas for conservation. Our results reveal that the dugong has become functionally extinct in China, while the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise, whale shark, and sea turtles have all experienced more severe declines compared to the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. Based on the sighting histories of these threatened species, regional conservation priorities and management activities should therefore focus on reducing disturbance pressure in the Beibu Gulf and eastern Guangdong for the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and in eastern/southern Hainan Island for the whale shark and sea turtles. These findings challenge current conservation strategies that prioritize the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin in the SCS, suggesting that coastal dolphins might not be good indicators of the population trends of sympatric marine megafauna. While LEK cannot provide precise abundance and habitat data for highly threatened marine species, we demonstrate that it offers comparable long-term population trend and wide-scale distribution data to inform the prioritization of conservation actions.

AB  - Gobiidae (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) is one of the largest fish families within the teleosts, with a worldwide distribution inhabiting fresh, brackish, and marine waters. The gobiid fishes of the western Indian Ocean remain insufficiently studied, with many species either misidentified or their diversity underestimated. Available data are limited to only a few species, primarily due to their low economic value, small size, cryptic appearance, incomplete geographic sampling, and occurrence in hard-to-sample habitats. The Indo-Pacific tropical sand goby, Favonigobius reichei, belongs to the Gobiopsis lineage within the subfamily Gobiinae and is distributed across the Indo-West Pacific. Here, we report the presence of this cryptic species in the coastal waters of Qeshm Island, marking the first record for the Persian Gulf. We also provide a detailed morphological description, along with a COI-based phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis of the newly collected samples.

AB  - Vegetation dynamics in savannas are largely determined by water availability as well as soil nutrient dynamics. Species composition differs significantly from nutrient-rich soils to nutrient-poor soils, where the former is dominated by fine-leafed palatable woody species and the latter by broad-leafed and less palatable ones. Whilst this typically occurs at a landscape or catena scale, it is also interestingly observed at a localised and micro scale in areas such as wetlands and termite mounds. Wetlands are important edaphic contrasts in savannas and are paradoxically prevalent in the semi-arid to arid regions. In Southern Africa endorheic (inward draining) wetlands, known as pans, are particularly ubiquitous in arid regions but are not well studied compared to other wetland types. These wetlands were the focus of this study, which took place in the semi-arid savanna of the Limpopo plains, South Africa. The key research aims of this study were to determine how the pans differed from the surrounding terrestrial savanna landscape with respect to soil texture and chemistry, woody plant density and vegetation species composition. Top and sub soil samples were analysed to a depth of 30 and 60 cm and vegetation transects were carried out across three identified 'hydro-ecological' zones, i.e. the pan centre, the wooded wetland zone around the pan and representative terrestrial savanna habitat. In addition, drone aerial imagery was utilised to accurately determine woody species density and visually understand habitat changes. As hypothesised, the physiochemical properties of the soils differed along the study gradient from terrestrial to wetland, where in general the soil fertility, clay content and water holding capacity increased. The high clay content of the pans facilitates the surface pooling of rainwater and the possible maintenance of wetland conditions in these depressions which were found to be localised soil nutrient hotspots. The wooded wetland and terrestrial areas differed from each other in woody species composition where the terrestrial areas were largely dominated by broad leafed tree and shrub species and the wooded wetland areas had few to no broad-leafed species present but rather a dominance of fine-leafed Senegalia/Vachelia species. In addition, the Senegalia/Vachelia dominated habitat had a higher tree density than the surrounding bushveld, forming closed canopy patches in some areas. This change in vegetation and soil dynamics are important in savanna ecology as these habitats function quite differently from each other with respect to nutrient cycling, herbivore behaviour and biodiversity. It was concluded that these pans are nutrient-rich hotspots, likely playing an important ecological role in the savanna landscape. Furthermore, as they are likely to be key water sources and preferential forage sites, they could be the first to show signs of degradation and be useful indicators for land managers. These pans should be highlighted as sensitive habitats with regional conservation significance, which are deserving of adequate protection from surrounding threats such as mining.

AB  - Both theory and prior studies predict that climate warming should increase attack rates by herbivores and pathogens on plants. However, past work has often assumed that variation in abiotic conditions other than temperature (e.g. precipitation) do not alter warming responses of plant damage by natural enemies. Studies over short time periods span low variation in weather, and studies over long time-scales often neglect to account for fine-scale weather conditions. Here, we used a 20+ year warming experiment to investigate if warming affects on herbivory and pathogen disease are dependent on variation in ambient weather observed over 3 years. We studied three common grass species in a subalpine meadow in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA. We visually estimated herbivory and disease every 2 weeks during the growing season and evaluated weather conditions during the previous 2- or 4-week time interval (2-week average air temperature, 2- and 4-week cumulative precipitation) as predictors of the probability and amount of damage. Herbivore attack was 13% more likely and damage amount was 29% greater in warmed plots than controls across the focal species but warming treatment had little affect on plant disease. Herbivory presence and damage increased the most with experimental warming when preceded by wetter, rather than drier, fine-scale weather, but preceding ambient temperature did not strongly interact with elevated warming to influence herbivory. Disease presence and amount increased, on average, with warmer weather and more precipitation regardless of warming. Synthesis. The effect of warming over reference climate on herbivore damage is dependent on and amplified by fine-scale weather variation, suggesting more boom-and-bust damage dynamics with increasing climate variability. However, the mean effect of regional climate change is likely reduced monsoon rainfall, for which we predict a reduction in insect herbivore damage. Plant disease was generally unresponsive to warming, which may be a consequence of our coarse disease estimates that did not track specific pathogen species or guilds. The results point towards temperature as an important but not sufficient determinant and regulator of species interactions, where precipitation and other constraints may determine the affect of warming.

AB  - Morphological features of the East Siberian moose were studied in central and southern Yakutia, Siberia from 2005 to 2024. Body size was measured in 15 adult moose, hair colouration was described in 46, and horn shape in 78 individuals. According to morphometric characters, the East Siberian moose (Alces americanus pfizenmayeri) of Yakutia occupies a position intermediate between A. a. buturlini and A. a. cameloides and has morphological features characteristic of a subspecies. Four colour variations have been identified in the body colouration. The most common colouration is light brown (43.4%). In head colouration, 5 colour shades are detected, only brown colouration is common in both sexes. There are some sex differences in head colouration, females being coloured in lighter tones, vs males in darker tones. In males, 4 types of horn shape are identified: shovel- shaped horns with a divided shovel, with a narrow shovel and long ramifications, shovel- shaped with an undivided shovel and stag-shaped horns. Specimens with shovel- shaped antlers with a divided shovel are the most frequent (82.0%). A. a. buturlini has been recorded from central Yakutia.

AB  - The great importance of the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) for the subsistence of the human populations of Patagonia during the Holocene has been demonstrated in numerous studies. This species is considered as the main prey of the hunter-gatherer groups of the Patagonian interior, indicating the existence of a strong ecological relationship of predator-prey type. Despite the importance of this ungulate for prehistoric human populations, its spatial distribution throughout the Holocene has not been systematically explored, assuming that it was ubiquitously distributed in almost all of Patagonia. In this work, the spatial distribution of the guanaco in Patagonia during different periods of the final Pleistocene and Holocene is explored using zooarchaeological and paleontological evidence together with species distribution models and paleoclimatic reconstructions. Likewise, the spatial variation in the importance of this species for the diet of human populations is assessed. The results show that there were large differences in the distribution of guanaco in Patagonia over time. In general terms, this camelid suffered a constant contraction in range since the Late Pleistocene period to the present. There is an Andean range and peri-cordilleran core of population distribution that remains observable during all this time. Human subsistence was strongly influenced by this pattern of distribution. The differences in the guanaco distribution described in this work are important not only for archaeological and paleontological problems, but also for the current conservation of guanacos.

AB  - Description of the subject. Mammal wildlife inside the Luki Biosphere Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo is under strong anthropic pressure, threatening its integrity.Objectives. This study aims to characterize the diversity and conservation status of the Reserve's mammalian animal community, which has not been documented to date. Method. To carry out this analysis, a grid of 40 camera traps was set up for 90 days within the core area of the Reserve, covering an area of 32 km2. Simultaneously, daily monitoring of hunting activity was conducted amongst 50 hunters for 63 days, all from five villages located on the periphery of the reserve. Results. We identified 14 mammalian taxa based on camera trap observations, all of which were identified at least at the genus level, including the endangered chimpanzee (Pan troglotydes). A total of 18 species were hunted during the entire research period. Among the major groups of animals recorded by the two survey approaches, rodents were the most important, representing 86.4 % of camera trap detections and 66.9% of hunted animals, respectively. Medium-sized species, such as duikers, are rarely detected or caught. Compared with other Central African protected areas studied with comparable sampling devices and rates, the Luki Biosphere Reserve appears quite poor, both in terms of richness and diversity. Conclusions. These results suggest a strong alteration of the mammalian community present in the Luki Biosphere Reserve, despite the presence of a small relict population of chimpanzees. Furthermore, the lack of large and medium-sized species in offtake data and their very low detection rates by camera traps indicates the urgent need to increase monitoring efforts and questions the participatory management policy of the reserve that has been in place for nearly 20 years.

AB  - Isopods, characterized by direct development, lack a planktonic stage that would allow for long-distance dispersal. For some herbivorous species, though, rafting on floating macrophytes (including seaweeds) could be a mechanism to facilitate population connectivity over wide distances. In addition, the phylogeography of these species is expected to be related to that of their dispersal vectors. In the current study, we sequenced a fragment of 636 bp of the COxI gene in 107 individuals of the kelp-dwelling isopod Amphoroidea typa from ten populations along 2500 km of the Chilean coast (27 degrees S - 43 degrees S); no isopods were found at two sites in northern Chile (21 degrees S and 23 degrees S). Our results reveal the existence of population genetic structure and isolation by distance in A. typa. We identified three geographic groups: one represented by the four northernmost populations (27 degrees 32 degrees S), a second one including two central populations (34 degrees-37 degrees S), and the last one comprising the southernmost populations (39 degrees-43 degrees S). These results are partially explained by the effect of El Nino, which enhances extinction and recolonization of kelp forests and associated grazers north of 30 degrees S. The results show that A. typa does not have any specific kelp preferences and dwells on kelp species with different dispersal capabilities, such as the non-buoyant Lessonia spp. and the floating giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Individuals of A. typa appear capable of switching between different kelp hosts during their lifetime, including vectors that permit rafting over long distances, and thereby contribute to population connectivity throughout the distribution range of this herbivorous isopod. The main outcomes of the current study support the idea that organisms dwelling on positively buoyant macrophytes can effectively disperse together with their floating hosts.

AB  - Studying the coexistence mechanisms of sympatric wildlife helps to shed light on why the earth has so many different species. When ungulates share ranges, food and habitat requirements may partially or fully overlap. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine how sympatric ungulates share limited resources. Carcasses of 27 adult blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) and three adult red deer (Cervus elaphus alxaicus) were collected in the Helan Mountains, China. Nutritive indices of plant species foraged and morphometric measurements of the digestive system of the two sympatric ungulates were determined. In addition, 120 passive, infrared motion-triggered cameras recorded spatial overlap and temporal overlap between the two species. Camera trapping revealed relatively limited spatial overlap and significantly different activity rhythms between blue sheep and red deer. Differences were also observed in stomach weight, surface enlargement factor of the rumen, and intestine length between the two species. However, the combined relative weight of the stomach and intestine was not different between species. The low spatiotemporal overlap decreased opportunities for encounters between sympatric blue sheep and red deer, and significant differences in digestive systems allowed the two species to consume different plant species or different parts of the same species. Thus, the two sympatric ungulates coexist harmoniously in the Helan Mountains because of long-term evolutionary behavioral and physiological adaptations that eliminate negative effects on the survival of the other species.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important C pool of the global ecosystem and is affected by various agricultural prac-tices including fertilization. Excessive nitrogen (N) application is an important field management measure in tea plan-tation systems. However, the mechanism underlying the impact of N fertilization on SOC, especially the microscopic mechanism remain unclear. The present study explored the effects of N fertilization on C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes and microbes expressing these enzymes by using a metagenomic approach in a tea plantation under long-term fertilization with different N rates. Results showed that N application significantly changed the abun-dance of C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes, especially those associated with labile and recalcitrant C degrada-tion. In addition, the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities showed a significant difference under different N rates. At the phylum level, microbial taxa involved in C degradation were highly similar and abun-dant, while at the genus level, only specific taxa performed labile and recalcitrant C degradation; these SOC-degrading microbes were significantly enriched under N application. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the soil and pruned litter properties greatly influenced the SOC-degrading communities; pH and DOC of the soil and biomass and total polyphenol (TP) of the pruned litter exerted significant effects. Additionally, the random forest (RF) algo-rithm revealed that soil pH and dominant taxa efficiently predicted the beta-glucosidase abundance, while soil pH and DOC, pruned litter TP, and the highly abundant microbial taxa efficiently predicted chitinase abundance. Our study indicated that long-term N fertilization exerted a significant positive effect on SOC-degrading enzymes and mi-crobes expressing these enzymes, resulting in potential impact on soil C storage in a perennial tea plantation ecosys-tem.

AB  - Pathogens introduced into wildlife populations can cause population declines and pose a threat to conservation. Understanding how pathogens spread through wildlife populations requires information about animal space use across the landscape. The abundance of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in western North America has declined in response to pathogens introduced concurrently with the expansion of domestic sheep. Wildlife and land management agencies use bighorn sheep seasonal home range models to assess and mitigate pathogen transmission risk among bighorn and domestic sheep populations. Current risk assessment tools assume that seasonal home ranges are annually consistent, but the extent to which deviations from this assumption could render erroneous predictions about pathogen introduction risk has not received extensive attention. To evaluate the influence of temporally variable environmental conditions on pathogen introduction risk, we used locations of desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni) gathered across 6 populations residing in the Mojave Desert, an environment characterized by high interannual variation in precipitation and forage production. Our objectives were to assess whether seasonal home range sizes varied consistently with temporally varying attributes of the environment and assess the influence of varying environmental attributes on pathogen introduction risk using our model results and the United States Forest Service's Risk of Contact (ROC) tool. Home range sizes varied by sex and season, with higher environmental moisture levels (Palmer drought severity index) associated with larger male home ranges in summer and fall-winter. Higher spatial variation in primary productivity was associated with smaller male home range sizes in summer but with larger male home range sizes in fall-winter. Female home ranges were also smaller when variation in primary productivity was high during spring but had no detectable relation with environmental moisture or spatial variation in productivity during the rest of the year. We combined these results with the ROC tool to simulate the influence of varying environmental attributes on pathogen introduction risk. Those simulations suggested that home range expansions associated with above-average environmental moisture only increased the contact risk between 2 adjacent populations by 0.02%. Consequently, risk forecasts in the Mojave Desert system might be relatively robust to temporally dynamic home range sizes, so long as the environmental attributes driving home range size do not deviate dramatically from historical levels. However, major departures from long-term trends in environmental variation could lead to more dramatic effects on home range size and subsequent risk and should be reassessed if environmental variation changes substantially in the future.

AB  - Forest cover loss and fragmentation have increased in recent years due to the increasing anthropogenic land use. Whereas previous studies have focused mostly on forest cover change from other disturbances (e.g., insects, diseases, and forest fires), little is known regarding how land uses are increasing at the expense of forest cover. Thus, we fill this research gap by assessing forest cover change and fragmentation with an emphasis on how competing anthropogenic land uses are increasing at the expense of the coniferous forests using empirical evidence from northeastern British Columbia (BC). We classified Landsat images from 1985, 2000, and 2015 using the Random Forests (RF) classification algorithm. The study finds an annual net loss of 2.3% (gain: 6.9%, loss: 9.2%) in the coniferous forest cover, but the timber harvest land base's (THLB) share of the coniferous forest gain and loss is higher than that of the area outside the THLB. We find that the period with a lower amount of fragmentation has a lesser amount of coniferous forest cover loss and vice versa. We show that coniferous forest cover is more likely to recover from barren land. In forest areas where anthropogenic land uses are on the rise, land managers could use knowledge from our study as ancillary information in assessing the sustainability and potential cumulative impacts of anthropogenic land uses. We conclude that the rate of forest recovery from anthropogenic-induced land categories is likely to account for the amount of forest fragmentation.

AB  - Simple Summary The wild boar is one of the most common wild animals. On the territory of Russia, there are two subspecies of the wild boar-European and Asian. At the beginning of the 20th century, the wild boar in the European part of Russia was practically exterminated. Later the population was restored by importing animals from other regions and by self-repopulation. The aim of our research was to assess the population structure of the Russian wild boar in comparison with the wild boar from other regions of the world and to determine the level of autozygosity, which allows us to determine the state of the population. We found traces of introgression of the Asian wild boar into the European one due to, migration of the wild boar in the population recovery process. Further analysis for genetic influx into Russian wild boar population identified four samples in which more than 10% of the genome belonged to domestic pigs. The Homozygous-by-Descent (HBD) Segments evaluation showed a low level of autozygosity in comparison with the aggregate sample of the European wild boar. Based on our genetic evaluation, we concluded that the population of the Russian wild boar of the European and Asian subspecies are characterized by a sufficient level of genetic diversity. The wild boar is the wild ancestor of the domestic pig and one of the most common species of ungulates. At the beginning of the 20th century, the wild boar was practically exterminated in the European part of Russia. In the period 1935-1988, 7705 boars were caught in various regions of the European part of Russia, the Far East, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Tajikistan and resettled in the territory of Russia. Asian and European wild boars dwell the territory of Russia. The aim of our research was to study the genetic diversity and structure of wild boar populations in different regions of Russia using genome-wide genotyping. We have determined the genetic distances, population structure, parameters of genetic diversity and significantly expanded our understanding of the genetic state of the Russian wild boar. For the first time, we calculated autozygosity of the wild boar of the European and Asian subspecies using Homozygous-by-Descent (HBD) Segments analysis, which is important in terms of population recovery. We also found evidence of hybridization between Russian wild boar and domestic pigs. A group of European wild boars showed introgression of the Asian boar into population. The mean level of the inbreeding coefficient in European wild boar was higher than in Asian wild boar, and combined groups of the European boar had higher inbreeding coefficient than Russian wild boars. These results obtained can be used in population management.

AB  - Here we present charcoal identifications for Rose Cottage Cave, Eastern Free State, from layers dated between about 96,000 and 35,000 years ago (-96 and-35 ka ago). We then suggest plant community types that might have been established in the area in warm Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5) versus cooler MIS4/MIS3 phases. The hypothesis is that frost-tender plants should occur in warm phases while hardy Leucosidea sericea, Protea spp. and Erica spp. should be more common during cooler phases more recent than-74 ka ago. Leucosidea sericea thrives under moist conditions and its presence in late MIS4 and in several MIS3 layers at Rose Cottage implies that the area may have been moister than many other sites in the interior of southern Africa, thereby making it attractive for occupation. The charcoal identifications at-96 ka ago included taxa like Buddleja salvifolia that need somewhat warmer conditions than taxa such as Leucosidea sericea. Taxa diversity based on the charcoal identifications is generally low at the site throughout the Middle Stone Age, but the vegetation from relatively warm MIS5 seems more diverse than that of MIS4 and MIS3. Some taxa identified, for example, Calodendrum capense, Leucosidea sericea, Erica caffra and Protea caffra no longer grow near the cave although they are commonly found in other parts of eastern South Africa.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to determine the daily activity patterns and seasonal activity variations of the Eurasian lynx in different habitats (forests and open lands) in a geographical region where there are relatively few data on its ecological characteristics. Survey effort totaled 10 102 camera trap days, with 24 camera trap stations covering an area of approximately 650 km(2). Our results showed no significant differences in the habitat preference of the lynx throughout the entire study area or between seasons. The crepuscular and nocturnal activity preferences of the lynx were similar to those of the wolf, red fox, and the European hare. The lynx's daily activity pattern peaked during 20:00-22:00 and 04:00-06:00 hours, and did not show significant variation between seasons. Kernel density estimation was used in order to reveal the temporal overlap of other carnivore and herbivore species with the lynx. The highest temporal overlap (coefficient of overlapping: 0.90) was seen with the European hare. Our findings also indicated higher temporal overlaps with the wolf, red fox, wild boar, and brown bear, and lower overlaps with the red deer, Southwest Asian badger, and Martes spp., which improved understanding of their interactions and co-existence with the lynx.

AB  - Quantifying the demography of wildlife is vital to population monitoring; however, studies using physical capture methods can prove challenging. Camera traps have gained popularity as a density estimator tool in recent decades due to noninvasive data collection, reduced labor, cost efficiency, and large-scale monitoring capabilities. Many wildlife populations are comprised of individuals with no unique natural markers for individual identification, resulting in need for unmarked abundance models. The recently developed Space-to-Event (STE) model offers a method for density estimation of unmarked populations using timelapse photography. STE relates detections of animals to camera sampling area (i.e., viewshed), resulting in density estimates that can be extrapolated to abundance over large areas. Consequently, this makes STE sensitive to estimates of viewshed area as small changes in viewshed could significantly affect density estimation. Using STE, we estimated density and recruitment of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a densely forested landscape using measurements of viewshed per camera. We compared estimates of abundance derived from uniquely measured viewshed to estimates of abundance derived from an assumed viewshed area held constant across all cameras. When using a constant viewshed across all cameras, our point estimates of abundance shifted away from uniquely measured viewshed estimates in predictable ways, depending upon how much area was sampled. Additionally, we demonstrated the need for further exploration of animal availability at fine temporal scales by comparing estimates of density derived from sampling the full diel period to estimates derived from periods of peak activity (i.e., crepuscular periods). Finally, we extended the usefulness of the STE model by using densities of fawns and adult females to derive estimates of fawn recruitment.

AB  - Simple Summary The patterns and causes of biodiversity variations along environmental gradients are hot topics for ecologists and biogeographers. Leaf miners are the specific insect guild that feed and live inside plant leaves. Although altitudinal diversity trends have been studied for many insect groups, few scientists have focused on the elevational diversity pattern of leaf-mining insects. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the elevational distribution of leaf miners in China. Moreover, all previous work on the elevational change of leaf miners only focused on their abundance or species richness, without further analyses on their diversity indices, especially on phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity. The diversity of the leaf-mining insects on one dominant oak species in Central China was thus investigated through Hill numbers. The oak species hosted rich leaf miner species, and different leaf miners showed different elevational preferences. Most diversity metrics of leaf miners generally followed hump-shaped mid-peak elevational patterns. The species composition and diversity pattern of leaf miners on dominant trees in China are poorly understood. Using Hill-based diversity metrics, the elevational patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for leaf miners on Quercus variabilis Blume at Baotianman were systematically analyzed. Leaf mine types belonged to ten genera and seven families. Different leaf miners had different elevational preferences. Most taxonomic and phylogenetic Hill diversity indices had typical hump-shaped elevational patterns, with a peak at the middle elevation of approximately 875 m. No functional Hill diversity indices presented significant linear or nonlinear trends with altitude. The driving factors behind the elevational distribution patterns of leaf miners require further work.

AB  - 1. Anthropogenic climate change is a substantial threat to global biodiversity. It may affect insect herbivores directly and indirectly. Indirect effects are, among others, mediated by climate-change induced variation in host-plant quality. Although being potentially important, little is known on the significance of such indirect effects and on interactions among environmental stressors in plant-herbivore interactions.
   2. To simulate the potential impact of climate change, we investigated effects of host-plant temperature and soil moisture on herbivore performance in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana under laboratory conditions.
   3. Maize grown at high temperatures or under wet conditions reduced herbivore performance, indicated by decreased body mass, storage reserves, phenoloxidase activity, and increased development time. Temperature and soil moisture acted largely independent of one another. Detrimental effects of the high plant temperature were restricted to males, indicating a higher vulnerability of this sex to environmental stress.
   4. In nature, B. anynana might be threatened by increasing temperatures during the wet season negatively affecting host-plant quality. Our study shows that herbivore performance can be substantially affected by indirect effects mediated through changes in host-plant quality, which deserves more attention in the current era of global climate change.

Using simulated data, we evaluated three variables reflecting the key trade-offs ecologists face when designing a trapping study: 1) the number of observations obtained per individual, 2) the trap density and 3) the proportion of the home range falling inside the trapping area. We compared the performance of five home-range estimators (MCP: Minimum Convex Polygon, LoCoH: Local Convex Hull, KDE: Kernel Density Estimation, AKDE: Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation, BicubIt: Bicubic Interpolation). We further explored the potential benefits of combining these estimators with asymptotic models, which leverage the saturating behavior of changes in the estimated home-range area as the number of observations increases to improve accuracy, as well as different data-ordering procedures. We then quantified the bias in home-range size under the different scenarios investigated. The number of observations and the proportion of the home range within the trapping grid were the most important predictors of the accuracy and the precision of home-range estimates. The use of asymptotic models helped to obtain accurate estimates at smaller sample sizes, while distance ordering improved the precision and asymptotic consistency of estimates. While AKDE was the best performing estimator under most conditions evaluated, bicubic interpolation was a viable alternative under common real-world conditions of low trap density and area covered. A case study using empirical data from white-tailed deer in Florida and another from jaguars in Belize demonstrated support for the findings of our simulation results. Although researchers with trap data often overlook home-range estimation, our results indicate that these data have the capacity to yield accurate estimates of home-range size. Trapping data can, therefore, lower the economic costs of home-range analysis, potentially enlarging the span of species, researchers and questions studied in ecology and conservation.

AB  - The southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, includes both the Pampa and Atlantic Forest biomes, and covers an area of around 284 thousand km2. Since the last checklist for the state, published in 2012, many additional sites have been sampled. Hence, we provide here a full list of earthworm species and their distribution in different municipalities and land use systems in the state. Data were obtained from the literature, museums, and other earthworm collections and recent sampling efforts. Records for 19 additional species are reported here for the first time, raising the total to 78 species/subspecies currently known from Rio Grande do Sul, from the families Acanthodrilidae (5), Benhamiidae (3), Lumbricidae (13), Megascolecidae (11), Ocnerodrilidae (22), Almidae (2), Glossoscolecidae (18) and Rhinodrilidae (5). Alexidrilus Righi, 1971 is synonymized with Urobenus Benham, 1886, as both species in the genus (A. littoralis Ljungstrom, 1972 and A. lourdesae Righi, 1971) have similar morphology to the type species Urobenus brasiliensis Benham, 1886. Most of the native species/subspecies in the state (39), including an important number of new species, were found in native vegetation with lesser disturbance, such as swamps, native forests and pastures. On the other hand, the three peregrine and 27 exotic species (especially Pontoscolex corethrurus, Eukerria spp., lumbricids, megascolecids, Dichogaster spp., and Microscolex spp.) dominated in disturbed sites, such as compost piles, urban areas, rice and other crops, and cultivated pastures. Considering the geographic extension and the many unsampled sites in the state, further collection efforts are necessary and will certainly reveal new species, as evidenced here.

AB  - Climate change is impacting species distribution at a global scale, posing a significant threat to biodiversity. Special attention needs to be given to threatened species like the Kashmir Red Deer (Cervus hanglu hanglu). Despite being a symbol of global conservation, holistic management is necessary for decision-making and species recovery. A comprehensive study mapping of the potential habitat changes for Hangul in the Dachigam landscape is crucial to enhance conservation efforts. We examined the impacts of expected global warming on the distribution of Hangul by employing a maximum entropy approach to assess species range shift. Hangul was anticipated to be sensitive to upcoming worldwide warming, and it was expected that this would increase its risk of local extinction. In the model, the severity of repercussions from climate change grew as the time horizon increased and decreased the species' suitable habitat. By 2080, predictions indicated a gradual reduction in range or, in some scenarios, the complete loss of habitat, regardless of the potential for Hangul to disperse indefinitely. We estimated that the overall very highly suitable habitat in the protected region is currently 2220 ha, while its vast distribution area in the unprotected zone is 30,445 ha, emphasizing the necessity of establishing corridor connectivity between fragmented populations and promoting conservation efforts. Among various climate conditions, the core-to-edge ratio is at its highest level in the current conditions. Our study reveals two critical findings: Firstly, endangered species unique to a particular region are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming. Secondly, when evaluating the outcomes of global warming, the highly suitable habitat is expected to shift under predicted climatic changes, with an average altitudinal migration of 700 m. Consequently, conservation strategies must consider the expected regional shifts and are designed with a clear understanding of the accuracy of projecting climate change effects.

AB  - Leishmaniasis by Leishmania infantum has a zoonotic transmission cycle involving an increasing number of mammalian hosts, forming a cooperative network. The sand fly feeding on livestock is evidenced, but clinical confirmation regarding their infection is limited. We aimed to evaluate Leishmania seroprevalence in livestock to assess its impact on leishmaniasis epidemiology in an endemic area located in the Mediterranean region. A cross-sectional serological study screened livestock exposure to L. infantum and risk factors in Southern Spain. A total of 864 serum samples of clinically healthy sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were examined by an indirect fluorescence antibody test, using a 1/80 cut-off titre to minimize cross-reactions. Global seroprevalence was 10.8%: 21.6% cattle, 15.4% sheep, 7.3% goats, and 0.6% pigs. Statistically significant differences in positive detection were observed among species (p < 0.001) and natural regions (p < 0.001). High positive reactions in cattle, goats, and sheep suggest livestock exposure to Leishmania spp. and potential asymptomatic infection. Livestock presence in biotopes could promote a dilution effect, reducing human leishmaniasis incidence. Further investigation is needed to confirm livestock roles in leishmaniasis maintenance and transmission.

AB  - The fossil record of mammals preserves evidence for dietary adaptations that allowed lineages to persist in dynamic ecosystems for tens of millions of years. We investigated ecological attributes of fossil mammals during the middle to late Miocene (17.5-8.5 Ma) in the western Mojave region of North America to evaluate the response of herbivorous ungulates to paleoenvironmental changes. Herbivores may utilize the same food resources across generations, relying on relationships with vegetation and habitats established over multiple generations. We employed stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from ancient soils and herbivore tooth enamel to evaluate changes in vegetation and herbivore diets. We compiled isotopic data from published studies of three sequences from the warm Miocene Climatic Optimum and added new data from the Dove Spring Formation, which formed during the cooler Middle Miocene Climatic Transition. Herbivorous ungulates exhibited dietary fidelity for nearly nine million years, selectively consuming C3 plants even as C4 vegetation became more prevalent on the landscape. High oxygen stable isotope ratios in comparison to equids suggest that ancestral antilocaprids and camelids were likely facultative drinkers. These findings reveal enduring dietary preferences that enabled these herbivores to persist amid the profound environmental transitions of the Miocene.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse the changes in the infection rate development inside the beech stem as a result of browsing by deer (Cervus elaphus). The research materials were collected from three research plots located in the Polanow Forest Inspectorate from March to April 2020. For the study, 80 beech trees were selected, for which the size of the fallow tree, the percentage of the section taken from its centre infected with rot, and the number of years passed since the tree was wounded were determined. The study shows that the infection affects only the rings formed before the tree was injured. The average size of stem rot was 7.75% of its area, and it spread at the rate of 2.52% of the cross-sectional area per year. The analysis of the obtained results proved that both the size of the wound (splits) and the time elapsed since the tree was damaged are significantly correlated with each other. It is also possible to build a model for estimating the size of decay in stunted beech trees based on easy-to-determine predictors, such as maximum wound width and elapsed time since tree damage.

AB  - Understanding the behavioural adjustments of wildlife in anthropized landscapes is key for promoting sustainable human-wildlife coexistence. Little is known, however, about how synanthropic species navigate spatio-temporal variation in the availability of food and cover that are shaped by human practices such as agriculture.Animal habitat use is predominantly driven by spatial and temporal variations in food and cover, as individuals respond to fluctuations in the trade-off between food acquisition and risk avoidance. In agroecosystems, the availability of high-quality forage and cover is dependent on agricultural practices (e.g., harvesting) and crop phenology, providing an ideal opportunity to evaluate how wildlife adjust their behaviour in a heterogeneous human-dominated landscape.We investigated the influence of crop phenology on the behaviour of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to infer the functional roles of crop types in the food-cover landscape. We analysed the habitat selection and activity patterns of 105 GPS-collared adult female roe deer using a unique data set combining field-specific land cover data, region-specific estimates of crop phenology and weekly harvesting data for three common crops in a French agroecosystem.We found very distinct habitat selection and activity patterns according to crop type, phenological stage and time of day. Wheat and artificial meadows were strongly selected at night-time during the early and post-harvest stages only, when roe deer were highly active, suggestive of feeding activity. On the contrary, roe deer strongly selected maize during the day when it was high enough to provide cover, when they were less active, indicating that it was primarily used for refuge. These patterns depended on the availability of more 'natural' cover, suggesting that mature maize may substitute for 'natural' cover when the latter is scarce.Synthesis and application: Our work highlights the importance of behavioural plasticity and habitat complementation in the persistence of this synanthropic species in agroecosystems. This behavioural adjustment may buffer the consequences of the reduction in natural habitats that accompanies intensification of agricultural production and has implications for understanding how agricultural practices shape the food-safety trade-off of wildlife living in these highly modified landscapes.
   Penser une coexistence durable entre humains et non-humains necessite une meilleure comprehension des ajustements comportementaux de la faune sauvage aux dynamiques des paysages anthropises. Peu d'etudes ont neanmoins considere comment la faune sauvage repond aux variations spatio-temporelles des ressources alimentaires et d'habitats refuge qui sont tributaires des pratiques humaines, comme l'agriculture.L'utilisation de l'espace par les animaux est principalement sous-tendue par les variations spatiales et temporelles en nourriture et en couvert, les individus repondant aux fluctuations du compromis entre l'acquisition des ressources et l'evitement du risque. Au sein des agroecosystemes, la disponibilite en ressources alimentaires de haute qualite et en couvert vegetal depend de la phenologie des cultures agricoles et des pratiques agricoles (ex: la recolte), ce qui en font des systemes ideaux pour evaluer les ajustements comportementaux de la faune sauvage a des paysages heterogenes, faconnes par l'activite humaine.Nous avons ainsi etudie l'influence de la phenologie des cultures agricoles sur le comportement du chevreuil d'Europe (Capreolus capreolus) afin d'inferer les roles fonctionnels, en tant que ressource et/ou couvert, pour chaque type de culture agricole. Nous avons analyse la selection d'habitat et les patrons d'activite de 105 chevreuils femelles adultes, equipes de colliers GPS, dans un agroecosysteme francais. Pour ce faire, nous avons utilise un jeu de donnees unique associant des donnees d'assolement a haute resolution, des estimations regionales de la phenologie des cultures et des releves hebdomadaires des fauches/recoltes de parcelles pour trois cultures agricoles communes.Nous avons trouve des patrons d'activite et de selection d'habitat tres differents selon le type de culture agricole, son stade phenologique et le moment de la journee (nuit/jour). Le ble et les prairies artificielles etaient selectionnees fortement de nuit, quand les chevreuils etaient actifs, et seulement pendant l'emergence des cultures et apres leur recolte, suggerant un comportement d'alimentation. Au contraire, le mais etait selectionne de jour, quand les chevreuils etaient peu actifs et quand le mais etait assez haut pour fournir du couvert vegetal; ceci suggere que les chevreuils utilisaient le mais mature principalement en tant qu'habitat refuge. Ces patrons dependaient neanmoins de la quantite de couvert vegetal plus << naturel >> (bois, haies) disponible au sein du domaine vital de l'individu, suggerant que les chevreuils utilisaient le mais mature comme habitat refuge de substitution, pour pallier le manque d'habitat refuge naturel.Synthese et applications. Notre etude souligne l'importance de la plasticite comportementale et de la complementation paysagere pour expliquer la presence et la persistance de cette espece dans les agroecosystemes. Les ajustements comportementaux des especes synanthropiques semblent pouvoir tamponner les consequences de la reduction des habitats naturels qui accompagnent l'intensification de la production agricole. Cette etude permet de mieux comprendre comment les pratiques agricoles modifient le compromis entre l'acquisition de ressources alimentaires et l'evitement du risque pour la faune sauvage vivant dans les paysages fortement modifies par l'humain.

AB  - Neonatal mortality is a primary determinant of ungulate population dynamics and occurs from multiple proximal causes, but few studies have compared relationships between risk factors and cause-specific mortality. We evaluated how landscape and physiological characteristics influenced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawn risk from predators (American black bears [Ursus americanus], bobcats [Lynx rufus], coyotes [Canis latrans], and wolves [Canis lupus]), anthropogenic causes, and non-predation natural causes (i.e., disease, injury, or starvation). We monitored 363 fawns and identified 166 mortalities in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA during 2009-2019. Human development reduced fawn predation, particularly from coyotes, but predation was compensated by vehicle collisions. Coyote predation also was reduced in more forested areas, which was offset by increased predation from black bears, bobcats, and wolves. Smaller birth mass increased risk of non-predation natural mortality but did not influence predation or anthropogenic mortality. Our results suggest that for prey living alongside human development, the survival advantage of a "human shield" from predation can be offset by anthropogenic mortality. Birth mass relationships with mortality contradicted the hypothesis that predators select weaker individuals. We conclude that landscape attributes and fawn characteristics may interact with top-down, bottom-up, and anthropogenic processes to shape neonatal white-tailed deer mortality. Because some causes of mortality have opposing relationships with risk factors, combined mortality risk assessment may mask the processes driving specific mortality causes.

AB  - Spanish National Parks (NPs) are protected areas for biodiversity conservation, including two Maritime-Terrestrian NPs: The Atlantic Islands of Galicia, PNIA (NW Spain) and Archipelago of Cabrera, PNAC (Balearic Islands). This study was aimed to conduct a 3-year genetic survey of syngnathid fish species (i.e. seahorses and pipefish) identified in both NPs and nearby unprotected areas, using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. A diversity of species was identified with differential distribution among NPs and adjacent areas studied. Pipefish (Syngnathus acus, S. abaster, S. typhle, Entelurus aequoreus, Nerophis lumbriciformis, N. maculatus, and N. ophidion) predominated, while seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus) were much less abundant. Genetic data and phylogenetic analysis clarified in situ morphological identification. Mitochondrial haplotypes for each species clustered into monophyletic groups, supporting the identification of a cryptic lineage of S. abaster in PNAC distinct from eastern Mediterranean populations of this species. Intraspecific genetic diversity was evaluated at spatial and temporal scale for population samples recorded during the survey period, providing valuable information for individual resampling traceability and delineating management units. Temporal stability in genetic diversity and gene flow with adjacent areas were observed for dominant species within each NP in the 3-year period studied. However, significant intraspecific differentiation was detected between populations identified in Atlantic and Mediterranean NPs. This study provides valuable reference genetic data for future monitoring and to identify distribution or research gaps for further studies towards the conservation of syngnathid populations in Spanish marine NPs, which serve as umbrella species for the preservation of vulnerable coastal ecosystems and habitats.

AB  - Disturbances that change population structure may evoke transient dynamics that can be assessed within a demographic resilience framework. Conservation management interventions are conceptually disturbances that can be evaluated through such a framework to inform management actions and goals. The Main Camp in Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa presents a case study. Here management reduced the size of the elephant (Loxodonta africana) population by similar to 26%. We compared population growth, modelled trends, constructed life tables and parameterized population projection matrices from data collected before, during and after the interventions. The interventions reduced population size and density, but co-occurring droughts may have reduced subsequent population growth and stage-specific survival. Transient dynamics followed the interventions and droughts and were associated with an unstable stage structure. The effect of adult survival on modelled asymptotic growth (its elasticity) was greater than a change in fertility. However, lowered juvenile survival contributed most to changes in transient growth. Management plans for elephant populations should consider the length of transients induced by interventions and environmental disturbances such as droughts. Our approach can benefit the assessment of population responses of elephants to disturbances such as poaching and persistent droughts elsewhere in Africa.

AB  - Paleoecological and ecometric studies of animal communities' functional composition require quantification of whether fossil faunas reliably record trait distributions of living communities. We analyzed whether body size and dietary biases exist within Pleistocene Eurasian sites included in the NOW database, compared with modern communities. Based on mass distributions, we discriminated small mammal sites, large mammal sites, and mixed sites in this record. Large mammals made up 50% of occurring genera and, on average, 74% of genera occurring within sites. Mixed sites with more generic occurrences (17% of sites) fell within modern communities' variation in their proportions of body size and dietary categories. Both large and small mammal sites fell outside the range of modern variation. Whereas most modern communities included 50%-60% herbivorous genera, small and large mammal fossil sites inated in this record, and herbivores were over-represented relative to non-herbivores.

AB  - Predation may indirectly influence prey's fitness and population dynamics through behavioural adjustments in response to perceived predation risk. These non-consumptive effects of predation can also arise from hunting by humans, but they remain less documented. Advances in biologging allow detailed assessments of the activity budgets of elusive wildlife, increasing the potential to uncover the non-consumptive effects of human activities on animals. We used tri-axial accelerometry to record the daily activity of 24 Scandinavian brown bears (20 females and 4 males) from a heavily hunted population in Sweden, for a total of 29 bear-years (2015-2022). We used a random forest algorithm trained with observations of captive brown bears to classify the accelerometry data into four behaviours, running, walking, feeding and resting, with an overall precision of 95%. We then used these classifications to evaluate changes in bear activity budgets before and during the hunting season. Bears exhibited a bimodal daily activity pattern, being most active at dusk and dawn and resting around midday and midnight. However, during the hunting season, males became more nocturnal compared to before the hunting season, suggesting a proactive behavioural adjustment to reduce encounters with hunters. Females showed the opposite pattern and had a higher probability of being active during the day, potentially to increase nutritional gains before denning. Additionally, daily number of running bouts did not vary between the pre-hunting and hunting seasons in both sexes, but females' proportion of running bouts occurring during legal hunting hours was higher during the hunting season than prior to it, which suggests a reactive behavioural adjustment to encounters with hunters. Detailed assessments of wild animal behaviours, allowed through recording of movement data at high frequencies, have the potential to improve our understanding of the impacts of human activity on wildlife.

AB  - Optimally foraging animals should minimise time spent foraging in order to perform other fitness-enhancing activities. The ruminants' more efficient digestive system, requiring lower volumes of forage, is predicted to provide an advantage over hindgut fermenters with respect to foraging effort, but this may be offset by their need for higher quality forage. We contrasted the activity of two similarly-sized, syntopic grazers, black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou), a ruminant, and Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra), a hindgut fermenter, using camera trap data and tested the volume-requirement and the nutrient-driven hypotheses, seasonally. Zebra and wildebeest activ-ity varied seasonally, potentially due to differences in resource availability. In winter, a greater proportion of wildebeest were recorded grazing relative to zebra, supporting the nutrient-driven hypothesis, whilst the inverse occurred (although not significantly) in summer, supporting the volume-requirement hypothesis. Seasonal variation in resources may provide temporal foraging trade-offs of benefits for ruminants and hindgut fermenters.

AB  - For most of the 20th century, the hypothesis was accepted that Madagascar's extensive grass-dominated ecosystems were of anthropogenic origin, carved out of pristine forests after a mere two millennia of human settlement. We tested an alternative hypothesis that these C-4 grassy ecosystems were part of the general Late Miocene expansion of tropical grassy biomes, using diverse data from published sources (Bond et al. 2008). Joseph and Seymour (2021) criticised this paper, which they see as seminal to subsequent studies on the grasslands. Here we respond to their critique of our study. We also briefly note diverse studies since 2008 pointing to the ancient origin of Madagascar's C-4 grasses and the ecosystems they dominate. We conclude with key research needs that will help promote open-minded research on these long neglected grassy biomes. The answers would be of considerable scientific and public interest but may also contribute to enlightened management of forest/grassland mosaics.

AB  - An inverse density-dependent relationship between abundance and adult sex ratio (ASR, males:female) occurs in some populations of polygynous mammals due to life history differences between the sexes. Male fecundity and survival is dictated by attempts to obtain as many copulations as possible, whereas female fecundity and survival is dictated by resource acquisition. Therefore, females usually acquire forage before males as a result of intetspecific scramble competition, particularly when forage becomes more limited at K carrying capacity. This leads to the passive displacement of males in a given area. The common belief is that most monogamous mammal populations exhibit balanced adult sex ratios. The coupling of sexually mature males and females in a population result in this pattern for this mating system. Present literature focuses on primary or secondary sex ratios in mammals or on ASR patterns within individual species. Our goal was to test if expected ASR patterns would be visible across numerous species in both mating systems. We hypothesized we would see an inverse relationship between abundance and ASR across polygynous populations, and no relationship between abundance and ASR across monogamous populations. We extracted time series population data from published literature for 43 populations of 15 different mammal species. Results from our analysis of a linear mixed-effects model were consistent with our hypothesis for polygynous populations, as we found a significant inverse relationship between abundance and ASR. However, our analysis also revealed a significant inverse relationship between abundance and ASR in monogamous populations that was not consistent with our hypothesis. Our findings provide quantitative support for a theoretical model explaining the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms driving a density-dependent relationship between abundance and ASR in polygynous mammals. An investigation into monogamous mammals is needed to assess why some species with this mating system display a density-dependent response in ASR as well.

AB  - As environmental conditions continue shifting under accelerating anthropogenic pressure, there is an urgent need to better understand and predict changes in the ecological function of emergent, often novel communities. This motivated the rapid development of trait-based ecological approaches that quantify functional traits of individuals to make inferences about ecological function. Long-term monitoring programs often collect community abundance data annually; yet, to our knowledge, these very different types of datasets have rarely been combined to hindcast shifts in community structure and function. Here, we merge the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research dataset on benthic communities with a contemporary tropical seaweed trait database to quantify shifts in community function over nearly 20 years and through three distinctly different environmental disturbances. This research was motivated by global shifts on reefs to seaweed domination with unknown shifts in ecosystem functions. Using ordination, we visualized dramatic shifts in community trait space occupancy over time. When comparing mean trait value over time for each trait in each reef type, we describe rapid transitions in the functional ecology of seaweed communities in response to well-documented biotic and abiotic disturbances. A biotic disturbance that killed coral created seaweed communities with traits maximized for resistance to herbivory, while a physical disturbance resulted in a replacement community maximizing resistance to physical disturbance traits. Overall, we document transient shifts in community functional traits in response to shifts in environmental drivers, but also evidence for a stable attractor characterized by tall, less herbivore-resistant communities. Uncovering these shifts in ecological strategies in response to major disturbances demonstrates that combining trait-based approaches with long-term data provides a powerful tool for furthering understanding of how functional changes in communities are driven by environmental change.

AB  - Insect larval frass has been proposed as a fertilizer and amendment, but methods for testing its effects on plants are poorly developed and need standardization. We obtained different types of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) frass via the factorial combination of (a) two insect diets, as follows: G (Gainesville = 50% wheat bran, 30% alfalfa meal, 20% maize meal) and W (43% sheep whey + 57% seeds); (b) two frass thermal treatments: NT = untreated and T = treated at 70 degrees C for 1 h. We tested the effects on the germination of cress (Lepidium sativum L.) and wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) by applying 1:2 w:w water extracts at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% concentration. Standardizing frass water content before extraction affected chemical composition. Frass extracts showed high electrical conductivity (8.88 to 13.78 mS cm(-1)). The W diet was suppressive towards Escherichia coli and showed a lower content of nitrates (e.g., WNT 40% lower than GNT) and a concentration-dependent phytotoxic effect on germinating plants. At 25% concentration, germination indices of G were 4.5 to 40-fold those at 100%. Root and shoot length and root hair area were affected by diet and concentration of frass extracts (e.g., root and shoot length in cress at 25% were, respectively, 4.53 and 2 times higher than at 100%), whereas the effects of the thermal treatment were few or inconclusive. On barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown in micropots on a silty loam soil, root mass was reduced by 37% at high extract concentration. A quick procedure for root hair surface area was developed based on the geographic information system (GIS) and may provide a fast method for incorporating root hair phenotyping in frass evaluation. The results indicate that below-ground structures need to be addressed in research on frass effects. For this, phyotoxicity tests should encompass different extract dilutions, and frass water content should be standardized before extraction in the direction of canonical procedures to allow comparisons.

AB  - Continuation of archaeobotanical and palaeoecological research on three semi-artificial lake islands, Nowy Dworek, Chycina and Lubniewice, has provided new information on the history, development and use of grasslands in Ziemia Lubuska (Lubusz land) in western Poland during the early Middle Ages. Pollen analysis reveals that the reduction in woodland and opening up of the regional landscape and the appearance of grassland communities there began around the 7th century ad, which preceded the construction of the islands in the lakes. The analysis of plant macroremains collected from the settlement layers on these islands, of pollen from cores in the lakes and studies of the phytosociological plant communities of recent vegetation have helped to describe the botanical composition of these past meadows and pastures. The results show strong similarities between the three sites, which suggests that the local populations were using the same grassland types, which were on soils ranging from damp to rather dry and sandy. The main grassland in the vicinity of the islands included the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea syntaxonomical class of communities, although Festuco-Brometea grasslands were also present. The presence of plant remains associated with various other types of meadows and pastures shows the diversity of habitats represented by the plant remains.

AB  - The common leopard (Panthera pardus) is a large carnivore species primarily ranging in the protected areas within the flat plains of Nepal. Facing competition from tigers (Panthera tigris) and decline prey population within these areas, the leopards venture into the mid-hills, leading to increased conflicts with local people. This study was designed to identify the predator and determine the spatiotemporal interactions between predators and potential prey species in the Chhatradev Rural Municipality (CRM) of Arghakhanchi, Nepal. The study utilized 18 camera traps in two phases: from March 2nd to August 3rd, 2021 and from August 5th to January 6th, 2022, with a total sampling effort of 2,402 trap night. Two common leopards and individuals of six prey species were identified. The findings indicated that common leopard activities were primarily nocturnal, with distinct crepuscular peaks at dawn and dusk, when the highest spatiotemporal overlaps were seen with wild boar and barking deer. Composite scores indicated that wild boars and barking deer had relatively higher scores, suggesting that they are the main prey species for common leopards. Our study confirmed the presence of common leopards in the mid-hill regions of Nepal, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy prey population for leopard conservation and human conflict reduction.

AB  - Native sika deer (Cervus nippon) had not been observed in and around Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. However, deer have recently been confirmed in this area, and the number of individuals and the range have been expanding, causing damage to forestry and natural vegetation. Although the origin of these deer is unknown, it may be derived from Formosan sika deer (C. n. taiouanus), which is listed as an invasive alien species in Japan. There is concern about hybridization between this subspecies and the native Japanese sika deer. In the present study, we used genetic methods to assess the current status of the deer in the Sasebo area of Nagasaki Prefecture, particularly its origin and hybridization. Our study showed that the deer did not originate from Formosan sika deer, and we found no evidence of hybridization. The deer in the Sasebo area were found to have a haplotype included in the southern Japanese sika deer lineage. The current study was unable to identify the specific origin of the deer due to limitations in PCR-RFLP and mitochondrial DNA sequencing analysis.

AB  - Simple Summary Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in young yaks. This study investigates its impact on the gut microbiota of these animals. The results show a decrease in microbial diversity and an increase in harmful bacteria like Eysipelatoclostridium, Parabacteroides, and Escherichia-Shigella during diarrhea. A metabolic pathway analysis reveals heightened activity in the associated pathways. These outcomes indicate that dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may be a key factor driving diarrhea outbreaks in yaks in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.Abstract Diarrhea-induced mortality among juvenile yaks is highly prevalent in the pastoral areas of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Although numerous diseases have been linked to the gut microbial community, little is known about how diarrhea affects the gut microbiota in yaks. In this work, we investigated and compared changes in the gut microbiota of juvenile yaks with diarrhea. The results demonstrated a considerable drop in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota in diarrheic yaks, accompanied by Eysipelatoclostridium, Parabacteroides, and Escherichia-Shigella, which significantly increased during diarrhea. Furthermore, a PICRust analysis verified the elevation of the gut-microbial metabolic pathways in diarrhea groups, including glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, oxidative phosphorylation, glutamate metabolism, antibiotic biosynthesis, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Taken together, our study showed that the harmful bacteria increased, and beneficial bacteria decreased significantly in the gut microbiota of yaks with diarrhea. Moreover, these results also indicated that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may be a significant driving factor of diarrhea in yaks.

AB  - Heavy infestations with winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus (Packard, 1869)) have been associated with mortality of moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)). Recumbency is an obligate behaviour for moose when ruminating and when conserving core body heat in cold weather. Recumbent behaviours were used to establish impacts of ticks and ambient temperatures on moose calves during the winter. Calves (n = 12) were evenly divided into no-tick, low-tick, and high-tick groups. Recumbency bout duration increased over the winter but was independent of the tick group. The probability of ruminating decreased during warm temperatures for infested moose in the early stages of infestation. Legs tucked tightly decreased with increasing ambient temperature for all groups, and all groups had a higher probability of head down when ambient conditions were colder. The greatest differences in behaviour were between moose of the high-tick group and other moose. During the most active tick phases when ambient conditions dropped below -10 degrees C, moose of the high-tick group had a higher probability of being recumbent with their head down and legs tucked tight to the body. Energy conservation, irritation from ticks, and the impact of body condition are the three primary stimuli that most likely influenced recumbent postures of moose calves in this study.

AB  - Camellia fascicularis belongs to the family Theaceae and is a plant species with extremely small populations. It is also a second-class national protected plant in China. In recent years, the anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and antitumor effects of C. fascicularis polyphenols and flavonoids have been reported. However, changes in the soil chemistry and microbes after artificial cultivation of C. fascicularis have not been well studied. Therefore, three healthy plants from each different artificial planting year's plot (Age_3, Age_5, and Age_7) were selected, and the chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil and root endophytic microbial communities for different cultivation years of C. fascicularis were studied in Hekou County, China. The accumulation of pathogenic and beneficial microbes in the rhizosphere of C. fascicularis was also discussed. The results show that (1) the alpha diversity in rhizosphere soil was significantly higher than that in roots, and roots recruited more Actinobacteria, which might produce beneficial secondary metabolites for the plant; (2) the total nitrogen in the rhizosphere soil of C. fascicularis cultivated for 7 years was significantly higher than that in the soil cultivated for 3 years; (3) there was no significant difference in the alpha and beta diversity in the rhizosphere soil and root endophytes of C. fascicularis in different cultivation years; (4) there was no difference in the abundance of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in either the rhizosphere soil or roots, but the number of PGPR in roots was higher than that in rhizosphere soil; and (5) the changes in pathogenic fungi and biocontrol fungi in rhizosphere soil were greater than those of endophytic fungi in roots. The results show that there are no significant differences in microbial communities among 3, 5, and 7 years, but the influence of the outside environment on the soil and fungi was greater than that of the roots and bacteria. These results can help us to understand the soil chemical and microbial community changes during the artificial cultivation of C. fascicularis and play an important role in its artificial conservation and breeding, as it is a plant species with extremely small populations.

AB  - The "grazing horses" (Equinae) were successful large herbivores that arrived from North America to Eurasia at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. The adaptiveness of highcrowned (hypsodont) Equus spp. allowed them to conquer environments from open to forested, resulting in different body sizes. Few large-scale studies on horse body mass in northern Eurasia exist. Despite controversial systematics of Equidae, their ecomorphological features are quantifiable. The Pleistocene habitat and Equus spp. body mass changes were studied across northern Eurasia. Mean non-equid ungulate hypsodonty demonstrated progressive opening of landscapes throughout the Pleistocene, returning towards more humid and closed environments (taiga) below 70 degrees N by the Holocene. Landscape heterogeneity across northern Eurasia indicated different zoogeographic provinces. Mean Equus spp. body mass decreased during the Middle Pleistocene to resemble the Holocene estimates. The Holocene domestication might have prevented small-sized and grazing-adapted horse lineages from extinction when taiga forests spread across northern Eurasia.

AB  - Variability in plant traits such as nutrients and defences can challenge insect herbivores searching for a host plant. Cultivar mixtures are designed to harness this variability to reduce herbivore damage in agroecosystems but have had mixed success. We examine how the spatial frequency of plant trait variability-a fundamental but rarely examined feature of variability-influences insect foraging and survival. We released a generalist herbivore into monocultures of two chemically distinct tomato varieties or dicultures of the two varieties with two spatial frequencies of chemical diversity and tracked herbivore movement and feeding damage. We found the pattern of herbivore feeding damage was more spatially concentrated in both diculture treatments than in either monoculture, indicating that the presence of chemical diversity, regardless of its spatial frequency, influences herbivore foraging. In contrast, total amount of feeding damage was reduced by 25% in dicultures where genotypes were grouped compared to monocultures or dicultures with alternating genotypes, which had similar levels of damage. Similarly, herbivore survival in the low-frequency diculture was nearly half the survival in the high-frequency diculture or monocultures. Synthesis and applications. Whereas previous work investigates how the amount of chemical diversity in a plant population influences insect ecology, our results indicate that local spatial distribution of diversity is equally important. A key implication of this work is the potential to design cultivar mixtures spatially, at the movement scale of target organisms, to create more effective pest management landscapes and promote sustainable agriculture.

AB  - This study was to determine the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities and evaluate the effect of intercropping on soil fertility in the tea-Chinese chestnut intercropping system. The Illumina platform was used to characterize the rhizosphere bacteria in the intercropping systems. The rhizospheric soil in intercropping systems in fall was enriched in soil organic matter, available phosphorus, and available potassium, and these were positively correlated with several bacterial taxa including Chloroflexi, WPS-2, Bacteroidota, Myxococcota, Bacteroidota, and Patescibacteria. These bacteria permitted the tea plants to obtain sufficient amounts of nutrients from the soil. In spring, the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium of the intercropping system of tea and Chinese chestnut planted in the 1980s (80 T) increased, and these nutrients were positively correlated with Myxococcota, Latescibacterota, Bacteroidota, Deinococcota, Bdellovibrionota, SAR324 Clade (Marine Group B), and Patescibacerlai. In addition, several bacteria (Geobacter, Halomonas, Luteolibacter, Adhaeribacter, and Paludibaculum) contained in the 80 T sample in spring and fall were determined to be beneficial for the soil based on previous studies. The effects of intercropping and monocropping on soils were more complex in spring compared to those with fall, and Chinese chestnut tree age had a strong effect on soil. Our results highlight the need to fully consider factors such as tree age and season in the design of intercropping systems as well as collect additional data for scientific applications of intercropping systems.

AB  - The Guadix-Baza Basin (GBB) in Andalucia, Spain, comprises palaeontological and archaeological sites dating from the Early Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene, including some of the earliest sites with evidence for the presence of early humans (Homo sp.) in Europe. Thus, the history of climate and environments in this basin contributes significantly to our understanding of the conditions under which early humans spread into Europe during the Early Pleistocene. Here we present estimates of precipitation and primary productivity in the GBB from the Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene based on dental ecometrics in fossil communities of large herbivorous mammals, and perform an ecometrics-based distribution modelling to analyse the environmental conditions of Early and Middle Pleistocene human sites in Europe. Our results show that Early Pleistocene humans generally occupied on average relatively diverse habitats with ecotones, such as woodlands and savannas, but avoided very open and harsh (cool or dry) environments. During the Middle Pleistocene in Europe, humans occupied a comparatively much broader range of environments than during the Early Pleistocene, but were on average more concentrated in environments where the dental ecometric of mammals indicate wooded palaeoenvironments. In the earliest human occupation sites of the GBB, Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3, the mean annual precipitation and net primary production estimates indicate climatic conditions close to modern Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland environments, but with slightly higher primary productivity, indicating some similarity with East African woodlands. On the other hand, the environments did not resemble African grassland savannas. The browse-dominated diets of ungulates from Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3 further suggest palaeoenvironments where grasses were a minor component of the vegetation. In the slightly older site of Venta Micena that has no evidence for the presence of hominins, dental ecometric estimates indicate climate and environments similar to Mediterranean "forest steppe" environments existing in the surroundings of Baza today. Grasses were prevalent in the diet of some taxa, especially equids, in Venta Micena, but most of the species show browse-dominated diets even there. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is a highly lethal viral disease affecting suids and caused by the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). ASF was described for the first time in 1921 in Kenya. The ASF genotype I virus was introduced to Europe in 1957, marking the onset of the first European wave. In 2007, ASFV genotype II was detected in Georgia, affecting domestic pigs and wild boars, and it later spread to several European and extra-European countries, including Italy. This report focuses on the strategic challenges encountered in the attempt to eradicate ASFV amongst domestic pigs in the Lombardy region. The joint efforts that were implemented facilitated the eradication of ASF in domestic pigs in just over 1.5 months, representing an example of effective and timely cooperation to mitigate both the spread of the infection and the economic repercussions for the Italian and global pig industries.Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is a severe viral disease characterized by high lethality in suids and caused by the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). The ASF genotype I virus was introduced to Europe in 1957, marking the onset of the first European epidemic wave. In 2007, ASFV genotype II was detected in Georgia, affecting domestic pigs and wild boars before spreading to various European and extra-European countries, including Italy. The first case of ASFV in Italy was documented on 7 January 2022, in a wild boar in the Piedmont region. Since then, several ASFV-positive wild boar carcasses have been identified in the Piedmont and Liguria regions. By June 2023, ASFV had spread to Lombardy, one of the major pig-producing regions in northern Italy; the virus was first detected in early summer in wild boar carcasses. Two months later, it was diagnosed in a commercial pig farm as a consequence of the disease's spread amongst wild boars and an increase in the viral environmental load. This report aims to describe the features of ASFV domestic pig outbreaks that occurred in the Zinasco municipality (Lombardy) and the joint efforts to mitigate potential direct and indirect economic impacts on the Italian and global pig industry. The epidemiological investigation and the measures implemented, which were all performed according to national and European regulations, as well as exceptional ad hoc measures aimed at protecting the pig industry, are described in order to provide a practical and effective approach to combating ASF.

AB  - Algal turfs are expected to increasingly dominate the benthos of coral reefs in the Anthropocene, becoming important sources of reef productivity. The sediments trapped within algal turfs are known to determine turf condition and influence a range of key ecological processes, particularly the feeding behavior of fishes. Yet, our understanding of the interactions between turfs, sediments and fishes is largely derived from offshore reef systems, where turfs typically contain relatively low sediment loads. Here, we expand on this knowledge by characterizing the properties of turfs and their interactions with fishes on a large, mainland fringing reef system, Ningaloo Reef. Algal turfs varied in algal biomass, height and percent of organic content in the sediment between sites, while the total inorganic and organic sediment loads were comparable. Despite being located in an arid climate with low riverine sediment inputs, turfs in Ningaloo contained an average of 3.5 kg m(-2) of inorganic sediment, one of the highest loads reported in the literature. Yet, turf feeding rates by fishes in our study were comparable to locations where inorganic sediment loads are substantially lower. Feeding was dominated by herbivorous fishes (> 80% of the bites on average), with surgeonfishes being the dominant herbivore feeders (72% of the herbivore bites). In particular, the sediment sucker Acanthurus grammoptilus and the cropper Acanthurus triostegus-which crops off algal filaments protruding above the sediment layer-were the dominant and most commonly observed feeders. Our results suggest that cropping and sediment-sucking surgeonfishes are able to feed on turfs with high sediment loads, an ability that may prove advantageous in sediment-laden turf-dominated-reefs of the future.

AB  - Plant-animal interactions and the plant chemical defence systems are a keystone of ecology and of particular interest because they fundamentally shape ecosystem functioning. Despite that, the factors and mechanisms driving the interactions between insectivorous predators and plants, via herbivore-induced plant volatiles-HIPVs remains to be fully understood. Insectivorous birds and arthropods can use chemical cues provided by herbivore-damaged plants, yet the specific chemical defensive traits that are involved in the interactions with predators remain unknown for many plant species. In our experiments, we compared plant volatiles of English oak (Quercus robur) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) saplings treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We studied how the MeJA-induced plant volatiles differ between these two closely related plant species, and how it influences higher trophic taxa (e.g., predation, associated arthropod communities). Using plasticine caterpillars, we assessed attractiveness of MeJA-treated oaks (vs. control untreated oaks) for predators. Overall, in both plant species, attack attempts were significantly higher on MeJA-treated saplings compared to control saplings. Birds were responsible for the majority of attack attempts, followed by ants and other arthropods. The mean total amount of volatiles emitted by MeJA-induced saplings differed among the experimental oak species over time and repeated applications of MeJA. MeJA application had no significant effect on the abundance of arthropods. However, the mean body size of individuals of different feeding guilds was affected by MeJA treatment both negatively and positively, depending on the specific feeding guild. Overall, our study concludes that (1) the application of MeJA led to increased attractiveness of oak saplings for insectivorous predators, including invertebrates and birds; (2) MeJA-treated oak saplings emitted eight specific compounds that were not detected in control saplings and two additional compounds that were emitted at 100-fold higher levels in MeJA-treated saplings compared to control saplings; and (3) the predation rate on artificial caterpillars did not significantly differ between oak species.

AB  - Sixteen species of parasitic mites of the family Demodecidae have been described in ungulates (Ungulatomorpha), particularly among domestic animals and livestock. Specific synhospital species have been found in seven host species. Demodex bisonianus, occurring in the Meibomian glands of the eyelids, was described in the European bison Bison bonasus. Together with Trypanosoma wrublewskii and Bisonicola sedecimdecembrii, it is one of the three known specific parasite species of European bison. The European bison is not only a rare and endangered mammal, but its biology has been shaped by its recent restitution from extinction from a small pool of individuals kept in breeding facilities. This could have been the reason for the extinction of the majority of specific parasites. The present study reports the finding of a new specific parasite species, Demodex bialoviensis sp. nov., associated with the nasal skin region, in European bison from the Bialowieza Forest (Poland). It is the second species of Demodex reported in this host species, however occurring in a different location.

AB  - Aim It is generally assumed that the degree of resource specialization in herbivorous insects increases towards lower latitudes. However, latitudinal patterns in herbivore diet breadth at large spatial scales remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the drivers of latitudinal variation in lepidopteran 'fundamental' resource specialization, which we defined as the host breadth when not limited by interspecific interactions at the same trophic level. Location The Japanese archipelago (22 degrees N-45 degrees N), including hemiboreal, temperate and subtropical zones. Taxon Herbivorous butterflies. Methods Species-specific fundamental host breadth was calculated based on pooled host-use records. We investigated the latitudinal pattern and significant drivers of the degree of specialization in regional species pools at a 10-km grid level. As potential drivers, we focused on geography, current climate and diversity and body size of butterflies. Through Bayesian structural equation modelling, we investigated the complicated relationships between these variables and community-level resource specialization represented by three different indices of host breadth. Results We found that the fundamental resource specialization of butterfly communities increases towards higher latitudes. This pattern is contrary to the presumed general trend found in studies based on realized resource specialization within local communities. We found that the observed pattern is driven mainly by factors related to climate, butterfly diversity and body size in each community. Above all, annual mean temperature most strongly drove community-level fundamental host breadth of herbivorous butterflies. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the fundamental resource specialization may show different latitudinal patterns from the conventional prediction based on knowledge of realized resource specialization. Our results emphasize the importance of the current climate as a major factor regulating butterfly morphology and fundamental host breadth, regardless of whether the impact is direct or indirect.

AB  - The extent of direct interactions between large mammalian herbivores (LMH) and plant-dwelling arthropods (PDA), i.e., the ingestion of PDA by LMH, remains largely unexplored. Grazing LMH may ingest a variety of PDA, yet, it is unknown how different foraging strategies (i.e., browsing, grazing, etc.) influence the ingestion of PDA or whether individual variation within herds affects it. Here we examine how individual variation within a herd of browsing LMH impacts PDA ingestion. This was done using a DNA metabarcoding analysis on feces collected monthly from marked individuals within a herd of free-ranging goats. We found that goats frequently ingest PDA while feeding (all samples contains PDA), including a complex food-chain of herbivores, predators and parasites, which differed over the season and among individual goats. In total, 63 families of insects and 9 families of arachnids from 15 orders were ingested by the goats. Most ingested PDA were herbivores with reduced mobility, such as immature or sessile species. Highly mobile and noxious PDA were rarely detected. We show for the first time that ingestion of PDA by LMH is influenced by seasonal and individual variation within the herd and that it is common among LMH, regardless of feeding strategy or habitat.

AB  - Understanding species coexistence requires information about how species interact and partition their ecological niche. Niches of closely related species tend to be quite similar and thereby, when syntopic, overlap can result in competition when shared resources are limiting. Brocket deer of tropical forests are ecologically similar species due to convergence or relatedness. As a group, what little is known about their ecology suggests spatial and temporal niche separation while dietary differences among species remain largely unknown. The possibility of competition has been suggested, as it is rare for more than two species to co-occur. If competition is important, then it may limit syntopy of more species and its importance should increase with relatedness between species. Based on analyses of faecal samples, camera traps, and stable isotopes and multidimensional analysis of niche space, we test spatial, temporal and dietary niche differences and compare niche breadth in two syntopic species pairs: Mazama rufa with M. nana (both of subtribe Odocoileina) and M. jucunda (Odocoileina) with Subulo gouazoubira (Blastocerina). In 2007-2008 and 2017-2019, 240 faecal samples and 375 records were collected in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Spatial partitioning among both species pairs was found, with S. gouazoubira and M. nana having greater niche breadth, which may permit or facilitate coexistence. Odocoileina tend to be nocturnal, while Blastocerina tend to be diurnal, which suggests that phylogeny may influence species coexistence. Furthermore, the species tended to overlap with respect to diet. These results suggest interference competition avoidance by niche partitioning at the level of habitat and time, allowing coexistence. Thereby, despite the morphological similarities, brocket deer species of evolutionarily convergent subtribes preserve differences in ecological niche dimensions that facilitate the coexistence of their populations.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic heterogeneity result in divergent patterns of natural selection in nature, with important consequences for fundamental evolutionary processes including local adaptation, speciation, and diversification. However, increasing amounts of the global terrestrial surface are homogenized by agriculture (which covers nearly 50% of terrestrial vegetated land surface) and other anthropogenic activities. Agricultural intensification leads to highly simplified biotic communities for many taxa, which may alter natural selection through biotic selective agents. In particular, the presence of crops may alter selection on traits of closely related wild relatives via shared mutualists and antagonists such as pollinators and herbivores. We asked how the presence of crop sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) alters natural selection on reproductive traits of wild sunflowers (Helianthus annuus texanus). Across two years and multiple sites, we planted replicated paired populations of wild H. a. texanus bordering sunflower crop fields versus approximately 2.5 km away. We measured fitness, floral traits, and interactions of the plants with insect pollinators and seed predators. We found limited evidence that proximity to crop sunflowers altered selection on individual traits, as total or direct selection differed by proximity for only three of eleven traits: ray length (a marginally significant effect), Isophrictis (Gelechiidae, moth) attack, and Neolasioptera (Cecidomyiidae, midge) attack. Direct (but not total) selection was significantly more heterogenous far from crop sunflowers relative to near crop sunflowers. Both mutualist pollinators and antagonist seed predators mediated differences in selection in some population-pairs near versus far from crop sunflowers. Here, we demonstrate that agriculture can influence the evolution of wild species via altered selection arising from shared biotic interactions, complementing previously demonstrated evolutionary effects via hybridization.

AB  - While human-wildlife conflicts are an emerging problem in urban areas, wildlife conservation is needed to sustain human life. Because the degree of conflict depends on land cover types and housing density classes, land-use policies intended to influence both resident and wildlife behavior are needed. This paper numerically simulates the optimal urban boundary regulation to reduce human-coyote conflicts and conserve the ecosystem. Given the parameters of the Denver Metropolitan Area, the optimal location of the urban boundary is estimated as 1 km farther away from the market city boundary. As a result of the optimization more coyotes emerge in urban areas, while fewer herbivores and plants emerge in natural habitats. Because of a "cascade effect", that is, secondary-and-later effects on the number of certain species through a food chain, the optimal result sees the number of plants increase with a smaller natural habitat than the market size. This indicates that because both direct and cascade effects are affected by the degree of land-use policies, it is necessary to consider the cascade effect when designing these policies.

AB  - Simple Summary Soybean plantings typically consist of a diversity of herbivores and beneficial arthropods. In many instances, soybean producers rely on insecticide sprays to suppress pestiferous insects. However, these sprays may prove more damaging than beneficial. Increased vegetation diversity aims to enhance natural enemy abundance and efficacy and subsequently reduce pest populations more sustainably. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of three post-harvest practices in corn, resulting in varying levels of plant residue remaining on the soil surface, on populations of arthropod pests and beneficials within a subsequent soybean crop. Overall, insect herbivore abundance was greater in soybean with no cover crop and/or corn plant residue. However, the abundance of predators within the soybean foliage was similar among plots with plant residue or most residue removed via plowing. Among ground predators, spider activity density was greatest in soybean where residue was plowed under. Stink bug egg mortality due to predation and parasitism were inconsistent among treatments. Findings suggest that post-harvest practices investigated during this study will have a similar influence on most ground and foliar arthropods. However, post-harvest practices that limit tillage and maintain plant residue on the surface promote long-term sustainable ecosystems that benefit society. There is increased adoption of cover cropping and conservation tillage in the USA. Many farmers view these practices as methods for improving their soils. However, different cover cropping and tillage practices conducted post-harvest can have a disparate impact on arthropods within the subsequent cash crop. Field experiments were conducted during 2017 and 2018 at two experimental sites to examine the influences of different post-harvest practices following corn (Zea mays L.) harvest on pests and beneficials in subsequent soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plantings. Experimental treatments included: (1) tillage via chisel plow (CP), (2) no-tillage in which corn residue/stubble remained on the soil surface (CS), and (3) planting a cover crop into corn residue (CC) following corn harvest. Overall, insect herbivore abundance was greater in the CP treatment. Foliar predator numbers were similar among treatments or of greater abundance in CP. The activity density of epigeal insect predators varied according to site and feeding guild. However, spider activity density was greatest in CP. Stink bug egg mortality due to predation and parasitism varied among treatments. However, the percentage of stink bug eggs that hatched was greatest in the CC during both years. Findings suggest that post-harvest practices investigated during this study will have a similar influence on most epigeal and foliar arthropods in soybean.

AB  - Widespread mortality of native North American ash caused by emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) threatens native arthropod biodiversity, but hybrid ash populations with resistance to EAB may serve a role in supporting threatened communities of arthropods in managed landscapes impacted by EAB. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that a North American x Asian hybrid ash could serve as a refuge for North American arthropods in a common garden experiment by comparing beetle communities and herbivory on North American green and black ash, the Asian Manchurian ash, and the black x Manchurian hybrid 'Northern Treasure' ash. We found that ash specialists were rare among trees in the common garden. Species richness and composition of herbivorous beetles, as well as levels of herbivory, were similar among ash taxa, and these patterns were driven by native generalists. The lack of ash specialists collected suggests that regions that have experienced late stages of EAB-induced ash mortality may have missed the opportunity to conserve populations of native specialist herbivores with EAB-resistant ash genotypes. To maximize the potential for conserving native arthropod biodiversity of ash, it may be necessary to plant resistant ash prior to widespread EAB-induced ash mortality, prioritizing efforts on the leading edge of expanding distribution of EAB.

AB  - Introduced species can have profound impacts on communities by displacing and consuming native organisms. The intertidal communities in the Gulf of Maine have been radically altered through a suite of invasions in the early 1800s, including the herbivorous snail Littorina littorea and the omnivorous European green crab Carcinus maenas leading to morphological and distributional changes in two native gastropod grazers (Littorina saxatilis and Littorina obtusata). Green crabs and native cancrid crabs occupy the mid to low intertidal zones, leaving the high intertidal zones relatively free from crab predation pressure. However, a more recent invasion in the 1980s by the intertidal omnivorous Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, has eliminated this predator-free zone in the high intertidal. This invasion is of particular concern to populations of L. saxatilis, which were relegated to the high intertidal through combined competition and predation pressure by L. littorea and C. maenas. In order to quantify the potential impact of H. sanguineus on native snails, we conducted both field and lab experiments, testing the susceptibility of different sized snails to predation by introduced crabs. Additionally, we measured the distribution, abundance, and morphology of intertidal snails and crabs. Smaller snails of all species were the most susceptible to predation, although susceptibility differed among snail species and predation capabilities differed among crab species. L. saxatilis was the most vulnerable snail species to predation, with 73 and 64% of the population susceptible to large H. sanguineus and small C. maenas, respectively, while >96% of the L. littorea population was resistant to predation. L. saxatilis has been relegated to the high intertidal where there is high abiotic stress and poor-quality food, but until the invasion of H. sanguineus, there was little predation risk. This added predation pressure may further threaten populations of L. saxatilis, especially as the upper intertidal becomes more hostile with increasing temperatures and possible species introductions.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution is a worldwide problem affecting the quality of agricultural production and human health. In this study, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and its compost (CSMS) were used to remedy black soil and red soil with simulated Pb contamination, aiming to discover their role in the improving rhizosphere environment and structuring rhizosphere bacterial community under lead stress. We designed an ultra-small-scale plot experiment to separate the rhizosphere from non-rhizosphere soil when planting water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk). The results showed that under 600 mg/kg of lead pollution, CSMS and SMS had no significant effect on the rhizosphere bacterial diversity in the black soil, but CSMS significantly increased the rhizosphere bacterial diversity in the red soil. The amendments significantly increased the percentage of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in rhizosphere soil, and the relative abundance of some beneficial genera, such as Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhizomicrobium, Lysobacter etc., which subsequently restructured the bacterial community. The compositions of bacterial community of the red soil remediated by both amendments evolved to those of the black soil.

AB  - The epidermis of wild mammals is occasionally lacerated or punctured and wound care behaviours evolved to keep animals healthy in nature. Communal wound licking may promote healing of affected sites, relieve stress after a traumatic experience, and reinforce social bonds among individuals. Yet, there are few reported cases of communal wound licking in free-ranging mammals. We report observations of communal wound licking in a social ungulate-free-ranging bison (Bison bison). Two adult female bison presented with minor open puncture wounds after we chemically immobilized each of them with a dart fired from a rifle. The day after being darted, we observed three different adult bison lick the wounds of the two wounded bison. Both bison were <3 m of each other during this time and all of the observed wound licking occurred in <10 min. Our observation provides an additional example of communal wound licking in free-ranging mammals and extends it to a social ungulate. Benefits to bison of communal wound licking are perhaps largely social. However, targeted research is needed to better understand both the frequency and cost and benefits of communal wound licking.

AB  - Mortality events of marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) have been historically described in the southern margins of its geographical range. Few documented cases show how environmental changes and pathogens interact to trigger mortality scenarios and reveal their causes. Here, using a participatory surveillance framework, we document the most extensive marsh deer mortality event observed in the last three decades occurring in Ibera ecoregion, Corrientes, Argentina. Local stakeholders monitored marsh deer disease cases or mortality, and upon detection, emergency response teams conducted extensive field studies, documenting 409 dead marsh deer between May and August 2017. Complete postmortem examinations were performed on 16 deer, revealing hepatic fibrosis associates with Fasciola hepatica and multiple parasite infestations in different tissues. Molecular analysis performed on samples from 82 deer identified parasitic and vector-borne microorganisms, including Anaplasma marginale, Theileria cervi, and Trypanosoma spp. High-tick burden and Trypanosoma spp. were significantly associated with deficient body condition. Concurrently, increased precipitation and watershed height significantly expanded flooded areas, with reduced herbaceous cover indicated by land cover analysis. Our findings suggest that prolonged flooding in Ibera played a critical role in the interactions between habitat availability, marsh deer, and parasites. Environmental stressors likely exacerbated the effects of parasitic infections, highlighting the importance of integrating environmental monitoring with wildlife health assessments. Our results contribute to scientific knowledge that provides tools to enhance management efforts focused on protecting the marsh deer population and its critical habitats.

AB  - Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica) is native to Greater Caucasus Mountain Chain from Azerbaijan and Georgia in the East to Krasnodar region of Russia in the West. This species is divided into two subspecies (by some authors into species)-East-Caucasian tur and West-Caucasian tur and a subpopulation referred to as Mid-Caucasian tur. Up to date most of the genetic studies of Caucasian tur are based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and comprehensive investigation based on nuclear DNA is required for clarification of its genetic diversity and population structure. In our work, we assessed the applicability of Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip for genetic studies of Caucasian tur. Total of 15 specimens of Capra caucasica including East-Caucasian tur from Dagestan (E_TUR, n = 5), West-Caucasian tur from Karachay-Cherkessia (W_TUR, n = 5), and Mid-Caucasian tur from Kabardino-Balkaria (M_TUR, n = 5) were genotyped. After quality control, 5544 polymorphic loci, which were distributed all over 29 autosomes, were detected. The lowest number of SNPs was found on the 25th chromosome-68, and the highest on the 1st chromosome-348. It was shown that all the three groups of Caucasian tur clustered separately. A total of 2061 SNPs were common for all the populations, 594 were found only in W_TUR, 689 in E_TUR, and 530 in M_TUR. Individual heterozygosity ranged from 0.273 to 0.282 in W_TUR, from 0.217 to 0.253 in E_TUR, and from 0.255 to 0.283 in M_TUR. A clinal pattern of genetic variation was revealed. It was suggested to consider Caucasian tur a single species with several ecotypes. Thus, in our study we demonstrated that the Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip developed for domestic goats can be used as a useful tool for genetic studies of Caucasian tur.

AB  - Sea pens are considered to be of conservation relevance according to multiple international legislations and agreements. Consequently, any information about their ecology and distribution should be of use to management decision makers. This study aims to provide such information about six taxa of sea pen in Norwegian waters [Funiculina quadrangularis (Pallas, 1766), Halipteris spp., Kophobelemnon stelliferum (Muller, 1776), Pennatulidae spp., Umbellula spp., and Virgulariidae spp.]. Data exploration techniques and ensembled species distribution modelling (SDM) are applied to video observations obtained by the MAREANO project between 2006 and 2020. Norway-based ecological profiles and predicted distributions are provided and discussed. External validations and uncertainty metrics highlight model weaknesses (overfitting, limited training/external observations) and consistencies relevant to marine management. Comparison to international literature further identifies globally relevant findings: (a) disparities in the environmental profile of F. quadrangularis suggest differing "realised niches" in different locations, potentially highlighting this taxon as particularly vulnerable to impact, (b) none of the six sea pen taxa were found to consistently co-occur, instead partially overlapping environmental profiles suggests that grouping taxa as "sea pens and burrowing megafauna" should be done with caution post-analyses only, (c) higher taxonomic level groupings, while sometimes necessary due to identification issues, result in poorer quality predictive models and may mask the occurrence of rarer species. Community-based groupings are therefore preferable due to confirmed shared ecological niches while greater value should be placed on accurate species ID to support management efforts.

AB  - Identifying food web linkages between biocontrol agents of invasive plants and native species is crucial for predicting indirect non-target effects. Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density-mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait-mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non-target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented.
   The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non-target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles.
   Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy-free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend.
   Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non-target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait-mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density-mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non-target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non-target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non-target effect.

AB  - BackgroundPredation pressure and herbivory exert cascading effects on coral reef health and stability. However, the extent of these cascading effects can vary considerably across space and time. This variability is likely a result of the complex interactions between coral reefs' biotic and abiotic dimensions. A major biological component that has been poorly integrated into the reefs' trophic studies is the microbial community, despite its role in coral death and bleaching susceptibility. Viruses that infect bacteria can control microbial densities and may positively affect coral health by controlling microbialization. We hypothesize that viral predation of bacteria has analogous effects to the top-down pressure of macroorganisms on the trophic structure and reef health.ResultsHere, we investigated the relationships between live coral cover and viruses, bacteria, benthic algae, fish biomass, and water chemistry in 110 reefs spanning inhabited and uninhabited islands and atolls across the Pacific Ocean. Statistical learning showed that the abundance of turf algae, viruses, and bacteria, in that order, were the variables best predicting the variance in coral cover. While fish biomass was not a strong predictor of coral cover, the relationship between fish and corals became apparent when analyzed in the context of viral predation: high coral cover (> 50%) occurred on reefs with a combination of high predator fish biomass (sum of sharks and piscivores > 200 g m(-2)) and high virus-to-bacteria ratios (> 10), an indicator of viral predation pressure. However, these relationships were non-linear, with reefs at the higher and lower ends of the coral cover continuum displaying a narrow combination of abiotic and biotic variables, while reefs at intermediate coral cover showed a wider range of parameter combinations.ConclusionsThe results presented here support the hypothesis that viral predation of bacteria is associated with high coral cover and, thus, coral health and stability. We propose that combined predation pressures from fishes and viruses control energy fluxes, inhibiting the detrimental accumulation of ecosystem energy in the microbial food web.

AB  - The searching efficiency of predators depends on the balance between the adaptations of the predator and the counter-adaptations of the prey. In this evolutionary race, the prey should normally have the upper hand, as it can perform tradeoffs between efficiency in resource use and ability to avoid predators. In terrestrial predator-herbivore systems, however, the huge difference in food quality between prey and predators seems to give predators an advantage. In productive terrestrial ecosystems, predators thus chronically overexploit herbivores, i.e. regulate them at densities far below the point of maximum sustainable yield. Assuming type II functional response, this should result in violent limit cycle dynamics. In reality, however, such cycles are only common at high latitudes, whereas the herbivory-based food webs of species-rich ecosystems at middle and low latitudes are characterized by asymptotic dynamics, where numerical changes only occur in response to external forcing. One way or another, diversity thus seems to beget stability in terrestrial grazing webs. We propose that strong, donor-controlled energy flows from the detritus web and directly from plants to predators are the key for the prevalence of asymptotic dynamics at middle and low latitudes. These flows support generalists with type III functional response and, therefore, a capacity to curb budding outbreaks at an early stage. The ongoing extinction wave could critically weaken these stabilizing interactions, which could destabilize currently stable food webs. and result in violent limit cycle dynamics in ecosystems, where the dominating species have evolved under asymptotic dynamics. This could cause secondary extinctions and inflict large economic losses.Keywords: extinction, food webs, limit cycles, overexploitation, searching efficiency, stability

AB  - West Gulf Coastal Plain provenance loblolly (Pinus taeda L.), longleaf (Pinus palustris Mill.), shortleaf (Pinus echinata Mill.), and slash pines (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) were planted in December 2015 on three east Texas sites to compare initial growth and survival. Three years after planting, survival ranged from 26.4% to 76.4%. Damage by Texas leafcutter ants (Atte texana) caused significant mortality on one site, and feral hog (Sus scrofa) herbivory and uprooting greatly affected survival at two other sites. Tree heights were greater in loblolly and slash pine than in shortleaf and longleaf pine, whereas diameters were greater in loblolly than in slash, shortleaf, and longleaf. Height and survival rates were greater in Shelby County and were lowest in Cherokee County. Midday leaf-level water potentials were most negative for shortleaf and loblolly pines and varied across the three sites.Tree heights were significantly but weakly (R = -0.23) correlated to leaf-level water potentials.
   Study Implications: Based on these results, loblolly pine is recommended for planting on sites where soil moisture is adequate, if early growth and survival are a concern. Slash pine can outcompete other pines on sites where soils are poorly drained. On soils that are excessively drained with low moisture, shortleaf may be considered. Given longleaf pine's ability to retain needle moisture and surface area during periods of low soil moisture, longleaf pine is suggested for planting on the same sites. Longleaf pine will require more active management on any soil type in order to decrease herbaceous plant competition. Continued measurements are required to determine whether these growth and survival trends will continue over a full rotation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAgro-landscape structure affects the population dynamics of crop pests and natural enemies alike. In southern China, rice is typically cultivated under either double cropping rice (DCR) or single cropping rice (SCR) systems. Although each system is preferred to variable extent by pestiferous herbivores or natural enemies, this phenomenon has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we investigated the dynamics of pests and natural enemies across 19 individual SCR fields embedded within landscape mosaics of varying DCR and semi-natural habitat coverage in Jiangxi, China. Within each field, we established plots with and without insecticide applications.RESULTSOverall, DCR coverage negatively affects in-field abundance of planthopper (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) pests and natural enemies, and predator richness during early season, particularly in insecticide-unsprayed plots. During late season, DCR coverage positively affects abundance of other rice pests in insecticide-unsprayed plots. Compared to DCR, semi-natural habitat coverage has stronger effect on natural enemy populations. Hence, although DCR and semi-natural habitat influence a preventative management of rice pests in SCR systems, their effects are temporally variable and context-dependent.CONCLUSIONOur study underscores a need for more nuanced area-wide management strategies that holistically consider rice growth stages, landscape-level organismal flows, and insecticide-induced disturbances at the field level.

AB  - Southeast Asia is a conservation priority region due to its high biodiversity-including megafauna-and high rates of defaunation, which has negative impacts on key ecological processes such as seed dispersal. Yet, seed dispersal interactions at the community level have rarely been described in this region. This is a major knowledge gap because medium-size and large animals are disproportionately affected by defaunation and they also have critical roles as seed dispersers. Hence, community-wide studies that encompass a full range of animal body sizes across diverse regions are required, to enable an improved understanding of defaunation impacts. Here, we (a) describe a highly diverse Southeast Asian seed dispersal network (Khao Yai National Park, Thailand), (b) assess the role of body size in identifying important animals and (c) determine if threatened species are disproportionately important in the network. The network is highly nested and modular, with species phylogeny, body size and seed size having a major influence on modularity; mammals and birds occupied different modules. Generalist species playing important roles in the network were mainly medium or large-sized. However, the largest disperser (elephants) played a relatively minor role in seed dispersal in this community, and bulbuls were important despite their small size. Many threatened animal species were important within the network as connector species and through their interactions with a larger number of plant species. Consequently, the resilience of this biodiversity hotspot is at threat by the potential nonrandom loss of the most important seed dispersers.

AB  - Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) face many anthropogenic risks including illegal shooting, electrocution, collision with wind turbines and vehicles, and lead poisoning. Minimizing or offsetting eagle deaths resulting from human-caused sources is often viewed as an important management objective. Despite understanding the leading anthropogenic sources of eagle fatalities, existing scientific research supports few practical solutions to mitigate these causes of death. We implemented a non-lead ammunition distribution program in southeast Wyoming, USA, and evaluated its effectiveness as a compensatory mitigation action to offset incidental take (i.e., fatalities) of golden eagles at wind energy facilities. In 2020 and 2022, we distributed non-lead ammunition to 699 hunters with big-game tags specific to our >400,000-ha study area. These hunters harvested 296 pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), 14 deer (Odocoileus spp.), and 33 elk (Cervus canadensis) in the study area, which accounted for 6.9% and 6.5% of the harvest in these hunt units in 2020 and 2022, respectively. We used road surveys in 2020 to estimate a density of 0.036 (95% CI = 0.018-0.058) golden eagles/km(2) during the big game hunting season in our study area. Model output suggests that our non-lead ammunition distribution program offset the fatality of 3.84 (95% CI = 1.06-23.72) eagles over the course of these 2 hunting seasons. Our work illustrates the potential usefulness of non-lead ammunition distribution programs as an action to mitigate eagle fatalities caused by wind facilities or other anthropogenic causes of death.

AB  - A balanced combination of protein sources to partially replace fishmeal in the diets of cultured carnivorous fish can promote optimal fish health and production performance. In the present study, the growth, body condition and gut microbiota of juvenile dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus fed fishmeal-substituted diets comprising different blends of animal and plant protein sources, with crystalline amino acid supplementation, were compared. The fish (15.7 [SE 0.12] g fish(-1)) were fed one of three isonitrogenous (41% protein) and isoenergetic (13 kJ g(-1)) diets for 60 days. Fish fed a diet with no fishmeal (D0; blood meal and soybean protein sources only) displayed the lowest specific growth rate (p < 0.001). Longer body lengths were achieved in fish fed a 50% fishmeal diet (D50; supplemented with poultry meal, bloodmeal, canola meal and soybean) (13.2 [SE 0.4] cm) compared with those fed either a 100% fishmeal diet (D100) (12.8 [SE 0.4] cm) or a diet with no fishmeal (D0) (12.1 [SE 0.08] cm) (p < 0.001). There were no differences in condition factor, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between fish fed diets D50 and D100; whereas fish fed diet D0 had a lower HSI and a higher FCR when compared with the other treatments (p < 0.01). The dietary protein source did not alter the gut microbiota of these fish. In conclusion, 50% replacement of dietary fishmeal with a favourable balance of meals processed from poultry, blood, canola and soybean improved length gain in juvenile dusky kob compared with those fed a diet with no fishmeal replacement.

AB  - A challenge for management of wildlife species is the assessment of the effect of roads on migration. We developed models to estimate the spatial (zone of influence (ZOI)) and temporal (delays in migration) effects of roads, and test whether road closures reduced delays in migration. We analyzed collar (2011-2019) and road survey data from two barren -ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (Borowski, 1780)) herds to assess the impact of a 171 km mine road that bisects their migration corridor. We estimated ZOIs of 16-17 km prior to crossing the road during 2018 and 2019, and 3.0 km after crossing. Estimates of mean delay were 4.3 and 2.5 days for 2018 and 2019, which were reduced by 28%-68% (1.2-1.7 days) if roads were closed when caribou were within the ZOI. In 2017-2018, when the road was extended 64 km north, caribou were 12% less likely to deflect north around the road, therefore increasing delays. Road surveys indicated aggregation of caribou prior to crossing the road, with few caribou observed after crossing, a finding supported by collar data. Our methods can estimate the spatial and temporal effects of roads for any wildlife species and assess mitigation strategies in reducing delays in migration.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AR) represents a global threat in human and veterinary medicine. In that regard, AR proliferation and dissemination in agricultural soils after manure application raises concerns on the enrichment of endogenous soil bacterial population with allochthonous antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Natural resilience of agricultural soils and background concentrations of ARGs play key roles in the mitigation of AR propagation in natural environments. In the present study, we carried out a longitudinal sampling campaign for two crop vegetation periods to monitor spatial and temporal changes in the abundance of seven clinically relevant ARGs (sul1, ermB, vanA, aph(3')-IIa, aph(3')-IIIa, bla(TEM-1) and tet(W)) and ribosomal 16S RNA. The absolute and relative abundances of the selected ARGs were quantified in total community DNA extracted from agricultural (manured and non-manured) and forest soils, fresh pig faeces and manure slurry. We observed that ARG concentrations return to background levels after manure-induced exposure within a crop growing season, highlighting the resilience capacity of soil. Naturally occurring high background concentrations of ARGs can be found in forest soil in due distance under low anthropogenic influences. It was observed that pesticide application increases the concentrations of three out of seven ARGs tested (ermB, aph(39-IIIa and tet(W)). Moreover, we noticed that the absolute abundances of sul1, vartA, ermB and blu(TEM-1) resistance genes show an increase by 100- to 10,000- fold, from maturation of fresh pig faeces to manure. Outcomes of our study suggest that agricultural soil environments show a strong capacity to alleviate externally induced disturbances in endogenous ARG concentrations. Naturally occurring high concentrations of ARGs are present also in low human impacted environments represented by the indigenous resistorne. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last decades, humanity has considerably altered the functioning of Earth, resulting in global and interrelated social, economic, and environmental crises. To address these crises, the concepts of ES and resilience look promising to understand the complexity of the social-ecological system (SES) and its dynamics. However, operational frameworks that bring together these two concepts are still lacking. We therefore propose the Navigate framework to guide the researchers and the managers in finding sustainable solutions, in other words safe and just strategies.This framework was built from a literature review, interviews with leading experts, and feedback from its implementation in a case study.The conceptual part of the Navigate framework illustrates the multiple interactions between nature and society, depicted by the ES, occurring at various scales. Following disturbances, the SES responds by either persisting, adapting or even transforming (i.e. three forms of resilience). The operational part of Navigate suggests six steps to follow in an iterative process: (1) define the system, (2) define the problem, the stakes and goals, (3) define the pathways, (4) assess the ES, (5) assess the resilience, and (6) design the action plan. The implementation of this framework to a case study demonstrated that together ES and resilience with a participatory process gave a comprehensive picture of the SES, essential to making sound sustainable decisions. Indeed, the integrated assessment of ES combining various complementary methods highlights the stakeholders' needs and perspectives, the various forms of knowledge, the scales, and the interactions. Resilience broadened the analysis by understanding how the important drivers impacted the SES and its ES.In conclusion, the Navigate framework shows the way (i.e. which ES the stakeholders have requested) while considering the dynamic properties of the SES, amidst increasing social and ecological uncertainties, to navigate together toward sustainability.

AB  - Management of glyphosate resistant volunteer soybean can be challenging and costly in other glyphosate resistant crops. This study examined the effect of elk (Cervus elaphus) grazing on volunteer soybean (Glycine max) management. Volunteer soybean density was assessed in four fields grazed by elk and three without elk in western Manitoba, Canada. This study determined that elk grazing of soybean stubble significantly reduced soybean volunteer density in the following crop. These results demonstrate that winter elk grazing can be an effective management technique for volunteer soybeans.

AB  - Conservation breeding programs are increasingly used as recovery actions for wild animals; bringing founders into captivity to rear captive populations for future reintroduction into the wild. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature recommends that founders should come from genetically close populations and should have sufficient genetic diversity to avoid mating among relatives. Genomic data are highly informative for evaluating founders due to their high resolution and ability to capture adaptive divergence, yet, their application in that context remains limited. Woodland caribou are federally listed as a Species at Risk in Canada, with several populations facing extirpation, such as those in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia (BC). To prevent local extirpation, Jasper National Park (JNP) is proposing a conservation breeding program. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms for 144 caribou from 11 populations encompassing a 200,000(2) km area surrounding JNP to provide information useful for identifying appropriate founders for this program. We found that this area likely hosts a caribou metapopulation historically characterized by high levels of gene flow, which indicates that multiple sources of founders would be appropriate for initiating a breeding program. However, population structure and adaptive divergence analyses indicate that JNP caribou are closest to populations in the BC Columbia range, which also have suitable genetic diversity for conservation breeding. We suggest that collaboration among jurisdictions would be beneficial to implement the program to promote recovery of JNP caribou and possibly other caribou populations in the surrounding area, which is strategically at the periphery of the distribution of this endangered species.

AB  - Morphometric variation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) is caused by multiple environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, soil quality, and forage availability. The effects of temperature and precipitation on plant growth are well documented, but it is unclear how soil mineral concentration affects deer morphometrics. Although it is recognized that deer have larger morphology and greater productivity in areas of the United States with mineral-rich soils, the question remains as to whether this trend is driven by increased food availability in areas with mineral-rich soils because of land use (i.e., agriculture) or if nutrient concentration of plants is greater in soils with greater mineral concentration. We collected plant tissue from 40 species commonly selected as forage by deer at 36 sites in 16 states across the eastern United States, representing a wide range of soil quality conditions over a broad geographical area. We categorized plant sampling locations into 5 soil quality classes based on a soil productivity index and analyzed plant nutrients to assess if soil productivity index classifications could be used to predict deer forage quality. We then made direct soil-plant comparisons by pairing each plant sample with a soil sample collected around the base of the plant to determine if soil nutrient concentration explained variation in plant nutrient concentration. We tested soil samples for phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. We analyzed plant samples for crude protein, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium for the soil productivity classification comparisons, and we analyzed phosphorus, potassium, and calcium for the direct site-specific analyses, as these macronutrients are critical to deer body mass, productivity, and antler growth. We analyzed forages by plant type (i.e., forb, semi-woody, shrub, or tree) and plant tissue age (i.e., young or older tissue). Nutrient concentration varied by plant type and tissue age. Plant type explained the majority of variation in plant nutrients, with forbs containing greater concentrations of all nutrients than the other plant types. Young plant material contained more crude protein and phosphorus, whereas older plant material contained more calcium. The soil productivity index was a poor predictor of deer forage quality. Calcium was the only mineral that differed by soil productivity class, but calcium was not limiting for deer at any site, as plant calcium levels exceeded maximum requirements for deer across all soil productivity classes. Site-specific soil phosphorus, potassium, and calcium explained little variation in plant mineral concentration (partial R2 = 0.00). Our results provide evidence that naturally occurring plants, especially forbs, can provide nutrition sufficient for maximum deer body weight, reproduction, and antler size, within a given area, across the eastern United States regardless of the dominant soil type. As such, the availability of naturally occurring native forbs may be a primary limiting factor regulating age-specific deer body mass and antler size, not limitations in plant nutrients resulting from soil mineral concentration. Land managers should be encouraged to influence plant composition toward greater forb coverage where increased forage quality for deer is desired, even in areas with soils low in mineral concentration.

AB  - China is rich in goat breeding resources. Officially recognized local goat breeds are mainly distributed in agro-ecological regions. The population structure and matrilineal origin of native Chinese goats can be used to formulate protection and utilization strategies for these genetic resources. In this study, the genetic structure and maternal origin of native Chinese goats were investigated using mtDNA D-loop sequences. A total of 329 goat samples from 25 Chinese indigenous goat populations and five introduced goat breeds from abroad were collected; these populations were distributed in four ecogroups designated as Southwest, South-central, the North China Plain, and Foreign-ecogroup. A larger average number of nucleotide differences and richer nucleotide diversity were observed in South-central and Foreign-ecogroup, whereas these were lower in Southwest. The 216 haplotypes divided into several haplogroups, of which HapA contained 99 haplotypes distributed in Southwest, the North China Plain, and Foreign-ecogroup with high frequency (0.53-0.77), whereas the frequency of HapA in South-central was <0.09. HapB was mostly found in South-central (0.5538) and was distributed to the North China Plain (0.2667), while it was rare in Southwest (<0.08) and Foreign-ecogroup (<0.07). According to the estimation of kinship and ancestry, HapA had five ancestors (A2, A3, A5, A10, and A12), HapB had a single maternal ancestor (A8), and HapC had two maternal ancestors (A1 and A4). This study showed that native Chinese goat breeds were mainly divided into three haplogroups (HapA, HapB, and HapC) and goat populations have expanded in the ecological regions.

AB  - Population abundance estimation is a critical yet challenging task for wildlife management decision-making. For aerial surveys of terrestrial mammals in highly heterogenous landscapes, estimation models that address multiple sources of detection bias are needed. A typical hybrid mark-resight model includes an additive parameter that accounts for detection probabilities derived from marked animals. While this additive hybrid method improves abundance estimates, there remains a need to account for heterogeneity due to the conditional dependence in detection probability inherent in aerial surveys with multiple observers.We propose a modified approach, referred to as a conditional hybrid model, to address this heterogeneity directly. The conditional hybrid model applies a mark-resight approach typically used to account for tag loss in mark-recapture studies to aerial surveys with a subset of the population marked with GPS collars. We conduct a structured comparison between the additive and conditional hybrid estimation models and fit these two hybrid models to data from a 2020 aerial survey of mule deer in southern California.Both the additive and conditional hybrid models had general agreement in overall model structure and variable importance, however, the conditional model outperformed the additive model in capturing sources of detection heterogeneity and overall abundance estimates differed by 9%. Our top-ranked models suggest that deer movement, larger group sizes, and rougher topography increased detection probability, whereas high cloud cover, obscuring vegetation and high observer fatigue and helicopter height decreased detection probability.Our findings illustrate the need to assess multiple correction methods when estimating abundance from aerial survey data to ensure accurate abundance estimates are being used to inform wildlife management strategies, with the caveat that specific survey conditions may dictate which method is the most appropriate for achieving robust estimates.These approaches represent the cutting-edge science on wildlife abundance estimation from aerial survey data, a critical ingredient for effective wildlife management. By testing innovative hybrid methods, we present the first formal comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each method within a highly heterogeneous landscape, providing practitioners with necessary information for future application.
   Population estimates for aerial detection surveys need to account for multiple sources of bias. We compared additive and conditional models to address heterogeneity using aerial survey data for deer in southern California and found that conditional models performed better, with estimates differing by up to 9%. In highly heterogeneous landscapes, the conditional models can produce more robust population estimates.image

AB  - The first multidisciplinary characterisation of Bowditch Seamount in the Sargasso Sea was conducted to provide new baseline knowledge of the biodiversity, geomorphology, oceanography and glacial history of this seamount. A dropframe camera transect 1483-1562 m deep on the seamount documented 77 megafaunal taxa including Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem indicator taxa such as sponges, cold-water corals, and stalked crinoids. Seabed terrain analysis of multibeam echosounder data showed species varied significantly along this transect in response to local geomorphological variability (R-adj(2) = 31%, p < 0.0001), with changes in seafloor relief and substrata driving species composition over the seamount. C-14-calibrated and Th-230-ages of fossil corals (Desmophyllum dianthus) collected by Van Veen grabs 1517 m deep showed corals thrived on the seamount similar to 24 ka BP and similar to 17 ka BP. Abrupt excursions between higher and lower radiogenic epsilon(Nd)-composition values of the skeletons suggested that D. dianthus persisted on the seamount over times of southern source water input and detrital sediments from the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet, respectively. In agreement with other studies from the western North Atlantic, living D. dianthus were absent in the contemporary setting at these depths, and suggest a significant re-organisation of the seamount community since the deglacial when ice-rafted debris of carbonates likely resulted in a lower aragonite compensation depth allowing D. dianthus to proliferate at deeper depths. New conductivity-depth-temperature profiling revealed the seamount at these depths is now bathed by highly oxygenated Labrador Sea Water (LSW) formed at high latitudes. Co-analysis of a newly constructed 70-year long time series of temperature and salinity for the Labrador Sea and Bermuda regions revealed a 10-year transit time from high latitudes to Bowditch Seamount. This multidisciplinary approach shows how geomorphology drives local biodiversity patterns, but also how upstream climatic forcing in subpolar regions may influence Bermuda's subtropical seamount ecosystem.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) have an important role in biodiversity conservation, protecting wildlife habitats and mitigating wildlife population decline. Over the past decade, Myanmar, which is part of the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot, has expanded its number of PAs, preserving substantial portions of the remaining natural habitat. Unfortunately, comprehensive data on the biodiversity status of most newly established PAs is lacking. In this study, we estimated the occurrence of predators and photographic capture rates of prey in North Zarmari Wildlife Sanctuary, a recently established PA situated in the Bago Yoma Range of central Myanmar, to provide data for its management plan development. A camera trap survey conducted between March and June 2020 at 63 grid cells (4 x 4 km2) recorded 25 mammal species, including Critically Endangered and Endangered prey and predators, and illegal activities such as illicit hunting and logging. Leopard (Panthera pardus) occurrence was positively influenced (AUC of 0.92) by the presence of primates and wild pigs. Bears showed a preference for areas surrounding human settlements, perhaps due to the availability of food related to human activities. Small carnivores were also affected by human disturbances. Despite evidence of low protection and high human disturbance, our results suggest a notably rich diversity of both prey and predator species within the area. The occurrence of species was impacted by a combination of factors, including habitat type and the level of human disturbance. Additionally, many species appeared to be affected by their proximity to the forest edge and human settlements. Therefore, the success of future conservation efforts hinges on the implementation of well-informed management action, underscored by a thorough understanding of the distribution and interplay among key wildlife species. This entails addressing relevant threats, as well as understanding the species' interactions with environmental factors at play within their habitats.

AB  - The Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHTs) in Bangladesh have a rich biodiversity, hosting a wide range of wild mammal species, underscoring the importance of systematic monitoring focused on conservation efforts. This study aims to assess the diversity and abundance of small- and medium-sized wild mammal species in Pittachhara Forest in the CHTs. A comprehensive wildlife monitoring survey was conducted in this forest using strategically placed camera traps to identify the wild species diversity, and we evaluated the activity patterns and seasonal variations for the period of February 2023 to August 2024. The camera trap identified eight species of small- and medium-sized wild mammals: the Bengal slow loris, northern pig-tailed macaque, leopard cat, large Indian civet, common palm civet, crab-eating mongoose, northern tree shrew, and black rat. The activity patterns showed distinct temporal behaviors among these wild mammals, with nocturnal activity dominating for the Bengal slow loris and leopard cat, while the northern pig-tailed macaque exhibited diurnal activity. Seasonal variations demonstrated a significant difference in increased activity among most wild mammal species throughout the summer, particularly the large Indian civet and crab-eating mongoose, likely due to favorable environmental conditions, and decreased activity in the winter (p < 0.05). The findings suggest an intricate connection between species-specific behaviors and environmental factors that influence activity patterns, with increased activity in summer and a decrease in winter, indicating that summer conditions may enhance the movement and foraging behaviors of mammals. This study underscores the necessity for continuous biodiversity monitoring followed by conservation efforts in Pittachhara Forest to reduce the threats of habitat fragmentation, human disturbances, and inadequate protection, thus protecting the survival of endangered wild mammal species and maintaining the environmental harmony of this small, protected area.

AB  - Eld's deer Rucervus eldii (McClelland, 1842) is an ungulate that lives in tropical lowland forests in several countries of Indochina and Hainan Island of China. Its remaining population is small and scattered, and the species is listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The debate over the taxonomic status of the Hainan population has persisted for over a century-as an island-endemic subspecies R. e. hainanus, or an insular population of the subspecies R. e. siamensis, would have significant conservation implications. And, given the Hainan population had experienced both population bottleneck and multiple translocations in the past, conservation genomics would be a powerful tool to evaluate the genetic impacts of these events. In this study, we used conservation genomics assessment to study population differentiation and genetic diversity of R. e. siamensis in Cambodia and three Eld's deer subpopulations on Hainan Island. Based on the unique genetic profile and demographic analysis, this study corroborated previous studies using genetic markers that the Hainan Eld's deer warrants the taxonomic status of a distinct subspecies. The Hainan population exhibits a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in the level of inbreeding when compared to the population of Cambodia. The signs of purifying selection were found against homozygous loss-of-function mutations to decrease the deleterious burden in the Hainan population. However, there was an accumulation of more deleterious missense mutations. Furthermore, significant differences in genetic diversity and level of inbreeding found among the three Hainan subpopulations indicated population isolation and suboptimal translocation strategies, which calls for urgent, coordinated, and science-based genetic management to ensure the long-term viability of the endemic subspecies hainanus. This study provides guidance for the conservation and management of Eld's deer.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is a primary driver of population declines in marine megafauna. These captures not only have environmental impacts, they also have economic consequences for fishers such as direct losses when repairing fishing gear. Therefore, evaluating the fishers' perception of bycatch and comparing it with data from scientific fisheries observers might provide a broader view of the current situation these species face. To do this, we obtained data concerning the bycatch of 1,838 sea turtles between 2008-2018 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as informative surveys from 421 artisanal fishers surveyed in 2020. There is a discrepancy between the bycatch observed and the fishers' perceptions of it. The observers' results identified that high rates of incidental capture of sea turtles are associated with the mahi mahi fishery that occurs during winter and is a shallow set fishery using fish as bait. The olive ridley turtle was the main species affected by bycatch. According to the fishers' perception, bycatch was higher with the use of J-hooks and a longline (compared to circle hooks and to gill nets and trawl nets) and when the target species are pelagic fish during the winter season. In addition, the fishers' perception showed that 39.4% considered incidental fishing as an environmental problem and 28.5% considered it as a nuisance, while 32.1% do not consider sea turtle bycatch as a problem. These findings suggest that 60% of fishers do not consider it a need to protect sea turtles. Given the different responses between fisheries observers and fishers' perception, it is clear that more dialogue is necessary to raise awareness about the effects of bycatch on worldwide sea turtle populations. Thus, there is an enormous potential to recruit/increase fishers' active participation for turtle protection. In this context, the idea of including the fishers' perception into any management strategy or conservation measure should be reinforced in order to effectively reduce the bycatch of these iconic species.

AB  - Climate change is threatening our ability to manage forest ecosystems sustainably. Despite strong consensus on the need for a broad portfolio of options to face this challenge, diversified management options have yet to be widely implemented. Inspired by functional zoning, a concept aimed at optimizing biodiversity conservation and wood production in multiple-use forest landscapes, we present a portfolio of management options that intersects management objectives with forest vulnerability to better address the wide range of goals inherent to forest management under climate change. Using this approach, we illustrate how different adaptation options could be implemented when faced with impacts related to climate change and its uncertainty. These options range from establishing ecological reserves in climatic refuges, where self-organizing ecological processes can result in resilient forests, to intensive plantation silviculture that could ensure a stable wood supply in an uncertain future. While adaptation measures in forests that are less vulnerable correspond to the traditional functional zoning management objectives, forests with higher vulnerability might be candidates for transformative measures as they may be more susceptible to abrupt changes in structure and composition. To illustrate how this portfolio of management options could be applied, we present a theoretical case study for the eastern boreal forest of Canada. Even if these options are supported by solid evidence, their implementation across the landscape may present some challenges and will require good communication among stakeholders and with the public.

AB  - Pyric herbivory, the interaction between fire and grazing, is an ecological process in rangeland ecosystems. While cattle selection of burned patches is documented, the effects of a second herbivore species, like goats, remain unclear. This study examined patch selection patterns of cattle and goats when provided with both burned or unburned areas with patches varying in time since fire (TSF) and burn season. We hypothesized that both livestock species would select for recently burned patches, with cattle selection being more season-dependent than goats. We also hypothesized that the proportion of time allocated to the most recently burned patches would not significantly differ between livestock species. We compared TSF across burn seasons and quantified patch selection using Ivlev's electivity index. Our results showed that both livestock species selected for recently burned patches, with selection decreasing as TSF increased. For cattle, patch selection was influenced by TSF and burn season. Goat patch selection was also related to TSF, but showed more variability in response to burn season and TSF duration. In dormant season burns, both livestock species selected for the most recently burned patches, while selection following growing season burns peaked at 6-11 months TSF. The observed patterns suggest that including goats in cattle operations that use pyric herbivory will not alter overall preference for burned areas.

AB  - Body composition studies are critical for evaluating the accuracy of nutritional condition indices for predicting body components. We evaluated >40 indices of nutritional condition for caribou (Rangifer tarandus (Linnaeus, 1758)) using 29 female caribou captured from three populations in Alaska (USA) that ranged in condition from 2.3% to 11.2% ingesta-free body fat (IFBF) and 6 captive female caribou that ranged in condition from 8.1% to 26.0% IFBF. Estimates of body fat, protein, and gross energy were regressed against each index of nutritional condition. Generally, indices with linear or slightly curvilinear relations to body fat and those based on multiple fat depots were the most accurate in predicting nutritional condition and the most useful over the full range of nutritional condition. A scaledLIVINDEX (a combination of subcutaneous fat thickness and a condition score), CONINDEX (a combination of kidney fat and marrow fat), and a subset of the Kistner score (pericardium and kidneys only) had the strongest relationship with body fat (r(2) > 0.86) and were useful over the entire range of nutritional condition. If used properly and with adequate training, indices of nutritional condition can be a critical tool for understanding the severity and seasonality of nutritional limitations in wild caribou populations.

AB  - Interventions to improve productivity in pastoral livestock systems of northern Kenya focus on the management of the rangeland resources and grazing areas with few initiatives on changes related to the livestock assets. However, changing climatic conditions with high frequencies of droughts have increased the vulnerability of pastoral communities and necessitate prompt interventions in animal management practices. In 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Irrigation in collaboration with the International Livestock Research Institute commenced a programme to build the resilience of pastoral holdings using their animal assets rather than depending on humanitarian emergency responses. Interventions necessitated changes in management practices related to sheep and goat production. Core innovation groups (CIG) each comprising 30 pastoral households in select communities were established to model new practices for wider adoption using participatory processes in Isiolo, Marsabit and Turkana Counties. CIG members went through a 3-year phased training programme on animal management practices for more efficient, resilient and productive animals. The adoption of new practices in CIG flocks was monitored by extension personnel. Data were analysed using logistic regression techniques to assess household-level adoption of livestock breed improvement, feeding and disease control interventions. The 3 years of the programme (2018-2021) were relatively satisfactory in terms of pasture availability; hence, communities pursued strategies to enhance their flocks. All CIG adopted more than one of the introduced technologies concurrently. Prevention of diseases was the most readily adopted, followed by crossbreeding using indigenous breeds of sheep and goats from other arid areas of Kenya. Turkana County had the lowest probability of adopting any of the technologies as previous devastating droughts have resulted in an increased emphasis on animals for survival rather than productivity. The study shows that pastoral communities are open to technological interventions for animal productivity. Adoption of the technologies was enhanced by the experiential capacity development activities adapted to the education level of the different communities.

AB  - Current and legacy effects can greatly affect the growth of a focal plant and its interactions with herbivores and such effects can be mediated by above-and belowground effects. However, determining the relative importance of current and legacy above-and belowground effects in natural conditions is a major challenge. In a long-term grassland experiment, we examined the relative importance of the current and legacy above-and belowground effects of plant communities on the growth and aboveground herbivore damage on a focal plant, Leucanthemum vulgare. Focal plants were planted into tubes with soil col-lected from different plant communities and placed back into the plant communities. Weekly, plant growth and damage were recorded and after 12 weeks plant biomass was measured. We analyzed how well aboveground and belowground characteris-tics of the current and legacy plots explained plant growth and herbivory. We found both current plant communities and legacy plant communities significantly affected plant growth (shoot biomass and the number of leaves) and herbivory. Root biomass of the focal plants was influenced by current plant communities only. Current and legacy above-and belowground characteris-tics explained 12% and 11% of the variation in shoot biomass. Root biomass was mainly explained by current above-and belowground characteristics with a total explained variation of 10%, while legacy effects explained 3%. Legacy effects explained most variation in the number of leaves during the first two weeks of measurements, and the effect remained present during the growth season. In contrast, characteristics of the current community explained most of the variation in herbivory throughout the growth period, with on average 6% explained variance aboveground vs. 5% belowground. Our grassland field study highlights that both current and legacy effects influence plant growth, but herbivory on focal plants is caused by current neighborhood effects only and not by legacy effects.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Habitat fragmentation can influence the spatial ecology of wildlife populations, with downstream effects on population dynamics and sustainability. Row-crop farming is a common anthropogenic landscape alteration, yet the effects on animal movement and space use is understudied in some species. Cropland can benefit wildlife nutritionally but may result in habitat loss because of changes in landscape composition and human disturbance. Methods We quantified the influence of cropland presence and coverage on mule deer spatial ecology in the southern Great Plains. We GPS-collared 146 adult mule deer in four regions of the Texas Panhandle and monitored movement relative to spatio-temporal fluctuations in cropland and particular crop species availability for 2 years. We modeled the effects of cropland on space use and resource selection at multiple spatio-temporal scales to characterize population and individual habitat components of mule deer. Results We observed a functional response in cropland use, where at low coverage, use was proportional to availability but decreased with > 20% cropland coverage at the home range and within-home range scales. Few mule deer exhibited long-distance movements towards cropland. Individuals within 1.6 km of cropland exhibited greater cropland use, whereas deer > 4.2 km from cropland rarely used these areas. At the population level, mule deer selected cropland during the winter and late summer, probably for nutritional benefit when rangeland nutrients are low. At a finer scale, step-selection functions identified individual heterogeneity in crop species selection. Winter wheat, alfalfa, and fallow fields had greater use relative to other crop types. Generally, 15-60% of mule deer with access to cropland selected alfalfa year-round, and up to 63% of deer selected winter wheat post-reproduction. Conclusions Our results suggest that at a low spatial coverage, cropland alters the spatial ecology of mule deer at several spatio-temporal scales and may provide nutritional benefits, but at a cost of lost habitat when cropland exceeds 20% of the landscape. Declining groundwater resources and an exponentially growing human population will alter future farming practices. Understanding how species occupying these environments, such as mule deer, are influenced by human-induced landscape changes can enhance mitigation of human-wildlife interactions and aid conservation actions as policy and social pressures shape future agricultural practices.

AB  - Wire-snare poaching is increasingly recognized as a major threat to endangered large carnivores in Africa and Asia. However, empirical information on the extent and distribution of snaring remains extremely limited beyond anecdotal reports presenting opportunistically collected data. In this study, we compile information to present a comprehensive synopsis of snaring of critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Hunted for their parts and skins, Sumatran tigers remain in high demand in illicit international markets. We focus our analysis on the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia, which cumulatively contain similar to 36 % of the island's remaining tiger habitat. Based on records collected from a combination of Indonesian government data, ranger patrol observations, and content analysis of local media, we identified 13 tiger snaring hotspots and documented 28 verified incidents of ensnared tigers between March 2008-March 2023. These totals represent minimum estimates because of spatiotemporal gaps in ranger patrols and inconsistent reporting of snaring by local communities. Our analysis of the incidents reveals tiger mortality in 9 (32.1 %) of the cases and permanent moves to ex-situ settings due to amputation or other debilitating snaring-induced injuries in another 8 (28.6 %) cases. Tiger snaring was positively correlated with forest-edge habitats in the Leuser Ecosystem, where 64.3 % of all incidents occurred. Across both provinces, 28.6 % of all snared tigers were allegedly captured in snares set in agricultural areas to control wild boar. To maximize efficacy of the government's ongoing anti-snare campaigns, we recommend increased personnel for ranger patrols and more attention on tiger-specific snaring impacts.

AB  - Kelp forests in Korean waters, mainly consisting of Ecklonia cava, provide ecologically and economically important ecosystems. However, they are severely threatened by increasing sea surface temperature (SST). In 2023, an unusually high SST was observed in the northern East China Sea, where the average SST from August to November 2023 was found to be 1.1 degrees C higher than the average SST during the same period over the last two decades. Our photo images and videos reveal increasing feeding on E. cava populations by tropical herbivore rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus, Siganus fuscescens) associated with the impact of increasing SST. Given the fall reproductive peak of E. cava population, increased herbivory by tropical rabbitfish could have a significant adverse impact on the composition of temperate kelp forests.

AB  - The study was conducted to test the feasibility of protocols for field collection of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) for in vitro embryo production (IVP) in wild bison. The study was done with captive wood bison during the anovulatory season. In Experiment 1, the efficiency of transvaginal ultrasound-guided COC collection was compared between bison restrained in a squeeze chute without sedation vs in lateral recumbency after chemical immobilization using a dart gun (n = 8/group). In Experiment 2, a 2 x 2 design was used to examine the effects of superstimulation treatment [single dose of equine chorionic gonodotrophin (eCG) vs multiple doses of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)] and method of drug administration (manual injection vs field darting) on COC collection and IVP. In Experiment 1, no difference was detected between chute-restrained vs chemically immobilized groups in the time required to complete COC collections, the number of follicles aspirated (11.5 +/- 1.9 vs 9.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.4) or the COC recovery rate [COC recovered/follicle aspirated; 58/92 (63%) vs 44/69 (64%); P = 0.9]. In Experiment 2, no differences were detected between superstimulation treatments (eCG vs FSH). The total number of follicles available for aspiration did not differ between manual injection and field darting (23.9 +/- 2.7 vs 21.6 +/- 1.9; P = 0.4). Compared with the random start unstimulated group, the embryo production rate was higher [18/132 (14%) vs 53/189 (28%); P = 0.04] after wave synchronization and superstimulation. Results suggest that COC collection is equally feasible in a recumbent position after chemical immobilization as those bison restrained in a standing position in a hydraulic chute. Ovarian superstimulation with a single-dose eCG protocol is as effective as a multiple-dose FSH protocol, and field darting is as effective as chute-side administration of superstimulation treatments. The strategies in the present study are ready to be incorporated into field collections in free-roaming bison herds.

AB  - Anthropogenic actions have affected marine species for a long time, through overexploitation of natural stocks and habitat degradation, influencing the life strategies of several taxa, especially rays and sharks, which have suffered significant population declines in recent years. Therefore, conservation actions and stock management have become paramount. In this regard, chola guitarfish, Pseudobatos percellens, distributed throughout the Brazilian coast, is often commercially fished by local artisanal fleets or as by-catch in shrimp trawl fisheries. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the genetic diversity of P. percellens throughout the Brazilian coast, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic analyses employing 3329 SNPs revealed a hidden biodiversity within P. percellens, with at least one lineage occurring in the Northern and Northeastern regions and another distributed in the Southeastern/Southern Brazilian coast, with high genetic differentiation between them. However, the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) indicated the presence of in fact three lineages distributed in these regions that must still be better investigated. Therefore, to ensure adequate conservation of chola guitarfish biodiversity, populations must be managed separately along the Brazilian coast. Furthermore, the need for a taxonomic review for this group is noted.

AB  - Information on connectivity and genetic structure of marine organisms remains sparse in frontier ecosystems such as the Arctic Ocean. Filling these knowledge gaps becomes increasingly urgent, as the Arctic is undergoing rapid physical, ecological and socio-economic changes. The abundant and widely distributed polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is highly adapted to Arctic waters, and its larvae and juveniles live in close association with sea ice. Through a reduced-representation sequencing approach, this study explored the spatial genetic structure of polar cod at a circum-Arctic scale. Genomic variation was partitioned into neutral and adaptive components to respectively investigate genetic connectivity and local adaptation. Based on 922 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers genotyped in 611 polar cod, broad-scale differentiation was detected among three groups: (i) Beaufort -Chukchi seas, (ii) all regions connected by the Transpolar Drift, ranging from the Laptev Sea to Iceland, including the European Arctic and (iii) West Greenland. Patterns of neutral genetic structure suggested broadscale oceanographic and sea ice drift features (i.e., Beaufort Gyre and Transpolar Drift) as important drivers of connectivity. Genomic variation at 35 outlier loci indicated adaptive divergence of the West Greenland and the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas populations, possibly driven by environmental conditions. Sea ice decline and changing ocean currents can alter or disrupt connectivity between polar cod from the three genetic groups, potentially undermining their resilience to climate change, even in putative refugia, such as the Central Arctic Ocean and the Arctic Archipelago.

AB  - The application of organic amendments in agriculture has gained increasing attention as a sustainable approach to improving soil fertility and crop productivity. This study assessed the effects of vermicompost derived from water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) manure on the yield and biochemical quality of cauliflower cultivated in soil types typical of the Campania region: loam and clay. Three fertilization treatments were tested, an unfertilized control, vermicompost (140 kg N ha-1), and mineral fertilizer (MIN), at the same nitrogen rate. The results showed that vermicompost more significantly improved plant growth compared to the unfertilized control, particularly in loam soil, where the biomass and the leaf number increased by 160% and 335%, respectively. In clay soil, vermicompost enhanced nutrient availability, leading to a 159% biomass increase relative to the control. While mineral fertilization resulted in the highest yields, vermicompost improved the antioxidant capacity and influenced the amino acid composition, particularly in clay soil, where it enhanced the total amino acid content by 35% over that of the control. Additionally, vermicompost increased the quantity of soil organic matter and moderated the oxidative stress responses, suggesting long-term benefits for soil health. These findings highlight the potential of vermicompost as an effective and sustainable soil amendment, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming and nitrate-sensitive environments. Further research is needed to optimize its integration with conventional fertilization strategies to maximize the agronomic and environmental benefits.

AB  - Herbivore fronts can alter plant traits (chemical and/or morphological features) and performance via grazing. Yet, herbivore-driven trait alterations are rarely considered when assessing how these fronts shape ecosystems, despite the critical role that plant performance plays in ecosystem functioning. We evaluated herbivore fronts created by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum , as it consumes the cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora , in Virginian salt marshes. Sesarma fronts form at the head of tidal creeks and move inland, creating a denuded mudflat between the tall-form Spartina low marsh (trailing edge) and the short-form Spartina high marsh (leading edge). We quantified Sesarma front migration rate, tested if Sesarma herbivory altered geomorphic processes and Spartina traits at the trailing and leading edges, and examined how these trait changes persisted through the final 8 weeks of the growing season. Sesarma front migration in our region is two times slower than fronts in the Southeast United States, and Spartina retreat rate at the leading edge is greater than the revegetation rate at the trailing edge. Sesarma fronts lowered elevation and decreased sediment shear strength at the trailing edge while having no impact on soil organic matter and bulk density at either edge. At the leading edge, Sesarma grazing reduced Spartina growth traits and defensive ability, and trait changes persisted through the remaining growing season. At the trailing edge, however, Sesarma grazing promoted belowground biomass production and had limited to no effect on growth or defensive traits. We show that herbivore fronts negatively impact saltmarsh plant traits at their leading edge, potentially contributing to front propagation. In contrast, plants at the trailing edge were more resistant to herbivore grazing and may enhance resilience through elevated belowground biomass production. Future work should consider herbivore-driven plant trait alterations in the context of herbivore fronts to better predict ecosystem response and recovery.

AB  - A rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted in the Republic of the Congo including a systematic biodiversity study (including a targeted study of mammals), implemented over two seasons. One hundred thirteen recce transects (250 m by 2 m) were undertaken over 34 days of fieldwork. A total of 19 species were detected (3 to genus level only). The encounter rate was 26.65 mammalian signs per km; no differences in numbers of signs between season appeared; however, the dry-season species accumulation pattern was higher than during wet season. Correlation analysis showed increasing density of mammals as distance away from villages, lakes and coast increased. The correlation result is deemed to highlight not only a substantial hunting pressure and avoidance of humans, but also preference for forested habitats noted to appear from 20 km distance from the coast. Using high numbers of relatively short recce transect proved a useful supplementary method for assessing mammalian diversity during rapid biodiversity assessments. Results suggest that 70 recce transects (with a minimum of eight per habitat type) would have been sufficient to yield this information.

AB  - Mutualisms between plants and ants are common features of tropical ecosystems around the globe and can have cascading effects on interactions with the ecological communities in which they occur. In an African savanna, we assessed whether acacia ants influence nest site selection by tree-nesting birds. Birds selected nest sites in trees inhabited by ant species that vigorously defend against browsing mammals. Future research could address the extent to which hatching and fledging rates depend on the species of ant symbiont, and why ants tolerate nesting birds but no other tree associates (especially insects).Abstract in Swahili is available with online material.

AB  - Seasonal variation in the macrobenthic functional characteristics, such as trophic structure and secondary production, was studied, along with their structural characteristics such as density, biomass, and community distribution in Cochin estuary (CE), a tropical monsoonal estuary along the Southwest coast of India during 2018-2019. The biotic indices, AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) and M-AMBI (Multivariate-AMBI) were used to assess the ecological quality of the study area by using the sensitivity of macrobenthic fauna to disturbances. A distinct temporal variation was evident in the macrobenthic structural characteristics, wherein high density, biomass, and species richness were observed during the post-monsoon. Polycheate species were dominant during pre-monsoon (Prionospio cirrifera) and monsoon (Mediomastus sp.), while gastropod species, Stenothyra perpumila, was dominant during post-monsoon. The trophic structure analysis revealed the dominance of deposit-feeding polychaetes during the pre-monsoon in association with the fine sediments laden with high organic carbon. In contrast, during post-monsoon, the polychaete trophic groups were more or less evenly distributed in the sandy substratum. The higher density of suspension feeders and herbivorous-grazers observed during the post-monsoon indicated improved habitat quality compared to the pre-monsoon dominated by the detritivores. The macrobenthic secondary production was also high during the post-monsoon, contributed by a diverse assemblage of molluscs, crustaceans, and polychaetes having size > 0.7 mm. The biotic indices also showed an evident increase in the habitat quality of the estuary from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon (AMBI, moderately disturbed to undisturbed; M-AMBI, poor-moderate-good to good-high conditions), similar to the results of benthic structural and functional characteristics. The study highlights the significance of the utility of benthic functional characteristics while assessing the habitat quality of an ecosystem.

AB  - Simple Summary Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) are frequently found in bovine milk samples as well as on teat skin associated with subclinical mastitis (SCM). Staphylococcus microti is a new species among NAS resulted to recently be the predominant species in the milk of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) affected by intramammary infection (IMI). The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of S. microti in milk and milking parlor equipment samples of an Italian buffalo farm. No clinical mastitis was noticed, but S. microti-associated SCM and IMI were detected. The presence of S. microti was also revealed on milking parlor surfaces. The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility tests highlighted a complete resistance to tetracyclines, and 20.4% of the isolated S. microti exhibited a multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile. In conclusion, the presence of this bacterium in the milk of buffaloes in the absence of evident mastitis clinical signs underlines the need for further studies, and its finding on milking parlor surfaces suggests that the environmental quality of the milking parlor plays an important role in influencing both S. microti's spread and the microbial communities of the milk. S. microti is a new species among non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) frequently found in bovine milk samples and associated with subclinical mastitis (SCM). The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of S. microti in 200 composite milk samples and 104 milking parlor surface swabs collected at a buffalo farm in Southern Italy to define its presence in milk and a milking parlor environment. The samples were inoculated onto different agar plates, and the isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The strains identified as S. microti (54/304 samples, 17.8%) were collected, and their purified genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification and whole 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Furthermore, their phenotypic resistance profiles were evaluated by a disk diffusion method, and the genotypic characterization of the tetracycline resistance was performed for the tetM and tetK genes by multiplex PCR. Four and forty-seven S. microti isolates from milk samples of lactating animals with subclinical mastitis (SCM) and intramammary infection (IMI), respectively, and three isolates from milking parlor surfaces were recovered. The genomic DNA was purified from the bacterial isolates, and the amplification and sequencing of the 16S gene further supported the proteomic identification as S. microti. No clinical mastitis was detected in the herd during the study period. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a worrisome 100% resistance to tetracyclines, genotypically mediated by the tetM gene for all strains. This study highlights that S. microti may be commonly isolated from dairy buffalo milk and milking parlor equipment. Its association with SCM or IMI remains to be established.

AB  - Parasites can exert a substantial influence on the ecology of wildlife populations by altering host condition. Our objectives were to estimate single and multiparasite-condition relationships for fallow deer (Dama dama) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Denmark and to assess potential health effects along the parasite burden gradient. Fallow deer hosted on average two endoparasite taxa per individual (min = 0, max = 5) while red deer carried on average five parasite taxa per individual (min = 2, max = 9). Body condition of both deer species was negatively related to presence of Trichuris ssp. eggs while body condition of red deer was positively related to antibodies of the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. For the remaining parasite taxa (n = 12), we either found weak or no apparent association between infection and deer body condition or low prevalence levels restricted formal testing. Importantly, we detected a strong negative relationship between body condition and the sum of endoparasite taxa carried by individual hosts, a pattern that was evident in both deer species. We did not detect systemic inflammatory reactions, yet serology revealed reduced total protein and iron concentrations with increased parasite load in both deer species, likely due to maldigestion of forage or malabsorption of nutrients. Despite moderate sample sizes, our study highlights the importance of considering multiparasitism when assessing body condition impacts in deer populations. Moreover, we show how serum chemistry assays are a valuable diagnostic tool to detect subtle and sub-clinical health impacts of parasitism, even at low-level infestation.

AB  - The feral cattle of the subantarctic island of Amsterdam provide an outstanding case study of a large mammalian population that was established by a handful of founders and thrived within a few generations in a seemingly inhospitable environment. Here, we investigated the genetic history and composition of this population using genotyping and sequencing data. Our inference showed an intense but brief founding bottleneck around the late 19th century and revealed contributions from European taurine and Indian Ocean Zebu in the founder ancestry. Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences further revealed a moderate reduction in genetic diversity despite high levels of inbreeding. The brief and intense bottleneck was associated with high levels of drift, a flattening of the site frequency spectrum and a slight relaxation of purifying selection on mildly deleterious variants. Unlike some populations that have experienced prolonged reductions in effective population size, we did not observe any significant purging of highly deleterious variants. Interestingly, the population's success in the harsh environment can be attributed to preadaptation from their European taurine ancestry, suggesting no strong bioclimatic challenge, and also contradicting evidence for insular dwarfism. Genome scan for footprints of selection uncovered a majority of candidate genes related to nervous system function, likely reflecting rapid feralization driven by behavioral changes and complex social restructuring. The Amsterdam Island cattle offers valuable insights into rapid population establishment, feralization, and genetic adaptation in challenging environments. It also sheds light on the unique genetic legacies of feral populations, raising ethical questions according to conservation efforts.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an economic tree species in southern China and is famous for its oil. The surrounding climate is filtered by the tree itself, resulting in the canopy microclimate, which affects the growth and fruit quality of C. oleifera. This study investigated the effect of canopy positions on microclimate and fruit growth, maturation and qualities by comparing the differences in canopy position. This study also considered the relationship between microclimate and fruit qualities during the oil conversion period. The fruit qualities and microclimate were studied by dividing the canopy into two vertical layers and horizontal layers, creating the following canopy positions: upper outer canopy (UO), upper inner canopy (UI), lower outer canopy (LO) and lower inner canopy (LI). The light intensity increased significantly from inside to outside and from top to bottom in the canopy; however, there were no significant differences in temperature and relative humidity. At maturity, the moisture content of fruits and kernels in UO and LO was approximately <5% of those in UI and LI. The soluble sugar content increased by 10.90%, 8.47% and 6.84% in UO, UI and LO in November, while no significant change was observed in LI. The kernel oil content (KOC) obtained a higher value in UO and UI at maturity. However, KOC decreased by 5.16%, 3.02%, 3.10% and 0.67% in UO, UI, LO and LI in November. Light intensity in September and October was correlated, and temperature and relative humidity in August and September were correlated.

AB  - Certain species experience rapid population increases in human-modified and -affected environments. Conservation actions and increased wintertime food availability have led to a population increase of several large herbivorous waterbird species. In Northern Europe, this trend is opposite to the overall decrease of several smaller waterbird species. We examined whether the recovery of a flagship species, the whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), and the spreading of the nonnative Canada goose (Branta canadensis), cause asymmetric competition with other sympatric waterbirds at their breeding sites. We used data from the national Finnish waterbird surveys collected in the late 1980s and early 2020 s at 942 sites, to assess the site-level effects of large herbivore occurrence on other waterbird species, while considering their trophic overlap. We hypothesised that there could be competitive effects of large herbivorous on smaller species, especially those with similar foraging niches. We however found that other waterbird populations have decreased less at sites occupied by whooper swans since the 1980 s. Canada goose site occupation was not associated with the abundance of other waterbirds. Thereby, our findings are not consistent with the suggestion that population increases of large herbivore species lead to asymmetric competition on the breeding wetlands. The whooper swan may potentially act as an indicator of habitat quality and further on as a flagship umbrella species with multidisciplinary conservation benefits, of which may accrue benefits also to other waterbirds exhibiting declining population trends. Our findings underline the importance of considering species interactions when designing and implementing management actions in conservation strategies.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems supporting wildlife and livestock populations have undergone significant transformation in the last millennium. Climate, herbivory, fire, and people are identified as important drivers of ecosystems dynamics; however, grassland resilience has been rarely explored in landscapes with mixed grazing histories. Here we analyse ecosystems states from a South African mountain valley grassland in the last 1250 years using palaeoenvironmental proxies. Our results suggest that a tallgrass phase maintained by climate, people and fire replaced a shortgrass phase driven by indigenous herbivores after ca. 690 cal BP. Furthermore, the tallgrass phase had unpalatable grasses and disturbed soil. We suggest these ecological changes were linked to climate change and arrival of pastoralists in the region. Therefore, our results indicate that human activities may undermine resilience of grasslands and that reversing some changes may be difficult.

AB  - Lichens produce various carbon-based secondary compounds (CBSCs) in response to abiotic conditions and herbivory. Although lichen CBSCs have received considerable attention with regard to responses to UV-B exposure, very little is known about intra-specific variation across environmental gradients and their role in protection against herbivory in the Antarctic. Here we report on the variation in CBSCs of two widely distributed and common Antarctic lichens, Usnea antarctica and Umbilicaria antarctica, between sites with different solar exposure (NW-SE) and along natural nitrogen (N) gradients which are associated with changing lichen-invertebrate associations on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic). Fumarprotocetraric and usnic acid concentrations in Usnea showed no relationships with solar exposure, lichen-N or associated invertebrate abundance. However, fumarprotocetraric acid concentration was 13 times higher at inland sites compared to coastal sites along the N-gradients. Gyrophoric acid concentration in Umbilicaria was 33% lower in sun-facing (northerly exposed) habitats compared to more shaded (south-facing) rocks and declined with elevation. Gyrophoric acid concentration was positively correlated with the abundance and species richness of associated microarthropods, similar to the patterns found with lichen N. This initial investigation indicates that there can be large intraspecific variation in lichen CBSC concentrations across relative short distances (< 500 m) on Signy Island and raises further questions regarding current understanding of the role of CBSCs in Antarctic lichens in relation to biotic and abiotic pressures.

AB  - Spatial organization plays prominent roles in disease transmission, genetics, and demography of wildlife populations and is therefore an important consideration not only for wildlife management, but also for inference about populations and processes. We used hierarchical agglomerative clustering of a spatial graph network to partition Wind Cave National Park (WICA) into five regions used by 163 female elk (Cervus elaphus) marked with global positioning system collars during 2005-08 and 2011-13. We grouped elk based on differential use of the five regions, developed a priori models for inter-group variation in the occurrence of chronic wasting disease (CWD), and used Akaike's information criterion to compare models and stratify regions. Previous descriptions of elk population structure, which have been based on social contact or overlap of individual ranges, have distinguished spatially disjunct population subsets. Constructing hierarchical partitions of the landscape enabled us to also discern and describe overlapping and nested subsets. During 2016-18, apparent park-wide prevalence of CWD was 0.18 (90% CI = [0.146, 0.182]); however, prevalence within three spatial strata used primarily by different elk ranged from 0.03 ([0.008, 0.074]) to 0.29 ([0.211, 0.375]). In context with published estimates of recruitment, predation, and anthropogenic mortality, such differences in prevalence equate to increasing local abundance of elk in southwestern WICA, stable to declining abundance in the west/northwest, and rapidly declining abundance in the east. Despite the modest size of WICA (11,357 ha), park-wide averages conflate effects of elk distribution and disease, obscuring spatial patterns with profound implications for study and management of elk and CWD. Graph networks have been used widely in ecology to describe such phenomena as social relationships, connectivity of habitat patches, animal movements, and the spread of disease. Extension to partitioning of geographic range is straightforward but entails different considerations. We discuss allocation of sampling effort, construction of an initial partition, specification of a model for graph cohesion, selection of a clustering algorithm, and identification of useful partitions.

AB  - The circadian activity of selected mammal species and the temporal overlap with human presence or between species were analysed in 2013-2014 on the territory of the Sinite Kamani Nature Park, Eastern Stara Planina. The purpose of this study was to determine how the human presence affected the circadian activity of mammal species in this protected area. The wild boar (n = 68) showed 22% overlap with the humans (n = 54) in its circadian activity (Delta = 0.22, CI 0.02-0.21) while the roe deer (n = 144) activity overlapped in 49% with the human activity (Delta = 0.49, CI 0.29-0.51). The European brown hare (n=26) activity had a 23% overlap (Delta = 0.23, CI 0.07-0.26), the golden jackal (n = 42) - 36% (Delta = 0.36, CI 0.22-0.49) and the red fox (n = 131) - 24% (Delta = 0.24, CI 0.06-0.25). The overlap between the red fox and European brown hare activity was 81% (Delta= 0.81, CI 0.71-0.93), between red fox and golden jackal - 71% (Delta = 0.71, CI0.49-0.77) and between red fox and Martes sp. - 81% (Delta = 0.81, CI 0.72-0.93). The target species avoided the range of time when humans were active. This forced the species to use a narrower temporal niche when sharing the same space. These results provided insights for the better management of the species in the protected areas.

AB  - The Philippine native pig (PhNP) is a unique genetic resource composed of multiple domesticated Sus scrofa lineages and interspecific hybrids. No prior study has determined the population structure and genetic diversity of PhNPs on multiple islands and provinces, which is essential for establishing conservation priorities. In this study, we explore the population structure and genetic diversity of various PhNP populations in Luzon and the Visayas, Philippines, to identify conservation priorities. We analyzed seven PhNP populations (n = 20-27 samples each; Benguet [B], Kalinga [K], Nueva Vizcaya [N], Isabela [I], Quezon [Q], Marinduque [M], and Samar [S]) and four transboundary breeds present in the Philippines (n = 9-11 samples each; Duroc, Large White, Landrace, and Berkshire). The pigs were compared against a panel of 20 microsatellite markers recommended by the ISAG-FAO. We tested for population structure at the island, region, and province levels. Strong genetic differentiation between native and transboundary breeds was confirmed by Bayesian clustering (k = 2) and Nei's D-A genetic distance (100% bootstrap support for the PhNP cluster). PhNP exhibited high heterozygosity (Ho: 0.737), a high allele count (Na: 7.771), and a low inbreeding coefficient (Fis: -0.040-0.125). Bayesian clustering supported genetic differentiation at the island (k = 2; North Luzon and South Luzon-Visayas cluster), region (k = 3), and population (k = 8) levels. The pairwise F'st between PhNP populations ranged from 0.084 (N and I) to 0.397 (Q and K), confirming that some PhNP populations exhibited sufficient genetic distance to be considered separate populations. This study shows that native pigs from B, K, I, Q, M, and S are unique genetic units for conservation. Furthermore, the small effective population sizes of B, I, Q, M, and S (Ne: 3.9, 19.1, 14.2, 44.7, and 22.5, respectively) necessitate immediate conservation actions, such as incentivizing PhNP farming.

AB  - This paper presents the first records of the brittle star Ophiactis abyssicola in Canadian waters and range extensions of up to 1900 km in the Northwest Atlantic from previously known locations. Samples were collected off northern Labrador and the northern portion of insular Newfoundland (eastern Canada) at 433 and 1097 m depths, respectively. This newly recorded species of brittle star from the bathyal zone off Newfoundland and Labrador adds to the marine biodiversity of Canada and to the general distribution knowledge of O. abyssicola.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry is essential for the livelihood and culture of indigenous people in the Arctic. Parts of the herding areas are also used as pastures for farm animals, facilitating potential transmission of viruses between species. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, viruses circulating in the wild are receiving increased attention, since they might pose a potential threat to human health. Climate change will influence the prevalence of infectious diseases of both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to detect known and previously unknown viruses in Eurasian tundra reindeer. In total, 623 nasal and 477 rectal swab samples were collected from reindeer herds in Fennoscandia, Iceland, and Eastern Russia during 2016-2019. Next-generation sequencing analysis and BLAST-homology searches indicated the presence of viruses of domesticated and wild animals, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine papillomavirus, alcephaline herpesvirus 1 and 2, deer mastadenovirus B, bovine rotavirus, and roe deer picobirnavirus. Several viral species previously found in reindeer and some novel species were detected, although the clinical relevance of these viruses in reindeer is largely unknown. These results indicate that it should be possible to find emerging viruses of relevance for both human and animal health using reindeer as a sentinel species.

AB  - Across the globe, mobile species are key components of ecosystems. Migratory birds and nomadic antelope can have considerable conservation, economic or societal value, while irruptive insects can be major pests and threaten food security. Extreme weather events, which are increasing in frequency and intensity under ongoing climate change, are driving rapid and unforeseen shifts in mobile species distributions. This challenges their management, potentially leading to population declines, or exacerbating the adverse impacts of pests. Near-term, within-year forecasting may have the potential to anticipate mobile species distribution changes during extreme weather events, thus informing adaptive management strategies. Here, for the first time, we assess the robustness of near-term forecasting of the distribution of a terrestrial species under extreme weather. For this, we generated near-term (2 weeks to 7 months ahead) distribution forecasts for a crop pest that is a threat to food security in southern Africa, the red-billed quelea Quelea quelea. To assess performance, we generated hindcasts of the species distribution across 13 years (2004-2016) that encompassed two major droughts. We show that, using dynamic species distribution models (D-SDMs), environmental suitability for quelea can be accurately forecast with seasonal lead times (up to 7 months ahead), at high resolution, and across a large spatial scale, including in extreme drought conditions. D-SDM predictive accuracy and near-term hindcast reliability were primarily driven by the availability of training data rather than overarching weather conditions. We discuss how a forecasting system could be used to inform adaptive management of mobile species and mitigate impacts of extreme weather, including by anticipating sites and times for transient management and proactively mobilising resources for prepared responses. Our results suggest that such techniques could be widely applied to inform more resilient, adaptive management of mobile species worldwide.

AB  - Diet in fish is influenced by multiple factors including nutritional requirements, trophic morphology and spatial and temporal variation in resource availability. We examined spatial variation in trophic resources on substrata grazed by scarinine parrotfishes by combining quantitative microhistology with 16S and 18S small subunit rRNA barcoding of feeding substrata in six parrotfish species on outer-shelf reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We then compared four of these taxa with conspecific data from mid-shelf reefs differing in incident wave energy, parrotfish assemblage structure and benthic cover of hard corals, crustose coralline algae (CCA) and macroalgae. The dominant biota on outer-shelf feeding substrata in terms of both surface coverage and frequency of occurrence were filamentous cyanobacteria. The density of filamentous cyanobacteria on outer-shelf feeding substrata as measured by microscope did not differ either among the six parrotfish species or within-species cross-shelf. Endolithic and epilithic filamentous cyanobacteria from the order Nostocales were the most frequently observed filamentous cyanobacteria, suggesting that these represent a key feeding target for these parrotfishes. In addition to filamentous Nostocales cyanobacteria, taxa that were consistently present on both mid-shelf and outer-shelf feeding substrata were the euendolithic micro-chlorophytes Ostreobium and Phaeophila, diatoms, fungi, CCA, Peyssonnelia, dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, the sponge taxa Clionaida and Poecilosclerida and the filamentous algae Sphacelaria and Polysiphonia. Our results reveal key nutritional drivers underlying feeding by parrotfish on carbonate reefs and provide further support for the hypothesis that microscopic photoautotrophs are a major dietary target for grazing parrotfishes.

AB  - Insect-associated bacteria can mediate the intersection of insect and plant immunity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of single isolates or communities of gut-associated bacteria of Helicoverpa zea larvae on herbivore-induced defenses in tomato. We first identified bacterial isolates from the regurgitant of field-collected H. zea larvae by using a culture-dependent method and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We identified 11 isolates belonging to the families Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Yersiniaceae, Erwiniaceae, and unclassified Enterobacterales. Seven different bacterial isolates, namely Enterobacteriaceae-1, Lactococcus sp., Klebsiella sp. 1, Klebsiella sp. 3, Enterobacterales, Enterobacteriaceae-2, and Pantoea sp., were selected based on their phylogenetic relationships to test their impacts on insect-induced plant defenses. We found that the laboratory population of H. zea larvae inoculated with individual isolates did not induce plant anti-herbivore defenses, whereas larvae inoculated with a bacterial community (combination of the 7 bacterial isolates) triggered increased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in tomato, leading to retarded larval development. Additionally, field-collected H. zea larvae with an unaltered bacterial community in their gut stimulated higher plant defenses than the larvae with a reduced gut microbial community. In summary, our findings highlight the importance of the gut microbial community in mediating interactions between herbivores and their host plants.

AB  - Learning by observing others (i.e. social learning) is an important mechanism to reduce the costs of individual learning. Social learning can occur between conspecifics but also heterospecifics. Domestication processes might have changed the animals' sensitivity to human social cues and recent research indicates that domesticated species are particularly good in learning socially from humans. Llamas (Lama glama) are an interesting model species for that purpose. Llamas were bred as pack animals, which requires close contact and cooperative behaviour towards humans. We investigated whether llamas learn socially from trained conspecifics and humans in a spatial detour task. Subjects were required to detour metal hurdles arranged in a V-shape to reach a food reward. Llamas were more successful in solving the task after both a human and a conspecific demonstrated the task compared to a control condition with no demonstrator. Individual differences in behaviour (i.e. food motivation and distraction) further affected the success rate. Animals did not necessarily use the same route as the demonstrators, thus, indicating that they adopted a more general detour behaviour. These results suggest that llamas can extract information from conspecific and heterospecific demonstrations; hence, broadening our knowledge of domesticated species that are sensitive to human social behaviour.

AB  - The incorporation of quick fix pseudoranging (QFP) technology into global positioning system (GPS) collars has the potential to increase location-fix success for terrestrial species. Units enabled with QFP obtain the data necessary to calculate an accurate GPS location-fix during post-processing with just a 3-5 second view of a satellite constellation. Fix-success rate is one of the main sources of error in GPS telemetry studies, creating an inherent bias resulting in misleading data interpretations and incorrect inferences about habitat use. During winter 2017-2018, we captured 20 adult female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and fitted them with QFP-enabled GPS collars on 2 study areas (10/site) in northcentral and northeastern Minnesota, with an additional 40 collars (20/site) deployed during winter 2018-2019. Prior to deployment of the GPS collars on free-ranging deer, we conducted stationary tests to evaluate location-fix-success and spatial accuracy of 48 (of the 60) collars distributed among 4 different vegetative cover types. We recovered 100% of the expected 3,024 location-fixes during the stationary tests. The overall mean location error of the GPS collars was 5.7 m (+/- 0.15 [SE], range = 0-189 m), with errors in dense conifer (10.3 +/- 0.52, range = 0-189 m) being greater than in hardwood stands (6.2 +/- 0.22, range = 0-91 m), browse patches (3.2 +/- 0.08, range = 0-26 m), and openings (3.2 +/- 0.08, range = 0-32 m). Similarly, we evaluated the performance of 30 collars deployed on free-ranging deer. We deployed collars for a mean 79.5 days (+/- 7.22, range = 1.8-153.8 days) with a fix-success rate of 100% (34,758 location-fixes); QFP accounted for 11.3% of the 34,758 location-fixes. Our results suggest that the addition of QFP capabilities effectively increased fix-success of GPS collars on free-ranging deer by 11%. An increase in fix-success rate can be of considerable value to movement, distribution, and habitat selection studies, where bias associated with missing data can create unreliable or even false inferences.

AB  - Selection of the most stably expressed reference genes is key to monitoring accurate target gene expression across any tissue or cell type. The mRNA in spermatozoa stores valuable information related to changes in spermatogenesis due to variations in environmental conditions, especially during heat stress, which affects various sperm functions. Semen quality in buffalo bulls is significantly influenced by the seasons. In the study, a panel of nine genes was evaluated to identify the most stably expressed internal control gene (ICG) for the normalization of real-time gene expression data generated across various seasons for Murrah buffalo bulls' spermatozoa. Sperm cells were purified from the semen samples collected during different seasons, with temperature-humidity index (THI) ranging from 80.80 +/- 1.47 (hot summer) to 55.88 +/- 1.98 (winter), using the BoviPure (TM) gradient purification method. The RNA isolated from the purified spermatozoa fraction was quality checked prior to reverse transcription and subjected to qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) based expression analysis. An automated 'endoGene' pipeline was employed to apply the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms for data analysis. The result indicated that GAPDH and PP1A were the most stably expressed among the gene panel, whereas ATPSF1 and ACTB were the two least stable expressed reference genes. Further, the most suitable ICGs identified were validated by normalization of real time expression data of heat stress and sperm quality genes, HSFY2 and AKAP4, respectively. The genes identified would help in generating the most reliable results for the expression profiling of the genes dictating sperm quality and heat stress cope-up mechanism in buffalo spermatozoa, collected during different seasons.

AB  - Livestock contributes to global warming through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reducing these emissions is an ongoing challenge for the small ruminant sector. Despite its significant role in national economies, limited studies on the carbon footprint (CF) of dairy small ruminants in Mediterranean countries exist. The study aimed to achieve the following: (a) estimate the GHG emissions of eleven semi-extensive sheep and goat farms in a mountainous region of southern Greece, using the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodologies; (b) compare the outcomes of both methods; and (c) calculate farms' CF, as a means of their environmental impact evaluation. All on-farm activities (except machinery or medicine use) related to sheep or goat production were considered to estimate GHG emissions. The results show differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 estimates, reflecting the simplified computational approach of Tier 1. The average CF values estimated via Tier 1 for goat and sheep farms were 2.12 and 2.87 kg CO2-eq./kg FPCM, respectively. Using Tier 2, these values increased to 2.73 and 3.99 kg CO2-eq./kg FPCM. To mitigate environmental impact, farms could enhance productivity by improving herd management and feeding strategies.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the effect of different organic manures on the performance of toria crop and to understand their impact on the soil properties and availability of nutrients in acidic sandy loam soil.
   Methodology: Three-year fixed plot study was conducted with 7 treatments viz., T-1: control, T-2: recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), T-3: cow dung manure @ 5 t ha(-1) , T-4: pig dung manure @ 5 t ha(-1), T-5: goat dung manure @ 5 t ha(-)1 , T-6 : farm yard manure (FYM) @ 5 t ha(-1) , and T-7 : vermicompost @ 5 t ha(-1) replicating 3 times in a complete randomized block design. Data were collected and analysed following the standard procedures. The yield and yield attributing parameters of toria and the soil properties such as soil pH, organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and available NPK were studied.
   Results:Application of different organic manures significantly affected the plant height, number of primary branches per plant, number of siliquae per branch, number of seeds siliqua and 1000-seed weight of toria crop. Addition of organic manure significantly enhanced the soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and available NPK in the soil over initial, except soil pH. The cost of cultivation, gross return and net return varied from 10.50 x 10(3) to 23.10 x 10(3), 15.00 x 10(3) to 35.10 x 10(3) and 4.46 x 10(3) to 19.96 x 10(3) Rs. ha(-1), respectively. The B:C ratio varied in the order of goat dung manure > cow dung manure >RDF >FYM > pig dung manure > vermicompost > control treatment.
   Interpretation: nourishment of soil quality and health, application of vermicompost was confirmed to be the best over other organic sources of nutrients primarily due to enhancement in C and N status and an increase in microbial activities in soil.

AB  - Plant root activities lead to significant differences in metabolites between the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil, profoundly affecting microbial distribution. However, how this process drives the migration and propagation of manure-derived antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in farmland ecosystems remains unclear. Herein, we used a rice pot microcosm experiment to explore the characteristics of antibiotic resistome and bacterial communities in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils and the driving effects of rhizosphere metabolites on ARG propagation. The results showed significant differences in some ARGs and bacterial diversity in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils with varied differential ARGs between different growth stages of rice (P < 0.05). The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and glutathione metabolism were found to be the main pathways affecting ARG differences in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils under manure application. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis further indicated that ARG distribution differences between rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils were mainly regulated by differential metabolites, which influenced the ARG distribution by altering the succession of soil microbial communities. These results demonstrate the role of differential metabolites resulting from rice root activities in co-regulating ARG distribution, providing new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of soil ARG dynamics in paddy fields.

AB  - Mammals can use a variety of physiological mechanisms to adapt to changes in their environment. Thyroid hormones (THs) are key modulators of growth and mediators of environmental conditions by regulating developmental processes and metabolism in animals. In recent years, advancements in non-invasive sampling have allowed monitoring of the fluctuations of THs and their metabolites in wild mammals. Triiodothyronine (T3) represents the major metabolite of THs excreted in feces so that it can be monitored in fecal samples. In this study, fecal samples collected during the hunting season from legally culled European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; n = 160) were assayed to investigate the potential fluctuations of fecal TH metabolites (FTMs) in response to environmental (e.g., the temperature, local densities) and individual (e.g., sex, age, body, and nutritional conditions) variables. For this aim, we validated a TH enzyme immunoassay in the feces of roe deer. Our results show that FTMs can be successfully measured with satisfactory accuracy and precision. Extraction recovery (70%-120%), intra- and inter-day repeatability (<15%), linearity dilutions (80%-120%), and parallelism (<20%) were consistent with international guidelines. Environmental temperature (p < 0.001) showed a strong inverse correlation with FTM levels. THs can thus represent a reliable indicator in studying animals' adaptative responses to environmental temperature changes, providing perspectives for the study of the impact of climate change on ungulates and mammals. Further analyses, comparing samples collected all year round, are needed to investigate the correlations of TH values versus the other investigated variables.

AB  - In grassland ecosystems, fire plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological functioning but also causes substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Both climate and herbivory are key determinants of fire regimes, yet the relative importance of these factors remains debated. We focused on the steppes of Kazakhstan-one of the world's largest grasslands and a global fire hotspot-to assess the relative importance of climate and grazing patterns on fire regimes. Specifically, we made use of the natural experiment that the post-Soviet collapse of the Kazakh livestock sector provided. We used the MODIS Burned Area Product and calculated annual livestock grazing demand (required forage intake) from 2001 to 2019. We estimated a binomial mixed-effects model to extricate the impact of grazing demand and climate factors on fire occurrence. Our results show that fire regimes changed markedly on the Kazakh steppes, with exceptionally high fire frequencies and extent in the 2000s. We found a clearly negative association between grazing demand and burned area; in other words, more heavily grazed areas burned less frequently. Moreover, annual grazing demand appeared in more of the best-performing models than precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, or growing degree days. Given that livestock herding is declining in many grassland regions, and native grazers have been lost or greatly reduced in the past, our study highlights the increasing risk of fire with less grazing, but also the potential for grazing restoration to mitigate such risks in the world's grassland regions.

AB  - Globally, anthrax outbreaks pose a serious threat to people, livestock, and wildlife. Furthermore, environmental change can exacerbate these outbreak dynamics by altering the host-pathogen relationship. However, little is known about how the quantitative spatial dynamics of host movement and environmental change may affect the spread of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Here, we use real-time observations and high-resolution tracking data from a population of common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) in Tanzania to explore the relationship between river hydrology, H. amphibius movement, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active anthrax outbreak. We found that extreme river drying, a consequence of anthropogenic disturbances to our study river, indirectly facilitated the spread of B. anthracis by modulating H. amphibius movements. Our findings reveal that anthrax spread upstream in the Great Ruaha River (similar to 3.5 km over a 9-day period), which followed the movement patterns of infected H. amphibius, who moved upstream as the river dried in search of remaining aquatic refugia. These upstream movements can result in large aggregations of H. amphibius. However, despite these aggregations, the density of H. amphibius in river pools did not influence the number of B. anthracis-induced mortalities. Moreover, infection by B. anthracis did not appear to influence H. amphibius movement behaviors, which suggests that infected individuals can vector B. anthracis over large distances right up until their death. Finally, we show that contact rates between H. amphibius- and B. anthracis-infected river pools are highly variable and the frequency and duration of contacts could potentially increase the probability of mortality. While difficult to obtain, the quantitative insights that we gathered during a real-time anthrax outbreak are critical to better understand, predict, and manage future outbreaks.

AB  - Large carnivores are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities, and their protection is among the main goals of biodiversity conservation. The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) inhabits high-mountain landscapes where livestock depredation drives it into conflicts with local people and poses an obstacle for its conservation. Aims. The aim of this study was to identify the livestock groups most vulnerable to depredation, target them in implementation of practical interventions, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies for conflict mitigation. We present a novel attempt to evaluate intervention strategies for particularly vulnerable species, age groups, time, and seasons. Methods. In 2020, we conducted questionnaire surveys in two regions of the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal (Manang, n = 146 respondents and Upper Mustang, n = 183). We applied sample comparison testing, Jacobs' selectivity index, and generalised linear models (GLMs) to assess rates and spatio-temporal heterogeneity of depredation, reveal vulnerable livestock groups, analyse potential effects of applied intervention strategies, and identify husbandry factors relevant to depredation. Key results. Snow leopard predation was a major cause of livestock mortality in both regions (25.4-39.8%), resulting in an estimated annual loss of 3.2-3.6% of all livestock. The main intervention strategies (e.g. corrals during night-time and herding during daytime) were applied inconsistently and not associated with decreases in reported livestock losses. In contrast, we found some evidence that dogs, deterrents (light, music playing, flapping tape, and dung burning), and the use of multiple interventions were associated with a reduction in reported night-time depredation of yaks. Conclusions and implications. We suggest conducting controlled randomised experiments for quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of dogs, deterrents, and the use of multiple interventions, and widely applying the most effective ones in local communities. This would benefit the long-term co-existence of snow leopards and humans in the Annapurna region and beyond.

AB  - Small recreational boats are an omnipresent source of sound pollution in shallow coastal habitats, which can impact the behavior and physiology of a wide array of taxa. However, effective monitoring of this stressor is currently limited by a lack of tools. The present study coupled passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with timelapse imagery to provide a comprehensive analysis of sound pollution at two coastal sites varying in habitat structure: Goat (rocky reef) and Kawau (sandy bay) Islands. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to automatically count boats in each image, and the relationship between the soundscape and number of boats present was analysed using power spectral density and adaptive threshold analyses. Small boat activity was positively correlated with third octave level (TOL) root mean squared sound pressure levels (SPLRMS 63 - 5011 Hz), and this effect was frequency dependent, at both Goat (F-7,F-9704 = 5.665, p < 0.001) and Kawau (F-7,F-42488 = 325.33, p < 0.001) Islands. However, at Goat Island this interaction effect was driven by a significant difference between 63 Hz and all other TOLs (p < 0.05), whereas at Kawau Island the interaction effect of TOL and boat number was more variable. Furthermore, low frequency (similar to 50 - 300 Hz) biophony was found to influence the likelihood of boat sound being detected at Goat Island. Small boat impacts are contextual, likely due to habitat specific propagation conditions and the presence/absence of vocalising animals. As such, monitoring of sound pollution in coastal habitats requires a tailored approach which accounts for the localised nature of shallow coastal soundscapes. These findings demonstrate the potential for timelapse imagery to elucidate variability in boat sound, which may be particularly useful for remote sites which are ecologically rich, yet have no acoustic protections, such as many marine protected areas.

AB  - Consumers can directly (e.g., consumption) and indirectly (e.g., trophic cascades) influence carbon cycling in blue carbon ecosystems. Previous work found that large grazers have nuanced effects on carbon stocks, yet, small, bioturbating-grazers, which remove plant biomass and alter sediment properties, remain an understudied driver of carbon cycling. We used field-derived and remote sensing data to quantify how the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, influenced carbon stocks, flux, and recovery in salt marshes. Sesarma caused a 40%-70% loss in carbon stocks as fronts propagated inland (i.e., ungrazed to recovered transition), with front migration rates accelerating over time. Despite latitudinal differences, front migration rate had no effect on carbon stocks, flux, or time to replacement. When we included Sesarma disturbance in carbon flux calculations, we found it may take 5-100 years for marshes to replace lost carbon, if at all. Combined, we show that small grazers cause a net loss in carbon stocks as they move through the landscape, and irrespective of migration rate, these grazer-driven impacts persist for decades. This work showcases the significant role of consumers in carbon storage and flux, challenging the classic paradigm of plant-sediment feedbacks as the primary ecogeomorphic driver of carbon cycling in blue carbon ecosystems.

AB  - Human disturbance and development are fragmenting landscapes, limiting the ability of organisms to freely move to meet their survival and reproductive needs. Simultaneously, extreme weather events-such as tropical cyclones, megafires, and heatwaves-pose a major threat to survival and may require animals to rapidly move to escape. As the dual forces of landscape fragmentation and extreme weather events continue to intensify, researchers urgently need to develop an understanding of the synergistic effects of these forces on animal mobility and survival. Here, we present a case study on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) that undertook extraordinary long-distance movements (up to 399 km) to escape a once-in-two-decades extreme snowstorm in the Red Desert, WY, USA. Although Wyoming is a seemingly underdeveloped landscape, high fence density and two major highways in the region exposed pronghorn to novel barriers that delayed movement, restricted habitat access, and ultimately hindered their ability to escape extreme snow accumulation. The synergistic effects of movement barriers and extreme weather increased mortality rates by 3.7-fold such that over 50% of GPS-monitored pronghorn perished. These findings highlight the critical need to study escape movements and prioritize connectivity planning to curtail mass mortality events and ensure population persistence.

AB  - Background: Identifying factors shaping population genetic structure across continuous landscapes in the context of biogeographic boundaries for lineage diversification has been a challenging goal.The red muntjacs cover a wide range across multiple vegetation types, making the group an excellent model to study South and Southeast Asian biogeography. Therefore, we analysed mitogenomes and microsatellite loci, confirming the number of red muntjac lineages from India, gaining insights into the evolutionary history and phylogeography of red muntjacs.
   Results: Our results indicated the Northwestern population of red muntjac or the Himalayan red muntjac (M. aureus) in India as genetically diverse and well-structured, with significant genetic differentiation implying a low level of gene flow. The phylogenetic, population genetic structure, as well as species delimitation analyses, confirm the presence of the lineage from Western Himalayan in addition to the previously identified red muntjac lineages. Relatively low genetic diversity was observed in M. aureus compared to M. vaginalis, M. malabaricus and M. muntjak. The M. aureus and M. vaginalis lineages have split during the late Pleistocene,similar to 1.01 million years ago (Mya), making M. aureus the youngest lineage; whereas, M. malabaricus split earlier, similar to 2.2 Mya and appeared as the oldest lineage among red muntjacs.
   Conclusions: Pronounced climate fluctuations during the Quaternary period were pivotal in influencing the current spatial distribution of forest-dwelling species' restriction to Northwestern India. Our finding confirms the distinct Himalayan red muntjac (M. aureus) within the red muntjac group from Northwestern India that should be managed as an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). We recommend a reassessment of the conservation status of red muntjacs for effective conservation and management.

AB  - The Amazon is recognised as one of the most conserved tropical rainforests in the world. However, along its peripheral agricultural frontiers, mammal assemblages are gradually being eroded due to deforestation of this large area known as the Arc of Deforestation, particularly along the Amazon's southeast. In this study, we aimed to expand on the knowledge of richness, composition, and defaunation of mammal assemblages in two priority protected areas for biodiversity in the region: Cristalino State Park (hereafter Cristalino) and Xingu State Park (hereafter Xingu). We used camera traps and line transects for data collection between 2020 and 2021. Our results demonstrated that both protected areas support rich assemblages of medium- and large-sized mammals within the south-central Amazon (Cristalino-32 species, Xingu-30 species). Due to the differing vegetation types between each park, the two mammal assemblages showed significant differences in species composition. Even with one of the highest biomasses of large ungulates (tapir and brocket deer) and apex predators (jaguar and puma) compared to other protected areas in south-central Amazon, both areas showed a high biomass defaunation index relative to these same areas. The result is largely driven by the low abundance of peccaries, especially Tayassu pecari. This could be one of the impacts of extensive human pressure caused by deforestation and degradation around and inside these protected areas. Both parks play an important role in the survival of threatened mammals, and in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functionality in the southern Amazon, helping to curb agricultural expansion into the interior of the Amazon rainforest.
   A Amaz & ocirc;nia & eacute; reconhecida como uma das florestas tropicais mais bem preservadas do mundo. No entanto, ao longo de suas fronteiras agr & iacute;colas, as assembleias de mam & iacute;feros est & atilde;o sendo gradualmente erodidas devido ao desmatamento dessa grande regi & atilde;o conhecida como Arco do Desmatamento, particularmente ao longo do sudeste amaz & ocirc;nico. Neste estudo, nosso objetivo foi ampliar o conhecimento sobre a riqueza, a composi & ccedil;& atilde;o e a defauna & ccedil;& atilde;o dos mam & iacute;feros em duas unidades de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o priorit & aacute;rias para a biodiversidade na regi & atilde;o: o Parque Estadual do Cristalino e o Parque Estadual do Xingu. Usamos armadilhas fotogr & aacute;ficas e transectos lineares para a coleta de dados entre 2020 e 2021. Nossos resultados demonstraram que ambas as unidades de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o apresentam assembleias de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte ricas em esp & eacute;cies no centro-sul da Amaz & ocirc;nia (Cristalino - 32 esp & eacute;cies, Xingu - 30 esp & eacute;cies). Devido aos diferentes tipos de vegeta & ccedil;& atilde;o de cada parque, as duas assembleias de mam & iacute;feros apresentaram diferen & ccedil;as significativas na composi & ccedil;& atilde;o de esp & eacute;cies. Mesmo com uma das maiores biomassas de grandes ungulados (anta e veado-mateiro) e predadores de topo (on & ccedil;a-pintada e on & ccedil;a-parda) em compara & ccedil;& atilde;o com outras unidades de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o no centro-sul da Amaz & ocirc;nia, ambas as & aacute;reas apresentaram um alto & iacute;ndice de defauna & ccedil;& atilde;o de biomassa em rela & ccedil;& atilde;o a essas mesmas & aacute;reas. Este resultado, em grande parte, & eacute; causado pela baixa abund & acirc;ncia de pecar & iacute;deos, especialmente Tayassu pecari. Esse pode ser um dos impactos da extensa press & atilde;o humana causada pelo desmatamento e pela degrada & ccedil;& atilde;o ao redor e dentro dessas unidades de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o.

AB  - Large herbivores at northern latitudes often forage on agricultural farmland. In these populations, the presence of both resident and migrant individuals (termed partial migration) is common, but how migrants and residents differ in their selection of farmland is not well-understood. Higher access to farmland may provide benefits to residents compensating for not following the 'green wave' of emerging vegetation such as migrants. According to sexual segregation theory, males and females differ in body-size-related nutritional needs and risk sensitivity associated with farmland. Yet, how the sexes differ in the selection of farmland through an annual cycle remains unclear. We quantified seasonal variation in the selection of farmland by partially migratory red deer (Cervus elaphus) at broad, landscape scale and at fine, within-home range scale using 16 years of data (2005-2020) from 329 females and 115 males in Norway. We tested predictions related to the partial migration and sexual segregation theories using resource selection functions. We predicted higher selection for farmland by residents than by migrants, and higher selection by females than by males due to higher nutritional needs, but that higher perceived predation risk would impact their diurnal selection patterns. The time spent on farmland was higher in winter (14%-18%) than in summer (8%-14%). Residents selected farmland more than migrants mainly at broad, landscape scale, while differences were smaller and less consistent at a fine, within-home range scale. Females showed higher broad-scale selection for farmland in winter, whereas males showed higher selection in summer. At a fine, within-home range scale, females selected farmland more in summer during darkness, whereas sex differences were small otherwise. The fine-scale selection of farmland was markedly higher during low-light conditions than in daylight. A high population density index was correlated with high broad-scale selection of farmland, i.e. high farmland availability in the home ranges, whereas the effect of the density index was weak at a fine, within-home range scale. Our study emphasises how hypotheses deriving from the theories of partial migration and sexual segregation can improve our understanding of ungulates' selection of farmland. The higher selection by residents during summer highlights the importance of retaining landscape connectivity, allowing for migration and reducing pressure on local resources.

AB  - Extreme weather and climate events have become more frequent and directly affect the ecological structure and function of integrated grazing lands. While the Great Plains have experienced a long history of regular disturbances from drought and floods, grazing, and fires, the increased frequency and magnitude of these disturbances can reduce ecological resilience, largely depending on management practices. Alternative strategies designed to adaptively manage grazing land resources based on the ecology of the system should increase the resistance and resilience to disturbances when compared to prevailing practices. Determining the ecologic and economic value of alternative strategies will require long-term evaluations across large spatial scales. The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network has been established to evaluate the differences between alternative and prevailing practices among 18 strategically located sites and across decadal time scales throughout the continental United States. A key integrated grazing land site within this network is the Texas Gulf located at the Riesel Watersheds in the Blackland Prairie of Central Texas. At this study site, the differences between alternative and prevailing grazing management strategies are now being evaluated. The alternative strategy was designed using a combination of knowledge of the site and species ecology with modern-day tools and technologies. Alternatively, the prevailing practice implements a conventional year-round continuous grazing system with heavy reliance on hay and supplemental protein during winter. Results will provide grazing land managers with economically viable adaptive management choices for increasing ecological resilience following extreme and frequent disturbance events.
   Ecological structure and function of integrated grazing lands are directly affected by frequent and extreme weather events. The Texas Gulf is a key area to test alternative versus prevailing grazing management because of the grazing history. Alternative grazing management strategies should increase the resistance and resilience to these disturbances. Since pasturelands function differently than rangelands, quantifying how grazing strategies differ is essential.
   Although the Great Plains have experienced a long history of regular disturbances from drought and floods, grazing, and fires, the increased frequency and magnitude of these disturbances can reduce ecological resilience, largely depending on management practices. Alternative grazing land management strategies designed to adaptively manage grazing land resources based on the ecology of the system should increase the resistance and resilience to disturbances when compared to prevailing practices. Determining the ecologic and economic value of alternative strategies will require long-term evaluations across large spatial scales. The purpose of this paper is to outline the Long-Term Agroecosystem Texas Gulf integrated grazing study that compared alternative versus prevailing management practices across decadal time scales.

AB  - The ongoing "toilet revolution" in China provides new opportunities to improve the rural living environment and sanitation, and the introduction of new sanitation facilities such as urine diverting composting toilets (UDCTs) is conducive to the effective treatment and resource utilization of feces. This study revealed the degradation performance and microbial community dynamics of UDCTs and clarified the influence mechanism of fecal volume in aerobic composting treatment. The results showed that UDCTs could effectively decompose human feces, with an organic matter degradation rate of 25% 30%. The temperature, water content, NH4+-N and nutrient accumulation were higher in the high fecal volume treatment than in the low fecal volume treatment. Bacterial community composition and structure in UDCTs varied with composting stage and fecal volume. The diversity and richness of bacterial community in compost were changed with different fecal volumes, but the dominant groups were similar. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that nitrogen and organic carbon were the main drivers of bacterial community changes during composting. Highly nutritious and non-phytotoxic compost products were suitable for agronomic uses. Based on these results, UDCTs can be an effective way to solve the problem of fecal pollution in rural areas, and fecal dosage is a potential influencing factor in the operation and maintenance of composting systems.

AB  - Maternal deprivation early in life has been shown to disrupt neonates' development. Nevertheless, separating the young animals from their dams soon after birth remains a common practice in dairy farm husbandry. This study investigated the effects of different rearing conditions on goat kids' stress coping abilities. Twenty female kids were raised together with their dams ('dam-reared') in a herd composed of other lactating goats and kids, while twenty female kids were separated from their dams three days after birth and reared together with same-age peers ('artificially-reared') and visually separated from the lactating herd. All kids shared the same father and two thirds of the kids were twins allocated to each treatment. At one month of age, kids were individually submitted to a series of tests: a novel arena test, a novel goat test, and a novel object test. These tests happened consecutively in this order, and lasted 180 s each. The kids' behaviour was video-recorded and analysed post-hoc by an observer blind to treatments. Five weeks after weaning, the kids were also subjected to human-animal relationship tests. During the three behavioural tests, artificially-reared kids vocalized more (P < 0.001), reared more (P < 0.001), ran more (P = 0.002) and jumped more (P < 0.001) than dam-reared kids, but self-groomed less (P = 0.01) and urinated less (P = 0.05) than dam-reared kids. During the novel goat test and the novel object test, artificially-reared kids gazed less at the novel goat and the novel object (P = 0.02) and initiated contact more quickly (P = 0.05) with the novel goat and the novel object than dam-reared kids. The treatments however did not differ significantly in salivary cortisol response to the tests (P = 0.96). Artificially-reared kids showed significantly less avoidance of humans than dam-reared kids during the human-animal relationship tests after weaning (P < 0.001). The higher intensity of their behavioural reaction showed that artificially-reared kids react to stressful situations more actively than dam-reared kids. The difference between the three tests were only minor, suggesting a general change in the kids' response to stressful situations rather than a specific change in their social response tested with an unfamiliar adult. Hence, artificial rearing affects goat kids' behavioural response to challenges, probably maternal deprivation being the main factor.

AB  - Climate warming has significantly altered the phenology of plants in recent decades. However, in contrast to the widely reported warming-induced extension of vegetative growing season, the response of fruit development period (FDP) from flowering to fruiting remains largely unexplored, particularly for woody plants. Analyzing >560,000 in situ observations of both flowering and fruiting dates for six temperate woody species across 2958 European phenological observations sites during 1980-2013, we found that in all species both flowering and fruiting phenology, that is, the FDP, advanced with climate warming. However, the advancing rates of the two events were not necessarily equal for any given species, resulting in divergent changes in the length of FDP among species with climate warming. During 1980-2013, not only the temperature during FDP but also the forcing requirement for fruit development increased, both affecting the length of FDP. The shortened FDP was mainly due to elevated temperature, thus accelerating the accumulation of forcing, whereas the prolonged FDP was primarily caused by the substantial increase of the forcing requirement of fruiting, which could be fulfilled only in a longer time and thus slowed down the advance of fruiting. This study provides large-scale empirical evidence of warming-induced advances of FDP but divergent changes in its length in temperate woody species. Our findings demonstrate the contrasting reproductive phenological strategies among temperate woody species under the pressure of warming climate, contrary to the lengthening of vegetative growing season, which is by and largely similar with different woody species.

AB  - Transhumant pastoralism guided by traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) helps people in adapting to extreme biophysical conditions and remoteness in the high-altitude region of the western Himalaya. However, the age-old practice is currently under threat due to changes in socioeconomic, policy and environmental conditions, which may lead to erosion of pastoralism-related TEK. This study was undertaken to document traditional knowledge concerning transhumant pastoralism of the Kinnaura community in three high-altitude villages, namely Chhitkul, Rakchham and Batseri in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation methods. A total of 38 key informants were interviewed to elicit information about the contemporary practices and TEK related to transhumant pastoralism. The study found that the transhumant pastoralism is not only intricately linked to sociocultural life but also contribute significantly to the livelihood of Kinnaura community and hired herders. Findings revealed that the pastoralists are the repository of vast knowledge on various aspects of sheep- and goat-based transhumance, viz. herd composition and management, grazing and supplementary feeding and ethnoveterinary practices. It is concluded that the study would help policy decisions for the preservation and protection of transhumant pastoralism-related TEK of the indigenous Kinnaura pastoralists. Further, considering the nexus between TEK and ecosystem services, this study would also contribute in well-being of the human society and resilience of the similar social-ecological systems.

AB  - Understanding the forces that drive genotypic and phenotypic change in wild populations is a central goal of evolutionary biology. We examined exome variation in populations of deer mice from two of the California Channel Islands: Peromyscus maniculatus elusus from Santa Barbara Island and P. m. santacruzae from Santa Cruz Island exhibit significant differences in olfactory predator recognition, activity timing, aggressive behavior, morphology, prevalence of Sin Nombre virus, and population densities. We characterized variation in protein-coding regions using exome capture and sequencing of 25 mice from Santa Barbara Island and 22 mice from Santa Cruz Island. We identified and examined 386,256 SNPs using three complementary methods (BayeScan, pcadapt, and LFMM). We found strong differences in molecular variation between the two populations and 710 outlier SNPs in protein-coding genes that were detected by all three methods. We identified 35 candidate genes from this outlier set that were related to differences in phenotypes between island populations. Enrichment analyses demonstrated that patterns of molecular variation were associated with biological processes related to response to chemical stimuli and regulation of immune processes. Candidate genes associated with olfaction (Gfy, Tlr2, Vmn13r2, numerous olfactory receptor genes), circadian activity (Cry1), anxiety (Brca1), immunity (Cd28, Eif2ak4, Il12a, Syne1), aggression (Cyp19a, Lama2), and body size (Bc16, Syne1) exhibited non-synonymous mutations predicted to have moderate to large effects. Variation in olfaction-related genes, including a stop codon in the Santa Barbara Island population, suggests loss of predator-recognition traits at the molecular level, consistent with a lack of behavioral aversion to fox feces. These findings also suggest that divergent pathogen prevalence and population density may have influenced adaptive immunity and behavioral phenotypes, such as reduced aggression. Overall, our study indicates that ecological differences between islands are associated with signatures of selection in protein-coding genes underlying phenotypes that promote success in those environments.

AB  - Coexistence of people and wildlife outside protected areas is of critical conservation importance. However, human-wildlife interactions on shared landscapes can produce negative outcomes for wildlife populations and people. This article focuses on the effects of wildlife on local people's lived experiences of physical safety in the Tarangire ecosystem of northern Tanzania. The Tarangire ecosystem supports a diverse array of wildlife species of global conservation significance, encompassing several national parks, community-based conservation areas, forest reserves, and trophy hunting blocks. From the perspectives of local agropastoral Maasai communities, coexisting with wildlife is a routine part of everyday life, though some species are dangerous and pose threats to physical safety. These human security concerns compound the economic impacts of wildlife on local livelihoods, manifest in the forms of crop raiding, livestock depredation, and property damage. Based on mixed qualitative methods including ethnographic fieldwork (2019-2020; 2022; 2023), participant observation, household surveys (n = 1076), and in-depth interviews (n = 240), this paper identifies the species of particular concern to communities. Elephants, spotted hyenas, buffalo, and lions pose significant threats to human security. Venomous snakes and leopards are also safety concerns, but to a lesser degree. The anthropological dimensions of these threats to physical safety are underrepresented in the literature on human-wildlife conflict. This paper spotlights three recent incidents of people being killed by wildlife (elephant, hyena, and lion) in the area, and the psychosocial consequences that have since rippled across local communities. People expressed feelings of fear, resentment, anger, grief, and insecurity born of their experiences coexisting with large nondomestic mammals. Wildlife attacks on people engender material and emotional impacts with traumatic aftereffects. These human dimensions of wildlife are significant for equity reasons in and of themselves, and also for environmental sustainability as they affect people's tolerance for living with wildlife. Greater attention to the lived experiences of local people is needed to improve conservation practice in northern Tanzania.

AB  - Estimates of sex- and age-specific survival are important for guiding population management decisions for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, differences in deer survival between public and private lands can exist and, if unaccounted for, may affect wildlife agencies' ability to effectively manage statewide and local deer populations. From 2014 to 2016, we radiocollared and monitored survival of 79 adult white-tailed deer (141 deer-years; 62 male, 79 female) on 2 public and 2 private properties in Alabama, USA. We assessed the effects of sex, age, and landownership type (i.e., public or private) on adult white-tailed deer harvest and survival patterns using an information-theoretic approach. Hunter harvest accounted for 77% of observed mortalities (n = 23/30), but harvest and survival rates varied by sex and age. Harvest and survival were similar between public and private property despite more restrictive hunting regulations for antlered deer on public areas. Similar harvest rates were likely due to self-imposed, quality deer management (QDM) harvest strategies on private land that emulated the effects of a state-mandated antler point restriction (APR) on public land. Our findings indicate survival rates of adult white-tailed deer may be applicable across landownership types where state-mandated harvest regulations with respect to males are more restrictive on public than private property, due to the popularity of QDM by private-land deer hunters. However, where regulations are similar across landownership types (e.g., no state-mandated APR), differences in harvest and survival rates may exist.

AB  - Exploring the impact of diet-derived gut microbiota on insect growth and development holds significant value not only for understanding the "diet-gut microbes-insects" interactions, but also for forensic entomology, as it lays the research foundation for clarifying the relationships among "cadavers-microbes-necrophagous insects". This study investigates the effects of pig manure-derived gut microbiota on the growth and development of Sarcophaga africa, a key necrophagous insect. Our findings demonstrate that, compared to pig lung, pig manure significantly increased larval amount without affecting adult eclosion rates, thereby facilitating laboratory population establishment and accelerating development. Through microbial sequencing, key target bacteria were identified and validated using quantitative detection and antibiotic interference experiments. The results highlight two critical aspects: first, dietary microbes play a central role in shaping the gut microbial community structure of larvae; second, gut microbes derived from pig manure, particularly Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, may enhance the developmental process of S. africa by directly increasing protein levels in 3rd instar larvae and indirectly reducing glycogen levels in late pupae. Additionally, developmental data for S. africa at 30 degrees C were obtained to establish reference values for forensic applications using necrophagous insects in postmortem interval estimation. These findings highlight the need for forensic entomologists to consider how microbial-driven developmental variations may affect the reliability of developmental data in such studies.

AB  - Buffalo nut (Cervantesiaceae; Pyrularia pubera Michx.) is a unique facultative hemiparasitic species that can reproduce clonally or sexually. Fragmented population stands of buffalo nut in Pennsylvania, USA, represent the northern-most range of distribution of the species. These leading-edge populations could be the originators for new stands expected to arise as climate change shifts this species' native range further north. When observing an isolated stand of buffalo nut, it is impossible to be sure if individual trees are clones of a common parental plant or the product of sexual reproduction. Our study represents the first attempt to use population genetic methodologies to determine the genetic relatedness of individual plants in fragmented stands, and to assess the genetic diversity of native buffalo nut populations in North America. Our study used microsatellite markers to compare genetic variation in samples from populations in Pennsylvania to samples collected in other populations in the northern end of its range (i.e., West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia). We found 1) that trees could not be located at most sites, and 2) that Pennsylvania populations are largely clonal with little genetic diversity among locations within the state (similar to 200 km(2)) relative to populations sampled in Kentucky and Virginia. We provide best practice suggestions for conservation of this species.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity can modify the distribution of species abundance in a community leading to the appearance of new dominant species. While many studies report that an alien plant species which becomes increasingly dominant can change species composition, plant-pollinator network structure and the reproductive output of native plant species, much less is known about native plant species which become dominant in their communities.
   Euphorbia jolkinii Boissier (Euphorbia, hereafter) has become a dominant native plant in the over-grazed meadows of Shangri-La, SW China. During the flowering season of Euphorbia and over 2 years, we quantified the impact of Euphorbia on plant richness and flower visitor richness in 12 subalpine meadows along a gradient of Euphorbia dominance. We also evaluated the floral preferences of flower visitors, interaction evenness of plant-flower visitor networks and the deposition of pollen on the stigmas of two co-flowering plant species (Gentiana chungtienensis and Anemone rupestris) in each meadow.
   The species richness of flower visitors to non-Euphorbia plants was negatively correlated with Euphorbia dominance. As the proportion of Euphorbia increases, flower visitors to Euphorbia decreased, while flower visitors to other co-flowering plants increased. Interaction evenness decreased as the proportion of Euphorbia increased. Furthermore, the conspecific pollen deposition of one of the two co-flowering plant species studied, G. chungtienensis, decreased as the proportion of Euphorbia increased.
   Synthesis. There appears to be little substantive difference between the impact of a newly dominant native plant and the impacts reported for many alien plants on native plant-pollinator communities. This lack of difference suggests that dominance, in addition to plant origin (alien vs. native), could play an important role in influencing the structure and functioning of native communities. This finding has considerable implications for restoration ecology. Thus, communities where natural dominance order has been changed due to anthropogenic activity may not be considered a problem as all the species are native-in reality though, they may be as damaged as communities invaded by alien species.

AB  - Phenotypic diversity and abundance drive salmon resilience in the face of increasing environmental variability. But what happens when human activities fundamentally alter the habitat complexity that drives this diversity? And how can we restore habitats to recover both diversity and abundance to support salmon persistence in a warming climate? Here, we looked at the impact of a large watershed restoration effort on the abundance and climate resilience of the three remaining core natural spring-run Chinook Salmon populations in the California Central Valley (Butte, Mill, and Deer Creek). Butte Creek fish, which have floodplain access, had higher overall productivity and faster juvenile growth compared with Mill and Deer Creek populations, and the proportion of floodplain inundation was positively correlated with Butte Creek adult abundance two years later. While Butte Creek exhibited significant increases in abundance post-restoration (similar to 000%), it generally exhibited lower phenotypic diversity and only a marginal increase in population stability after restoration based on the coefficient of variation (CV). In particular, Butte Creek salmon tended to exhibit larger drops in escapement following dry years (e.g., return years 2010, 2017) compared with Mill and Deer Creek populations, presumably due to limited inundation of its downstream floodplain. The late-migrating juvenile strategy (i.e., yearling), which disproportionately supported Mill and Deer Creek populations during droughts, was uncommon among Butte Creek adults (averaging 60% of returns for Mill and Deer Creek vs. 0.3% for Butte Creek). Increased spring-run stock complex stability was found, post-restoration, when combining the three spring-run populations (i.e., lower aggregate CV). However, among-river pairwise correlations also suggested increased synchronization in population abundances post-restoration, potentially due to increasing frequency and severity of extreme climatic events (e.g., droughts and ocean warming). This study underscores the importance of restoring a connected mosaic of aquatic habitats across modified landscapes, such as cold water refugia and floodplains, to preserve multiple (across-population) life history pathways for increasing salmon stock complex stability and abundance. These landscape-scale process-based habitat restoration efforts are likely to be crucial for the successful long-term recovery of vulnerable species in a rapidly changing climate.

AB  - Fisheries-independent surveys are a critical tool for monitoring marine populations and communities. However, considerations must be made to account for variable-size-based catchability. The size-specific catchability function is therefore key for estimating size distributions, but often requires extensive data sets or specialized field experiments to determine. We develop a Bayesian model capable of simultaneously estimating both a size-based catchability curve and species-specific size spectrum parameters from trawl data by assuming that individual species size spectra follow a theoretically derived parametric size spectrum model. The resulting model provides a means of estimating catchability and size spectra within an adaptive framework capable of accommodating confounding factors such as vessel power and fish density, potentially allowing for improved biomass and productivity estimates. We demonstrate the application of this model using 15 years of Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) survey data from Nunavut to determine size-specific catchabilities and assess whether the size spectrum of Greenland Halibut has changed across the time series. While size spectrum parameters for this stock were not found to vary, we did find evidence of time-varying catchability parameters across the study period.

AB  - Although nuclear power plant accidents have raised concerns about the genetic consequences of radiation exposure, no studies have successfully compared the DNA of wild animals before and after the accident in the same area around a nuclear power plant. Here, we investigated 12 microsatellites of Japanese wild boar in the Fukushima prefecture before and after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. A population structure analysis of the microsatellites revealed that wild boar of the 4 prefectures of North Kanto were divided into 5 populations before the nuclear accident. Yet, wild boar sampled after the nuclear accident did not belong to any of these 5 populations. The reason for this result was related to significant changes in the composition of microsatellites after the nuclear accident; on average, 90% of post-accident microsatellite alleles were newly emergent in Fukushima prefecture. In samples obtained before the nuclear accident, each microsatellite had either even or odd-length alleles. Yet, in samples obtained after the nuclear accident, most microsatellites had alleles of both even and odd lengths. Moreover, we examined haplotypes and their frequencies in the mitochondrial DNA control region, and found no significant differences before and after the nuclear accident in both Fukushima and Tochigi prefectures, and no haplotypes were distributed only in distant areas suggesting an influx of wild boar after the nuclear accident. This research suggested that the change in microsatellites was a result of microsatellite instability rather than a result of the migration of wild boar from other areas. This research provides important insights into the effects of a nuclear accident on mammals.

AB  - Key message Melolontha hippocastani is a major pest in European mixed and broadleaf forests. Investigating its oviposition behavior, we observed that a dense shrub layer reduces the density of egg clusters and eggs in the soil. Conversely, canopy openness and a large proportion of oak appear as favoring conditions.
   Context Melolontha hippocastani is a major pest in European mixed and broadleaf forests. In north-eastern France, an epidemic phase has been observed since 2007, characterized by a high mortality rate of seedlings and young trees, and by massive swarming flights every 4 years.
   Aims We investigated the oviposition behavior of M. hippocastani in the northern Vosges Mountains.
   Methods We set up study plots in the infected area after adults had emerged and the females had laid their eggs. We excavated pits and counted the eggs and egg clusters they contained. We also carried out dendrometric surveys.
   Results A dense shrub layer had a negative effect on the density of egg clusters and the number of eggs in the soil, while canopy openness and the proportion of oak basal area had positive effects.
   Conclusion We hypothesized that a dense shrub layer could create a barrier for females. On the other hand, an open canopy may improve conditions for the larvae in the soil, just as a high proportion of oak trees in the surrounding area may provide a good food source for both larvae and adults. Wesuggest several research orientations and propose guidelines for forest management in view of our results.

AB  - Climate variability and change pose a major challenge to rain-fed agriculture in Africa. Extreme weather events are projected to continue affecting African drylands. Thus, it is essential to assess how rural farming communities in marginal environments are adapting to environmental changes. Specifically, there is need to assess local adaptations that can help enhance the resilience of socio-economic and environmental systems. This study identifies the current status, main challenges and opportunities of pasture farming for climate change adaptation among smallholder farmers in a semi-arid dryland in Kenya. It combines household and key informant interviews and participatory methods. Agropastoral farmers in the studied area are establishing native perennial pastures, where species selection is largely influenced by its forage value. Although agropastoral farmers have adopted pasture farming, they still face multiple challenges including climatic factors, lack of sufficient knowledge and information, limited access to markets, high cost and low availability of native grass seed, destruction of grazing herbivores and seed predation. Adopting strategies like low cost irrigation systems and agricultural technologies, cooperatives development and policy formulation to facilitate easy access of inputs and relevant markets has great potential to increase local resilience to environmental change and contribute to achieving wider development goals. Thus, policy makers should prioritize formulating climate adaptation policies and programmes that will promote diversification of livelihoods and support local climate adaptation strategies among farming communities in African drylands.

AB  - The hangul Cervus hanglu hanglu, a Critically Endangered mountain ungulate of Jammu and Kashmir, India, faces the imminent threat of population loss and extinction. Effective management of its largest viable population in Dachigam National Park in the Kashmir Himalaya requires reliable demographic information. Using 14 microsatellite markers we identified 293 individuals (208 females and 85 males) through faecal analysis, and generated data on the genetic status and population size of the hangul in its winter habitat. The mean expected and observed heterozygosities of 0.62 and 0.59 are comparable to those of several red deer Cervus elaphus populations elsewhere. The effective population sizes were 46.3 and 93.7 when the frequencies of rare alleles were considered to be 0.050 and 0.010, respectively. The average mean kinship of the population was 0.34, and there was no evidence of a recent bottleneck event. In genetic mark-recapture analysis the best model included an effect of sex on both detection and recapture probabilities. Detection of males was highest in November, coinciding with the hangul breeding season, whereas detection of females was highest in December. Our estimate of the hangul population using genetic mark-recapture with bootstrapping was 394 individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use genetic data to estimate the population of the hangul. It will guide future studies of this subspecies and also serve as an impetus for identifying founder animals for captive breeding, and for connecting the population in Dachigam National Park with the other small, isolated populations to ensure the long-term survival of this subspecies.

AB  - Gaining a more complete understanding of a species' dietary variability is crucial to properly discern distribution, population growth trends, and conservation actions. Endangered mountain gorillas live in topographically complex forests covering a wide elevational range and diverse habitat matrices. Since 1967, mountain gorillas have been studied at high elevations in the southwest of the Volcanoes National Park (VNP) in Rwanda, where groups use different compositions of habitats and have been growing at higher rates than groups in the northeast VNP region, which is characterized by lower elevations. Building on previous efforts, we describe dietary variability among VNP mountain gorilla groups by integrating data from groups ranging in the northeast VNP. We assessed and compared nutritional components of key foods (making up 80% of the diet) to better understand whether variation in diet quality could be linked to within-population growth differences. Feeding and ranging data were collected between November 2019 and December 2022, using long-term monitoring data, group scans, and focal animal sampling. To compare diet quality, we combined nutritional values from newly collected food plants and previously collected and assessed food plant samples using comparable field and laboratory methods. We recorded 57 new foods for the study population. Groups in the southwest (N = 8) and the northeast (N = 4) regions of VNP used different vegetation zones, and there was high dietary variability with low diet overlap among these regions. Although northeast groups rely on more diverse diets, key foods (making up similar to 80% of the diet) had comparable nutrient concentrations to southwest groups. This suggests that diet quality is unlikely to be a main driver of observed heterogeneous population growth. For follow-up research, we discuss alternative explanations linked to food distribution, biomass, and energy expenditure to access foods. Our findings add important information for future habitat suitability assessments essential for mountain gorilla conservation management and habitat restoration and expansion efforts.

AB  - Wild ruminants are susceptible to infection from generalist helminth species, which can also infect domestic ruminants. A better understanding is required of the conditions under which wild ruminants can act as a source of helminths (including anthelmintic-resistant genotypes) for domestic ruminants, and vice versa, with the added possibility that wildlife could act as refugia for drug-susceptible genotypes and hence buffer the spread and development of resistance. Helminth infections cause significant productivity losses in domestic ruminants and a growing resistance to all classes of anthelmintic drug escalates concerns around helminth infection in the livestock industry. Previous research demonstrates that drug-resistant strains of the pathogenic nematode Haemonchus contortus can be transmitted between wild and domestic ruminants, and that gastro-intestinal nematode infections are more intense in wild ruminants within areas of high livestock density. In this article, the factors likely to influence the role of wild ruminants in helminth infections and anthelmintic resistance in livestock are considered, including host population movement across heterogeneous landscapes, and the effects of climate and environment on parasite dynamics. Methods of predicting and validating suspected drivers of helminth transmission in this context are considered based on advances in predictive modelling and molecular tools.

AB  - Cross-ecosystem nutrient fluxes can influence recipient food webs, including both static measures of structure and dynamic measures of function. However, a mechanistic basis for how nutrient subsidies affect both structure and function across multiple trophic levels is still lacking. Here, we investigate how nutrient subsidies provided by seabirds influence coral reefs, focusing on the link between primary producers and primary consumers. We quantified turf algal cover and herbivorous fish biomass (static metrics of structure), as well as productivity of turf algae and herbivorous fish (dynamic metrics of function) at sites in the inner Seychelles with a range of seabird densities due to different rat invasion histories. Turf algae grew faster with increasing amounts of seabird-derived nutrients. These higher rates of primary productivity, in turn, fueled higher productivity and biomass of herbivorous fishes. In contrast, seabird-derived nutrients did not increase cover of turf algae nor did turf algal cover affect herbivores. Instead, seabird nutrients indirectly enhanced herbivorous fish productivity and biomass via effects on primary productivity, which, in turn, led to increased top-down control by herbivores to limit turf algal cover. Overall, dynamic metrics better revealed the flow and effects of seabird-derived nutrients through coral-reef food chains and revealed the mechanisms by which seabirds can enhance coral-reef ecosystem function. These findings could be used to predict the benefits of removing introduced rats from islands, which can increase seabird populations and restore nutrient connectivity, thus potentially enhancing ecosystem function across multiple trophic levels on coral reefs.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations and deer hunter participation on federal public lands within the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States have been declining over the last 30 years. Our study focused on Chattahoochee National Forest hunters in North Georgia, a region that has sustained a 64% decline in buck harvest success rates and 68% decline in hunter participation during 1979-2018. To better understand factors influencing satisfaction of remaining hunters, we sent mail questionnaires to 1,271 hunters in February 2019. We received 441 completed questionnaires for a 36% adjusted response rate. First, we used principal component analysis to identify 4 unique motivations for deer hunting: 1) escaping the daily routine and spending time outdoors, 2) harvesting deer for food, 3) socializing with hunting partners, and 4) harvesting trophy bucks. Second, we used ordinal logistic regression, which indicated that perception of a low deer population density was associated with lower levels of satisfaction. Perception of the right number of hunters on the landscape was associated with higher levels of satisfaction. In addition, greater importance ratings of harvesting trophy bucks were associated with lower satisfaction levels. Last, we applied revised importance-performance analysis to 19 aspects of WMA deer hunting, which revealed that managers should focus on increasing opportunities for hunters to see deer and harvest bucks for the best chance at improving hunter satisfaction. Considering the 64% decline in harvest success rates between 1979 and 2018, the positive relationship between hunter satisfaction and perception of deer density, and hunter desires to see more deer and have more opportunities to harvest bucks, we recommend managing the deer population to increase numbers. Overall, our findings suggested that hunters and managers agree on the direction of deer management on North Georgia public lands for the near future. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The rapid expansion of tea plantations (Camellia sinensis), which replace local natural forests, decreases the water conservation function in the headwater region and threatens regional water security. However, studies focusing on the comprehensive evaluation and improvement of the water conservation function of natural forests and tea plantations are lacking. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation method for the water conservation function by investigating, monitoring, and conducting process model simulations of 221 tea plantation and natural forest (bamboo forest) samples obtained in the field. We also quantified the trade-off between water conservation and carbon sequestration. The results showed that the tea plantations had lower annual water conservation than the bamboo forests. Slope was the most critical influential variable affecting water conservation in tea plantations. Strict control should be exercised in the development of steep slopes above 20 degrees for tea plantations, to enhance the regional water conservation capacity. Water conservation in bamboo forests increased to the maximum level at a planting density (SD) of approximately 2500-2700 tree/ha and then decreased quickly. The optimal SD values of bamboo forests were 2500, 2600, and 2650 trees/ha at slopes of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees, respectively, which can maintain higher water conservation and adequate carbon sequestration. Overall, water conservation and carbon sequestration increased by approximately 22.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared with the average values for bamboo forests. However, at slopes >20 degrees, a strong trade-off was observed between water conservation and carbon sequestration, and competing ecosystem services accompanied those, which were hard to balance and which resulted here in disproportionate water conservation at the cost of carbon sequestration loss.

AB  - The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former 'apicum' area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.

Secretion and excretion of prion infectivity from North American cervids with this condition causes environmental contamination and subsequent efficient lateral transmission in free-ranging and farmed cervids. Variants of cervid PrP exist that affect host susceptibility to chronic wasting disease. Cervid breeding programmes aimed at increasing the frequency of PrP variants associated with resistance to chronic wasting disease may reduce the burden of this condition in animals and lower the risk of zoonotic disease. This strategy requires a relatively rapid and economically viable model system to characterise and support selection of prion disease-modifying cervid PrP variants. Here, we generated cervid PrP transgenic Drosophila to fulfil this purpose. We have generated Drosophila transgenic for S138 wild type cervid PrP, or the N138 variant associated with resistance to chronic wasting disease. We show that cervid PrP Drosophila accumulate bona fide prion infectivity after exposure to cervid prions. Furthermore, S138 and N138 PrP fly lines are susceptible to cervid prion isolates from either North America or Europe when assessed phenotypically by accelerated loss of locomotor ability or survival, or biochemically by accumulation of prion seeding activity. However, after exposure to European reindeer prions, N138 PrP Drosophila accumulated prion seeding activity with slower kinetics than the S138 fly line. These novel data show that prion susceptibility characteristics of cervid PrP variants are maintained when expressed in Drosophila, which highlights this novel invertebrate host in modelling chronic wasting disease.

AB  - Predation on livestock presents a daunting challenge for human-carnivore coexistence in agricultural landscapes. In Germany, the recolonization of wolves is ongoing and its consequences are insufficiently understood. Knowledge about which livestock species are susceptible to wolf predation, which farm types are predisposed to attacks by wolves, and when predation on livestock occurs is valuable for mitigating stakeholder conflicts. To this end, we analyzed 14 years of monitoring data and assessed the livestock prey spectrum, identified correlates between predation on livestock, farm type and livestock category, and described temporal patterns of livestock loss caused by a recolonizing wolf population in the state of Brandenburg (Germany). Among a total of 1387 recorded cases, 42% were unequivocally attributed to wolves (SCALP criteria C1 and C2) and 12% of cases were not caused by wolves. The number of head of livestock killed during a single wolf attack was mediated by farm type and livestock species; losses per event were greater in full-time farms vs. other farm types and greater in sheep, farmed deer and other livestock species, compared to cattle. While sheep were the most commonly killed livestock species, the increase in wolf territories over the investigation period was associated with a widening of the domestic prey species spectrum. Count regression models provided evidence for the increasing frequency of predation events over the 14-year period, along with an exponential increase in wolf territories. Predation on livestock occurred throughout the year, yet seasonality of events was evident and differed across livestock categories. Predation on sheep peaked in the fall, coinciding with the post-weaning period of wolf offspring. Predation on cattle peaked in the spring, coinciding with the cattle calving period. These results call for renewed investment in the implementation of prevention methods for all susceptible domestic species, particularly during times of elevated predation risk.

AB  - Compensatory wetland restoration is a critical component of holistic, ecosystem-level oil spill response strategies. An important goal of restoration is to rehabilitate food webs in impacted areas, but faunal assemblages and trophic dynamics are rarely included in post-restoration monitoring or assessments of success. Different approaches to wetland restoration, including variations in construction technique, may influence faunal recovery and trophic interactions. To explore these dynamics, we compared emergent plant communities, terrestrial arthropod assemblages, and trophic interactions in restored emergent marshes that were constructed in terrace and mound configurations and in reference areas in the Lower Neches Wildlife Management Area (Texas, United States). Plant community composition differed among all habitat types, with higher diversity on terraces and in reference marshes. Terrestrial arthropod abundance was similar among habitat types, but species composition was distinctly different among habitat types, especially at the herbivore level, where four of the eight herbivore species were found in either reference or restored sites, but not in both habitat types. Herbivores (primarily beetles and planthoppers) were more abundant than detritivores (midges and flies) in all habitat types. Predator (web-building and hunting spiders) abundance and species identity were similar among habitat types. Based on stable isotope analysis, trophic relationships differed among mounds, terraces, and reference areas. Herbivore diets were more variable at the reference sites than in either restored habitat type, aligning with higher plant diversity in reference areas. In contrast, detritivore diets were more variable at restored sites, where they were likely consuming food sources such as benthic algae or sediment organic matter. Predator diets were primarily comprised of herbivores in reference areas and detritivores in restored habitats. Overall, the restoration approaches supported abundant terrestrial arthropod assemblages, but species composition was different. In addition, trophic relationships differed between restored and reference areas, in part due to unique plant species assemblages at restored and reference sites. These results suggest that ecosystem restoration strategies that introduce geomorphological heterogeneity and plant diversity are more likely to support a diverse array of species and functions.

AB  - It only takes one sperm to fertilize an egg, yet in some species, sperm migrate as a collective group; why they do so remains unclear. Here, we show that aggregation can improve sperm motility for species of deer mice that experience sperm competition, especially in viscous fluids, but this is only true when sperm groups have an efficient architecture. We find evidence that in species with relaxed postcopulatory sexual selection, less efficient strategies persist.
   In some species, sperm form coordinated groups that are hypothesized to improve their swimming performance in competitive contexts or to navigate through the viscous fluids of the female reproductive tract. Here we investigate sperm aggregation across closely related species of Peromyscus mice that naturally vary by mating system to test the predictions that sperm aggregates 1) are faster than solitary sperm in species that females mate multiply to aid cells in sperm competition, and 2) outperform solitary sperm cells in viscous environments. We find significant variation in the size of sperm aggregates, which negatively associates with relative testis mass, a proxy for sperm competition risk, suggesting that postcopulatory sexual selection has a stabilizing effect on sperm group size. Moreover, our results show that sperm aggregates are faster than solitary sperm in some, but not all, species, and this can vary by fluid viscosity. Of the two species that produce the largest and most frequent groups, we find that sperm aggregates from the promiscuous P. maniculatus are faster than solitary sperm in every experimentally viscous environment but aggregation provides no such kinematic advantage under these same conditions for the monogamous P. polionotus. The reduced performance of P. polionotus aggregates is associated with less efficient aggregate geometry and the inclusion of immotile or morphological abnormal sperm. Our cross-species comparison yields insight into the evolution of sperm social behaviors, provides evidence of extensive variation in the Peromyscus lineage, and reveals that differences in sperm aggregate quality associate with postcopulatory sexual selection.

AB  - Although facultative heap composting is widely used in small and medium-sized livestock farms in China, there are few studies on greenhouse gas (GHG) and odor emissions from this composting system. This study focused on GHG and odor emissions from facultative heap composting of four types of livestock manure and revealed the relationship between the gaseous emissions and microbial communities. Results showed that pig, sheep, and cow manure reached high compost maturity (germination index (GI) > 70%), whereas chicken manure had higher phytotoxicity (GI = 0.02%) with higher electrical conductivity and a lower carbon/nitrogen ratio. The four manure types significantly differed in the total GHG emission, with the following pattern: pig manure (308 g CO2-eq center dot kg(-1)) > cow manure (146 g CO2-eq center dot kg(-1)) > chicken manure (136 g CO2-eq center dot kg(-1)) > sheep manure (95 g CO2-eq center dot kg(-1)). Bacterium with Fermentative, Methanotrophy and Nitrite respiratory functions (e.g. Pseudomonas and Lactobacillus) are enriched within the pile so that more than 90% of the GHGs are produced in the early (days 0-15) and late (days 36-49) composting periods. CO2 contributed more than 90% in the first 35 d, N2O contributed 40-75% in the late composting period, and CH4 contributed less than 8.0%. NH3 and H2S emissions from chicken and pig manure were 4.8 times those from sheep and cow manure. Overall, the gas emissions from facultative heap composting significantly differed among the four manure types due to the significant differences in their physicochemical properties and microbial communities.

AB  - Vehicles collide with hundreds of thousands of deer on European roads each year. This leads to animal deaths and suffering, economic damage and risks for human safety, making the reduction of road mortality a major field in conservation biology. In order to successfully reduce roadkill, we need improved knowledge regarding spatiotemporal patterns of deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) on a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed >85,000 DVCs collected over 17 years in Denmark to investigate changes in the number of DVCs over time and to find spatiotemporal patterns of DVC occurrence. We used a use-availability design - originally developed for habitat selection analyses - to compare DVCs involving roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) with random road locations on a landscape scale. This approach enabled us to combine temporal (seasonal and diel variation), spatial (land cover, road density and type) and other relevant variables (deer population density, traffic, and deer activity) within the same analysis. We found that factors related to infrastructure and land cover were most important in explaining patterns of DVCs, but seasonal and diel changes, deer activity, and population density were also important in predicting the occurrence of DVCs. Importantly, patterns of DVCs were largely similar between the three deer species, with more DVCs occurring at intermediate traffic density, increasing forest cover, during dusk and dawn, and with increasing deer activity and population density. The strong and consistent patterns found here will allow the development of flexible mitigation measures. We propose that our findings could be used to develop a spatio-temporally flexible warning system for smartphones and navigation systems that is based on existing map providers, making it a widely available and cheap mitigation measure.

AB  - In savannas, fire and herbivores are important drivers of natural ecosystem processes. Fire is also used intensively for management purposes. However, reported fire effects differ between studies. Reasons for these differences are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of fire on leaf chemistry of grasses and woody plants in the savanna of the Busanga Flood Plain, Zambia, in relation to the time elapsed between plant sampling and the last fire (fire age) and the frequency of fires during the last 16 years (fire recurrence). We analyzed leaves for their nitrogen, carbon, and fiber concentrations, and estimated their metabolizable energy content, reflecting feed quality for browsers and grazers. Grasses and woody plants differed in all chemical components and showed different responses to fire. Grass quality was higher at sites burnt in the year of sample collection than at sites burnt only in previous years, but did not change under different fire recurrences. Leaves of woody plants did not differ in relation to fire age but their quality increased with increasing fire recurrence. In woody plants, the carbon content responded to the interaction between fire age and fire recurrence, indicating changes in carbon allocation in response to fire. Thus, burning increased feed quality for grazers and browsers but on different temporal scales. The scale effects may contribute to the differences in resource allocation described by different studies. They merit more attention in management decisions as well as in future studies on fire effects in savanna systems.
   In Zambia's Busanga Flood Plain, burning increased feed quality for grazers and browsers but on different temporal scales. While grasses show marked responses to recent fire but not to the frequency of fires, the leaves of woody plants show the opposite response with strong effects to fire recurrence. The asynchronous chemical response of grasses and trees should then result in asynchronous and nonlinear responses of herbivores over different time scales, adding further complexity to the analyses of plant-animal interactions in savanna systems.image

AB  - Humans have been exploiting natural ecosystems and their resources, driving many species to extinction at the expense of global human health, the welfare of wild animals, and the integrity of Earth's ecosystems. Research has shown that the illegal international wildlife trade is of particular interest because it poses a serious threat to global health, biodiversity, conservation efforts, animal welfare, international relations, and biosecurity due to its clandestine and unregulated nature. Trafficked wild animals and wildlife products are moving between source and demand regions in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Despite a common misconception that consumers are primarily located in Asian countries, the EU is a major destination for legal and illegal wildlife trade, and certain EU countries function as transit points for illegal wildlife trafficking. Like Europe, the Middle East, including T & uuml;rkiye, serves as a key transit hub for wildlife trafficking from Africa to Asia, yet no peer-reviewed studies assess T & uuml;rkiye's role in these networks. Motivated by the seizure of a baby gorilla at Istanbul Airport on December 22, 2024, this study aims to identify and analyze international illegal wildlife trade involving T & uuml;rkiye. This study collated publicly available data sources, revealing 55 international wildlife trafficking seizure records involving T & uuml;rkiye between 2011 and 2022. The seizure records were composed of mammals (64 degrees%o, 35 records), reptiles (20 degrees%o, 11 records), birds (7 degrees%o, 4 records) and other species (9 degrees%o, 5 records). A total of 34 countries were identified as countries of origin, transit, or destination in wildlife trafficking routes involving seizures where T & uuml;rkiye served as either an origin, transit, or destination country between 2011 and 2022. The data indicate that international wildlife traffickers use T & uuml;rkiye predominantly as a transit hub connecting Africa with both Asia and Europe, particularly for the trafficking of ivory, rhino horn and pangolin scales between 2011 and 2022. Total quantities of items trafficked during this period were 3,156 kg and 226 pieces of elephant ivory, 176 kg and 34 rhino horns, and 6,566 kg of pangolin scales. The variety of trafficked items, including live animals such as tortoises and African grey parrots through to rare instances like an infant gorilla, underscores the complexity of the illegal wildlife trade. National authorities'commitment to law enforcement is evident from the seizures identified. The study offers practical recommendations to disrupt trafficking networks, improve data collection, and curb demand in consumer markets. By guiding policymakers, conservationists, and authorities, the study fosters international cooperation, optimal resource use, and endangered species protection. International wildlife trafficking can occur when detection and law enforcement measures fail in both the countries of origin and destination, and, where relevant, in transit countries, showing the necessity for governments worldwide to make the international illegal wildlife trade a priority.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions between species underpin biodiversity and ecosystem function, but may be lost when partners respond differently to abiotic conditions. Except for a few prominent examples, effects of global anthropogenic change on mutualisms are poorly understood. Here we assess the effects of urbanization on a symbiosis in which the plant Cordia nodosa house ants in hollow structures (domatia) in exchange for defense against herbivores. We expected to find that mutualist ants would be replaced in the city by heat-tolerant opportunists, leaving urban plants vulnerable to herbivory. In five protected forest sites and five urban forest fragments in southeast Per & uacute;, we recorded the identity and heat tolerance (CTmax) of ant residents of C. nodosa. We also assayed their plant-defensive behaviors and their effects on herbivory. We characterized the urban heat-island effect in ambient temperatures and within domatia. Forest plants housed a consistent ant community dominated by three specialized plant ants, whereas urban plants housed a suite of 10 opportunistic taxa that were, collectively, about 13 times less likely than forest ants to respond defensively to plant disturbance. In the forest, ant exclusion had the expected effect of increasing herbivory, but in urban sites, exclusion reduced herbivory. Despite poor ant defense in urban sites, we detected no difference in total standing herbivory, perhaps because herbivores themselves also declined in the city. Urban sites were warmer than forest sites (daily maxima in urban domatia averaged 1.6 degrees C hotter), and the urban ant community as a whole was slightly more heat tolerant. These results illustrate a case of mutualism loss associated with anthropogenic disturbance. If urbanization is representative of increasing anthropogenic stressors more broadly, we might expect to see destabilization of myrmecophytic mutualisms in forest ecosystems in the future.

AB  - The study was conducted in Iraq, Dhi Qar Governorate, Al-Shatra District, Al-Sada Al-Ghawalba Village, from November 15, 2021, to July 15, 2022, to evaluate milk production effect on some components of Iraqi buffalo milk (% fat, % non-fat solids, % protein, % lactose, % ash, milk density) and to determine the relationship between milk production and these components. The study included 30 lactating buffaloes of different ages, which were divided to three groups depending on their milk production. The first group included low-yielding buffaloes, with a total milk production of 7,380 kg during the study period. The second group included medium-yielding buffaloes, with a total milk production of 13,320 kg during the study period. The third group included high-yielding buffaloes, with a total milk production of 25,020 kg during the study period. The herd was monitored from the beginning of lactation until drying off. The results of the study showed that all milk components under study were changed by milk production in a significant way (p<0.05). The low-yielding buffalo group (7,380 kg) had significantly (p<0.05) higher fat content than the medium-yielding (13,320 kg) and high-yielding (25,020 kg) groups. The medium yielding group (13,320 kg) also had significantly (p<0.05) higher fat content than the high-yielding group (25,020 kg). The average percentages were 0.12 +/- 7.14, 0.11 +/- 6.07, and 0.18 +/- 5.07, respectively. In terms of non-fat solids, the low-yielding (7,380 kg) and medium-yielding (13,320 kg) groups had significantly (p<0.05) higher percentages than the high-yielding (25,020 kg) group. The average percentages were 0.18 +/- 9.49, 0.17 +/- 9.28, and 0.11 +/- 8.75, respectively. The low yielding (7,380 kg) and medium-yielding (13,320 kg) groups also had significantly (p<0.05) higher protein percentages than the high-yielding (25,020 kg) group. The average percentages were 0.036 +/- 3.51, 0.10 +/- 3.44, and 0.033 +/- 3.24, respectively. The high-yielding (25,020 kg) group had significantly (p<0.05) higher lactose percentages than the medium-yielding (13,320 kg) and low-yielding (7,380 kg) groups. The average percentages were 0.10 +/- 4.90, 0.032 +/- 5.20, and 0.12 +/- 5.38, respectively. The medium-yielding (13,320 kg) group also had significantly (p<0.05) higher lactose percentages than the low-yielding (7,380 kg) group. In terms of ash, the low-yielding (7,380 kg) and medium-yielding (13,320 kg) groups had significantly (p<0.05) higher percentages than the high-yielding (25,020 kg) group. The average percentages were 0.011 +/- 0.67, 0.0048 +/- 0.65, and 0.010 +/- 0.59, respectively. The medium-yielding (13,320 kg) group also had significantly (p<0.05) higher ash percentages than the high-yielding (25,020 kg) group. The low-yielding (7,380 kg) and medium-yielding (13,320 kg) groups had significantly (p<0.05) higher milk density than the high-yielding (25,020 kg) group. The average values were 0.32 +/- 32.25, 0.21 +/- 32.1, and 0.29 +/- 30.75, respectively. It was found that milk production was negatively and significantly correlated with fat, non-fat solids, protein, ash, and milk density.

AB  - Forests are ecosystems with high biological diversity, where various groups of organisms live. In the province of Isparta, during the years 2019-2020, systematic sampling in forest areas yielded data on aphids and their natural Quercus spp. (Fagaceae), and Robinia pseudoacacia L. (Leguminosae)]. The study identified 34 aphid species and 42 natural enemy species across 14 host tree species. The distribution of these species among orders was as follows: 54% Coleoptera, 15% Neuroptera, 13% Hemiptera, 13% Hymenoptera, 3% Diptera, and 3% Raphidioptera. The most abundant natural enemy species were Oenopia lyncea (Olivier, 1808) (19.0%), Harmonia quadripunctata (Pontoppidan, 1763) (11.3%), and Adalia decempunctata (L., 1758) (9.2%) in 2019 and H. quadripunctata (14.3%), Coccinula quatuordecimguttata (L., 1758) (12.5%), and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze, 1777) and Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant, 1850) (8.9%) in 2020. The tree species with the highest number of aphid species were P. nigra (15 species) and C. libani (13 species). In total, 123 interactions were identified among the 34 aphid species and 42 natural enemy species across 14 host tree species, representing tri-trophic levels.

AB  - Habitat quality and parasite assembly influence wildlife health, and they are key indicators of health and survivability of wildlife populations. To investigate the potential ecological relationships among habitat type, food nutrients, parasites and hormones in wild boar Sus scrofa, we collected samples of wild boar feces and available plants in their habitat by line transects during winter. Along transects, we identified the composition of plants foraged by wild boar and measured the content of nutrients in available plants to estimate nutrient intake. We also quantified parasites and hormones in wild boar fecal samples. We compared food nutrients among different forest types and explored possible relationships among estimated nutrient intake, parasites and hormones. We found coniferous forest had positive effects on estimated fat intake and negative effects on estimated protein and fiber intake by wild boar. Furthermore, we revealed that estimated fat intake was negatively correlated with Metastrongylus elongatus parasites and positively correlated with triiodothyronine (T3). In contrast, estimated protein intake was positively correlated with M. elongatus and negatively correlated with T3. Finally, we found negative relationships between T3 concentrations and loads of Ascaris suum parasites and between cortisol (COR) and loads of Trichuris suis parasites. These insights on ecological relationships help identify potential dietary parameters in winter that could help predict and manage parasite and hormone responses for wild boar population recovery.

AB  - Whether, and which, individuals migrate or not is rapidly changing in many populations. Exactly how and why environmental change alters migration propensity is not well understood. We constructed density-dependent structured population models to explore conditions for the coexistence of migrants and residents. Our theoretical models were motivated by empirical data identified via a systematic literature review. We find that the equilibrium density in the season with the strongest density dependence of a strategy predicts whether the strategy will become dominant within the population. This equilibrium density represents strategy fitness in a seasonal environment and can be used to examine selection on migratory behavior. Whether partial migration can be maintained within a population depends on where in the annual cycle density dependence operates. Diversified bet-hedging, where parents produce a mix of migrants and residents, also maintains partial migration. Our study disentangles density-dependent and density-independent rates in a population with seasonal structure, potentially providing routes to explain the rapid change in migration strategies observed in many populations.

AB  - To fully understand the foodborne diseases attributed to the intake of raw milk samples as conveyors of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), metagenomic sequencing methods are used worldwide to increase food safety because they allow the molecular characterization of pathogens without conducting primary isolation stages. The diversity of the bacterial communities within raw and pasteurized milk samples from diverse assets (i.e., horse (3), camel (3), goat (3), cow (3), and three pooling samples as controls) gathered from Saudi Arabia were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing as a standard DNA barcoding approach, showing significant numbers of bacteria. The dissimilar bacterial communities among the tested samples were classified under different classes (including Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacterial, Clostridia, etc.), families (including Lachnospiraceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Staphylococcaceae, etc.), and species (including Arthrobacter-citreus, Escherichia, Staphylococcus-aureus, etc.). Unexpectedly, the pooled pasteurized milk samples that were used as the controls were contaminated, and the top percentage was from Bacilli. Furthermore, 477 novel species were detected, and the largest amount was from raw horse milk (37.3%), followed by raw camel milk (21.6%), while countless species were discovered to be descended from Proteobacteria. Generally, the samples of raw horse milk had the highest levels of species richness and diversity, as shown by the alpha diversity analysis. The beta diversity analysis showed no exact similar community structures among species within the examined samples. To better comprehend the microbiological diversity, the use of high-throughput sequencing with a hypothetical basis is highly recommended to obtain useful microbial reserves from raw and pasteurized milk samples.

AB  - Effective management of wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations has to be based on precise estimates of local densities. The development of an effective and cost-efficient technique to cope with this need has always represented a challenge for wildlife managers and researchers. Drive counts, hunting bags, and Random Encounter Model (REM) are among the most frequently used techniques, with the latter recently gaining wide recognition. We sought to compare the 3 methods in terms of their suitability for management, precision, and effort required. Moreover, we evaluated the uncertainty of REM results when all sources of error were considered. In our study, the 3 methods were applied to a wild boar population of the Italian Apennines in 2013. We used the delta method to assess the total uncertainty of REM density estimates on the basis of the errors associated to all the parameters involved. Notably, the 3 methods tested showed consistent mean density estimates, though none of them reached fully satisfying levels of precision for management purposes. Since the low precision of REM was mostly due to the high variability of the group-size parameter, we propose simple technical improvements aimed at reducing the variability of this parameter and, thus, of REM. Although all the methods tested still need to be further developed to be effective for wild boar management, REM seems to be the most promising one in terms of both potential precision and effort required. The limited effort required by REM is particularly relevant in the current wildlife management scenario, where funds are often lacking and the number of hunters acting as volunteers is decreasing.

AB  - The insects constitute the majority of animal diversity. Most insects are holometabolous: during complete metamorphosis their bodies are radically reorganized. This reorganization poses a significant challenge to the gut microbiota, as the gut is replaced during pupation, a process that does not occur in hemimetabolous insects. In holometabolous hosts, it offers the opportunity to decouple the gut microbiota between the larval and adult life stages resulting in high beta diversity whilst limiting alpha diversity. Here, we studied 18 different herbivorous insect species from five orders of holometabolous and three orders of hemimetabolous insects. Comparing larval and adult specimens, we find a much higher beta-diversity and hence microbiota turnover in holometabolous insects compared to hemimetabolous insects. Alpha diversity did not differ between holo- and hemimetabolous insects nor between developmental stages within these groups. Our results support the idea that pupation offers the opportunity to change the gut microbiota and hence might facilitate ecological niche shifts. This possible effect of niche shift facilitation could explain a selective advantage of the evolution of complete metamorphosis, which is a defining trait of the most speciose insect taxon, the holometabola.

AB  - Mutualisms are key determinants of community assembly and composition, but urbanization can alter the dynamics of these interactions and associated effects on ecosystem functions. Legume-rhizobia mutualisms are a model interaction to evaluate the ecological and ecosystem-level effects of urbanization, particularly urban-driven eutrophication and nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, we evaluated how urbanization affected the ecology of the mutualism between white clover Trifolium repens and its rhizobial symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii along an urbanization gradient. We found that the abundance of rhizobium nodules on white clover decreased with urbanization. White clover acquired N from mixed sources of N fixation and uptake from the soil for the majority of the urbanization gradient, but white clover primarily acquired N from the soil rather than N fixation by rhizobia at the urban and rural limits of the gradient. Importantly, we identified soil N as a critical nexus for urban-driven changes in the white clover-rhizobium mutualism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that urbanization alters the ecological consequences of a legume-rhizobium mutualism, with direct and indirect effects of the urban landscape on an ecologically-important mutualistic interaction.

AB  - Effective planning for species conservation often requires an understanding of habitat use. The resources an animal selects within the landscape relate to its behavioral state and, therefore, incorporating behavior into habitat selection analyses can help inform management of threatened species. Here we present an approach for developing behavior-specific spatial habitat-use models using large quantities of GPS telemetry data. Using hidden Markov models, we first characterize 231,478 GPS fixes from 22 recently fledged endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax fleayi) as reflective of either perching, short-distance flight, or long-distance flight. We then use a multivariate habitat selection ratio to develop spatial models predicting where these behavioral states occur. Recently fledged Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles selected for areas close to forest edges during perching and short distance flights, whereas they selected more strongly for areas with steep topography (slopes > 15 degrees) and further from forest edges for longer flights. Models using distance to forest edge and topo-graphic slope effectively predicted where eagles engaged in long flights (R2 > 0.91, rs > 0.90) in each of six regions, whereas the performance varied by region for models describing perching (R2 = 0.43-0.97, rs = 0.80-0.97) and short flights (R2 = 0.34-0.93, rs = 0.63-1.00). Our study provides a detailed understanding of habitat use by young Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, which has multiple applications in the ongoing conser-vation of the population. Our method illustrates a framework for spatially explicit and behavior-specific habitat selection analyses that can be applied to other species of conservation concern.

AB  - In order to effectively conserve a species and manage its population, it is critical to understand the impact of climate change on habitat quality and connectivity. The sika deer (Cervus nippon) is a ungulate species endemic to East Asia and listed as a Category I State Key Protected Wild Animals under Chinese law. The C. nippon population was established in the Shennongjia area 30 years ago, and there is an urgent need to analyse the impact of environmental change on habitat quality. In this study, we compared suitable habitats and habitat connectivity of C. nippon in the Shennongjia area by utilizing an ecological niche model that integrated a set of environmental factors combined with a cost-distance approach for both the present time as well as in the future. The most encouraging findings were that the suitable habitat for C. nippon may be obviously enlarged and its habitat connectivity obviously improved under climate change. The suitable habitat of C. nippon in the Shennongjia area is limited at present; however, it is possible that the total area and number of suitable habitat patches can increase twenty- to thirty-fold and quadruple to sextuple, respectively, in the future (2050-2070). We detected a clear trend of suitable future habitat expansion into the northeast. The number of interpatch least-cost paths may dramatically increase (up to six to twelve times higher), and the lengths of least-cost paths and movement costs for the deer may decrease by half. Based on these results, several conservation recommendations have been suggested. Our study provides a valuable reference for protective actions that can be taken to conserve C. nippon in the Shennongjia area and can serve as a template for establishing conservation strategies for other species.

AB  - Bush cover is high in some semi-arid African grasslands, and these woody plants have various socio-cultural uses and potential as livestock feed resources. The current study was conducted in northern Tanzania to investigate the changes in bushland cover, identify general uses of woody plants by agro-pastoral farmers, determine livestock preferences, and the nutritional values of selected plants. We determined bush cover changes from 2000 to 2022 by Google Earth Engine using the Random Forest algorithm during land cover classification. Livestock observation and participatory rural appraisal were used to sample woody plants foraged by livestock. Farmers named woody plants in a local language, listed their uses and ranked them as livestock feed. Farmer-preferred plants were analysed for nutritional values and screened for preference using goats. Bush cover had increased by 6.9-90.2% at 0.6-4.5% per year in the studied area, where 32 woody plant species were ranked and had other socio-cultural uses. These uses were medicine (78%), firewood (59%), a food source (31%) and construction (28%), with Grewia bicolor and Cordia sinensis possessing many of the uses. Farmers ranked woody plants highly as the feed if they were available all year round, readily eaten by livestock (palatable) and led to high performance. The coefficient of preference (COP) varied (p < 0.001) among goats fed the selected plants. Grewia similis (COP = 1.8) and Haplocoelum foliolosum (COP = 1.7) were highly preferred, while Combretum campestris and C. sinensis were the least preferred. There were differences in nutritional values among key woody plants, and G. similis had the highest digestibility (59%), making it a suitable species for agroforestry. Encroaching non-invasive woody plants can be used as livestock feed or serve other socio-cultural uses; their control should be informed by participatory appraisal involving locals in semi-arid areas.

AB  - The flora of the Canary Islands has been subject to botanical studies for more than 200 years. Several biodiversity databases are available for the archipelago. However, there are various drivers of change in real biodiversity and the knowledge about it constantly needs to be kept track of. Island floras are both: exposed to species loss and to species introductions, either through natural processes or by anthropogenic drivers. Additionally, the evolution of endemic plant species plays a substantial role. Endemic species are sensitive to population decline due to small population sizes and possible low competitiveness against incoming species. Additionally, there is continuous progress in systematics and taxonomy. Species names or their taxonomic attribution can be modified. Here, we check published plant lists for the Canary Islands and literature, and compile currently accepted taxa into an updated checklist. For this FloCan checklist, several sources were compiled, checked for completeness and quality, and their taxonomy was updated. We illustrate how far plant names are considered in regional or global databases. This work represents the current state of knowledge on Canary Island plant diversity, including introduced and recently described taxa. We provide a comprehensive and updated basis for biogeographical and macroecological studies. Particularly, the number of non-native species is being extended substantially. The adaptation to standard international nomenclature supports integration into large-scale studies.

AB  - Understanding species- or population-specific dietary specialisation is key to informing habitat conservation needs and successful ex situ recovery programs for many endangered species. One of the most endangered populations in Canada, the behaviourally distinct deep-snow ecotype of the Southern Mountain caribou, is characterised by a winter diet of arboreal rather than terrestrial lichens. We hypothesised that this dietary variation would produce a distinct gut microbiome in deep-snow mountain caribou relative to their shallow-snow counterparts. We additionally hypothesised that the temporary alteration of natural diets for ex situ conservation programs, including the provision of commercial pelleted feed and volunteer-collected lichens during maternity penning of pregnant cows, may alter this specialised microbiome. Here, we use faecal DNA metabarcoding to compare diet and gut microbiome composition among various herds of deep- and shallow-snow caribou, captive deep-snow caribou from the Revelstoke maternity pen, and semi-domesticated reindeer. Our results confirm that free-ranging deep-snow caribou specialise on the arboreal hair lichens Bryoria and Nodobryoria, and we show that this correlates with a microbiome distinct from that of shallow-snow caribou specialising on the terrestrial lichens Cladonia and Stereocaulon. We also show that maternity penning of deep-snow caribou significantly altered forage consumption and microbiome composition: penned caribou consumed more foliose lichens and had a distinct microbiome compared to free-ranging caribou. Our results suggest that managers should carefully consider the preferred forage of caribou populations when designing interventions that require diet modification. We further suggest that faecal samples of caribou and other dietary specialists be routinely monitored for diet and microbiome composition, especially during periods of captivity or diet modification, as an additional component of conservation assessments.

AB  - Most of Ethiopia's National Parks are affected by anthropogenic factors. The objective of this study was to assess the major wildlife threatening factors of Gibe Sheleko National Park (GSNP) through semi-structured questionnaire, focus groups discussion and observation. The survey was carried out from December, 2018 to August, 2020. A total of 281 randomly selected household heads from eight Kebeles and 15 Park management staff were interviewed. The identified threats include: overgrazing, expansion of human settlement and agricultural practices, fuelwood collection, source of food (bushmeat, fishes and wild honey) collection, invasive vegetation species, human induced fire, human-wildlife conflict and source of house construction materials. The majority (71.17%) of the respondents used the Park as means of grazing land followed by sources of fuelwood (48.26%). Crop raiding is a serious problem in the study area as stated by 84.46% of the respondents. Identified crop raiders include: olive baboon, vervet monkey, warthog, bushpig, porcupine, hippopotamus and antelope species. About 78.14% of the respondents stated that guarding was the most common type of crop raiders' protection method. The majority (55.26%) of the respondents had positive attitudes towards conservation of the Park. Significant variation was observed in the types of natural resource utilization, types of human-wildlife conflict, trends of crop damage, population status of crop raiders, methods used to protect crop raiders and their attitudes towards GSNP conservation (P < 0.05). In general, GSNP is exposed to multiple conservation challenges. Therefore, for the sustainability of the Park, cooperation among different stakeholders is essential.

AB  - Perceptions of past ecological change affect views of current ecosystem state, but how do baselines help to shape stakeholders' visions of an idealized future?Here, we investigate links between perceptions of natural baselines and visions for the nearshore Gulf of Maine among a key stakeholder group, active lobster fishers. We ask three related questions: (1) What do fishers perceive as a 'natural' Gulf of Maine? (2) How do perceptions of the past predict individual and collective visions of an ideal future? and (3) How is existing management perceived as supporting these visions?We found that fishers perceived the ecosystem to be 'natural' an average of one decade before they started fishing. Three species dominated views of natural systems: cod Gadus morhua, lobster Homarus americanus, and herring Clupea harengus, but while long-time fishers associated abundant cod with a natural nearshore Gulf of Maine, memories of a historically cod-rich Gulf of Maine were fading among some younger fishers who began their careers after the cod crash in the 1990s. Perceptions of 'natural' ecosystems dictated future visions for the majority of taxa; on average, fishers remembered and desired abundant cod and herring, but perceived halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus and endangered right whales Eubalaena glacialis to have always been rare.Fishers described a vision for the future based on views of past ecological and social baselines, including fisheries deconsolidation and diversification, but expressed a lack of shared vision with and trust in federal management institutions to achieve these goals. In particular, memories of cod abundance in the 1970s and 1980s were coupled with memories of a diversified and accessible fishery, but fishers doubted that the recovery of cod would result in their restored access to cod fisheries.Together our results demonstrate that past personal experiences limit perceptions of what is possible, highlighting both the value and limitations of local ecological knowledge in places that have experienced ecological change over centuries. They also demonstrate how stakeholder perceptions of both social and ecological baselines shape visions for future ecosystems but are mediated by contemporary issues like trust in institutions and fisheries access.

AB  - Effective precision livestock farming requires the availability of reliable and up-to-date data characterizing the animals and environment of interest. This work presents the design, architecture, and implementation of a wireless acoustic sensor network for monitoring goat farms on a 24/7 basis. In addition, we define a hierarchical organization of the involved sound classes exhaustively covering every aspect of the encountered goat vocali-zations. Moreover, we developed an annotation tool tailored to the specifics of the problem at hand, i.e. a big, real-world data environment, able to meaningfully assist the annotation of goat vocalizations via a suitable sound classification module. On top of that, a mobile phone application was developed facilitating authorized users to remotely access information describing the situation on the farm site. Importantly, such a non-invasive moni-toring framework was installed in 4 different sites located in Northern Italy while taking into account their diverse characteristics.

AB  - Climatic variability, resource availability, and anthropogenic impacts heavily influence an animal's home range. This makes home range size an effective metric for understanding how variation in environmental factors alter the behavior and spatial distribution of animals. In this study, we estimated home range size of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) across four sites in Namibia, along a gradient of precipitation and human impact, and investigated how these gradients influence the home range size on regional and site scales. Additionally, we estimated the time individuals spent within protected area boundaries. The mean 50% autocorrelated kernel density estimate for home range was 2200 km(2) [95% CI:1500-3100 km(2)]. Regionally, precipitation and vegetation were the strongest predictors of home range size, accounting for a combined 53% of observed variation. However, different environmental covariates explained home range variation at each site. Precipitation predicted most variation (up to 74%) in home range sizes (n = 66) in the drier western sites, while human impacts explained 71% of the variation in home range sizes (n = 10) in Namibia's portion of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. Elephants in all study areas maintained high fidelity to protected areas, spending an average of 85% of time tracked on protected lands. These results suggest that while most elephant space use in Namibia is driven by natural dynamics, some elephants are experiencing changes in space use due to human modification.

AB  - Cyanobacteria have a great diversity of natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, including fungal pathogens within the Chytridiomycota (chytrids). While these pathogens have been previously described on a select number of cyanobacterial hosts and are suspected to play a significant ecological role, little is understood about species interactions and how competition between parasites can affect epidemic development and bloom formation. Here, three Planktothrix agardhii isolates from Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie (OH, USA) were challenged in monoculture and polyculture against infection by three isolates (C1, C2, C10) of their obligate chytrid fungal pathogen, Rhizophydiales sp. The chytrid isolates were inoculated as single isolates or a mixture of up to three different isolates. In monoculture, host isolates were characterized as highly susceptible (P. agardhii 1030), moderately susceptible (P. agardhii 1808) or mostly resistant (P. agardhii 1801). Co-infection of chytrid isolates on the highly susceptible host isolate had an additive effect on chytrid prevalence, leading to a culture crash where 2 or 3 chytrid isolates were present. Co-infection of chytrid isolates on the moderately susceptible and mostly resistant isolates had no effect on chytrid infection outcome or prevalence compared to infection with a single isolate. In polyculture, the effect on host growth was most significant in the single chytrid isolate treat-ment, which was attenuated with the addition of mixed chytrid treatments. Genetic analysis of the resulting population after the experimental period showed a tendency for the chytrid isolate C1 and P. agardhii 1801 to dominate in mixed population samples. Two different interspecific interactions seem to be in play; varied parasite infection strategies allow for the amplification of infection prevalence due to mixed chytrids in a sus-ceptible monoculture, or competition allows for the dominance of a single chytrid isolate in monoculture and the reduction of infection prevalence in a host polyculture. This work thus highlights how interactions between chytrid infections can change the course of epidemic development and harmful algal bloom formation.

AB  - Three-dimensional deep-sea structures enhance substrate complexity and can shape numerous ecological hotspots that play critical roles in the diversity and distribution of benthic faunal assemblages. The characteristics of these features are not fully understood due to the logistical challenges of exploring at great depths and remote locations. One such deep-sea feature, the Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone (WZFZ) located in the East Indian Ocean, was mapped using a full-ocean depth multibeam echosounder system. Additionally, twelve baited landers and five crewed submersible dives were conducted in water depths between 4709 and 6591 m. We use seafloor bathymetry, bathymetric derivatives and video footage from the submersible dives to characterise the benthic structures, substrate types, habitat diversity, and the distribution of associated functional groups of megafauna for the WZFZ. The Benthic Terrain Modeler toolbox was used as an initial semi-automated step to generate benthic structural classes, which were further characterized through the inclusion of bottom salinity and temperature data collected by the scientific landers and integrated with the observations of seafloor substrate from the submersible video footage. This resulted in identification of nine benthic habitat classes characterised by unique seafloor morphological structure and substrate texture. A polymetallic nodule field, a possible extension of the previously reported Cape Leeuwen nodule field, was also observed along submersible transects conducted on the slopes of the WZFZ. The distribution and diversity of the functional megafauna groups observed are influenced by the deep-sea benthic habitats, defined by seafloor structures and substrate heterogeneity, especially the presence of hard substrates such as outcropping bedrock and polymetallic nodules within the WZFZ.

AB  - Population density is fundamental information for assessing the conservation status of species and support management and conservation actions for in situ populations, but is unknown for many forest species due to their difficulty in detection. The Faecal Standing Crop (FSC) method using detection dogs is an alternative for cryptic or elusive species. An intrinsic difficulty of FSC is the ability to find faecal samples in the field and to estimate the probability of which faeces detection is influenced by degradation due to climatic conditions. Our goal was to propose a concurrent FSC parameter estimation using a scat detection dog under different climatic conditions and apply those parameters in a wild deer population. Ten faecal samples of grey brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira) were placed weekly in a transect (24 x 1440 m) in both dry and wet seasons (12 weeks each). A scat detection dog was then employed to find experimental faecal samples to determine the FSC parameters that were subsequently used with naturally occurring faecal samples (also dog-detected) to estimate population density. The oldest dog found samples were 21 (Dry) and seven (Wet) days after placement, resulting in dog efficiency of 22.5% (Dry) and 30% (Wet). Adjusting the model to account for efficiency and scat durability, we estimated similar, seasonal, densities of 4.51 individuals km-2 (SD = 2.21, Dry) and 5.37 individuals km-2 (SD = 3.71, Wet). Synthesis and applications: Our results demonstrate that our concurrent methodology corrected the effects of weather and habitat on FSC parameters thereby allowing for accurate population density estimation. Additionally, this method can provide reasonably precise density estimates with a logistically feasible sample size, as demonstrated by simulation. Following our recommendations, this method allows a reliable estimate of population density because it incorporates any influence of study area, dog ability and climate in faecal sample detection, providing fundamental information for the conservation of many cryptic and elusive species.
   Densidades populacionais sao informacoes fundamentais para a avaliacao do status de conservacao das especies e para guiar acoes de manejo e conservacao de populacoes in situ, mas essas informacoes sao desconhecidas para muitas especies florestais devido a sua dificuldade de deteccao. O metodo Faecal Standing Crop (FSC) usando caes farejadores e uma alternativa para especies cripticas ou elusivas. Uma dificuldade intrinseca do FSC e a capacidade de encontrar amostras fecais em campo e estimar a probabilidade de deteccao de amostras influenciada pela degradacao devido as condicoes climaticas. Nosso objetivo foi propor um metodo para a estimativa dos parametros FSC usando um cao farejador sob diferentes condicoes climaticas. Posteriormente, aplicamos estes parametros para estimar uma populacao de cervideos selvagens. Dez amostras fecais de veado-catingueiro (Subulo gouazoubira) foram colocadas semanalmente em um transecto (24 x 1440 m) nas estacoes seca e umida (12 semanas cada). Utilizamos um cao farejador para encontrar as amostras experimentais que foram usadas para determinar os parametros de FSC, os quais foram subsequentemente usados para estimar a densidade populacional na mesma area. As amostras mais antigas encontradas pelo cao foram de 21 (estacao seca) e sete dias (estacao umida), resultando na eficiencia do cao de 22.5% (estacao seca) e 30% (estacao umida). Considerando a eficiencia e a persistencia das fezes no ambiente, estimamos densidades sazonais similares de 4.51 indiv. km-2 (SD = 2.21, estacao seca) e 5.37 indiv. km-2 (SD = 3.71, estacao chuvosa). Sintese e aplicacoes: Nossos resultados demonstram que a nossa metodologia corrigiu os efeitos do clima e do habitat nos parametros FSC, permitindo uma estimativa precisa da densidade populacional. Seguindo nossas recomendacoes, esse metodo possibilita uma estimativa mais confiavel da densidade populacional, pois incorpora qualquer influencia da area de estudo, capacidade de encontro pelo cao e o clima na deteccao das amostras, fornecendo informacoes fundamentais para a conservacao de especies cripticas e elusivas.

AB  - In reproductive dynamics, recruitment is a critical biological process to ensure populations remain viable. While extrinsic factors such as predation and environmental factors (e.g., droughts) have been found to strongly influence recruitment, knowledge gaps still exist on how maternal factors such as age, body size, and past reproductive history influence recruitment. We examined a captive population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with a known pedigree exhibiting natural breeding behavior from 2008 to 2019, and compared annual recruitment data of individuals relative to a mother's age, lifetime body size percentile (LBP), and past reproductive history. We found that recruitment success increased up to 6.5 years of age before declining in older age classes. We also found that age and LBP had a significant interaction such that large-bodied females had high recruitment success at younger ages that peaked around 4.5 years of age, while small-bodied females had low recruitment success at young ages and high recruitment success at older ages. We also found females that recruited a fawn in the previous year recruited 1.46 times as many fawns than females that did not recruit a fawn the year prior. We documented 40 individuals (47% of mothers) that recruited fawns in consecutive years at least once in their lifetime, and those individuals recruited 75.3% of all fawns during the study. Our findings suggest that age of peak recruitment varies based on body size, and a minority of females in a population successfully recruit a majority of the fawns into the breeding population.

AB  - The management objectives of many protected areas must meet the dual mandates of protecting biodiversity while providing recreational opportunities. It is difficult to balance these mandates because it takes considerable effort to monitor both the status of biodiversity and impacts of recreation. Using detections from 45 camera traps deployed between July 2019 and September 2021, we assessed the potential impacts of recreation on spatial and temporal activity for 8 medium- and large-bodied terrestrial mammals in an isolated alpine protected area: Cathedral Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesised that some wildlife perceive a level of threat from people, such that they avoid 'risky times' or 'risky places' associated with human activity. Other species may benefit from associating with people, be it through access to anthropogenic resource subsidies or filtering of competitors/predators that are more human-averse (i.e., human shield hypothesis). Specifically, we predicted that large carnivores would show the greatest segregation from people while mesocarnivores and ungulates would associate spatially with people. We found spatial co-occurrence between ungulates and recreation, consistent with the human shield hypothesis, but did not see the predicted negative relationship between larger carnivores and humans, except for coyotes (Canis latrans). Temporally, all species other than cougars (Puma concolor) had diel activity patterns significantly different from that of recreationists, suggesting potential displacement in the temporal niche. Wolves (Canis lupus) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) showed shifts in temporal activity away from people on recreation trails relative to off-trail areas, providing further evidence of potential displacement. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring spatial and temporal interactions between recreation activities and wildlife communities, in order to ensure the effectiveness of protected areas in an era of increasing human impacts.
   Protected areas have a dual mandate of providing recreational activities while also protecting wildlife and their habitats. We looked at the effects of human recreation on wildlife use of habitat in space and time, and found responses to recreation varied by species. Within one protected area, we saw that animals may be avoiding humans by shifting their use of habitat in time, more than in space.image

AB  - Native plants may coevolve with native arthropods and may be associated with greater arthropod diversity than non-native plants. Thompson Mills Forest, a state arboretum owned by the University of Georgia and located in Braselton, GA, is home to a variety of oak (Quercus L., Fagacaeae) species. both native and non-native to Georgia. Arthropods were sampled from 20 trees belonging to 12 species, 8 native and 4 non-native, using beat sheets for 10 consecutive weeks in 2018. More than 500 arthropods were collected, with Coleoptera, Araneae, and Psocodea comprising more than 70% of the arthropods collected. Neither abundance nor Shannon index varied among trees of native or non-native origin or among tree species, although both variables peaked during the middle of the sampling period. Multivariate analyses showed similar arthropod communities were associated with native and non-native oaks. The results suggest that non-native plants may naturalize and, if so, may interact with arthropod communities in similar ways as native congeners. Further research into the long-term ecological interactions with non-native plants is recommended.

AB  - Survival, reproduction, and movement are the key demographic parameters that drive population dynamics. Factors affecting these demographic parameters in large, long-lived, extinction-threatened mammals are diverse and may differentially affect subpopulations in disparate parts of an ecosystem. We conducted annual photographic surveys to uniquely identify 1,520 giraffes at 4 subpopulations around the Serengeti Ecosystem in Tanzania to estimate demographic parameters of age- and sex-specific survival probabilities, reproduction, population densities, group sizes, and long-distance movements. In the Seronera (central) subpopulation, we combined 15 years of data from 3 independent survey schemes, developed a Bayesian hidden Markov model to estimate demographic parameters, and conducted a retrospective population analysis to elucidate the demographic drivers of temporal changes in population growth rate. We collected data over 4-5 years for 3 other subpopulations, and used frequentist methods to estimate demographic parameters. We compared our results with historical estimates from the 1970s and 2000s to examine long-term population trends and demographic drivers. We found significant differences in adult and subadult survival probabilities among subpopulations, with lower adult survival associated with declining subpopulations. Retrospective population analysis for the Seronera subpopulation reiterated that adult survival is a critical demographic driver of population dynamics for giraffes. The 2 subpopulations adjacent to the protected area boundary declined over 48 years, whereas the Seronera subpopulation stabilized since 2008. Only one individual moved between subpopulations, providing evidence for subpopulation insularity and potential genetic structuring of the overall population. These factors underscore the need for subpopulation-specific conservation strategies aimed at raising adult survival within the western and northeastern parts of the Serengeti Ecosystem. Community-based conservation efforts adjacent to protected areas have been effective in raising adult survival and density elsewhere. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding subpopulation dynamics and their demographic drivers for evidence-based conservation and management to recover endangered giraffe populations.

AB  - Identifying the circumstances and causes of carnivore attacks on humans is important for prevention of future incidents as well as employing effective wildlife management strategies. Cape Breton Highlands National Park (CBHNP) in Nova Scotia has experienced multiple attacks by coyotes Canis latrans on humans, including a fatal attack on an adult in 2009. Here we use a combination of data on space use and diet collected from 2011 to 2013 to reveal that limited resources and a reliance on a large ungulate (moose, Alces americanus) as the mechanism leading to aggression by coyotes in CBHNP. Resident coyotes exhibited large home range sizes (mean = 77.5 km(2)) indicative of limited resources and spatiotemporal avoidance of human activity. Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values of sub-sampled coyote whiskers (n = 32), which provide a longitudinal record of diet over the months before collection, revealed little intra- and inter-individual variation with nearly all individuals specializing on moose, a pattern that agrees with indices of natural resource availability. Specifically, stable isotope mixing models show that moose was the most important prey for most coyotes (25/32), representing between 41% and 78% of dietary inputs. Only four coyotes exhibited use of anthropogenic resources (human foods), and only one of seven coyotes involved in attacks on people had been consuming human foods before the attacks. Synthesis and Applications: We have described a unique ecological system in which a generalist carnivore has expanded its niche to specialize on a large prey species, with the unfortunate consequence of also expanding pathways to conflicts with people. Our results suggest extreme unprovoked predatory attacks by coyotes on people are likely to be quite rare and associated with unique ecological characteristics. Extreme management actions such as bounties are unnecessary, but managers may need to employ hazing or lethal removal earlier in the conflict process than under normal circumstances. Also, users of these areas should be made aware of the risks coyotes pose and encouraged to take precautions.

AB  - Algal turfs are an abundant and highly productive component of coral reef ecosystems. However, our understanding of the drivers that shape algal turf productivity across studies and among reefs is limited. Based on published studies we considered how different factors may shape turf productivity and turnover rates. Of the factors considered, depth was the primary driver of turf productivity rates, while turnover was predominantly related to turf biomass. We also highlight shortcomings in the available data collected on turf productivity todate; most data were collected prior to global coral bleaching events, within a limited geographic range, and were largely from experimental substrata. Despite the fact turfs are a widespread benthic covering on most coral reefs, and one of the major sources of benthic productivity, our understanding of their productivity is constrained by both a paucity of data and methodological limitations. We offer a potential way forward to address these challenges.

AB  - The consequences of climate change for biogeographic range dynamics depend on the spatial scales at which climate influences focal species directly and indirectly via biotic interactions. An overlooked question concerns the extent to which microclimates modify specialist biotic interactions, with emergent properties for communities and range dynamics. Here, we use an in-field experiment to assess egg-laying behaviour of a range-expanding herbivore across a range of natural microclimatic conditions. We show that variation in microclimate, resource condition and individual fecundity can generate differences in egg-laying rates of almost two orders of magnitude in an exemplar species, the brown argus butterfly (Aricia agestis). This within-site variation in fecundity dwarfs variation resulting from differences in average ambient temperatures among populations. Although higher temperatures did not reduce female selection for host plants in good condition, the thermal sensitivities of egg-laying behaviours have the potential to accelerate climate-driven range expansion by increasing egg-laying encounters with novel hosts in increasingly suitable microclimates. Understanding the sensitivity of specialist biotic interactions to microclimatic variation is, therefore, critical to predict the outcomes of climate change across species' geographical ranges, and the resilience of ecological communities.

AB  - Domestic pig hybridization with wild boar occurs for different reasons and needs. The ability to distinguish hybrids is important for monitoring of hybrid and purebred populations and for conservation of both rare domestic pig breeds and wild boars. As cranial morphology has a good discrimination power, the aim of this study was to quantify the differences of cranial morphologies between local Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs and their hybrids with wild boar, including first generation hybrid (domestic x wild) animals and second generation animals (backcross of first generation females with domestic and wild males). Most of the craniometric measurements of hybrids were larger than those of purebred local Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs. A particularly pronounced significant elongation of skull length parameters was found in hybrids. Cranial morphology can be used to discriminate between Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs and their hybrid groups for the all measurements of whole crania and for measurements of distinct parts of crania.The diversity of domestic pig breeds and their hybridization increases the variety of phenotypes expressed in hybrids. The aim of this study was to quantify the differences of cranial morphologies between local Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs and theirhybrids with wild boar. A total of sixteen craniometric measurements were performed on the lateral, ventral and dorsal sides of 71 skulls of Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs and their hybrids, including 1/4 wild boar (WB), 1/2 wild boar and 3/4 wild boar genotypes. The weight of the skull was affected by the genotype, live weight and sex of the animal. The size of the skull, particularly related to skull length parameters, increased consistently with the increase of the wild boar proportion in the hybrids. However, the Sus scrofa genotype did not affect the skull height. Clear discrimination was possible between the local Lithuanian breed pigs and their hybrids with different proportions of wild boar and between individual groups of hybrids. The most correct classification was determined on the basis of the overall and length parameters of the crania. This could contribute to better management and utilization of hybrids.

AB  - The rhizosphere microbiome influences many aspects of plant fitness, including production of secondary compounds and defence against insect herbivores. Plants also modulate the composition of the microbial community in the rhizosphere via secretion of root exudates. We tested both the effect of the rhizosphere microbiome on plant traits, and host plant effects on rhizosphere microbes using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Brassica rapa that differ in production of glucosinolates (GLS), secondary metabolites that contribute to defence against insect herbivores. First, we investigated the effect of genetic variation in GLS production on the composition of the rhizosphere microbiome. Using a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression model (DMBVS), we identified both negative and positive associations between bacteria from six genera and the concentration of five GLS compounds produced in plant roots. Additionally, we tested the effects of microbial inoculation (an intact vs. disrupted soil microbiome) on GLS production and insect damage in these RILs. We found a significant microbial treatment x genotype interaction, in which total GLS was higher in the intact relative to the disrupted microbiome treatment in some RILs. However, despite differences in GLS production between microbial treatments, we observed no difference in insect damage between treatments. Together, these results provide evidence for a full feedback cycle of plant-microbe interactions mediated by GLS; that is, GLS compounds produced by the host plant "feed-down" to influence rhizosphere microbial community and rhizosphere microbes "feed-up" to influence GLS production.

AB  - Desynchrony of phenological responses to climate change is a major concern for ecological communities. Potential uncoupling between one of the most fundamental divisions within populations, males and females, has not been well studied. To address this gap, we examined sex-specific plasticity in hibernation phenology in two populations of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus). We find that both sexes display similar phenological plasticity to spring snowmelt dates in their timing of torpor termination and behavioural emergence from hibernation. As a result of this plasticity, the degree of protandry (i.e. males' emergences from hibernation preceding those of females) did not change significantly over the 27-year study. Earlier male behavioural emergence, relative to females, improved the likelihood of securing a breeding territory and increased annual reproductive success. Sexual selection favouring earlier male emergence from hibernation may maintain protandry in this population, but did not contribute to further advances in male phenology. Together, our results provide evidence that the sexes should remain synchronized, at least in response to the weather variation investigated here, and further support the role of sexual selection in the evolution of protandry in sexually reproducing organisms.

AB  - Environmental and climatic variation drive animal migration. Animals must adjust their behavioral strategies, for example, habitat selection, to match best variation in resources whose value likely varies with conditions such as weather. For example, climate change makes processes such as snowmelt and the emergence of vegetation less predictable at the scale of months or weeks. Furthermore, climate change makes meteorological conditions unpredictable-or dynamic-at the scale of days and hours. The profitability of selecting any particular resource may vary according to local meteorological condition. We studied the impact of dynamic weather conditions on fine-scale movement strategies and resource selection during spring migration of adult female Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We assessed the role played by static resources such as open, lichen, and closed forest habitats and their role in a context-dependent of dynamic weather conditions, including temperature, precipitation, and changing snow water equivalent. We tested the role of static resources and dynamic conditions in three contexts: (1) whether caribou were encamped or moving using hidden Markov models; state-specific habitat selection for, and the interaction between, resources and conditions while (2) encamped and (3) moving. Weather conditions influenced the probability of moving or staying encamped, and the probability of selecting for a resource, which likely reflects the profitability of a given resource in a particular condition. The probability of staying encamped in the forest increases as temperature increases, and the probability of selecting an open area is higher when precipitation is lower. We highlight how meteorological conditions modify the selection of a static resource and likely the profitability of a given resource. The resource utility to a consumer is increasingly susceptible to climate change-induced effects.

AB  - Ocean acidification and eutrophication have direct, positive effects on the growth of many marine macroalgae, potentially resulting in macroalgal blooms and shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Enhanced growth of macroalgae, however, may be controlled by the presence of grazers. While grazing under ocean acidification and eutrophication conditions has variable responses, there is evidence of these factors indirectly increasing consumption. We tested whether a common marine herbivorous snail, Littorina littorea, would increase consumption rates of macroalgae (Ulva and Fucus) under ocean acidification (increased pCO(2)) and/or eutrophication conditions, via feeding trials on live and reconstituted algal thalli. We found that increased pCO(2) resulted in reduced grazing rates on live thalli, with snails feeding almost exclusively on Ulva. However, eutrophication did not impact consumption rates of live tissues. In addition, similarity in consumption of reconstituted Ulva and Fucus tissues across all treatments indicated that physical characteristics of algal tissues, rather than tissue chemistry, may drive dietary shifts in a changing climate. In this system, decreased consumption, coupled with increased growth of macroalgae, may ultimately enhance algal growth and spread.

AB  - Recovery of predator populations triggers conflicts due to livestock depredation losses, particularly in Germany where the wolf (Canis lupus) population grows exponentially and livestock (especially sheep) losses raise public concerns and motivate the authorities to control wolf numbers. Yet, the effects of wolf numbers and alternative factors, such as abundance of prey and livestock, on livestock losses in this country are not investigated. In this study, we collected and analyzed data on the numbers of reproductive units of wolves (packs and pairs together) as a surrogate of adult wolf numbers, sheep killed by wolves, living sheep, red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) in every German state and year from 2002 to 2019. We applied a negative binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to estimate the effects of these predictors on the numbers of sheep killed by wolves. We also examined the relationships between the percentages of killed/living sheep and the numbers of living sheep. Ranking of 63 models based on the Akaike information criterion revealed that sheep losses were determined by state, year, and number of living sheep, not by wolf numbers, at high precision and accuracy. The number of sheep killed by wolves increased consistently by 41% per year and by 30% for every additional 10,000 sheep, mainly in the north where most wolf territories are concentrated. This means that sheep are protected insufficiently and/or ineffectively. The percentages of killed/living sheep consistently increased by 0.02-0.05% per state and year, with the maximum percentage of 0.7%, on a backdrop of decreasing numbers of living sheep. In conclusion, we demonstrate that sheep losses in Germany have been driven by the expansion of the wolf population, not by wolf numbers, and by the number of sheep available. We suggest that Germany's wolf conservation policy should focus on alternative non-lethal interventions, enforcement and standardization of intervention monitoring, and promotion of wolf tolerance rather than on lethal control of wolf population size.

AB  - The present study investigated aquatic insect community of River Jatinga, one of the major north bank tributaries of Barak River, North east India. The objectives of this study were to find out spatial and seasonal distribution of aquatic insects and their functional feeding groups (FFG). Aquatic insects were collected seasonally in five different stretches of the river. Parameters like taxa richness, insect density, diversity indices, FFG%, riverbed sediment texture and particles sizes were determined. Total 37 and 38 numbers of aquatic insect families belonging to eight orders were recorded in the first and second year, respectively. In both years, the upstream sites with rocky substratum showed higher taxa richness (15) in pre monsoon and density (47.33 +/- 8.5) in winter season than that of downstream sites with sandy substratum. The size of particles gradually decreased from upstream sites to downstream sites. Boulders, cobbles, pebbles and granules mostly dominated the upstream sites (US1 and US2) while boulders and cobbles were totally absent in both downstream sites. Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Ephemeroptera and Diptera were the major orders and the major families were Psephenidae, Elmidae, Baetidae, Hydropsychidae, Leptophlebiidae, Gerridae and Simuliidae. The number of FFG types was higher in upstream sites than that of midstream and downstream sites in both years indicating preference for heterogenous habitat. The predators being mostly tolerant occurred across sites and seasons while sensitive groups like scrapers, shredders were found only in the upstream sites. Predators showed highest percentage (97.56) followed by piercers-herbivores, predators/scrapers (83.33). Canonical correspondence analysis revealed distinctive association between the insect community and particle sizes.

AB  - The arrival of a new carnivore can have important effects on local communities. While several effects of introduced alien species have been well documented, few studies have reported the ecological consequences of an expanding native species. Golden jackals (Canis aureus) are rapidly expanding their distribution in Europe, far beyond their historic range. While this raises many concerns about their potential impact on native wildlife, actual consequences are rarely recorded. Besides being a predator, the jackal is also an efficient scavenger and could function as a kleptoparasite for other predators living in areas colonized by jackals. Large felids are among the predators most vulnerable to kleptoparasitism and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) are already known to be negatively affected by several scavengers. Here we report on the first confirmed cases of jackals scavenging on lynx kills in the Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. We used camera traps to monitor scavengers at 65 lynx kills and recorded two cases of groups of jackals feeding on roe deer killed by lynx. To determine the potential for jackal kleptoparasitism on lynx at the continental level, we also calculated trends in the overlap in distribution ranges of both species in Europe. To date, jackals have colonized 13% of lynx range, including parts of two highly threatened populations. Finally, we highlight the potential impact of sympatric grey wolves (Canis lupus) to modulate this newly described jackal-lynx kleptoparasitic interaction.

AB  - Local adaptation to annually changing environments has evolved in numerous species. Seasonal coat colour change is an adaptation that has evolved in multiple mammal and bird species occupying areas that experience seasonal snow cover. It has a critical impact on fitness as predation risk may increase when an individual is mismatched against its habitat's background colour. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between landscape covariates and moult timing in a native winter-adapted herbivore, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), throughout Norway. Data was collected between 2011 and 2019 at 678 camera trap locations deployed across an environmental gradient. Based on this data, we created a Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that quantified the correlations between landscape covariates and coat colour phenology and analysed among season and year moult timing variation. Our results demonstrate that mountain hare moult timing is strongly correlated with altitude and latitude with hares that live at higher latitudes and altitudes keeping their winter white coats for longer than their conspecifics that inhabit lower latitudes and altitudes. Moult timing was also weakly correlated with climate zone with hares that live in coastal climates keeping their winter white coats for longer than hares that live in continental climates. We found evidence of some among year moult timing variation in spring, but not in autumn. We conclude that mountain hare moult timing has adapted to local environmental conditions throughout Norway.

AB  - The longstanding debate over human contribution to Pleistocene megafauna extinctions motivates our examination of plausible hunting behaviors that may have impacted prey populations. Prey size declines during the Pleistocene have been proposed as a unifying selecting agent of human evolution. Here, we identify prey selection criteria and exploitation patterns that could have increased the extinction risk for targeted species. Limited protein metabolism capacity in humans is proposed to have led to a focus on fat -rich prey, primarily large and prime adults, and selective exploitation of fatty body parts. Such behaviors may have made humanhunted species more vulnerable to population decline due to human predation alone or in combination with environmental changes. We contextualize this hypothesized mechanism within modern evolutionary theory, noting alignment with Niche Construction Theory as an explanation for the directional changes in human physiology and culture over time. The well -evidenced trend of brain expansion provides historical continuity with longer -term primate evolution, meeting recent calls for greater emphasis on ancestral connections in evolutionary models.

AB  - Extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense as climate variability increases, and these events inherently vary in their timing. We predicted that the timing of a heat wave would determine its consequences for insect communities owing to temporal variation in the susceptibility of host plants to heat stress. We subjected common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) plants to in-field experimental heat waves to investigate how the timing of heat waves, both seasonally and relative to a biotic stressor (experimental herbivory), affected their ecological consequences. We found that heat waves had multiyear, timing-specific effects on plant-insect communities. Early-season heat waves led to greater and more persistent effects on plants and herbivore communities than late-season heat waves. Heat waves following experimental herbivory had reduced consequences. Our results show that extreme climate events can have complex, lasting ecological effects beyond the year of the event-and that timing is key to understanding those effects.

AB  - For most herbivorous animals, group-living appears to incur a high cost by intensifying feeding competition. These costs raise the question of how gregariousness (i.e., the tendency to aggregate) could have evolved to such an extent in taxa such as anthropoid primates and ungulates. When attempting to test the potential benefits and costs, previous foraging models demonstrated that group-living might be beneficial by lowering variance in intake, but that it reduces overall foraging success. However, these models did not fully account for the fact that gregariousness has multiple experiences and can vary in relation to ecological variables and foraging competition. Here, we present an agent-based model for testing how ecological variables impact the costs and benefits of gregariousness. In our simulations, primate-like agents forage on a variable resource landscape while maintaining spatial cohesion with conspecifics to varying degrees. The agents' energy intake rate, daily distance traveled, and variance in energy intake were recorded. Using Morris Elementary Effects sensitivity analysis, we tested the sensitivity of 10 model parameters, of which 2 controlled gregarious behavior and 8 controlled food resources, including multiple aspects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity. We found that, while gregariousness generally increased feeding competition, the costs of gregariousness were much lower when resources were less variable over time (i.e., when calorie extraction was slow and resource renewal was frequent). We also found that maintaining proximity to other agents resulted in lower variance in energy intake when resources were more variable over time. Thus, it appears that the costs and benefits of gregariousness are strongly influenced by the temporal characteristics of food resources, giving insight into the pressures that shaped the evolution of sociality and group living, including in our own lineage.
   We developed simulations in which primate-like agents foraged on a variable resource landscape while maintaining spatial cohesion with conspecifics to varying degrees. It appears that the costs and benefits of foraging socially are strongly influenced by the temporal characteristics of food resources, giving insight into the pressures that shaped the evolution of sociality and group living, including in our own lineage.image

AB  - The purpose of our study was to measure total phenolic concentrations (TPC) of 14 species in the Phaeophyceae comprising kelp beds in the Otago Harbour Region (New Zealand). Our survey included 9 fucoids (order Fucales), 4 'true kelps' (order Laminariales), and 1 species in the order Desmarestiales over 4 seasons from multiple sheltered and wave-exposed sites. TPC observed among species varied by 2 orders of magnitude from the most concentrated in Carpophyllum flexuosum (estimated marginal mean [emmean] 212.6 +/- 24.77 mu mol per gram dry tissue weight [g DTW-1]) to the least concentrated in Lessonia variegata (emmean 10.88 +/- 2.84 mu mol g DTW-1). Within the sheltered kelp bed communities of the Otago Harbour, TPC was higher in the warmer months and lower in the cooler months within species. In the wave-exposed communities, TPC was on average higher in the spring compared to the summer within the observed community. Lastly, within one species across both inner and outer Harbour communities, a Vargha and Delaney's A measure suggests a specimen collected from the sheltered inner harbour sites would have a higher probability of being more concentrated in TPC than a specimen from the wave-exposed sites in the spring and summer (A-estimates 0.90 and 0.76, respectively) and a high probability of being more concentrated in the winter (A-estimate 0.70). Overall, variation in TPC among species within macroalgal communities suggests shifts toward more opportunistic species may impact community-wide TPC. Changes in species composition have important implications for the palatability of organic matter produced from macroalgal communities and the pathways for macroalgal-derived organic matter into coastal food webs.

Examination of the interaction between age-specific predation and chronic disease in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Journal of Animal Ecology, 00, 1-12. . Predation can alter disease dynamics in prey. If predators select for infected individuals, they can reduce disease burdens. In other cases, predators can increase disease burdens via various mechanisms such as altered prey behaviour. The influence of predation on disease dynamics is a result of interactions among various traits of the predators, prey and the pathogen itself. For example, pathogens tend to vary with age and predators typically select for certain age classes. Thus, the overlap between ages selected by predators and those infected will likely contribute to any effects of predation on reducing disease burdens. In this paper, Brandell et al. (2022) develop a model to evaluate the predator cleansing effect given age-based variation in pathogens and predation. The model was developed for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) infections in deer and elk facing predation by cougars and grey wolves in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The results indicate that predators can reduce CWD outbreak size, especially if selecting for infected individuals. CWD is an always fatal disease and this work suggests that predators could reduce disease burdens in cervids. The model is also applicable to other systems and promises to further our understanding of the role of predation on disease in prey, as well as drive future empirical studies.

AB  - Background Grasshoppers (Acridoidea, Orthoptera) are the dominant herbivores in grassland ecosystems worldwide. They can increase rangeland productivity by stimulating plant growth and accelerating nutrient cycling. This article presents a comprehensive checklist of grasshoppers in Mongolia. Until then, the available information was very scattered, based on old studies of Mongolian grasshoppers, recorded in a few international catalogues and databases, individual records and research work on agroecosystem communities. However, the available information on the composition of the Orthopteran fauna in Mongolia was sometimes unclear or non-existent and these dubious data were excluded from the present study. In addition, the grasshopper distribution analysis used the standardised personal collection of D. Altanchimeg. We also present a list of grasshoppers, as well as their distribution and abundance, in countries adjacent to Mongolia, such as Russia, China and South Korea. The surveys covered six types of natural zones: high mountain, taiga, forest-steppe, steppe, desert steppe and desert; desert steppe and steppe zones are the most widely distributed. We hope to have contributed significantly to the study of the distribution of grasshopper species in all these natural zones. New information In this study, a total of three families of Acridoidea belonging to eight subfamilies, 17 tribes, 52 genera and 128 species are reported for the various natural zones. The recorded species belong to eight subfamilies: Gomphocerinae are the most numerous with 56 species recorded, followed by Oedipodinae (51 species), Thrinchinae (nine species), Melanoplinae (six species), Calliptaminae (three species), Dericorythinae, Acridinae, Egnatiinae (one species each).

AB  - The body temperature of animals can be measured by thermistors, thermocouples, or radiotelemetry devices that are implanted surgically under the skin, although the suitability of subcutaneous temperature as an indicator of core tem-perature can be limited because of abnormal temperature readings, probably affected by ambient temperature and animal inactivity. This study compared the use of bio-loggers designed to monitor subcutaneous temperature (Tsub), with their use embedded in intravaginal sponges to measure vaginal temperature (Tvag). Three ewes were implanted with a subcutaneous temperature bio-logger that was configured to record Tsub every 30 min for a month. Ewes were given an intravaginal sponge for 12 days two days later. Inside the sponges were installed programmed bio-log-gers that measured Tvag every 5 min. The ambient temperature (Tamb) and relative humidity were monitored using mini data-loggers. Mean Tsub was lower (P < 0.001) during the day (38.02 +/- 0.02 degrees C) than at night (38.10 +/- 0.02 degrees C), with maximum Tsub (38.57 degrees C) at 20:00 h and minimum temperature (37.36 degrees C) at 08:00 h; however, mean Tvag was higher (P < 0.001) during the day (38.71 +/- 0.01 degrees C) than at night (38.62 +/- 0.01 degrees C), with maximum Tsub (39.02 degrees C) at 20:55 h and minimum temperature (38.33 degrees C) occurred at 08:25 h. Mean Tsub (38.08 +/- 0.02 degrees C) was lower (P < 0.0001) than was Tvag (38.65 +/- 0.10 degrees C) in the daytime and at night (P < 0.001). Both temperatures had a 24-h rhythm (P < 0.0001), but differed (P < 0.001) in the mean midline estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) (Tvag: 38.67 +/- 0.02 degrees C, Tsub: 38.09 +/- 0.02 degrees C), amplitude (Tvag: 0.21 degrees +/- 0.01C; Tsub: 0.25 +/- 0.01 degrees C), and acrophase (Tvag: 18:27 +/- 0.38 h, Tsub: 20:48 +/- 0.44 h). The coefficient of correlation between the two temperatures, measured simultaneously for 12 d was 0.644 (P < 0.01), and between Tamb and the two physiological temperatures, measured at the same time throughout the 12 d experiment, was 0.319 (P < 0.01) for Tsub and 0.287 (P < 0.01) for Tvag. The linear regression analysis of the 24 h circadian rhythm in Tsub and Tvag indicated a high coefficient of determination with Tvag (0.9255) and a lower coefficient of determination with Tsub (0.4292). In conclusion, the integration of a mini body temperature logger into a vaginal sponge, or their subcutaneous insertion, provided a continuous and accurate record of body temperature. Furthermore, the strong correlation between mean 24 h circadian Tvag and Tamb, demonstrated the usefulness of Tvag in biometeorological studies in sheep. As an alternative to employing these devices subcutaneously, they can also can be utilized as a biomarker of core body temperature inserted in vaginal sponges.

AB  - Change of Anthropogenic Disturbances and Its Influence on Wild Tea Survival in Shiiba, Japan. The use of traditional agricultural practices has been declining in much of the world. It is therefore essential to identify the functional links that connect human activities (i.e., livelihoods, land uses) and ecosystem components, and to understand the principles (i.e., ecological mechanisms) underlying those links in planning future local development and environmental conservation practices. In the Kyushu mountains in Japan, swidden farming (shifting cultivation) almost disappeared in the early 1960s, and the landscape shifted to plantations and secondary forests. In these areas, wild tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis), a useful plant that dominated in the early swidden fallow stage, often dominates the forest floor. We conducted a field survey and found that wild tea seemed to be surviving depending on the anthropogenic disturbances of Quercus acutissima silviculture (logging and weeding), which were similar to swidden farming in disturbance frequency. This relationship seemed to contribute to maintaining the functional link between land use and an ecosystem component (wild tea), and to the link between that component and local people by kamairi-cha (pan-fried green tea) production. Also, wild tea's response to the anthropogenic disturbances was observed as a response trait, and root biomass of wild tea seemed to contribute to maintaining its population.

AB  - Consumers can play critical roles in ecosystem resilience by modifying community resistance and recovery rates. In coral reefs, grazers can increase reef resilience by controlling algae and maintaining open space for coral recruitment, but can also erode the reef framework critical for coral recovery. Here we examine the context-dependent effects of herbivores on reef persistence in Caribbean Panam & aacute;. Using a series of lab and field experiments, we found that the erosional effects of the herbivorous reef urchin (Echinometra viridis) were 2 orders of magnitude greater on dead corals than live corals, and surveys across multiple similarly overfished reefs revealed a positive relationship between urchin densities and percent cover of bare dead coral with urchin densities exceeding 150 m-2 in some reefs. However, we observed that a mat-forming zoanthid (Zoanthus pulchellus), found exclusively on dead corals, had an inverse spatial relationship with urchins. Through a series of field experiments, we found that zoanthid overgrowth repelled urchins, increased dead coral persistence, and decreased erosion of dead corals making up the reef framework by more than 50% over a 22-month period. Our findings reveal that zoanthids can provide associational refuge to dead corals by enhancing their persistence under high urchin grazing pressure. We suggest that secondary space-holders, such as zoanthids, may play increasingly important functional roles in degraded reef systems by shielding coral skeletons from external bioeroders. Moreover, the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, which predicts that the importance of positive interactions such as associational refuges increases with consumer pressure, extends to dead foundation species such as coral skeletons crucial for ecosystem recovery.

AB  - Several studies have investigated the gut bacterial composition of wild ungulates in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. However, the relationship between their gut microbiome dendrograms and their phylogenetic tree remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed 45 amplicons (V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) from five wild ungulates-Pseudois nayaur, Pantholops hodgsonii, Gazella subgutturosa, Bos grunniens, and Equus kiang-from the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau to clarify the relationship between their phylogenies and gut microbiome dendrograms. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that G. subgutturosa is closely related to P. nayaur; however, these results were inconsistent with their phylogenetic trees. Additionally, the indicator genera in the microbiome of each wild ungulate showed strong associations with the diets and habitats of their host. Thus, diet and space niche differentiation may primarily account for the differences between the gut microbiome characteristics of these wild ungulates and their phylogeny. In summary, our research provides insights into the evolutionary factors influencing the gut microbiome of wild ungulates in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.
   This study investigated the relationship between the gut bacterial community and the phylogeny of five wild ungulates (Pseudois nayaur, Pantholops hodgsonii, Gazella subgutturosa, Bos mutus, and Equus kiang) inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using 16S rRNA gene data. The results of UPGMA and HCA were inconsistent with those of IQ-TREE, indicating that host phylogeny is not the only factor influencing the gut microbiota, and other factors, such as diet and habitat, may also have an impact. There were significant differences in gut bacterial composition among the five wild ungulates, and each species had distinctive bacterial features, primarily associated with fiber and cellulose breakdown, contributing to gastrointestinal homeostasis.image

AB  - . Globally, many grasslands have been lost or degraded via settlement, conversion to agriculture, or use as pasture. These losses have damaged the ability of migratory and nomadic birds of prey to find suitable breeding territories. Habitat restoration of degraded grasslands via the application of biosolids, the treated and sterilized remains from sewage treatment plants, improves soil water retention and nutrient profile, leading to substantial gains in plant growth and nutritive quality. Gains to wild and domestic herbivores have been documented, but impacts to predators are poorly known. Here, we test the hypothesis that biosolids-applied pastures are attractive to and support migratory and nomadic avian predators in central British Columbia, Canada. We obtained habitat records from sightings and prey remains from pellets for three vole-specialists, Long-eared Owls (Asio otus), Short-eared Owls (A. flammeus), and Northern Harriers (Circus hudsonius), as well as the generalist American Kestrels (Falco sparverius). During 5 years, the three diurnal species preferentially used biosolids-applied pastures, and kestrels and owls nested in biosolids-applied pastures or in forest patches adjacent to these pastures. Grasshoppers were more abundant on pastures with biosolids and were common prey for American Kestrels. The owls and harriers preferentially consumed voles, although Short-eared Owls consumed deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a major additional food source during years when voles were scarce. Long-eared Owls were documented only in the 2 years when voles were common. Collectively, these results suggest that biosolids-amended landscapes may attract raptors, even when vole densities are low.

AB  - Context. Regeneration Regeneration from seed and resprouting are life-history strategies used by plants in fire- prone landscapes; however, for some species there is a limited understanding of how different factors influence post-fire response within populations. Aims. We studied the effect of inter-fire interval and degree of tree burn on post-fire seedling germination and basal resprouting in Allocasuarina verticillata within two conservation parks on Kangaroo Island. Methods. We undertook seedling counts using 1 m(2) quadrats. Burnt trees were assessed for signs of resprouting. Key results. Seedling density 8-9 months post-fire was primarily influenced by interfire interval, and was higher in stands with an inter-fire interval time of 37-45 years (143 per m(2)) compared to those with an interval of >60 years (48 per m(2)). Resprouting in burnt A. verticillata trees was influenced by the degree of tree burn, but also varied considerably between the two parks. Conclusions. Our study confirmed that A. verticillata is a facultative seeder/resprouter that can regenerate from both seedling germination and resprouting post-fire. However, the two strategies are influenced by different factors, and resprouting rates in A. verticillata can be very low in some circumstances.

AB  - The impacts of microplastics on filter feeders megafauna have recently received increased attention. These or-ganisms are potentially exposed to plastic ingestion and the release of added/sorbed contaminants during feeding activities. An assessment of microplastic abundance and the chemical impact of Phthalates esters (PAEs) were performed in neustonic samples and skin biopsies of Balaenoptera physalus and Rhincodon typus inhabiting the Gulf of California (Mexico). Sixty-eight percent of the net tows contained plastics with a maximum of 0.24 items/ m3 mainly composed of polyethylene fragments. PAE levels were detected both in environmental and skin biopsy samples, with the highest values in the fin whale specimens (5291 ng/g d.w). Plasticizer fingerprint showed a similar distribution pattern between neustonic samples and filter-feeding species, with DEHP and MBP having the highest concentrations. The detection of PAE levels confirmed their potential role as plastic tracers and give preliminary information about the toxicological status of these species feeding in La Paz Bay.

AB  - This paper characterises current rewilding activities in the UK, through the analysis of 66 rewilding projects. Project information was obtained from online data (65 %), and direct mail data requests (35 %). The analyses showed an exponential growth in the number of new rewilding projects since 2010, with 8 % of projects started prior to 2000, and 60 % initiated after 2010. Seventy-three percent of projects involved rewilding areas of less than 1000 ha, 17 % being between 1000 and 10,000 ha, and 9 % greater than 10,000 ha. In Scotland, 80 % of the area being rewilded involved mountain, heath and bog habitats. For England the largest rewilded areas (58 %) were semi -natural or improved grasslands. Fifty-six percent of sites were formerly used for livestock farming, and 24 % for arable cultivation. A total of 72 % of sites employed tree planting, 64 % introduced herbivores, and 33 % introduced non -herbivores. The removal of sheep and cattle took place in 51 % of projects, with deer control in 33 %, wetland creation in 39 %, and the removal of artificial drainage in 36 % of projects. There was a close geographical proximity between rewilding sites and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with 69 % of areas being within 4 km, and only two sites greater than 8 km. Twelve project funding sources were recorded, and most projects utilised multiple funding sources. The benefits of an evidence -led and nationally co-ordinated rewilding approach were identified in relation to using well -established decision tools and frameworks to enhance future rewilding spatial planning. This would allow the development of a map of 'appropriate ' rewilding areas, based on landscape scale characteristics, national species and habitat priorities, and predicted future landscape changes. Importantly, these 'target ' areas would also be sensitive to local social, economic and agricultural contexts.

AB  - Aim Lepidoptera is a highly diverse, predominantly herbivorous insect order, with species transported to outside their native range largely facilitated by the global trade of plants and plant-based goods. Analogous to island disharmony, we examine invasion disharmony, where species filtering during invasions increases systematic compositional differences between native and non-native species assemblages, and test whether some families are more successful at establishing in non-native regions than others. Location Hawaii, North America, Galapagos, Europe, South Africa, South Korea, Japan, Nansei Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Australia, New Zealand. Taxon Lepidoptera. Methods We compared numbers of non-native, unintentionally introduced Lepidoptera species with the land area of 11 regions worldwide. Differences among native and non-native assemblages in the distribution of species among families were investigated using ordination analysis. We tested whether invasion disharmony is explained by propagule pressure (proxied by species richness in border interceptions) and if families were associated with specific trade commodities. Results In total, 741 non-native Lepidoptera species, accounting for 0.47% of the global diversity of lepidopterans, are established in at least one of the 11 regions. Crambidae, Pyralidae, Tineidae and Gracillariidae were particularly successful invaders, whereas the two most species-rich families, Erebidae and Geometridae, were under-represented among non-native Lepidoptera. Much of the variation in species numbers in the native, and less so in the non-native assemblages could be attributed to land area. Although native assemblages were similar among nearby regions, non-native assemblages were not, suggesting geography had little effect on invasion disharmony. Comparison of established with intercepted species revealed that macromoth families were generally under-represented in establishments, whereas several micromoth families were under-represented in interceptions. This discrepancy may relate to greater detectability of larger species or high propagule pressure via associations with specific invasion pathways. Main conclusions Invasion disharmony in Lepidoptera appears to be driven by processes unrelated to the success of native assemblages. While native assemblages developed through long-term evolutionary radiation, the composition of non-native assemblages is driven by differential invasion pathways and traits affecting the establishment of founder populations that vary among families.

AB  - BackgroundThe seeds of many plant species can be dispersed over long distances in animal fur (epizoochory). Quantifying epizoochory in the wild is, however, challenging, since it is difficult to measure the retention times of seeds in fur. These retention times depend on the acceleration that seeds experience and that can detach seeds from fur. Wildlife collars containing accelerometers may thus provide crucial information on epizoochorous seed dispersal. However, this is only the case if acceleration of the animal's neck (where collars are attached) is informative of acceleration of the animal's main body (where most seeds are transported).MethodsWe used accelerometers to simultaneously measure acceleration at the neck, breast and the upper hind leg of 40 individuals of eight mammal species spanning a large range of body masses (26-867 kg). We then quantified maximum acceleration as the 95%-quantile of the resultant acceleration (of all measured values in data intervals of 5 s).ResultsMaximum acceleration was comparable between the neck and breast but substantially higher at the hind leg. Maximum acceleration measured by neck collars and body mass jointly explained 81% of the variance in maximum acceleration of the breast and 62% of the variance in maximum acceleration of the leg.ConclusionsAcceleration measured by neck collars is informative of the acceleration experienced by seeds attached to other body parts (breast and leg). When combined with animal movement data and lab measurements of how fur acceleration affects seed release and retention times, widely used collar accelerometers can thus be used to assess distances of epizoochorous seed dispersal.

AB  - Conserving biodiversity with a growing human population is a key sustainability challenge. Consequently, a vast number of development initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social, economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring. However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing ???flow???, ???addition???, and ???deletion??? effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments: (1) megafauna conservation, (2) alternative livelihood programs, (3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the importance of development initiatives in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Simple Summary Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in wild grazing (WG) and domestic grazing (DG) yaks reveals distinct differences in bacterial diversity, with WG animals exhibiting a higher diversity than DG animals. Firmicutes dominate both groups, with a greater abundance in the WG type, indicating a stronger fiber-degrading capacity. WG yaks have a higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae families, which are known for their role in fiber degradation, and genus-level differences show a greater presence of fiber-degrading microbes, such as Ruminococcus and Rikenella. In contrast, DG yaks have a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae, Alloprevotella, and Succinivibrio, associated with protein and carbohydrate degradation, reflecting their different dietary habits. These differences in gut microbiota composition suggest that feeding patterns are crucial in shaping the microbial community, influencing yak health and environmental adaptation. The findings presented herein have significant implications for livestock production, highlighting the importance of considering the impact of grazing practices on gut microbiota, and providing valuable insights for developing prebiotics and microbiological agents tailored to specific dietary needs. The gut microbiota is a diverse and complex population, and it has a key role in the host's health and adaptability to the environment. The present study investigated the fecal bacterial community of wild grazing (WG) and domestic grazing (DG) yaks on natural grazing pastures, analyzing the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing to assess bacterial diversity. A total of 48 yak fecal samples were selected from two different grazing habitats. The DG group had more crude proteins and non-fiber carbohydrates. The WG group had more OM, insoluble dietary fiber such as NDF, ADF, ether extract, and TC. There were 165 and 142 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the WG and DG groups, respectively. Shannon index analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity in the WG group than in the DG group. At the phylum level, Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial taxa in both groups. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the WG group was higher than in the DG group. At the family level, the WG group had a significantly higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae (p < 0.001) and Rikenellaceae (p < 0.001) than the DG group. The abundances of Alloprevotella and Succinivibrio were more pronounced in the DG group than in the WG group at the genus level. This study presents a novel understanding of the bacterial communities of ruminants and their potential applications for livestock production.

AB  - Background Birch species such as Betula pendula have conspicuous white bark and the evolutionary drivers for this colouration remain unresolved. Aims We evaluated our hypothesis that the white bark is a visual warning signal to deter mammals from bark-stripping. Many species of deer (Cervidae) and multiple other mammals consume bark. White birch species' bark contains betulin and other compounds that likely make the bark unprofitable for herbivores. The white bark has features consistent with a visual signal for mammalian herbivores and could act as a visual aposematic signal of chemical defence. Methods We compared deer bark-stripping between tree species in Scottish woodlands. For Betula pendula, we compared stripping of juvenile brown bark with mature white bark. We also reviewed existing literature to find the tree-species preference for a wide-range of bark-stripping mammals. Results In Scotland, we found that white-barked birch bark was less preferred. We also found mature white birch bark was avoided compared to juvenile brown bark. Existing literature for multiple herbivores showed that white birch species' bark was often either not preferred or avoided. Conclusion We suggest that the conspicuous white colouration of birch bark may act as an aposematic visual signal to deter bark-stripping mammals.

AB  - Deer surveys play an important role in the estimation of local ecological balance. In the Chitwan National Park of Nepal, the dense tree canopies and tall vegetation often obscure the presence of wild deer, which has a negative effect on the accurate population surveys of wild deer. UAVs equipped with infrared sensors have been increasingly used to monitor wild deer by capturing a lot of images. How to automatically recognize and obtain the number of deer objects from thermal images is becoming an important research topic. Due to the difference between thermal images and true-color images, as well as the variations in deer object sizes in these two types of images, current ready-to-use object detection models, designed for true-color imagery, are ill-suited for the task of detecting small deer objects within thermal imagery. In this paper, an enhanced Faster R-CNN was constructed to detect small deer objects from thermal images, in which a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) based on a residual network is used to improve feature extraction for small deer objects and multi-scale feature map constrution for the subsequent region proposals searching, bounding box regression, and regions of interest (RoIs) classification. In addition, small-scaled anchor boxes and a multi-scale feature map selection criterion are devised to improve the detection accuracy of small objects. Finally, based on Faster R-CNN, FPN, and different residual networks including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152, we constructed five object detection models, and evaluated their detection performance by using COCO evaluation matrix. Under the condition of IoU >= 0.5, the integration of Faster R-CNN, FPN, and ResNet18 demonstrated to perform better than others. Specifically, The COCO evaluation results revealed an Average Precision (AP) score of 91.6% for all deer objects. Small deer objects (area <= 200 pixels) achieved an AP score of 73.6%, medium deer objects (200 < area <= 400 pixels) demonstrated an AP score of 93.4%, and large deer objects (area > 400 pixels) achieved the highest AP score of 94.3%. Our research is helpful for effective wild deer monitoring and conservation and can be a valuable reference for the exploration of small object detection from low-resolution thermal images.

AB  - Personal exposure studies suffer from uncertainty issues, largely stemming from individual behaviour uncertainties. Built on spatial-temporal exposure analysis and methods, this study proposed a novel approach to spatial-temporal modelling that incorporated behaviour classifications taking into account uncertainties, to estimate individual livestock exposure potential. The new approach was applied in a community-based research project with a Tribal community in the southwest United States to address questions on potential livestock exposure to abandoned uranium mines (AUMs). The study aimed to 1) classify Global Positioning System (GPS) data from livestock into three behaviour subgroups - grazing, travelling or resting; 2) calculate the daily cumulative exposure potential for livestock; 3) assess the performance of the computational method with and without behaviour classifications. Using Lotek Litetrack GPS collars, we collected data at a 20-min-interval for two flocks of sheep and goats during the spring and summer of 2019. Analysis and modelling of GPS data demonstrated no significant difference in individual cumulative exposure potential within each flock when animal behaviours with probability/uncertainties were considered. However, when daily cumulative exposure potential was calculated without consideration of animal behaviour or probability/uncertainties, significant differences among animals within a herd were observed, which does not match animal grazing behaviours reported by livestock owners. These results suggest that the proposed method including behaviour subgroups with probability/uncertainties more closely resembled the observed grazing behaviours. Results from the research may be used for future intervention and policy-making on remediation efforts in communities where grazing livestock may encounter environmental contaminants.

AB  - Conflicts between economic development and conservation are increasingly hampering efforts to restore imperiled wildlife populations. Public opinion can influence how these conflicts translate into conservation actions, encouraging stakeholders to express their views through various public channels. The outcome of these campaigns typically remains unknown. Via an online survey, we collected to the opinion of 1000 citizens of Quebec, Canada, regarding the ongoing conflict between logging and the conservation of at-risk caribou populations (Rangifer tarandus). We found that people expect conservation actions that are sufficient to recover caribou populations, even if millions of government investment are required and jobs are lost in the process. When respondents learned that academic caribou researchers indicated that the two management strategies being studied by government would be insufficient for population recovery, one-third withdrew their support for either strategy. Age, gender and education all explain variation in public opinion, but it was the region of residence that most consistently explained variation in opinion. Residents of caribou-inhabited regions were less concerned about caribou conservation and more supportive of forestry than residents of other regions, reflecting regional differences in expected economic impacts of conservation, not negative interactions with caribou. In fact, most people supported strong conservation actions for the recovery of caribou populations, regardless of their socio-demographics. Our analysis provides general insights into how public opinion on the trade-off between conservation and economy is influenced by socio-demographics and scientific conclusions. We found that current government conservation actions (or lack thereof) are not in line with mainstream public opinion.

AB  - Sheep are important livestock animals that have evolved under various ecological pressures. Xinjiang is a region with diverse and harsh environments that have shaped many local sheep breeds with unique characteristics and environmental adaptability. However, these breeds are losing ecological flexibility due to the promotion of intensive farming practices. Here we sequenced 14 local sheep breeds from Xinjiang and analyzed their genetic structure and gene flow with other sheep breeds from neighboring regions. The Tibetan Plateau was the geographic origin of Xinjiang native sheep evolution. We performed genome-environment association analysis and identified Bio9: Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter and Bio15: Precipitation Seasonality as the key envi-ronmental factors affecting Xinjiang local sheep and the key genes involved in their survival and adaptation. We classified Xinjiang native sheep breeds into six groups based on their differential genes by pairwise selective sweep analysis and Community Network Analysis. We analyzed transcriptome expression data of 832 sheep tissues and detected tissue-specific enrichment of six group-specific genes in different biological systems. Our results revealed the genetic basis of year-round estrus, drought tolerance, hypoxia resistance, and cold tolerance traits of Xinjiang sheep breeds. Moreover, we proposed conservation strategies for Xinjiang local sheep breeds and provided theoretical guidance for breeding new sheep breeds under global extreme environments.

AB  - Animal personality should be highly relevant to recovery of species following habitat restoration, but empirical evaluations remain scarce. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the southwestern United States and globally, grasslands are threatened with shrub encroachment, prompting landscape-scale restoration efforts to remove shrubs and improve habitat for grassland species. We examined the behavioural response of a keystone rodent of grasslands, banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis, to extensive shrub removal efforts in New Mexico, U.S.A. We captured individuals from replicated restoration and remnant grassland habitats and used standardized behavioural assays to determine whether D. spectabilis exhibits personality and whether it varies between restoration and remnant habitats. We also conducted a movement experiment using artificial shrubs to test whether personality mediates movement choices through shrub cover, which could be a mechanism contributing to the colonization dynamics of restoration sites. We found repeatable differences among individuals for multiple behaviours, including movements, providing evidence of personality. We also documented a syndrome in which bolder and more active individuals moved through movement trials quicker, indicating personality-dependent movement. Dipodomys spectabilis also exhibited personality-dependent movement through artificial shrub cover, suggesting the choice to move through shrublands may depend on personality. This result could have consequences for colonization dynamics of restoration sites if a subset of individuals is more likely to traverse low-quality shrublands and settle in habitats treated for shrub removal. Surprisingly, there was weak divergence in behavioural traits at the population level between restoration sites and remnant grasslands. This outcome could reflect personality-dependent colonization early in the restoration trajectory being eroded by subsequent gene flow and facilitation of alternative behavioural types.

AB  - The weight-length relationship (WLR) of fish is a crucial tool in fish biology research and has received extensive attention. However, fish growth is influenced by many factors, and the WLR also changes accordingly. Our aim was to investigate how fish body shape is affected by various factors by analyzing the existing parameters of the relationship between fish body length and weight. We analyzed 198,354 fish specimens belonging to 402 species of 82 families in China and investigated the change of fish body shape in the function of their ecology. Herbivorous fish tended to be shorter and fatter than carnivorous fish, and omnivorous fish fall somewhere in between. This difference could be due to variations in feeding habits and the availability of food sources. Additionally, fish living in lentic waters tended to have a shorter and fatter body shape compared to those living in lotic waters. This could be attributed to differences in swimming behavior in these environments. Furthermore, our results showed that the b value decreased as altitude increased, and fish tended to be thinner and longer due to lower oxygen and temperature levels in high-altitude waters. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the WLR of fish and the impact of multiple factors on fish body shape.

AB  - Simple Summary Human cases of Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), diagnosed serologically by immunofluorescence assay, have recently been reported in the Goias state, midwestern Brazil. Because serological cross-reactions among different rickettsial species that belong to the spotted fever group (SFG) are common, the agent responsible for the BSF cases in Goias remains unknown. We evaluated the presence of anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies in dogs, horses and capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), as well as rickettsial DNA in ticks collected from these animals and from the environment, in an area where BSF cases have been reported and two areas under surveillance in Goias. The DNA of Rickettsia that did not belong to the SFG was detected in Amblyomma dubitatum, which was identified by DNA sequencing as Rickettsia bellii. Seroreactivity to SFG and R. bellii antigens was detected in dogs, horses and capybaras, with higher titers for R. bellii in dogs and capybaras. These data demonstrate the circulation of SFG rickettsiae in the region and the need for further research to definitively determine the agent responsible for rickettsiosis cases in this area. Brazilian spotted fever (BSF) is the most important tick-borne diseases affecting humans in Brazil. Cases of BSF have recently been reported in the Goias state, midwestern Brazil. All cases have been confirmed by reference laboratories by seroconversion to Rickettsia rickettsii antigens. Because serological cross-reactions among different rickettsial species that belong to the spotted fever group (SFG) are common, the agent responsible for BSF cases in Goias remains unknown. From March 2020 to April 2022, ticks and plasma were collected from dogs, horses and capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), and from the vegetation in an area where BSF cases have been reported and two areas under epidemiological surveillance in Goias. Horses were infested by Amblyomma sculptum, Dermacentor nitens and Rhipicephalus microplus; dogs by Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.), Amblyomma ovale and A. sculptum, and capybaras by A. sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum. Adults of A. sculptum, A. dubitatum, Amblyomma rotundatum and immature stages of A. sculptum and A. dubitatum, and Amblyomma spp. were collected from the vegetation. DNA of Rickettsia that did not belong to the SFG was detected in A. dubitatum, which was identified by DNA sequencing as Rickettsia bellii. Seroreactivity to SFG and Rickettsia bellii antigens was detected in 25.4% (42/165) of dogs, 22.7% (10/44) of horses and 41.2% (7/17) of capybaras, with higher titers for R. bellii in dogs and capybaras. The seropositivity of animals to SFG Rickettsia spp. antigens demonstrates the circulation of SFG rickettsiae in the region. Further research is needed to fully determine the agent responsible for rickettsiosis cases in this area.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify the risk regions of wild boar incidents in China and to draw a risk map. Risk maps can be used to plan the prioritization of preventive measures, increasing management effectiveness from both a short- and a long-term perspective. We used a web crawler (web information access technology) to obtain reports of wild boar incidents from China's largest search engine (Baidu) and obtained 196 valid geographic locations of wild boar incidents from the reports. Subsequently, a system of environmental variables-with climate, topography, landscape, and human disturbance as the main variable types-was constructed, based on human-land-system thinking. Finally, the Maxent model was applied to predict the risk space of wild boar incidents in China by integrating the geographic location information for wild boar incidents with the environmental variables. We observed that the types of environmental variables that contributed to wild boar incidents were in the descending order of climate (40.5%) > human disturbance (25.2%) > landscape (24.4%) > topography (9.8%). Among the 14 environmental variables, annual precipitation, the GDP index, and the mean annual temperature were the main environmental variables. The distance from woodland, distance from cultivated land, and elevation were the secondary environmental variables. The response curves of the environmental variables demonstrated that the highest probability of wild boar incidents occurred when the annual average temperature was 16 C-degrees, the annual precipitation was 800 mm, and the altitudes were 150 m and 1800 m. The probability of wild boar incidents decreased with an increase in the distance from cultivated and forested land, and increased sharply and then levelled off with an increase in the GDP index. Approximately 12.18% of China was identified as being at a high risk of wild boar incidents, mainly on the eastern side of the Huhuanyong Line.

AB  - Despite a vast number of studies about shallow reef fish assemblages, and an increasing amount of studies about mesophotic ones, there are very few cross-shelf assessments including both, shallow and mesophotic depths. Herein, we analyze changes in reef fish assemblages in a cross-shelf euphotic-mesophotic (19-72.6 m) gradient in tropical SW Atlantic. Data was obtained using a novel low-cost 360 degrees stationary video system. Sixty-four species from thirty families were identified. Depth, distance offshore and proportion of consolidated substrate were the main predictors of fish assemblages' structure. Four distinct fish assemblages were identified across the depth gradient (20-30, 30-40, 40-50 and 50-75 m), with marked shifts in composition, abundance, and trophic structure. Abundance of invertebrate feeders and large roving herbivores declined across the shelf and with increasing depth, while abundance of planktivores and piscivores increased, particularly below 50 m. These changes were likely caused by changes in food availability and habitat suitability. Our low-cost video system yielded high-resolution images that enabled us to accurately survey reef fish assemblages, being therefore a useful method for studies focusing on both, euphotic and mesophotic reef ecosystems. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how reef fish assemblages change with increasing depth in SW Atlantic reefs and corroborate the idea that the breakpoint between euphotic and mesophotic fish assemblages is contextdependent rather than previously defined as 30 m depth.

AB  - Aim Terrestrial deposition of aerosol marine sodium declines with distance from coastlines. Salt deprivation in vertebrate herbivores and salt-seeking behaviours should hence increase with distance inland. We analyse published geospatial data on ungulate-patronized salt licks to test whether they are non-randomly distributed relative to distance from oceans and elevation. Location Canada, Alaska and the contiguous United States. Taxon Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). Methods We determined the land area and median elevation of 100 km increments from the North American coast. The null model of the expected number of licks within each interval was determined by the ratio of the interval's land area to the total land area, multiplied by the total number of licks. We asked whether the number of licks further from coastlines was significantly higher than chance. We also assessed whether licks occur disproportionately at higher elevations, comparing the median elevation of observed licks to the median elevation within each interval. Results We found a strong positive relationship between salt lick patronage by ungulates and distance from the coast. Licks occurred significantly less often within, and more often beyond, 500 km inland, and at significantly higher elevations than would be expected by chance. Main conclusions These findings indicate that the patronage of salt licks is constrained geographically, and that the foraging behaviour of ungulates and other phytophagous vertebrate taxa may be influenced over large spatial scales by sodium availability. Salt-seeking behaviour varies on a wide biogeographical scale across North America, with concomitant implications for vertebrate herbivore behaviour and ecology.

AB  - Populations at the leading front of a range expansion must rapidly adapt to novel conditions. Increased epigenetic diversity has been hypothesized to facilitate adaptation and population persistence via non-genetic phenotypic variation, especially if there is reduced genetic diversity when populations expand (i.e., epigenetic diversity compensates for low genetic diversity). In this study, we use the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic diversity to test this hypothesis in populations of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) sampled across a purported recent range expansion gradient. We found mixed support for the epigenetic compensation hypothesis and a lack of support for expectations for expansion populations of mice at the range edge, which likely reflects a complex history of expansion in white-footed mice in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Specifically, epigenetic diversity was not increased in the population at the purported edge of the range expansion in comparison to the other expansion populations. However, input from an additional ancestral source populations may have increased genetic diversity at this range edge population, counteracting the expected genetic consequences of expansion, as well as reducing the benefit of increased epigenetic diversity at the range edge. Future work will expand the focal populations to include expansion areas with a single founding lineage to test for the robustness of a general trend that supports the hypothesized compensation of reduced genetic diversity by epigenetic variation observed in the expansion population that was founded from a single historical source.

AB  - More than half of the fish biomass of coastal rocky reefs depends on zooplankton; however, the trophic basis of estuarine fish assemblages remains unknown. We quantified the trophic basis (i.e. basal energy sources) of fish community biomass inhabiting three habitat types (seagrass, natural reef and artificial reef) in two estuaries, compared with two coastal rocky reef sites. Fish assemblages were surveyed with Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUVs) and the species abundance, richness and biomass of fish were classified into nine functional feeding groups (6 teleost and 3 elasmobranch). Comparable metrics for coastal fish assemblages were obtained from published surveys using BRUVs. Using the functional feeding group biomass and the group-specific diet composition, the breakdown of energy sources was calculated using a food web analysis. Estuarine reef habitats had different species and different functional feeding group composition than seagrass habitat. The majority of fish biomass in the seagrass habitat was supported by detritus (51% in Botany Bay) or macrophytes (58% in Lake Macquarie). In contrast, zooplankton supported most fish biomass (45-59%) at the coastal reef locations, and in reef habitat in one estuary (35-43%), but not the other estuary (33-34%). Trophic pathways which support fish assemblages, are key in identifying mitigation measures which can help conserve these populations with growing urbanisation of estuaries and coasts.

AB  - Alpine meadow ecosystem are undergoing the divergent successions under the influence of global climate warming and overgrazing by herbivores, which may profoundly impact the ecohydrology function of alpine meadow ecosystem. However, few studies reported the effects of the divergent successions on ecohydrological process of alpine meadow. Here, we report an in situ experiment to examine the effects of the divergent successions on soil pore structure, infiltration rate and evapotranspiration of the two types of divergent-succession meadows (the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow), compared to the normal alpine meadow. Results showed that both the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow significantly reduced the dominant Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage, soil compactness, and belowground biomass, but significantly increased soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05) compared to the normal alpine meadow. Soil infiltration rate was significantly negatively correlated with Kobresia spp. coverage, soil compactness and belowground biomass, while significantly positively correlated with soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05). Therefore, the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow increased soil infiltration rates not only by reducing the dominated Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage and belowground biomass, but also by increasing soil non-capillary porosity. Compared with the normal alpine meadow, the cumulative infiltration and evapotranspiration increased by 245.25% and 45.19% in the shrub-encroached meadows, and increased by 208.23% and 29.95% in the severely degraded meadow. However, short-term grazing exclusion presented little effect on soil infiltration rate in alpine meadows. Overall, the divergent successions of alpine meadows had a greater impact on soil water replenishment and evapotranspiration than the short-term grazing exclusion. These findings can help to better understand the impacts of the divergent community succession on the ecohydrological process in alpine grassland ecosystem.

AB  - The El Nino represents a substantial threat to pastures, affecting the availability of water, forage and compromising the sustainability of grazing areas, especially in the northern region of Brazil. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the thermographic profile of three production systems in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. The study was conducted on a rural cattle farm in Mojui dos Campos, Para, Brazil, between August and November 2023. The experiment involved livestock production systems, including traditional, silvopastoral and integrated, with different conditions of shade and access to the bathing area. An infrared thermographic (IRT) camera was used, recording temperatures in different zones, such as areas with trees, pastures with forage and exposed pastures. The highest mean temperatures (p = 0.02) were observed in pastures with full sun from August to November. On the other hand, the lowest average temperatures were recorded in areas shaded by chestnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa). The highest temperature ranges were found in sunny areas and the lowest were recorded in shaded areas. The highest temperatures were observed in the pasture in full sun, while the lowest were recorded in areas shaded by chestnut trees (p < 0.0001). The interaction between the systems and treatments revealed significant temperature differences (p < 0.0001), with the native trees showing an average temperature of 35.9 degree celsius, lower than the grasses and soil, which reached 61.2 degree celsius. This research concludes that, under El Nino in the Eastern Amazon, areas shaded by Brazil nut trees had lower temperatures, demonstrating the effectiveness of shade. Native trees, compared to grasses and soil, showed the ability to create cooler environments, highlighting the positive influence on different species such as sheep, goats and cattle.

AB  - There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the basic ecology of many mammal species that inhabit the Neotropical region. The mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii) is an elusive Neotropical rodent, catalogued as "Near Threatened" by the IUCN and whose ecology is largely unknow. To better understand its dietary ecology, we first conducted a literature review on its diet, determining it as primarily herbivorous-frugivorous. However, through a field experiment using photo-trapping in the Madrigal del Podocarpus Reserve (southern Ecuador) to identify the vertebrate scavenger assemblage, we documented for the first time, an unexpected behaviour of this species consuming a significant amount of carrion. This unexpected finding challenges previous assumptions about the mountain paca's diet and raises important questions about its ecological role and the importance of carrion in ecosystems. Our study underscores the need to further explore carrion ecology and its significance in the understudied and biodiverse tropical Andes.

AB  - Unraveling the mechanisms causing restricted regeneration and limited distribution range has become a core issue for biodiversity conservation. Anthropogenic disturbances are changing a variety of ecological factors, but how their relative importance varies across multiple regeneration stages is still unclear even in a single species. In this study, we focused on Metasequoia glyptostroboides, a relict species suffering a severely restricted regeneration in the wild, and performed controlled experiments using 54,600 seeds to investigate seedling emergence and growth in both its natural and adjacent unoccupied habitats to disentangle the roles of seed availability, interspecific competition and herbivore/omnivore attack across early regeneration stages. Our results showed that these factors mainly exerted their predominant effects at initial regeneration stages. Compared with herbivore/ omnivore attack, seed availability and interspecific competition were the crucial factors regulating seedling emergence. The first-year seedling survival rate was only significantly influenced by interspecific competition, and the survival of second-year seedlings was independent of all these factors. Moreover, we detected similar impacts of these factors in the adjacent unoccupied habitats to those in the natural habitats, indicating their roles in limiting population expansion. Our findings provide some suggestions to assist the natural regeneration and range expansion of M. glyptostroboides, and our experiment design can be applied in the assessment of endangerment causes for other endangered plants.

AB  - Evidence from increasing mineralization, micropollutant concentrations, waterborne epidemics, an algal boom, and dissolved organic matter has provided substantial evidence that climate change impacts water quality. While the impact of the extreme hydrological event (EHE) on water quality (WQ) has aroused considerable research interest, research uncertainty has been premised on WQ data scarcity, a short time frame, data non-linearity, data structure, and environmental biases on WQ. This study conceptualized a categorical and periodic correlation using confusion matrices and wavelet coherence for varying standard hydrological drought index (SHDI; 1971-2010) and daily WQ series (1977-2011) of four spatially distinct basins. By condensing the WQ variables using chemometric analyses, confusion matrices were assessed by cascading the SHDI series into 2-, 3-, and 5-phase scenarios. 2-phase revealed an overall accuracy (0.43-0.73), sensitivity analysis (0.52-1.00), and Kappa coefficient (- 0.13 to 0.14), which declines substantially with the phase increase, suggesting the disruptive impact of EHE on WQ. Wavelet coherence depicted the substantial (R-n(2)(u, s) = 0.5 ) mid-and long-term (8-32 days; 6-128 days) co-movement of streamflow over WQ, confirming the varying sensitivity of WQ variables. Land use/land cover mapping and the Gibbs diagram corroborate the eventful WQ evolution by EHE and their spatial variability concerning landscape transformation. Overall, the study deduced that hydrologic extreme triggers substantial WQ disruption with dissimilar WQ sensitivity. Consequently, suitable chemometric indicators of EHE impacts such as WQ index, nitrate-nitrogen, and Larson index at designated landscapes were identified for extreme chemodynamics impact assessment. This study proffers a recommendation for monitoring and managing the impact of climate change, floods, and drought on water quality.

AB  - Ghee is a traditional Tibetan dairy product with high-fat content, low yield, plasticity, caseation, and rich nutrition. In this study, we analyzed the diversity of microbial communities in yak milk and ghee samples at high and low altitudes, especially the Lactobacillus genus, and further used metabolomic techniques to compare the differences in metabolites in yak ghee at different altitudes. The results showed that the increase in altitude had a significant and generally inhibitory effect on the microbial community diversity in milk ghee, and yak milk at high altitude was abundant in nutrients, which could antagonize the negative impact of increased altitude. Using non-targeted metabolomics, we infer the composition of flavor compounds in ghee: nine kinds of carboxylic acids, 11 kinds of esters, six kinds of ketones, two kinds of alcohols, and four kinds of alkene compounds, among which the key flavor compounds are dl-2-(acetylamino)-3-phenylephrine acid, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone, sebacic acid, Lysope 18:1, and uracil 1-beta-d-arabinofuranoside. These flavor substances are found in Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus. With the participation of Lactobacillus, it is synthesized through biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from ornithine, lysine, and nicotine acid and glyoxylate and decarboxylate metabolism, among which Lactococcus plays a key role. In this study, a variety of lactic acid bacteria related to ghee fermentation were screened out, revealing the composition of volatile flavor compounds in Gannan yak milk ghee in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and providing a reference for further key volatile flavor compounds and the formation mechanism of flavor compounds.

AB  - Treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD) is an emergent disease of elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Pacific West of the United States. Although lesions are usually restricted to the feet, anecdotal reports suggested increased prevalence of abnormal antlers in affected elk. We used hunter harvest reports for 1,688 adult male elk harvested in southwestern Washington, USA, during 2016-2018, to evaluate anecdotal reports. We used Akaike's Information Criterion to compare 18 logistic regression models describing the prevalence of asymmetrical antlers, indicated by unequal antler point counts. Our leading model (84% of model weight) described additive effects of TAHD (odds ratio = 1.91; 95% CI = [1.49, 2.44]) and maximum number of antler points. Confidence intervals overlapped zero for all other parameters, which described ecotypic, geographic, and age-related effects. Effects of physical injury on antler development have been described elsewhere; however, injuries leading to instances of antler deformity do not have population-level management implications. In contrast, we describe effects of a transmissible disease that was reported by hunters in >35% of adult male elk and was associated with an increase of >= 16 percentage points in the prevalence of gross asymmetry. Unequal point counts are quite common in elk with otherwise typical antlers and seem unlikely to attract public notice or be attributed to hoof lesions; thus, we suspect our results and anecdotal reports reflect more prominent deformities that are important to stakeholders who enjoy hunting and wildlife viewing.

AB  - Prioritizing candidate areas to achieve species richness representation is relatively straightforward when distributions are known for many taxa; however, it may be challenging in data-poor regions. One approach is to focus on the distribution of a few charismatic species in areas that overlap with areas with little human influence, and another is to expand protection in the vicinity of existing protected areas. We assessed the effectiveness of these two approaches for protecting the potential distribution of 21 bird species affiliated with the piedmont dry forest in Argentina. We assessed the degree to which current protected areas met the representation target for each bird species. We found that 8% of the piedmont dry forest and 11% of the extent of occurrence of the bird species within piedmont dry forest were protected, indicating a shortfall. Areas with little human influence that overlap with the distribution of charismatic species had a higher number of bird species than areas with high human influence. Areas within the vicinity of protected areas performed similarly to priority areas, but included high human influence areas. We suggest that a prioritization scheme based on areas of charismatic species distribution that overlap with areas of low human influence can function as an effective surrogate for bird species affiliated with the piedmont dry forest in Argentina. Our results have operational implications for conservation planning in those regions of the world where biodiversity data are poor, but where decisions and actions to sustain biodiversity are urgently needed.

AB  - Simple Summary Numerous palm oil byproducts are already employed as livestock energetic feed supplements, and the inclusion of palm oil deodorizer distillate (POD) presents a potential addition to cost-effective feed alternatives. However, the presence of high-fatty-acid diets could alter the ruminal environment, potentially influencing the digestive efficiency. This study aimed to assess the impact of POD on the digestive system of sheep. Twenty sheep were fed different diets containing varying amounts of palm oil deodorizer, and their rumen fluid was analyzed for the microbial composition and digestive efficiency. The microbial community in the rumen was primarily composed of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, with minor changes occurring when the POD was added to the diet. Up to 25 g of POD per kilogram of dry matter negatively affected the ruminal fermentation or apparent digestibility, but not to a high degree, indicating that POD is a viable and cost-effective supplement for sheep diets. However, higher POD levels hindered the breakdown of fibrous material in the rumen and overall dry matter digestibility. These findings suggest that while POD can be a beneficial and economical option for sheep nutrition, carefully considering its dosage is crucial for maintaining optimal digestive function and nutrient utilization, offering valuable insights for sustainable and efficient livestock feeding practices.Abstract This study aimed to assess the impact of palm oil deodorizer distillate (POD) on the ruminal environment, including (i) microbial community, (ii) ruminal degradability, and (iii) apparent digestibility in sheep. The data used were derived from twenty rumen-cannulated sheep fed five isoproteic and isofiber diets based on elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Roxo) silage supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 g kg-1 POD on a dry matter (DM) basis. Rumen fluid samples were collected three hours after feeding directly from the ventral sac of the rumen via a cannula and then subjected to DNA extraction, which was subsequently used for 16S rDNA amplification, followed by sequencing and diversity analysis. In this study, the microbial diversity was dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, followed by Euryarchaetoa, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes, in the ruminal environment, and was slightly modified when supplemented with the POD up to 100 g/kg (10%), leading to only a slight decrease in the diversity index. The ruminal degradability, ruminal fermentation parameters, and apparent digestibility were slightly compromised by the inclusion of up to 25 g of POD per kg of DM, and larger inclusions interfered with the ruminal degradability of fibrous fractions and the apparent digestibility of dry matter. This lipid supplement showed good results for feeding sheep and is an inexpensive and abundant alternative in the regional market.

AB  - Today, the overgrowth of woody and shrubby vegetation on former agricultural lands is a serious problem. The aim of this research has been to investigate age-related changes in the forest inventory indicators of forest stands on abandoned farmlands. Taking into account the temporal factor when monitoring the carbon budget allows identifying a number of processes in the dynamics of carbon sequestration that cannot be estimated in a single study. To address this issue, data from permanent sample plots have been analyzed in 2011 with repeated measurements in 2023. The sample plots are located on the abandoned farmlands on the border of the Krasnoyarsk forest-steppe area. The dynamics of the process of overgrowth and development of plantations has shown that as the abandoned farmlands form, in addition to the dominant Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.), silver birch ( Betula pendula Roth) and aspen ( Populus tremula L.), Siberian larch ( Larix sibirica Ledeb.), Siberian spruce ( Picea obovata Ledeb.) and goat willow ( Salix caprea L.) are also found. The dynamic process of pine abandoned farmlands has been established over a period of 15 to 27 years after land abandonment. The mixed plantations of various successional origins have ranged in age from 10 to 30 years old. Various processes have been observed in the research plots in terms of changes in the density of abandoned farmlands (overgrowth, thinning). The reforestation of abandoned farmlands occurs from the forest border and at a distance of up to 50 m continues after 30 years. The abandoned farmlands are characterized by various forms of overgrowth: clumps, biogroups, complete and by single trees. The average quantitative assessment has shown that that the most intense changes in height, diameter, height to the crown base, height to the largest crown width, and crown diameters have occurred in the test area where the minimum density has been observed, which has been decreasing dynamically. In the plot with the maximum density, morphological indicators have been characterized by an average increase. Minimal changes have been recorded in the sample plot where the density has increased significantly over 12 years. The growth rate of trees of the same diameter in height has been greater in 2023 compared to 2011. It is possible that this has been influenced by a combination of external and internal factors, including climate change. To assess the carbon productivity of forest stands growing on the abandoned farmlands, it is advisable to use regression equations developed for a specific area. The results of the study of the dynamics of carbon sequestration by young forests growing on the abandoned farmlands indicate the feasibility of using postagrarian lands for the implementation of forest climate projects.

AB  - The Asian elephant is mostly confined to mountainous ranges and therefore risks population fragmentation if hard protected area (PA) boundaries near steep slopes prevent movement. We tested whether elephant gene flow is (i) controlled by slope and (ii) affected by the interplay between barriers and slope. We used 176 unique genotypes obtained non-invasively from fresh elephant dung to assess individual-by-individual genetic distance across the Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot. To assess landscape distance, 36 resistance models were produced by transforming a slope raster. Core areas and corridors were calculated from the raster that provided the best correlation between the genetic and distance matrices. The influence of the closure of PAs on gene flow was examined for one region, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The best resistance raster obtained by transforming the slope occupancy model was better than Euclidean distance for explaining genetic distance, indicating that slope partially controls gene flow. Fencing elephant PAs on hilly terrain reduces core areas and disrupts corridors. Consequently, hard PA boundaries abutting slopes can fragment elephant populations, but this can be ameliorated by protecting the adjacent flatter terrain.

AB  - Forest roads are an important part of forest management, both in terms of cost and impact on surrounding ecosystems. Existing tools to simulate the construction of forest roads have been designed for tactical or operational planning purposes, for relatively small areas (<10 000 ha) and small-scale topographic information. Hence, no forest road simulation tool properly exists to assist forest landscape ecology and management research. Here, we present the Forest Roads Simulation (FRS) extension for the LANDIS-II model--a spatially explicit landscape simulation model of forest succession and disturbances. The FRS extension simulates forest road networks via a least-cost path algorithm accounting for landscape structure, decision inputs, and forest road types. We demonstrate the accuracy with which the FRS extension reproduces several key characteristics of existing road networks in two managed regions in Quebec, Canada: road density, road position, and fragmentation of the landscape. The FRS extension is easy to parameterize, proposing many options for researchers to simulate forest road networks at a strategic level in managed landscapes. It can tackle new research questions investigating the effects of forest roads within management strategies, such as the cost of road construction and habitat fragmentation, across large management units and long planning horizons.

AB  - Plant resource allocation strategies are thought to be largely a consequence of changing abiotic conditions and evolutionary history. However, biotic interactions also influence how a plant allocates resources. As a result, plants mediate indirect interactions between organisms above- and belowground through resource allocation. Neighboring plants can influence plant fitness directly through competition for resources, and indirectly by altering associated community interactions (associational effects), such as pollination, herbivory, and a suite of belowground interactions. Given the importance of community interactions for plant success, and the known ability for plant neighbors to change these interactions, the goal of this "pandemic project" was to understand how heterospecific plant neighbors alter plant resource allocation, whether this occurred through above- or belowground mechanisms, and whether this in turn alters biotic interactions and the relationship between a focal plant and its herbivore and soil community interactions. To do so, we established a common garden experiment, manipulating plant neighbor identity and the extent of interaction among neighbors (aboveground only, vs. above- and belowground interactions, using customized pot types), and measured changes to a focal plant and its biotic interactions over two growing seasons. We found evidence of both neighbor effects and pot type, showing that neighbor interactions affect a focal plant through both above- and belowground processes, and how the focal plant is affected depends on neighbor identity. Though neighbors did not directly alter herbivory or most soil microbial interactions, they did alter the relationship between belowground microbial communities and a plant response trait (specific leaf area). Plant resource allocation responses were reduced with time, showing the importance of extending experiments beyond a single growing season, and are an important consideration when making predictions about plant responses to changing conditions. This study contributes to a growing body of work showing how community contexts affect the above- and belowground interactions of a plant through plant resource allocation strategies.

AB  - Seahorses are cryptic fish that can be found in several types of ecosystems. The microhabitat plays an important role in their lives, providing structure for many ecological functions. Taking into account that the influence of habitat loss will be mainly severe on species specialized in microhabitats, and habitat use might also be related to life stage, the present study aims to characterize the microhabitats used by the longsnout seahorse Hippocampus reidi along the Rio de Janeiro state coast, describing the breadth of the spatial niche, as well as the influence of benthic invasive species and abiotic factors on it, and proposing specific habitat conservation strategies. The present study was carried out in five areas of Rio de Janeiro state. Our results showed that habitat use by seahorses varied across the different areas, where there is a notable difference in niche breadth between adults and juveniles. Sepetiba Bay had a higher abundance of seahorse and microhabitat diversity, and a particular invasive species Schizoporella sp. seemed to be positively correlated to the seahorses' abundance. In addition, our results showed that Arraial do Cabo and Arma & ccedil;& atilde;o dos B & uacute;zios deserve greater attention and can be considered priority areas for conservation, and Araruama Lagoon needs specific conservation measures to protect the seahorses against future threats caused by urbanization.

AB  - Many well-studied animal species use conspicuous, repetitive signals that attract both mates and predators. Orthopterans (crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers) are renowned for their acoustic signals. In Neotropical forests, however, many katydid species produce extremely short signals, totaling only a few seconds of sound per night, likely in response to predation by acoustically orienting predators. The rare signals of these katydid species raises the question of how they find conspecific mates in a structurally complex rainforest. While acoustic mechanisms, such as duetting, likely facilitate mate finding, we test the hypothesis that mate finding is further facilitated by colocalization on particular host plant species. DNA barcoding allows us to identify recently consumed plants from katydid stomach contents. We use DNA barcoding to test the prediction that katydids of the same species will have closely related plant species in their stomach. We do not find evidence for dietary specialization. Instead, katydids consumed a wide mix of plants within and across the flowering plants (27 species in 22 genera, 16 families, and 12 orders) with particular representation in the orders Fabales and Laurales. Some evidence indicates that katydids may gather on plants during a narrow window of rapid leaf out, but additional investigations are required to determine whether katydid mate finding is facilitated by gathering at transient food resources.

AB  - Although most prey have multiple predator species, few studies have quantified how prey respond to the temporal niches of multiple predators which pose different levels of danger. For example, intraspecific variation in diel activity allows white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to reduce fawn activity overlap with coyotes (Canis latrans) but finding safe times of day may be more difficult for fawns in a multi-predator context. We hypothesized that within a multi-predator system, deer would allocate antipredation behavior optimally based on combined mortality risk from multiple sources, which would vary depending on fawn presence. We measured cause-specific mortality of 777 adult (>1-year-old) and juvenile (1-4-month-old) deer and used 300 remote cameras to estimate the activity of deer, humans, and predators including American black bears (Ursus americanus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), coyotes, and wolves (Canis lupus). Predation and vehicle collisions accounted for 5.3 times greater mortality in juveniles (16% mortality from bears, coyotes, bobcats, wolves, and vehicles) compared with adults (3% mortality from coyotes, wolves, and vehicles). Deer nursery groups (i.e., >= 1 fawn present) were more diurnal than adult deer without fawns, causing fawns to have 24-38% less overlap with carnivores and 39% greater overlap with humans. Supporting our hypothesis, deer nursery groups appeared to optimize diel activity to minimize combined mortality risk. Temporal refuge for fawns was likely the result of carnivores avoiding humans, simplifying diel risk of five species into a trade-off between diurnal humans and nocturnal carnivores. Functional redundancy among multiple predators with shared behaviors may partially explain why white-tailed deer fawn predation rates are often similar among single- and multi-predator systems.

AB  - Natural controls on the distribution, abundance, or growth rates of exotic species are a desirable mode of intervention because of lower costs compared to anthropogenic controls and greater social acceptance. In the Great Basin, cougars (Puma concolor) are the most widely distributed carnivore capable of killing large ungulate prey. Populations of feral horses (Equus ferus) are widely distributed throughout the Great Basin and can grow at rates up to 20%/year. Although cougars exhibit distributional overlap with horses, it has been assumed that predation is minimal because of differences in habitat use and body-size limitations. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored the diets of 21 global positioning system (GPS)-collared cougars in the western Great Basin (5 males, 8 females) and eastern Sierra Nevada (2 males, 6 females) from 2009-2012. We investigated 1,310 potential kill sites and located prey remains of 820 predation events. We compared prey composition and kill rates of cougars inhabiting the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin, and among male and female cougars across seasons. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the effects of prey availability and habitat characteristics on the probability of predation on horses by cougars. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) comprised 91% of prey items killed on the Sierra Nevada reference site but only comprised 29% of prey items in the Great Basin study area. Average annual kill rates for deer differed between the Sierra Nevada ( x over bar = 0.85 deer/week, range = 0.44-1.3) and Great Basin ( x over bar = 0.21 deer/week, range = 0.00-0.43). Diets of cougars in the Great Basin were composed predominantly of horses (59.6%, n = 460 prey items; 13 individuals). Ten cougars regularly consumed horses, and horses were the most abundant prey in the diet of 8 additional individuals in the Great Basin. Cougars on average killed 0.38 horses/week in the Great Basin (range=0.00-0.94 horses/week). Differences in predation on horses between the sexes of cougars were striking; Great Basin females incorporated more horses across all age classes year-round, whereas male cougars tended to exploit neonatal young during spring and summer before switching to deer during winter. Within GLMM models, the probability of predation on horses compared to other prey species increased with elevation, horse density, and decreasing density of mule deer on the landscape, and was more likely to occur in sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) than in pinyon (Pinus monophylla)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) forests. Behavior of individual cougars accounted for more than a third of the variation explained by our top models predicting predation on horses in the Great Basin. At landscape scales, cougar predation is unlikely to limit the growth of feral horse populations. In the Great Basin ecosystem, however, cougars of both sexes successfully preyed on horses of all age classes. Moreover, some reproductive, female cougars were almost entirely dependent on feral horses year-round. Taken together, our data suggest that cougars may be an effective predator of feral horses, and that some of our previous assumptions about this relationship should be reevaluated and integrated into management and planning.

AB  - In recent years, Hainan Eld's deer (Cervus eldi) population in the Datian Nature Reserve (DNR) has been decreasing. This may be due to predation by Burmese python (Python bivittatus), as the number of Eld's deer predation events by Burmese pythons has increased since 2013. This poses huge pressure on the DNR that is mainly involved in the conservation of wild Eld's deer population. We divided the changes in deer population size in the DNR into three time periods (1988-1992, 1999-2003, and 2015-2019) according to changes in the number of Burmese pythons. We analyzed changes of Eld's deer population in the Wenchang conservation station (WNR) for the period 2010-2018. In the DNR, Eld's deer population increased from 242 to 349 during 1988-1992 in the absence of Burmese python. When there were few Burmese pythons in the region in 1999-2003, Eld's deer population increased from 702 to 1075. In 2015-2019, when the number of migrating Burmese pythons captured was the greatest, Eld's deer population decreased from 306 to 223, and the mean annual growth rate was - 6.21%. As predation by Burmese pythons decreases the survival rate of Eld's deer fawns in the DNR, the growth rate of Eld's deer population was significantly affected. Our results indicated that predation by Burmese python is currently a key factor affecting the growth of Eld's deer population.

AB  - When a population is isolated and composed of few individuals, genetic drift is the paramount evolutionary force and results in the loss of genetic diversity. Inbreeding might also occur, resulting in genomic regions that are identical by descent, manifesting as runs of homozygosity (ROHs) and the expression of recessive traits. Likewise, the genes underlying traits of interest can be revealed by comparing fixed SNPs and divergent haplotypes between affected and unaffected individuals. Populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (SPM, France) have high incidences of leucism and malocclusions, both considered genetic defects; on the Florida Keys islands (USA) deer exhibit smaller body sizes, a polygenic trait. Here we aimed to reconstruct island demography and identify the genes associated with these traits in a pseudo case-control design. The two island populations showed reduced levels of genomic diversity and a build-up of deleterious mutations compared to mainland deer; there was also significant genome-wide divergence in Key deer. Key deer showed higher inbreeding levels, but not longer ROHs, consistent with long-term isolation. We identified multiple trait-related genes in ROHs including LAMTOR2 which has links to pigmentation changes, and NPVF which is linked to craniofacial abnormalities. Our mixed approach of linking ROHs, fixed SNPs and haplotypes matched a high number (similar to 50) of a-priori body size candidate genes in Key deer. This suite of biomarkers and candidate genes should prove useful for population monitoring, noting all three phenotypes show patterns consistent with a complex trait and non-Mendelian inheritance.

AB  - Environmental factors often limit plant establishment and survival through increased seedling mortality. Understanding plant growth and the causes of mortality can be helpful in developing solutions that enhance seeding success and improve restoration monitoring. The purpose of our research was to assess the efficacy of time lapse and motion sensing cameras for monitoring seedling height, density, and fate. We conducted this study in a salt desert shrub community in northwest Utah, USA. In spring 2017, we placed 28 cameras in fenced and unfenced plots seeded with bottlebrush squirreltail and collected hourly images of the seedlings' development for the initial four months post-seeding. The seedling attributes were recorded in-field and compared with camera images to determine accuracy and reliability. We found that the optimal period for capturing imagery occurred near the sun's zenith when shadows were minimized. We were able to detect both the timing of the plant emergence, plant height, density, growth rate, and seedling death. The average seedling height and density were underestimated by 14% and 30% between the camera and field estimates, respectively. We recognize that it could be beneficial to adjust for the effect of the date. The reduced seedling density improved the measurement accuracy through a lower visual obscurity. Managers can utilize remote cameras to effectively measure vegetation that can provide an insight into environmental influences.

AB  - Naturally, insect herbivore populations are controlled by their plant hosts and predators. These 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' controls influence leaf area lost to herbivory. Bottom-up control of herbivory may be driven by leaf nutrients and plant defences. Top-down control can be driven by abundance and species richness of natural enemies, host or prey specificity, and predation strategies (e.g., active searching or sit-and-wait 'ambush' predation). The relative importance of bottom-up and top-down controls is unresolved but likely to vary spatially and temporally and under different environmental conditions such as changing temperature. We surveyed leaf carbon and nitrogen, leaf area loss, and attacks on plasticine caterpillars across a tropical elevational gradient in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Provence, China. We show that predatory foraging activity decreases with elevation and temperature, whereas leaf nutrients and leaf area loss from herbivory remains more or less constant. Predation patterns were driven by ants, which are thermophiles and therefore more active, abundant, and diverse at warmer, lower elevations. Leaf nutritional values are important in driving herbivory patterns as herbivory was stable across this gradient, but other factors such as mechanical defences and herbivore-induced plant volatiles demand further study. Elevational studies provide insight into how ecosystem function will shift under climate change. As increasing temperatures following climate change allows predatory groups like ants to exploit higher elevations, top-down control in high elevation habitats could increase, resulting in re-wiring of these ecologically sensitive communities. At the same time, top-down control at lower elevations may be at risk if critical thermal maxima for natural enemies are exceeded.

AB  - Mast seeding is a well-known example of pulsed resources in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the large literature available so far on the effects of mast seeding on the dynamics of seed consumer populations, it remains unknown whether heterogeneity in demographic responses to mast seeding exists both within a population of consumers and among consumer populations. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by assessing the effects of acorn production (i.e., oak mast) on all stage-specific demographic rates (i.e., survival, growth, reproduction) in several consumer populations. From long-term capture-mark-recapture data collected in three wild boar populations in Europe and detailed information on annual acorn production, we quantified the effects of acorn production on body mass-specific demographic rates in these populations. We then built a body mass-structured population model for each population and assessed the effect of acorn production on generation time-the mean age of mother at childbirth-and population growth rate using a combination of prospective and retrospective demographic analyses. Within populations, acorn production had a positive effect on reproduction (proportion of breeding females) and growth of small-sized females. Survival remained buffered against environmental variation, in accordance with the demographic buffering hypothesis. Thus, all stage-specific demographic rates were not influenced in the same way by acorn production. In turn, higher reproduction and growth probabilities involved higher population growth rates and shorter generation times. Despite these common demographic responses to mast seeding among populations, we highlighted marked among-population variation in the magnitude of these responses. Also, while populations inhabiting resource-rich environments took advantage of current acorn conditions, populations under resource-poor environments stored and allocated acorns produced the preceding year to reproduction indicating contrasting breeding tactics along the capital-income continuum. Our results suggest heterogeneity in demographic responses to mast seeding, within and among populations. This is an important finding for our understanding of the effects of mast seeding on the dynamics of seed consumer populations.

AB  - Mammalian omnivores are a broad group of species that are often treated uniformly in ecological studies. Here, we incorporate omnivorous dietary differences to investigate previously found mammalian macroevolutionary and macroecological trends. We investigate the frequency with which vertebrate prey, invertebrate prey, fibrous plant material and non-fibrous plant material co-occur in the diets of terrestrial mammals. We quantify the body size distributions and phylogenetic signal of different omnivorous diets and use multistate reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to assess the transition rates between diets on the mammalian phylogenetic tree. We find omnivores that consume all four food types are relatively rare, as most omnivores consume only invertebrate prey and non-fibrous plants. In addition, omnivores that only consume invertebrate prey, many of which are from Rodentia, are on average smaller than omnivores that incorporate vertebrate prey. Our transition models have high rates from invertivorous omnivory to herbivory, and from vertivory to prey mixing and ultimately invertivory. We suggest prey type is an important aspect of omnivore macroevolution and macroecology, as it is correlated with body mass, evolutionary history and diet-related evolutionary transition rates. Future work should avoid lumping omnivores into one category given the ecological variety of omnivore diets and their strong evolutionary influence.

AB  - In order to investigate the effect of pruning on the soil environment in which tea trees grow and the growth of tea trees, this study used Wuyi Meizhan (Camellia sinensis) as a research object and measured its growth indexes, soil physicochemical indexes, soil enzyme activity and microbial functional diversity to analyze the effects of pruning treatments on the growth of tea trees, soil enzyme activity and soil microbial functional diversity and the correlation between them. The results of the analysis of tea tree growth indexes showed that the hundred-bud weight, leaf area and yield in the pruning treatment were significantly higher than those in the unpruned treatment. The results of soil physicochemical index analysis showed that pH, available phosphorus, available potassium and organic matter were significantly higher in the pruning treatment than in the unpruned treatment (p < 0.05), while available nitrogen and total phosphorus were significantly lower than in unpruned treatment (p < 0.05). The results of soil enzyme activities showed that only polyphenol oxidase and catalase activities were significantly higher in the pruning than in the unpruned treatment, while urease, protease, acid phosphatase, asparaginase and glutaminase activities were significantly lower than in the unpruned treatment (p < 0.05). Biolog analysis showed that the utilization of microbial carbon sources, especially amino acid and amine, increased in the rhizosphere soil of the pruned tea tree, while there was a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in microbial diversity. It is evident that pruning promoted tea tree growth and some enzyme activity, while inhibiting the activity of enzymes associated with the nitrogen cycle, and the utilization of microbial carbon sources increased, but their diversity decreased. This study provides a theoretical basis for the daily management of tea plantation after pruning.

AB  - Conservation areas, like national parks, are hotspots of social-ecological and social-economic activities. The resulting interactions contribute to an inherent complexity of these systems, making simulation models a vital form of support for their management activities. These models are often unimodal, i.e., limited by design to only one particular question or a specific temporal and spatial scale. We implemented the cross-scale and multi-modal base model MARS KNP for the Kruger National Park, South Africa that combines the agent-based paradigm with a dynamic vegetation model.
   As a proof-of-concept, we developed an elephant movement model within MARS KNP to evaluate the base model?s decision-support capabilities. The study was mainly focused on the underlying software mechanisms that allow easy integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal data objects. MARS agents can probe, interact with, and modify these objects. We found that this feature is essential for a cross-scale integration of different modeling approaches. Additionally, we propose a definition of the term ?base model? to shorten the provisioning time of decisionsupport tools.

AB  - This work examines the variation of carbon sequestration (considered as the sum of above- and below-ground plant biomass production added to soil organic carbon) occurring in two sites (named respectively BN and ER) characterized by a semi-arid climate after planting three tree species (Populus sibirica, Ulmus pumila, and Hippophae rhamnoides). Soil organic carbon (SOC) was analyzed at four different depths (from 0-60 cm). In these two sites, the three tree species contributed differently to carbon sequestration. We found that above-ground plant biomass (leaf, branch, stem) was higher at the BN site whereas at the ER site prevailed below-ground biomass. That is probably due to the low tree density in BN site and the higher soil moisture content present in ER site. Among the three tree species considered, P. sibirica showed the highest biomass value. The SOC values were highest in the topsoil layer (0-40 cm) and decreased with depth. This works clearly shows that in semi-arid lands carbon sequestration depends on the environmental factors that characterize the site, the tree density, and the tree species selected.

AB  - Low levels of essential mineral elements such as cobalt, copper, and iron, in organisms reduce immune function, increasing the chances of parasitic infection. This phenomenon has been demonstrated widely in domestic animals but rarely in wildlife. In this study, we used data from 7- to 9-month-old roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), living in two different populations facing contrasting environmental conditions (Trois-Fontaines and Chiz & eacute;), to investigate whether the parasitic and immunological statuses could be related to essential element status. Between 2016 and 2019, we collected feces to measure parasite burdens (gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes), blood to measure immunological parameters (globulins and white blood cells), and hair to assess the concentration of 11 essential elements (calcium [Ca], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], iron [Fe], magnesium [Mg], manganese [Mn], potassium [K], molybdenum [Mo], selenium [Se], and zinc [Zn]). The results showed first heterogeneity in the individual phenotypes of the two populations. Roe deer with low body mass had high concentrations of all the essential elements (in particular, Ca, Fe, Cu, K, and Mn), a high parasitic burden, and high concentrations of globulins. An association between high concentrations of essential elements and a high parasite burden was found at the two study sites despite markedly different environmental conditions. A relationship between essential element concentrations and immune parameters was also detected, with more basophils and globulins being associated with high concentrations of essential trace elements (i.e., Ca, Fe, Cu, and, to a lesser extent, Se, Cr, and Zn). These results suggest that young individuals with low body mass and high parasitism may select feeding resources rich in mineral elements, which may improve their ability to control the infestation and/or mitigate the negative consequences of parasites by maintaining immune system functions.

AB  - Halos around coral reefs are landscape-scale patterns arising from multispecies interactions that collectively structure reefscapes over many thousands of square kilometers. First described in the 1960s, halos are known from a handful of locations and continue to captivate scientists. What remains unknown is how globally widespread, persistent, and dynamic halos are. We examined satellite imagery of reefs globally, coupled with in situ field observations, to show that halos are a globally ubiquitous, persistent, yet dynamic ecological phenomenon spanning vastly different systems. We further document the previously undescribed presence of halos outside the tropics surrounding seagrass "reefs" and highlight the temporal scales over which coral reef halos change, merge, and persist. Specifically, we show that halos can change in size over relatively short temporal scales of months, despite persisting over decades. In doing so, we document patterns suggesting that additional biophysical mechanisms than previously assumed may shape halos. Understanding the full suite of mechanisms governing halo formation and maintenance may enable us to use them as proxies for species interactions. Given the global extent of halos, their role in affecting sedimentary carbon storage, and their relationship with marine reserve existence and maturity, they may ultimately serve as globally relevant indicators of coral reef ecosystem functioning and health.

AB  - The existence of polluting chemical compounds in the environment is a threat both to living beings and to the ecosystem as a whole. Ecotoxicology is therefore developing new tools, such as the use of biomarkers, with the aim of evaluating the effect of these pollutants. Many studies have discussed the role of oxidative stress indicators as potentially useful parameters in the field of environmental pollution. However, studies focused on wildlife, and more specifically on wild boar (Sus scrofa), are scarce, despite the wide geographical distribution of this ungulate, which would allow its use as a bioindicator in environmental biomonitoring programmes. In the present study, the levels of two oxidative stress biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione reductase (GR), were determined in the kidney tissue of wild boar from NW Spain. In addition, the influence of sex on the values obtained was evaluated. The overall mean values were 1.811 +/- 0.426 nmoles/mg protein for MDA, and 0.079 +/- 0.019 picomol/min/mg protein for GR activity. With regard to the influence of the sex factor, statistically significant differences were found in the levels of MDA, with higher levels of oxidative stress in males than in females. These results constitute a baseline of oxidative stress biomarker levels in game species for use in future biomonitoring studies.

AB  - The Altai Mountains contain rivers, lakes, and glaciers critical for the survival of both social and ecological systems. Reconstructing past hydroclimatic changes is crucial for understanding human-environment interactions and predicting future hydroclimatic dynamics in this region. We reconstructed the water level fluctuations of Tolbo Lake in the Altai Mountains over the past 13.7 kyr using the sedimentary cladoceran fossils. The results show that a rising trend of the Holocene lake level resulted mainly from intensification of westerlies-driven precipitation. The results further reveal that the centennial timescale lake-level fluctuations during the mid-late Holocene was mainly modified by temperature-controlled meltwater input, resulting in low lake levels during the cold, glacier-advance periods and high lake levels during the warm, glacier-retreat periods. The intensification of westerlies-driven precipitation at similar to 6 cal ka BP initiated a humid environment and facilitated the Neolithic trans-Eurasian spread of livestock and crops (i.e. barley, wheat, and sheep). Subsequently, occasional increases in glacial meltwater during the warm phase further boosted grassland growth and animal husbandry, likely contributing to the expansion of major nomadic empires such as the Huns (similar to 2.4-1.8 cal ka BP) and the Mongols (similar to 0.8 cal ka BP). Additionally, the depletion of alpine glaciers due to the current anthropogenic warming may eventually result in significant shrinkage of the lakes and severe crises for ecosystems and the human communities that rely on these lakes.

AB  - Increase in soil salinization due to climate change is a global phenomenon that can induce significant changes in plant growth, physiology, and chemistry, exacerbating growing threats to insect biodiversity. Insects that rely on plants are likely to be indirectly impacted by changes in soil salt content through changes in plant chemistry, yet few studies link changes in plant metabolism to impacts on higher trophic levels. Some salinity-mediated changes in specialized metabolites may be predictable due to highly conserved metabolic pathways shared between herbivore defense and stress resistance, but recent studies also suggest substantial variation across plant species and habitats. To date, most of the research on salinity and chemically mediated plant-insect interactions has focused on herbivores, particularly in agricultural systems. Published effects of salinity on pollinators and parasitoids are scarce. Future research will need to focus more on the role of plant chemistry to bridge the divide between studies of plant and insect responses to salinization.

AB  - Understanding the ecological rules structuring the organization of species interactions is a prerequisite to predicting how ecosystems respond to environmental changes. While the ecological determinants of single networks have been documented, it remains unclear whether network ecological rules are conserved along spatial and environmental gradients. To address this gap, we reconstructed 48 plant-herbivore interaction networks along six elevation gradients in the Central European Alps in Switzerland, using DNA metabarcoding on orthoptera faeces. We developed hypotheses on the ecological mechanisms expected to structure interaction networks, based on plant phylogeny, plant abundance, leaf toughness, leaf nitrogen content and plant metabolomics. We show that plant phylogenetic relationships and species abundance have the greatest explanatory power regarding the structure of the ecological networks. Moreover, we found that leaf nitrogen content is a key determinant of interactions in warmer environments, while phenolic compounds and tannins are more important in colder environments, suggesting that determinants of species interactions can shift along environmental gradients. With this work, we propose an approach to study the mechanisms that structure the way species interact with each other between bioregions and ecosystems.

AB  - Teeth evolved early in vertebrate evolution, and their morphology reflects important specializations in diet and ecology among species. The toothless jaws (edentulism) in extant birds likely coevolved with beak keratin, which functionally replaced teeth. However, extinct dinosaurs lost teeth multiple times independently and exhibited great variation in toothrow distribution and rhamphotheca-like keratin structures. Here, we use rostral jawbone surface texture as a proxy for rostral keratin covering and phylogenetic comparative models to test for the influence of rostral keratin on toothrow distribution in Mesozoic dinosaurs. We find that the evolution of rostral keratin covering explains partial toothrow reduction but not jaw toothlessness. Toothrow reduction preceded the evolution of rostral keratin cover in theropods. Non-theropod dinosaurs evolved continuous toothrows despite evolving rostral keratin covers (e.g. some ornithischians and sauropodomorphs). We also show that rostral keratin covers did not significantly increase the evolutionary rate of tooth loss, which further delineates the antagonistic relationship between these structures. Our results suggest that the evolution of rostral keratin had a limited effect on suppressing tooth development. Independent changes in jaw development may have facilitated further tooth loss. Furthermore, the evolution of strong chemical digestion, a gizzard, and a dietary shift to omnivory or herbivory likely alleviated selective pressures for tooth development.

AB  - Remobilization of carbon storage compounds in trees is crucial for the resilience to disturbances, stress and the requirements of their perennial lifestyle, all of which can impact photosynthetic carbon gain. Trees contain abundant non-structural carbohydrates in the form of starch and sugars for long-term carbon storage, yet questions remain about the ability of trees to remobilize non-conventional carbon compounds under stress. Aspens, like other members of the genus Populus, have abundant specialized metabolites called salicinoid phenolic glycosides, which contain a core glucose moiety. In this study, we hypothesized that the glucose-containing salicinoids could be remobilized as an additional carbon source during severe carbon limitation. We made use of genetically modified hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L.x Populus albaL.) with minimal salicinoid content and compared these with control plants with high salicinoid content during resprouting (suckering) in dark (carbon-limited) conditions. As salicinoids are abundant anti-herbivore compounds, identification of such a secondary function for salicinoids may provide insight into the evolutionary pressures that drive their accumulation. Our results show that salicinoid biosynthesis is maintained during carbon limitation and suggests that salicinoids are not remobilized as a carbon source for regenerating shoot tissue. However, we found that salicinoid-producing aspens had reduced resprouting capacity per available root biomass when compared with salicinoid-deficient aspens. Therefore, our work shows that the constitutive salicinoid production in aspens can reduce the capacity for resprouting and survival in carbon-limited conditions.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the characteristics of the pasture and the behavior of grazing goats under continuous stocking in a silvopastoral system (SPS) of Andropogon grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth cv. Planaltina) in comparison to its monoculture (MC). The treatments consisted of two cropping systems: monoculture of Andropogon grass and silvopastoral system-SPS of native trees mixed with Andropogon grass, evaluated in five grazing periods using goats (February, March, April, May and June). Pasture height, leaf/stem ratio and the dry mass of forage, leaf, stem and dead material were evaluated. The grazing behavior of the goats was also assessed. Significant effect of interaction was observed (p < 0.05) on pasture height and on the dead material dry mass yield of the pasture among cropping systems and grazing periods. There was a significant effect of the different systems (p < 0.05) on the yield of forage dry matter, leaf dry matter and leaf/stem ratio. The SPS presented superior grazing time (p = 0.01), with an average of 389.0 min. Regarding rumination and moving times, there was no difference between cropping systems and grazing periods (p > 0.05). The Andropogon grass has the potential to be used in SPS with grazing goats under continuous stocking, positively affecting the pasture and animal behavior.

AB  - Recent reports of insect declines have raised concerns about the potential for concomitant losses to ecosystem processes. However, understanding the causes and consequences of insect declines is challenging, especially given the data deficiencies for most species. Needed are approaches that can help quantify the magnitude and potential causes of declines at levels above species. Here we present an analytical framework for assessing broad-scale plant-insect phenologies and their relationship to community-level insect abundance patterns. We intentionally apply a species-neutral approach to analyse trends in phenology and abundance at the macroecological scale. Because both phenology and abundance are critical to ecosystem processes, we estimate aggregate metrics using the overwintering (diapause) stage, a key species trait regulating phenology and environmental sensitivities. This approach can be used across broad spatiotemporal scales and multiple taxa, including less well-studied groups. Using community ('citizen') science butterfly observations from multiple platforms across the Eastern USA, we show that the relationships between environmental drivers, phenology and abundance depend on the diapause stage. In particular, egg-diapausing butterflies show marked changes in adult-onset phenology in relation to plant phenology and are rapidly declining in abundance over a 20-year span across the study region. Our results also demonstrate the negative consequences of warmer winters for the abundance of egg-diapausing butterflies, irrespective of plant phenology. In sum, the diapause stage strongly shapes both phenological sensitivities and developmental requirements across seasons, providing a basis for predicting the impacts of environmental change across trophic levels.

AB  - Underwater acoustic technologies are a key component for exploring the behavior of marine fauna such as sea turtles, sharks, and seals. The animals are marked with acoustic devices (tags) that periodically emit signals encoding the device's ID along with sensor data such as depth, temperature, or the dominant acceleration axis - data that is collected by a network of deployed receivers. In this work, we aim to optimize the locations of receivers for best tracking of acoustically tagged marine fauna, and provide a test case with tags suitable for megafauna tracking. The outcomes of such tracking allows the evaluation of the animals' motion patterns, their hours of activity, and their social interactions. In particular, we focus on how to determine the receivers' deployment positions to maximize the coverage area in which the tagged animals can be tracked. For example, an overly-condensed deployment may not allow accurate tracking, whereas a sparse one, may lead to a small coverage area due to too few detections. We formalize the question of where to best deploy the receivers as a non-convex constraint optimization problem that takes into account the local environment and the specifications of the tags, and offer a sub-optimal, low-complexity solution that can be applied to large testbeds. Numerical investigation for three stimulated sea environments shows that our proposed method is able to increase the localization coverage area by 30%, and results from a test case experiment demonstrate similar performance in a real sea environment. We share the implementation of our work to help researchers set up their own acoustic observatory.

AB  - More accurate determination of leaf plasticity induced by the legacy effect of grazing and immediate ingestion can provide insights on growth-defense tradeoffs, and are of great importance to understanding valuable indicators for grassland management. Despite the ecological importance of leaf traits, the effectiveness of leaf plasticity as a key physical anti-herbivore trait that may signal grazing disturbance has not yet been assessed. Here, we assessed leaf angle and related functional traits as indicators of the responses of palatable Leymus chinensis and less palatable Carex korshinskyi to five sheep grazing intensities during the early grazing season. Grazing significantly increases leaf angle, paralleled by a decrease in the sizes of both whole plants and leaves, with a stronger response by L. chinensis than C. korshinskyi. Leaf size and angle had higher positive and lower negative allometric slopes with plant size in L. chinensis compared to C. korshinskyi. This pattern reflects that the palatable species had relatively higher adaptability to grazing via stabilizing leaf area and anti-herbivore defense responses. Structural equation modeling shows that historical grazing contributes more than foraging in the current year to leaf plasticity, which is particularly evident in the less palatable species C. korshinskyi. The foraging proportion is positively correlated with the leaf angle for L. chinensis but not C. korshinskyi, suggesting that leaf plasticity can indicate selective foraging. Moreover, plasticity in leaf angle potentially influences net photosynthesis which manifests as a unimodal curve across the grazing intensities under a balance between the gross photosynthetic and respiratory rates. Thus, we demonstrate that palatability-dependent leaf plasticity can indicate selective foraging across grazing intensities, thereby contributing to plant anti-herbivore defense. Our results highlight that grazing legacy and immediate ingestion had a positive interaction effect on leaf traits. These findings show that grazing-induced leaf plasticity represents a key nexus between ecological mechanisms and grassland management.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLR) play a central role in recognition and host frontline defence against a wide range of pathogens. A number of recent studies have shown that TLR genes (Tlrs) often exhibit large polymorphism in natural populations. Yet, there is little knowledge on how this polymorphism is maintained and how it influences disease susceptibility in the wild. In previous work, we showed that some Tlrs exhibit similarly high levels of genetic diversity as genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), and signatures of contemporary balancing selection in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the most abundant cervid species in Europe. Here, we investigated the evolutionary mechanisms by which pathogen-mediated selection could shape this innate immunity genetic diversity by examining the relationships between Tlr (Tlr2, Tlr4 and Tlr5) genotypes (heterozygosity status and presence of specific alleles) and infections with Toxoplasma and Chlamydia, two widespread intracellular pathogens known to cause reproductive failure in ungulates. We showed that Toxoplasma and Chlamydia exposures vary significantly across years and landscape features with few co-infection events detected and that the two pathogens exert antagonistic selection on Tlr2 polymorphism. By contrast, we found limited support for Tlr heterozygote advantage. Our study confirmed the importance of looking beyond Mhc genes in wildlife immunogenetic studies. It also emphasized the necessity to consider multiple pathogen challenges and their spatiotemporal variation to improve our understanding of vertebrate defence evolution against pathogens.

AB  - Carpobrotus edulis is an invasive clonal plant with drastic effects on biodiversity and functioning of coastal ecosystems. In recent years, authorities and land managers have implemented diverse management strategies that usually focus on mechanical removal and chemical control. However, applying mechanical control to remove C. edulis may cause indirect adverse effects since it could increase the probability of spreading new propagules, which do not lose their physiological activity. Therefore, reducing the physiological activity of these plant fragments should be a priority to avoid their spread and re-rooting. Our goal was to assess the plant regeneration capacity after applying mechanical control (i) when placing the plant material on different types of ground surface (on sand, on stones and using rooted plants as control) and (ii) combined with the attack of specialized herbivores (the soft scale Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi). To achieve this, we evaluated how these two factors (ground surface and herbivory) affected the plant physiological activity, its survival and re-rooting, biometric measurements, shoot and root nutrient composition and biochemical parameters (total phenols and tannins). Regardless of the ground surface type, our results indicated that the specialist herbivore greatly affected the C. edulis parameters studied. The attack of P. mesembryanthemi stimulated the plant defence mechanisms, even in those individuals with less photosynthetic activity. Furthermore, P. mesembryanthemi severely reduced the biomass and volume of plant material. Decomposition of C. edulis was accelerated by the combination between the inoculation of P. mesembryanthemi and placing the plants on the stones ground surface. Overall, preventing plant re-rooting by avoiding connection to the soil is an effective method of reducing its viability after the eighth-tenth month. After applying mechanical control, we recommend placing C. edulis fragments over an inert ground surface to avoid re-rooting, which would favour its death. We conclude that the combination of mechanical control and P. mesembryanthemi or even direct inoculation with this specialist herbivore could help authorities and land managers to improve management strategies for C. edulis.

AB  - The region of the Arab peninsula has a diversity of plants and animals. Grazing on natural rangeland plants may have a neutral, positive, or negative impact on both animals and plants as well depending on several factors. Grazing environmental forces includes herbivory, physical impact, and deposition. When animals graze on plants, they show a hierarchy that leads to understanding instinctive responses and behavioral activities. Mouth anatomy of goats gives them the merit of capability of selecting plants in the range, while that of sheep enables them to graze quite near the ground. Preference is a behavioral trait that includes the proportional selection of plant species from a group of two or more. Animal behavioral preference in governed by abundance of a plant species, its morphological features, the animal species in question and the variety of species available. Animals have two distinct acquired behaviors (i.e. evolutionary and field acquired). Forage quality and quantity were inversely proportional to the ratio of spent time to graze in group to the region taken in the landscape, to be concluded that wild plants affect grazing animals by modifying their behaviors to adapt the current situation in the range.

AB  - Metabolism in stream ecosystems alters the fate of organic carbon (OC) received from surrounding landscapes, but our understanding of in-stream metabolic processes in boreal ecosystems remains limited. Determining the factors that regulate OC metabolism will help predict how the C balance of boreal streams may respond to future environmental change. In this study, we addressed the question: what controls OC metabolism in boreal headwater streams draining catchments with discontinuous permafrost? We hypothesized that metabolism is collectively regulated by OC reactivity, phosphorus availability, and temperature, with discharge modulating each of these conditions. We tested these hypotheses using a combination of laboratory experiments and whole-stream ecosystem metabolism measurements throughout the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW) in Interior Alaska, USA. In the laboratory experiments, respiration and dissolved OC (DOC) removal were both co-limited by the supply of reactive C and phosphorus, but temperature and residence time acted as stronger controls of DOC removal. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was largely predicted by discharge and site, with some variance explained by gross primary production (GPP) and temperature. Both ER and GPP varied inversely with watershed permafrost extent, with an inverse relationship between temperature and permafrost extent providing one plausible explanation. Our results provide some of the first evidence of a functional response to permafrost thaw in stream ecosystems and suggest the role of metabolism in landscape C cycling may increase as climate change progresses.
   Rivers and streams can transform organic matter received from the surrounding landscape through the metabolic activity of microbes and other organisms. In boreal streams, little is known about ecosystem metabolism and whether respiration rates might change as warming-induced permafrost thaw progresses. To understand if and how permafrost thaw is affecting stream microbial activity, we compared respiration rates in streams draining areas with different amounts of permafrost and used lab experiments to test which factors are currently limiting microbial activity. We found that metabolic rates were greatest in streams where the most permafrost thaw had occurred. This pattern could be explained by warmer water temperature promoting faster rates of microbial activity and less flashy flow conditions allowing more time for microbes to break down organic matter before it is flushed downstream. This newly documented relationship between permafrost thaw and stream respiration should be considered in efforts to better incorporate in-stream processes into broader carbon cycling models.
   Stream ecosystem respiration increased with permafrost thaw, likely due to warmer temperature and a more stable flow regime Within individual streams, ecosystem respiration was positively correlated with both discharge and gross primary production Respiration was most limited by temperature and residence time in lab experiments, with additional co-limitation by carbon and phosphorus

AB  - The earthworms (Crassiclitellata) of the Northern Atlantic Forest region are poorly known, and many new species are expected to be found in the region. Hence, quantitative and qualitative samples were taken in the Atlantic Forest region of southern Bahia State, Brazil, at eight sites to assess species presence and abundance in different land uses (forests, pastures, plantations). Earthworms were also qualitatively collected at an additional eight sites. Only one to two species per site were found in quantitative samples, while qualitative samples generally resulted in higher species recoveries, with highest richness observed at the native Atlantic Forest of Veracel in Porto Seguro. Pontoscolex corethrurus (Muller, 1857) was the dominant species at all sites and in most land use systems, probably favored by human migration and agricultural activities; it was only absent in one primary forest site where native Ocnerodrilidae species predominated. In total at least 14 species were found of which eight were new, belonging to the genus Rhinodrilus and three new genera in the Ocnerodrilidae family (Pauqueba, Parabauba and Diplomoela). Contrary to sites in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, where many native species belong to the Glossoscolecidae family, in southern Bahia, Ocnerodrilidae species tend to be more prevalent, occupying various habitats. More intensive sampling of these habitats, including surface litter, in and under fallen logs and dead tree trunks, under rocks, in bromeliad leaf tanks and deeper soil layers is essential in order to properly characterize earthworm communities in Brazilian Atlantic Forests.

AB  - The rehabilitation of polluted sites requires knowledge of the responses of the keystone species to contaminated soils and to co-occurring environmental stressors, such as climate variations and herbivory. To obtain this knowledge, we monitored the performance of young European aspen (Populus tremula) trees growing naturally at sites 1.8 to 64.5 km from the Monchegorsk copper-nickel smelter in north-western Russia from 2001-2005. Copper and nickel concentrations near the smelter were 25-30 times higher than the regional background. The radial and vertical increments, leaf size, fluctuating asymmetry and insect herbivory did not change along the pollution gradient. Leaf fluctuating asymmetry positively correlated with the site-specific radial increment. Among-year variations in weather conditions did not interact with spatial patterns in aspen performance. Lack of detrimental effects of extreme pollution on any of the studied traits indicates a high tolerance of European aspen to the harsh environmental conditions of industrial barrens. This tolerance makes aspen a suitable species for rehabilitation of areas with extreme levels of soil contamination by copper, nickel and other metals. The fast-growing aspens established in heavily polluted sites may facilitate natural recovery of plant communities by sheltering dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings and by producing litter that improves soil quality.

AB  - Global climate change is increasing thermal variability in coastal marine environments and the frequency, intensity and duration of marine heatwaves. At the same time, food availability and quality are being altered by anthropogenic environmental changes. Marine ectotherms often cope with changes in temperature through physiological acclimation, which can take several weeks and is a nutritionally demanding process. Here, we tested the hypothesis that different ecologically relevant diets (omnivorous, herbivorous, carnivorous) impact thermal acclimation rate and capacity, using a temperate omnivorous fish as a model (opaleye, Girella nigricans). We measured acute thermal performance curves for maximum heart rate because cardiac function has been observed to set upper thermal limits in ectotherms. Opaleye acclimated rapidly after raising water temperatures, but their thermal limits and acclimation rate were not affected by their diet. However, the fish's acclimation capacity for maximum heart rate was sensitive to diet, with fish in the herbivorous treatment displaying the smallest change in heart rate throughout acclimation. Mechanistically, ventricle fatty acid composition differed with diet treatment and was related to cardiac performance in ways consistent with homoviscous adaptation. Our results suggest that diet is an important, but often overlooked, determinant of thermal performance in ectotherms on environmentally relevant time scales.

AB  - Gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes are typical pathogens of mammalian herbivores. A key moment of infection by passively ingested nematodes is the contact between infective larvae and the grazing host. Yet, knowledge on dispersal dynamics of larvae infecting wild herbivores in natural environments is limited. We studied the mode and range of lateral larval movement. As study species, we used infective larvae of Ostertagia gruehneri-a parasitic nematode that can negatively affect its host, Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). In the laboratory, reindeer faecal pats containing larvae were introduced onto soil placed either horizontally or on a slope (10 degrees), mimicking the micro-topography of High Arctic tundra. After four weeks, 939 live nematodes were recorded, of which 23% were in the soil, mostly underneath the faecal pat (20%). The remaining 3% that dispersed away from the pat did so in both sloped and flat soil. We conclude that the larvae were able to actively move from faeces to soil and that subsequent dispersal was limited and not assisted by gravity (slope). These insights reveal potential infection hotspots, providing a glimpse in the complex interplay between parasite and host.

AB  - Selection of forage and habitats is driven by nutritional needs of individuals. Some species may sacrifice nutritional quality of forage for the mother in favor of safety of offspring (risk-averse strategy), immediately following parturition. We studied diet quality and forage selection by bighorn sheep before and following parturition to determine how nutritional demands associated with rearing offspring influenced forage acquisition. We used desert bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis nelsoni, to investigate that potential tradeoff. We captured and radio-collared female bighorn sheep from 2016 to 2018. We used vaginal implant transmitters (VIT)s in pregnant females to identify parturition and to capture and radio-collar neonates to monitor survival of young. We collected fecal samples throughout the breeding season and throughout the year to understand diet quality and composition throughout those temporal periods. We determined diet quality and composition for pre-parturient females, females provisioning offspring, females that lost offspring, and non-pregnant individuals using fecal nitrogen and DNA metabarcoding analyses. Additionally, we compared the diet quality and composition of offspring and adult females during the spring, as well as summer and winter months. Our results indicated differences in diet quality between individuals provisioning offspring and those whose offspring had died. Females that were provisioning dependent young had lower quality diets than those that lost their offspring. Diet composition among those groups was also markedly different; females that had lost an offspring had a more diverse diet than did females with dependent young. Diet quality differed among seasons, wherein offspring and adult females had higher quality diets during the spring months, with decreasing quality as the year progressed. Diet diversity was similar across seasons, although spring months tended to be most diverse. Our results support tradeoffs associated with risk-averse strategies made by adult females associated with parturition. Nutritional quality of forage was linked to provisioning status, indicating that females were trading diet quality for safety of offspring, but those females whose offspring had died selected high quality forages. Those results help explain habitat selection observed in mountain ungulates around parturition and provide further insight into the evolutionary processes and adaptive significance exhibited by those specialized artiodactyls.

AB  - Catastrophic wildfires impacted large areas of western Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia in 2019-2020, burning habitat for many species, including large proportions of the distributional range of the KI micro-trapdoor spider Moggridgea rainbowi, which led to it being listed as Endangered under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). In order to assess population genetic structure in M. rainbowi and detect diagnosable lineages and their distributional patterns across KI, 28 individuals were genotyped for 2495 loci, sampling from all known populations of the species. Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data provided strong support for three Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) within M. rainbowi; two populations on eastern KI and a heavily fire-impacted western population. High levels of divergence and fixed allelic differences between 5 and 16% indicate a lack of gene flow between ESUs and long periods of isolation. Distributional patterns of these lineages match likely locations of isolation events caused by successive changes to sea level during the Quaternary (2.58 million years ago to present), which led to KI being intermittently connected to the mainland or separated into one or more islands. Our findings have strong conservation implications for M. rainbowi and highlight the importance of inclusion of population genetic structure to inform conservation strategies and to conserve lineage biodiversity at the species level and below.

AB  - Few studies have addressed the sustainability of harvesting of secondary compounds from non-timber forest products (NTFP). Most of them suggest that reproductive aspects can be compromised due to competition for resource allocation. These impacts may depend on the harvest history and may be more pronounced in environments with lower resource availability. This study assessed the impact of different oleoresin harvesting intervals on the reproductive phenology of Copaifera pubiflora Benth. (Leguminosae) in two tree populations with different harvesting time spans (mid- x short-term) and resource constraints in Roraima, northern Brazilian Amazon. We evaluated the impact of different intervals of consecutive oleoresin harvest compared to a control group without harvesting. Tree populations are found in forests with different precipitation ranges: (i) an ecotonal forest at the savanna-tropical rainforest boundary (intervals: 18 months, six months; mid-term; less constrained forest), and (ii) a gallery forest within the savanna ecosystem (12 months, six months; short-term; greater constrained forest). Data on the number of trees in different phenophases and fruit abortion were obtained fortnightly for two years and ten months. The occurrence, duration, and activity (number of trees) of the phenophases were examined through circular analyses. Our results indicate that oleoresin harvest did not affect the timing and duration of reproductive events, and the interval between successive collections should be considered when designing more sustainable management practices. Long-term studies should be conducted to assess whether observed patterns are maintained and to determine the optimal oleoresin harvest interval so trees can allocate resources for defense without competing with other functions.

AB  - The municipality of Salvatierra, in Guanajuato, Mexico, develops an agricultural activity of national and regional importance. However, despite this, there needs to be more information on ecologically and economically important faunal groups, such as insects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to have an approximation of the entomofauna in four crops: sorghum, alfalfa, maize, and beans, as well as their composition and the characterization of the functional groups of insects in a dry seasonal tropical environment of the municipality of Salvatierra. The entomofauna for the four crops is composed of nine orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Dermaptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea, Neuroptera, and Orthoptera, and 53 families. The highest Simpson Wealth Index value was for alfalfa (0.91) and the lowest for beans (0.84). On the other hand, in terms of its structure and composition, the entomofauna is represented by eight functional groups: Herbivores = H, Predators = D, Parasitoids = PAR, Pollinators = POL, Vectors = V, Decomposers = DES, Xylophages = XIL, and Generalists = G. Phytophagous insects (pests), predators and parasitoids are the most common and abundant in crops. The present work generates new data on the entomofauna present in the agroecosystems of the community of Urireo in the municipality of Salvatierra, Guanajuato state, informing the development of specific studies of demography and ecological interactions between insect-plant and insect-insect.

AB  - Metal accumulation is used by some plants as a defence against herbivores. Yet, herbivores may adapt to these defences, becoming less susceptible. Moreover, ecosystems often contain plants that do and do not accumulate metals, but whether such heterogeneity affects herbivore adaptation remains understudied. Here, we performed experimental evolution to test whether the spider mite Tetranychus evansi adapts to plants with high cadmium concentrations, in homogeneous (plants with cadmium) or heterogeneous (plants with or without cadmium) environments. For that we used tomato plants, which accumulate cadmium, thus affecting the performance of these spider mites. We measured mite fecundity, hatching rate, and the number of adult offspring after 12 and 33 generations and habitat choice after 14 and 51 generations, detecting no trait change, which implies the absence of adaptation. We then tested whether this was due to a lack of genetic variation in the traits measured and, indeed, additive genetic variance was low. Interestingly, despite no signs of adaptation, we observed a decrease in fecundity and number of adult offspring produced on cadmium-free plants, in the populations evolving in environments with cadmium. Therefore, evolving in environments with cadmium reduces the growth rate of spider mite populations on non-accumulating plants. Possibly, other traits contributed to population persistence on plants with cadmium. This calls for more studies addressing herbivore adaptation to plant metal accumulation.

AB  - Located within the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Central Vietnam, Son Doong Cave is the world's largest cave and has become one of the most famous sites for caving tourists and scientists worldwide. It contains highly diverse landscapes and ecosystems with special value in many natural aspects including biodiversity. Bat species are usually regarded as key and fascinating dwellers in cave ecosystems. We recently conducted a bat survey in Son Doong Cave in May 2022 for an initial understanding of the bat species inhabiting this special cave. Bats were captured using mist nets. Echolocation calls were recorded and analyzed using the PCTape system and Batman and Selena software, respectively. Results from the survey confirmed that Son Doong Cave is a home for at least six echolocating bat species of five genera and four families: Hipposideridae (Aselliscus stoliczkanus, Hipposideros scutinares), Rhinolophidae (Rhinolophus thomasi), Molossidae (Mops plicatus) and Vespertilionidae (Myotis pilosus and Myotis cf. muricola). Of these five species, H. scutinares and M. pilosus are listed as globally "vulnerable" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Among the six captured and recorded species from the Son Doong Cave, each species is clearly distinguishable from the others in terms of morphological features, echolocation call structure and frequencies.

AB  - There is strong trait dependence in species-level responses to environmental change and their cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. However, there is little understanding of whether intraspecific trait variation (ITV) can also be an important mechanism mediating environmental effects on ecosystem functioning. This is surprising, given that global change processes such as habitat fragmentation and the creation of forest edges drive strong trait shifts within species. On 20 islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, we quantified intraspecific leaf trait shifts of a widely distributed shrub species, Vaccinium carlesii, in response to habitat fragmentation. Using a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment between forest edge and interior on 11 islands with varying areas, we disentangled the relative effects of intraspecific leaf trait variation versus altered environmental conditions on leaf decomposition rates in forest fragments. We found strong intraspecific variation in leaf traits in response to edge effects, with a shift toward recalcitrant leaves with low specific leaf area and high leaf dry matter content from forest interior to the edge. Using structural equation modeling, we showed that such intraspecific leaf trait response to habitat fragmentation had translated into significant plant afterlife effects on leaf decomposition, leading to decreased leaf decomposition rates from the forest interior to the edge. Importantly, the effects of intraspecific leaf trait variation were additive to and stronger than the effects from local environmental changes due to edge effects and habitat loss. Our experiment provides the first quantitative study showing that intraspecific leaf trait response to edge effects is an important driver of the decrease in leaf decomposition rate in fragmented forests. By extending the trait-based response-effect framework toward the individual level, intraspecific variation in leaf economics traits can provide the missing functional link between environmental change and ecological processes. These findings suggest an important area for future research on incorporating ITV to understand and predict changes in ecosystem functioning in the context of global change.

AB  - In many Mediterranean ecosystems, animal tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, , an ecovar of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), is maintained by multi-host communities. It is hypothesised that interspecies transmission is mainly indirect via shared contaminated environments. Therefore, identifying spatial areas where MTBC bacteria occur and quantifying space use by susceptible hosts might help predict the spatial likelihood of transmission across the landscape. Here, we aimed to evaluate the transmission risk of MTBC in a multi-host system involving wildlife (ungulates and carnivores) and cattle ( Bos taurus). ). We collected eighty-nine samples from natural substrates (water, soil, and mud) at 38 sampling sites in a TB endemic area within a Mediterranean agroforestry system in Portugal. These samples were analysed by real-time PCR to detect MTBC DNA. Additionally, host-specific space use intensity maps were obtained through camera-trapping covering the same sampling sites. Results evidenced that a significant proportion of samples were positive for MTBC DNA (49 %), suggesting that the contamination is widespread in the area. Moreover, they showed that the probability of MTBC occurrence in the environment was significantly influenced by topographic features (i.e., slope), although other non-significant predictor related with soil conditions (SMI: soil moisture index) incorporated the MTBC contamination model. The integration of host space use intensity maps with the spatial detection of MTBC showed that the red deer ( Cervus elaphus) ) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa) ) exhibited the highest percentages of high- risk areas for MTBC transmission. Furthermore, when considering the co-occurrence of multiple hosts, transmission risk analyses revealed that 26.5 % of the study area represented high-risk conditions for MTBC transmission, mainly in forest areas.

AB  - Annually, in the United States, >1 million deer (Odocoileus spp.)-vehicle collisions are reported, resulting in losses of $4.6 billion in vehicle damage and medical expenses. Wildlife and transportation managers require better information about traffic volumes relative to seasonal and diurnal deer movement patterns to appropriately evaluate the risks associated with deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We incorporated traffic volume data with DVC data and the movement rates and incidences of road crossings by white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) to evaluate if traffic volume or deer behaviors mediate the incidence of DVCs along a high-volume interstate highway in Morgan County in central Georgia, USA. From May 2012 to July 2014, we monitored the movements and survival of 25 deer (13 males, 12 females) instrumented with global positioning system (GPS) collars in an area 1.6 km north and south of a 7.7-km section of Interstate 20 in our study area. We used a linear mixed model to quantify the effects of mean traffic volume and total road crossings on DVCs for each hour of the day. Deer movements and DVCs were primarily crepuscular. Approximately 60% of GPS-collared deer crossed roads; 7 deer accounted for >90% of all road crossings. Approximately 73% of daily traffic occurred between 0700 and 1859 hours. Nearly twice the number of daily DVCs occurred during the fall (9.8 DVCs/day) than during the next highest season (winter; 4.9 DVCs/day). Although DVCs occurred at greater frequencies during crepuscular periods, results of our linear mixed model suggested only nighttime traffic volume predicted DVCs. The relationship between nighttime DVCs and traffic volume is likely due to the inability of drivers to perceive deer in a roadway during this time. We recommend mitigation efforts focus on increasing driver vigilance and reducing vehicle speed during nighttime periods, especially during the fall season.

AB  - Understanding the origin, expansion and loss of biodiversity is fundamental to evolutionary biology. The approximately 26 living species of crocodylomorphs (crocodiles, caimans, alligators and gharials) represent just a snapshot of the group's rich 230-million-year history, whereas the fossil record reveals a hidden past of great diversity and innovation, including ocean and land-dwelling forms, herbivores, omnivores and apex predators. In this macroevolutionary study of skull and jaw shape disparity, we show that crocodylomorph ecomorphological variation peaked in the Cretaceous, before declining in the Cenozoic, and the rise and fall of disparity was associated with great heterogeneity in evolutionary rates. Taxonomically diverse and ecologically divergent Mesozoic crocodylomorphs, like marine thalattosuchians and terrestrial notosuchians, rapidly evolved novel skull and jaw morphologies to fill specialized adaptive zones. Disparity in semi-aquatic predatory crocodylians, the only living crocodylomorph representatives, accumulated steadily, and they evolved more slowly for most of the last 80 million years, but despite their conservatism there is no evidence for long-term evolutionary stagnation. These complex evolutionary dynamics reflect ecological opportunities, that were readily exploited by some Mesozoic crocodylomorphs but more limited in Cenozoic crocodylians.

AB  - Motivations and sources of satisfaction associated with deer hunting vary, yet few studies have evaluated how hunters' individual characteristics and field behaviors influence harvest success. For example, emergent societal and technological shifts in hunting may be associated with selective deer harvest choices (e.g., choosing to pass on a harvest opportunity). We surveyed resident white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunters in Wisconsin, USA, and used a mixed-mode and multi-part survey to quantify hunters' expectations, motivations, perceptions, and field behavior during the 9-day firearm season in 2022. We used repeated measures logistic regression to model hunter behavior at the decision point of whether to take a shot at an antlered deer on a given day. Hunters' motivations, scouting effort, trail camera use, perception of deer density, prior harvest of a mature male deer, and prior participation in the archery season influenced this decision. In addition, hunting method, hunting location, and day of hunt influenced hunters' likelihood to take a shot. Our results identified factors influencing a growing practice of more selective deer hunting, which affects the efficacy of recreational hunting for managing white-tailed deer populations relative to social or ecological goals.

AB  - The application of stable isotope analyses allows a diachronic characterisation of species habitat and feeding behaviour, information of utmost importance for zooarchaeological research. In South America, the former distribution of the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) encompassed a much larger territory than the current one. Within the Argentinean Great Chaco, only a small native population persists in Northwestern Cordoba province, Central Argentina, where it was once widely distributed. In this paper, we present the first set of dentin and collagen delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for this relict population (N = 18) along with archaeological data of guanaco specimens (N = 19) dated to the Middle and Late Holocene from the nearby Ongamira valley. Neither deciduous and permanent teeth nor males and females show marked differences within the modern samples. Both modern and archaeological guanaco delta C-13 values indicate a mixed diet of C-3 and, to a lesser extent, C-4 plants. Conversely, the delta N-15 values exhibit distinct signals between the Arid and the Mountain Chaco subregions. The diet breadth of the archaeological guanacos suggests the use of transitional or ecotonal environments, also reflected in the size of their isotopic niche as opposed to modern guanacos. Regarding the timing of the species retraction in the region, there is no evidence of a shift in its habitat during the period between similar to 4700 and 1900(14)C years BP. We suggest their retraction probably occurred later than previously proposed in regional zooarchaeological models.

AB  - Delayed greening, the phenomenon in which expanding leaves appear red, blue or pale green due to low chlorophyll content, has long intrigued ecologists. However, little is known about what type of species are most likely to delay greening or which environmental conditions are associated with delayed greening. We spectroscopically quantified leaf pigments in 105 species from 12 representative terrestrial ecosystems, spanning from 16 degrees S to 43 degrees S, and assessed delayed greening as the log ratio of the average chlorophyll content in expanding and mature leaves. Contrary to the traditional binary view of delayed greening, we observed a normal distribution in the level of delayed greening species have, with expanding leaves containing, on average, half the chlorophyll of mature leaves. Surprisingly, there was no significant latitudinal gradient in the level of delayed greening. Herbivory showed no correlation with the level of delayed greening but a positive association with anthocyanin levels. Delayed greening levels tended to be lower in sites with near-neutral soil pH, greater in plant species with higher leaf surface and leaf mass per area, and exhibited no association with soil available nitrogen and organic carbon content. We suggest that a tradition of considering continuous variables in discrete categories can affect the way researchers think about a trait and potentially impede progress in understanding ecological strategy.

AB  - The hypothesis that transformation of rangelands by domestic mesoherbivores follows state-andtransition models allows for the prediction that the vegetation could cross an ecological threshold. We examine this hypothesis by attempting to identify structural thresholds in Gamka Thicket, a structurally heterogeneous variation of Albany Thicket in South Africa. We relate the physical structure and density of thicket bush clumps to distance from artificial watering points in four piosphere treatments differing in rangeland management history. Furthermore, we compare the pattern, extent, and variation in transformation at the end regions of our piosphere treatments with each other and with a transformed and untransformed reference site. Changes to the density and leaf mass below 1.5 m of bush clumps indicate that their structure is profoundly altered by mesoherbivores. Nevertheless, the evidence is not sufficient to indicate that irreversible changes in the physical structure of bush clumps have taken place and therefore that structural thresholds have been crossed. A useful addition to our sampling design would be to include exclosure plots along the piosphere gradients. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Contact between wild and domestic ungulates is increasing across rangelands, enabling disease co-transmission. Disease management is difficult given uncertainties in complex system behavior, limited empirical data, and logistical obstacles to interventions. We studied gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) transmission in a rangeland shared by both livestock and the critically-endangered migratory saiga antelope, Saiga tatarica, in order to model infection dynamics under current and plausible future scenarios of increasing livestock numbers, climate change and anti-helminth treatments. Our model was parameterised for trichostrongylid GIN - a cause of mortality and morbidity in ungulates globally -using data on observed faecal nematode egg output and host numbers and distribution. Results showed that seasonal saiga migration leads to asymmetry in parasite transmission, with the majority of GIN acquired by saigas in their autumn and winter range through prior pasture contamination from livestock. Consequently, reducing parasite burdens in livestock early in the season in these areas could dispro-portionately reduce cross-transmission to saigas. Early-season GIN suppression in livestock in the saiga's spring and summer range was predicted to have weaker effect on parasite transmission to saigas but reduces infections during the calving period, potentially increasing population health and resilience at this critical time. Optimally timed treatments could offset the effects of increasing livestock numbers on GIN infection pressure, while climate warming had only marginal impacts on GIN transmission under all scenarios. Our findings could support better understanding and mitigation of factors affecting saiga health and rural livelihoods. Our approach is transferable to other systems, particularly those with migratory hosts.

AB  - Understory planting affects the growth environment of tea plants, regulating the tea plant growth and the formation of secondary metabolites, which in turn affects the flavor of Xiaobai white tea. The present research adopted biochemical composition determination, widely targeted volatilities (WTV) analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, and odor activity value (OAV) analysis to analyze the characteristics in the macro-composition and volatile compounds of understory white tea. The sensory evaluation results indicated that understory Xiaobai white tea (LWTs) was stronger than ordinary Xiaobai white tea (PWTs) in terms of the taste of smoothness, sweetness, and thickness as well as the aromas of the flower and sweet. Understory planting reduced light intensity and air temperature, increased air humidity, organic matter, total nitrogen, and available nitrogen contents, which improved the growth environment of tea plants. The phytochemical analysis showed that the water-extractable substances, caffeine, flavonoids, and soluble sugar contents of understory tea fresh-leaf (LF) were higher than those of ordinary fresh-leaf (PF). The phytochemical analysis showed that the free amino acids, theaflavins, thearubigins, water-extractable substances, and tea polyphenols contents of LWTs were significantly higher than those of PWTs, which may explain the higher smoothness, sweetness, and thickness scores of LWTs than those of PWTs. The 2-heptanol, 2-decane, damasone, and cedar alcohol contents were significantly higher in LWTs than in PWTs, which may result in stronger flowery and sweet aromas in LWTs than in PWTs. These results provide a firm experimental basis for the observed differences in the flavor of LWTs and PWTs.

AB  - This study aimed to detect nerves taking part innervation in gazelles' (Gazella subgutturosa) shoulder and elbow joint capsule and to classify mechanoreceptor responsible for this innervation via histological and immunohistochemical methods. In order to detect quantity of the neural elements 12 adult gazelle cadavers (6 females and 6 males) were used. Capsules taken from shoulder and elbow joint were fixed by formaldehyde. Histological structures of mechanoreceptors were detected with haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Low-affinity neurotrophic receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP-9.5) and protein S-100 were classified via immunohistochemical staining method. The nerve endings of positive staining were counted by light microscope at 400x magnification. Histological examination revealed four types of nerve endings in the joint capsule. Free nerve endings, Ruffini, Golgi-like and Pacini nerving ends were detected in descending order. The more mechanoreceptors were detected in elbow joint than shoulder joint. It was concluded that the mechanoreceptors taking part in proprioceptive function of joints were highly observed in shoulder and elbow joint capsule. This strong innervation was thought as a result of gazelles' fast and nimbly movement ability.

AB  - Supplemental feeding of cervids during winter is a widespread management practice, but feeding may increase the risk of disease transmission. Therefore, legal regulations to limit supplemental feeding are often implemented when dealing with severe infectious diseases, such as chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. However, it is currently unclear whether these regulations result in decreased spatial clustering and aggregation as intended. Supplemental feeding is expected to restrict the movement of cervids. Therefore, a ban on feeding may also result in wider space use and a risk of geographic spread of disease. The space use of 63 GPS-marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) was investigated before (n = 34) and after (n = 29) the implementation of a legal regulation aimed at limiting the supplemental feeding of cervids during winter in a CWD-affected region of Nordfjella, Norway. Snow depth was the main determinant of the space use for red deer. A moderate reduction in the number of GPS positions in spatial clusters was evident during periods of deep snow once the ban was in place. Sizes of core areas (Kernel 50%), home ranges (Kernel 95%), and dispersion (MCP 100%, number of 1 km(2) pixels visited per deer) declined from January to March and with increasing snow depth. Dispersion (number of 1 km(2) pixels visited per deer) did not depend on snow depth after the ban, and red deer used larger areas when snow depth was high after the ban compared to before. The ban on supplementary feeding had no effect on size of core areas or home ranges. Several potential factors can explain the overall weak effect of the ban on space use, including the use of agricultural fields by red deer, other anthropogenic feeding, and landscape topography. This study highlights that snow depth is the main factor determining space use during winter, and it remains to be determined whether the moderate reduction in spatial clustering during deep snow after the ban was sufficient to lower the risk of disease transmission.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. is an ecologically and medicinally significant species widely distributed across Eurasia, the suitable habitat of H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis (is hereinafter referred to as sinensis) is concentrated in Northwest and Southwest China (approximately 34-40 degrees N, 100-115 degrees E). H. rhamnoides subsp. yunnanensis (hereinafter referred to as yunnanensis) is mainly distributed in the Hengduan Mountains and surrounding areas (approximately 25-30 degrees N, 98-103 degrees E). H. rhamnoides subsp. mongolica (hereinafter referred to as mongolica) is native to Central Asia to Siberia and is mainly distributed in Northern Xinjiang and Western Inner Mongolia in China (approximately 40-50 degrees N, 100-120 degrees E). H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica (hereinafter referred to as turkestanica) is mainly distributed in Western Xinjiang (approximately 40-45 degrees N, 70-85 degrees E). Climate change poses a considerable challenge, affecting its distribution and leading to shifts in its habitat ranges. This study applies the MaxEnt model to assess climate-driven distribution patterns of Hippophae species in China, and predicts current and future suitable habitats under climate change scenarios. This study employs the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS to simulate the potential distribution of four subspecies of H. rhamnoides during the current period and future projections under scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. The analysis reveals that the distributions of sinensis, mongolica, yunnanensis, and turkestanica are influenced primarily by climate variables such as temperature and precipitation, while yunnanensis is predominantly restricted by altitude. Future projections indicate that under the extreme climate of SSP5-8.5, centroid migration will be disrupted; specifically, sinensis is expected to migrate northeast or oscillate, mongolica will expand southwest but be limited by desert steppe zones, and turkestanica may face risks associated with groundwater depletion. This study advocates for integrating climate, ecological, and genetic data into conservation planning, with an emphasis on groundwater restoration and exploring genetic resources for stress resilience. The insights offered here contribute significantly to understanding climate adaptation mechanisms in arid and mountainous ecosystems and guide biodiversity conservation efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary As buffalo milk is important in Italy, especially in the southern regions where Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) buffalo mozzarella from Campania is produced, the need has arisen to trace the path of milk from the farm to the dairy. We aimed to verify the applicability of a buffalo tracing system throughout the national territory, following the Ministerial Decree of 9 September 2014. Use of the online system is mandatory for breeders, dairies, and intermediaries, and is required to record and communicate all milk that is produced, bought, and sold. In Italy, the number of registrations is more representative in the Campania region, which has the highest concentration of dairy buffalo herds; for the other regions, the number of farms registered in the system is less representative. The system highlights that the circuit of non-PDO products absorbs 35% of the total milk produced, while 65% of the milk is processed in PDO dairies, which allows for the control of milk production throughout the territory and facilitates the control of milk that proceeds to be frozen or that can only be used in non-PDO productions; this increases the transparency of the supply chain. The system is a computerized archive of the productions for all the operators in the sector. This document describes the development of a tracing system for the buffalo supply chain, namely an online computer system in which farmers, dairies, and brokers must maintain records of the production of milk through to the production of derivatives. The system is jointly used throughout the Italian national territory by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno (IZSM) and the Sistema Informativo Agricolo Nazionale Italiano (SIAN), after being made mandatory and regulated with the publication of the Ministerial Decree of 9 September 2014. Farmers are obligated to communicate their daily production of bulk milk, the number of animals milked, the number of the delivery note of the sale, and the name of the purchaser; within the first week of the month, they must communicate the milk production of each animal milked. Dairies are required to communicate the milk and the processed product (mozzarella, yogurt, etc.) purchased on a daily basis. The intermediaries are required to communicate the daily milk purchased, both fresh and frozen, the semi-finished product, and the sale of the same. The tracing system linked to the project authorized by the Ministry of Health, called "Development, validation and verification of the applicability of an IT system to be used for the management of traceability in the buffalo industry", provides operators with the monitoring of production and sales in real time through alerts and access logs. Currently, there are 1531 registered farmers, 601 non-PDO dairies, 102 PDO dairies, 68 non-PDO intermediaries, and 17 PDO intermediaries in Italy. The system provides support for the recovery of the buffalo sector; from the analysis of the data extrapolated from the tracing system of the buffalo supply chain for the years 2016 to 2019, this paper highlights that the application of the Ministerial Decree No. 9406 of 9 September 2014 and the tracing of the supply chain have increased the price of buffalo milk at barns from EUR 1.37/kg to EUR 1.55/kg from 2016 to 2019.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are increasing worldwide, and are typically most intense in humandominated unprotected areas where local people, livestock and wildlife share the same landscapes. Such conflict becoming severe as wildlife species damage crops and predate livestock, and the subsequent factors undermine wildlife conservation efforts in a region. Between March and June 2017, I conducted a questionnaire-based interview with 124 local farmers to examine the extent of human-olive baboon (Papio anubis) conflict and their conservation attitudes towards baboons in Wollo, Ethiopia. All respondents reported that crop foraging and small livestock (sheep and goats) predation were the two main human-olive baboon conflict causes in the region. Most respondents placed olive baboons as the second most destructive crop pest after geladas (Theropithecus gelada), and as the first most small livestock predator followed by leopard (Panthera pardus). Most farmers placed bean (Vicia faba) as the first most frequently raided crop by olive baboons followed by sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays). In the two years period (between 2015 and 2016), most (70.2%) respondents claimed that they lost their small livestock to olive baboons, with an annual average loss of 2.5 heads per year, equivalent to US$ 52.26. I found that most (80.7%) respondents had negative attitudes towards olive baboons, and 81.9% were not interested to olive baboon conservation in their localities. Most farmers agreed guarding as the best mitigation measures to minimize crop and livestock losses. The result shows that human-olive baboon conflicts create negative impact on both farmers' livelihood and baboon conservation in the region. I suggest that to mitigate human-olive baboon conflict shifting guarding system among local farmers as the means of keeping crop fields and small stock, and educating people about the ecosystem services of baboons as well as creation of a protected area should be considered in the region.

AB  - Floods are frequent natural disasters and could have serious impacts on aquatic environments. Eukaryotic communities in artificial canals influenced by floods remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variabilities among eukaryotes in response to floods in the Grand Canal, China. Generally, 781,078 sequence reads were obtained from 18S rRNA gene sequencing, with 304,721 and 476,357 sequence reads detected before and after flooding, respectively. Sediment samples collected after the floods exhibited a higher degree of richness and biodiversity but lower evenness than those before the floods. The eukaryotic communities changed from Fungi-dominated before floods to Stramenopile-dominated after floods. The spatial turnover of various species was the main contributor to the longitudinal construction of eukaryotes both before the floods (beta(SIM) = 0.7054) and after the floods (beta(SIM) = 0.6858). Some eukaryotic groups responded strongly to floods and might pose unpredictable risks to human health and environmental health. For example, Pezizomycetes, Catenulida, Glomeromycetes, Ellipura, etc. disappeared after the floods. Conversely, Lepocinclis, Synurale, Hibberdiales, Acineta, Diptera, and Rhinosporidium were all frequently detected after the floods, but not prior to the floods. Functional analyses revealed amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and energy metabolism as the main metabolic pathways, predicting great potential for these processes in the Grand Canal.

AB  - Population projection models based on long-term trends in regeneration and tree survival can be used to predict the future stability of swamp forest species using water management. Population growth and regeneration of a foundational tree species in North American cypress swamps (Taxodium distichum) were compared in the Cache River watershed of southern Illinois USA over several decades. This study examined T. distichum population growth in several regional swamps within the Cache River watershed along a moisture gradient to model growth, stability, or decline based on data of life history stage transitions, using data from the following time periods: the 1990s, 2002-2011, and 2012-2022. Using data from the 1990s, T. distichum populations in Crawford Tract in Buttonland Swamp were projected to increase over time because of the high frequency of juvenile stages at elevations with growing season drawdown and winter flooding. The situation in Crawford Tract had changed by 2019-2021 because T. distichum seedlings had not transitioned (i.e., saplings and young trees were absent) although no old-growth trees had died during or after the 1990s. In other regional swamps, projection models were constructed over two decades (2006-2021) along a dry-to-wet flood gradient including Section 8 Woods, Deer Pond, Wildcat Bluff, Snake Hole, and Heron Pond. Populations in swamps on the drier end of the gradient had more support from juvenile stages. In a tree health survey in 2022 within the impounded interior of But-tonland Swamp (not Crawford Tract), seventy percent of the old-growth T. distichum trees were stressed or declining. Coupled with the fact that no seedlings or saplings were observed, the populations in the interior of the swamp were not stable. Many factors could further stress these ancient T. distichum including interactions of impoundment with chemicals, disease, and changes in air temperature and precipitation. Overall, the seedling abundance in these swamps increased in these environments from 2012 to 2021, except in the most flooded swamps. From a management perspective, drier conditions were more conducive to the success of the earlier life history stages of T. distichum in these old-growth forests.

AB  - Bird- and bat-mediated biocontrol benefits the productivity of tropical commodity crops such as cacao, but the ecological interactions driving these ecosystem services remain poorly understood. Whereas birds and bats prey on herbivorous arthropods, they may also prey on arthropod mesopredators such as ants, with poorly understood consequences for pest biocontrol. We used a full-factorial experiment excluding birds, bats, and ants to assess their effects on (a) the abundance of multiple arthropod groups; (b) predation pressure on arthropods evaluated through artificial sentinel caterpillars; and (c) cacao yield over 1 year in shaded agroforestry systems of native cacao varieties in Peru. Birds and bats increased cacao yield by 118%, which translates in smallholder benefits of ca. US $959 ha(-1) year(-1). Birds and bats decreased predation by ants and other arthropods, but contributed to the control of phytophagous taxa such as aphids and mealybugs. By contrast, ant presence increased the abundance of these sap-sucking insects, with negative impacts for cacao yield. Notably, high abundances of the dominant ant Nylanderia sp., known to attend sap-sucking insects, were associated with lower cacao yield along a distance gradient from the closest forest edge. According to these results, arthropod predation by birds and bats, rather than mesopredation by arthropods, was most responsible for increases in cacao yield. Moving forward, detailed research about their trophic interactions will be necessary to identify the cause of such benefits. Retaining and restoring the large benefits of birds and bats as well as minimizing disservices by other taxa in cacao agroforests can benefit from management schemes that prioritize preservation of shade trees and adjacent forests within agroforestry landscapes.

AB  - We investigated several aspects of windthrow that are relevant to our understanding and management of forest ecosystems. As an example, we used an extreme event in December 2017, when the strongest storm in recent history occurred in the Slovenian Dinaric High Karst. We examined influential factors such as soil properties, wind speed, precipitation and ecological consequences for the affected forests. Soil properties were measured around standing and fallen silver fir trees at all three research sites. Tree species composition in the regeneration was observed on plots with chemical and acoustic ungulate deterrents and on control plots without deterrents. Economic estimates of yield loss due to damage were calculated at the national level. A model of the potential threat from windthrow was also developed based on data collected from windthrow events and meteorological data over the past 20 years. Our results indicate that soil depth and mineral fraction depth were similar at sites with and without damaged trees and were not the determining factors for tree toppling. Plots with acoustic deterrents showed the most effective regeneration development, the least decline in silver fir and the greatest increase in noble hardwood seedlings, while plots with chemical deterrents showed the least browsing damage. The estimated economic loss of epsilon 16.1 million is 6.6% less than the harvest under normal conditions. The economic loss was relatively low due to the nature of the storm, with the predominant type of damage being uprooted trees with no damaged trunks. The windthrow hazard model revealed that a large number of consecutive events with strong winds in each section weakened the stand, which was subsequently knocked down during the next extreme wind and rainfall event.

AB  - To facilitate forest transition to future climate conditions, managers can use adaptive silvicultural tools, for example the assisted translocation of tree species and genotypes to areas with suitable future climate conditions (i.e., assisted migration). Like traditional plantations, however, assisted migration plantations are at risk of failure because of browsing by ungulate herbivores. The ability of seedlings to tolerate browsing could also be hampered by low water availability, as is expected under climate change. Using a greenhouse experiment with five eastern North American tree species, we evaluated the effects of simulated winter browsing and reduced water availability on the growth (total biomass, shoot:root ratio), survival, and chemical composition (nitrogen, total phenolics, flavonoids) of seedlings. We compared seedlings from three geographic provenances representing three climate analogues, i.e., locations with a current climate similar to the climate predicted at the plantation site at a specific time (here: current, mid-century and end of the century). We hypothesized that seedlings would allocate resources to the system (shoots or roots) affected by the most limiting treatment (simulated browsing or reduced water availability). Additionally, we evaluated whether the combination of treatments would have an additive or non-additive effect on the growth, survival and chemical composition of the seedlings. Quercus rubra seedlings reacted only to the water reduction treatment (changes in biomass and N concentration, dependent on geographic provenance) while Pinus strobus reacted only to the simulated browsing treatment (biomass and chemical composition). We also observed non-additive effects of reduced water availability and simulated browsing on Prunus serotina, Acer saccharum and Thuja occidentalis. In general, shoot:root ratio and investment in chemical defense did not vary in response to treatments. The regrowth response observed in Q. rubra and A. saccharum suggests that these species could tolerate periodic browsing events, even when water availability is reduced. More information is required to understand their long-term tolerance to repeated browsing events and to harsher and more frequent water stress. We highlight the importance of species-specific growth and allocation responses that vary with geographic provenance, which should be considered by managers when planning climate-adapted strategies, such as assisted migration.</p>

AB  - Resource selection and space use are important aspects of an animal's ecology and understanding these behaviors is necessary for proper wildlife management. We used mixed-effect integrated step-selection models to evaluate seasonal variation in resource selection between male and female elk (Cervus canadensis) and diel periods in central Pennsylvania, USA. Resource selection varied seasonally, between sexes, and across diel periods. These results demonstrate strong seasonal sexual segregation in resource use, and movements between habitats throughout the day, highlighting the dynamic nature of resource selection by elk and underscoring the importance of considering sexual variation at multiple temporal scales when designing ungulate management strategies. Finally, we developed habitat suitability maps for male and female elk in the Pennsylvania Elk Management Area. Wildlife ecologists and managers must consider multiple sources of variation in habitat use and resource selection, particularly for large mobile species such as elk.

AB  - Herbivory reflects the interaction between plants and insects in ecosystems, and its latitudinal patterns at the global scale have attracted widespread attention. While many studies support the latitudinal herbivory hypothesis, it remains contentious. This study, based on a global dataset of 1206 herbivory records, explored the global latitudinal patterns of insect herbivory on leaves and their influencing factors. We found that herbivory decreased with increasing latitude from the equator to the poles, supporting the latitudinal herbivory hypothesis. Latitude affected the variation in climate, soil nutrients, and plant functional traits, which ultimately affected herbivory. Plant functional traits were the key factors affecting the global latitudinal patterns of herbivory, with climatic factors playing an important regulatory role, while soil nutrients had a relatively minor impact, explaining 7.3%, 4.66%, and 0.98% of the latitudinal variation in herbivory, respectively. Specifically, plant height and mean annual temperature were the most important drivers of the global latitudinal patterns of herbivory, explaining 3.39% and 3.03%, respectively. Our study focused on two new perspectives-plant functional traits and soil nutrients. Although soil nutrients had a relatively minor influence on the latitudinal patterns of herbivory, we emphasized the significant impact of plant functional traits on the latitudinal patterns of herbivory. Our findings provide new insights into understanding and predicting the geographic patterns of herbivory and ecological interactions in the context of global climate change, offering important references and ecological significance.

AB  - The agricultural industry is highly dependent on using water quality due to challenging soil and climatic conditions. Hence, this study investigated the potential reuse of treated effluents from a pilot-scale coupled UASB-Biofilter system for the cultivation of drought-resistant fodder shrubs using wastewater generated from the buffalo milkmaid process. The milkmaid wastewater was treated in a sedimentation tank, with the aim of removing large suspended solids and settleable organic matter, and then in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). The UASB effluent was treated in a biofilter. A field experiment was carried out at the Experimental Farm of Veterinary Faculty, Suez Canal University, from March to October 2023 to study the effect of different quality of treated buffalo milkmaid wastewater with COD (Null, 1000 +/- 28, 130 +/- 33, 520 +/- 27, 100 +/- 30 mg.L-1, respectively)on the growth of Acacia saligna and Moringa oleifera shrubs. Split plot designed with five Treatments: Control (freshwater) (T1), sedimentation tank effluent (T2), Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (modified UASB with rice straw biochar) effluent unit (T3), conventional UASB effluent unit (T4), and biofilter effluent unit (T5), of each species. Vegetative growth, the biomass of shrubs, and the soil NPK, organic matter, and organic carbon were determined. Moringa oleifera shrubs showed higher biomass (2330.3 g)and nitrogen content (62.02 mg kg-1) in soil compared to A. saligna. UASB treatments (T3 and T4) promoted the best growth, with treated buffalo milkmaid wastewater increasing nitrogen concentrations in the soil. Overall, UASB proved to be the most effective treatment for enhancing growth in A. saligna and M. oleifera shrubs in sandy loam soil. This study evaluates the performance of a pilot-scale UASB-Biofilter system for treated effluent reuse in drought-resistant fodder shrubs cultivation. It also conducts a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and RStudio 4.4.1, analyzing trends in wastewater reuse research from 1999 to 2024 based on data from the Web of Science. The review provides insights into the evolution of wastewater reuse in sustainable agro-hydrology and highlights emerging research areas for further investigation.

AB  - This experiment aimed to determine the temperature limits beyond which seahorse growth and reproduction become suboptimal due to climate change. Four temperatures (16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C) were tested to evaluate their effect on juvenile (1-56 days post-parturition (DPP)) and adult (one year old) long-snout seahorses, Hippocampus guttulatus. Additionally, the reproductive performance of adults was observed. Another experiment measured oxygen consumption (MO2) in the same age groups and temperatures. Adults showed significantly higher growth rates at 20 and 24 degrees C compared to 16 and 28 degrees C. Adult mortality rates were 0%, 0%, 6.2%, and 62.5% at the respective temperatures. Juvenile growth performance was higher at 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C but significantly lower at 16 degrees C and null at 28 degrees C, with survival rates of 8%, 62%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. Oxygen consumption increased with temperature, ranging from 106.3 +/- 3.1 to 203.3 +/- 3.1 mu mol O2/g BW/h at 16 degrees C, and from 127.6 +/- 3.5 to 273.3 +/- 3.1 mu mol O2/g BW/h at 28 degrees C for adults and 1 DPP juveniles, respectively. The study highlights that juvenile and adult H. guttulatus have narrow thermal boundaries, beyond which reproduction, growth, and survival are seriously affected. Under climate change, the species appears unable to cope, potentially leading to their rapid disappearance.

AB  - Composting is a sustainable and eco-friendly technology that turns animal waste into organic fertilizers. It remains unclear whether differences exist in the structure of microbial communities during different livestock manure composting. This study analyzed the dynamic change of bacterial and fungal communities, metabolic function, and trophic mode during chicken manure (CM) and pig manure (PM) composting based on 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Environmental factors were investigated for their impact on microbial communities. During composting, bacterial diversity decreased and then increased, while fungal diversity slightly increased and then decreased. Saccharomonospora and Aspergillus were the dominant genera and key microorganisms in CM and PM, respectively, which played crucial roles in sustaining the stability of the ecological network structure in the microbial ecology and participating in metabolism. Saccharomonospora gradually increased, while Aspergillus increased at first and then decreased. PM had better microbial community stability and more keystone taxa than CM. In CM and PM, the primary function of bacterial communities was metabolism, while saprotroph was the primary trophic mode of fungal communities. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was the primary factor influencing the structure and function of microbial communities in CM and PM. In addition to DOC, pH and moisture were important factors affecting the fungal communities in CM and PM, respectively. These results show that the succession of bacteria and fungi in CM and PM proceeded in a similar pattern, but there are still some differences in the dominant genus and their responses to environmental factors.

AB  - We examined small mammal (insectivores, bats and rodents) diversity in community and legally protected forest remnants in the Ghana-Togo Highlands of the Volta Region of Ghana, West Africa, a zoologically understudied area compared to neighboring Togo to the East, or Ghana west of the Volta River. We recorded 34 small mammal species: three species of shrews (Soricidae Fischer, 1815), 12 species of rodents, one primate (Galagidae Gray, 1825) and 17 species of bats (Chiroptera Blumenbach, 1779). The rodent Stochomys longicaudatus (Tullberg, 1893) appears to be a first record for Ghana. Two shrew, three rodent and one bat species were first records for the Volta Region. By comparing our small mammal captures and limited microhabitat data from 1999 and 2001 to forest cover change maps for the period 2000-2015 we discuss trends in species community changes due to forest cover loss and other disturbance regimes. Aside from contributing to our understanding of the distribution of several small mammal species, the study demonstrates the progressive loss of forest habitat in the Volta Region.

AB  - Wildlife feeding and nutrition are key drivers of several demographic parameters, such as breeding success and survival, influencing long-term population viability. To comply with the diet requirements that ensure offspring survival, parents adapt their forage strategies to the environmental conditions and resource availability. This is especially important for central-place foragers like raptors, where prey availability in the surroundings of nest and livestock carcasses significantly impact both foraging efforts and breeding success. Here we take advantage of 20 years extensive monitoring (2001-2020) of the Canarian Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) on the Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) to assess (1) what factors drive vulture diet diversity and, (2) how the number of livestock and diet diversity coupled together with environmental conditions affect breeding success and, ultimately, the conservation of vulture populations. We identified 3,787 prey items belonging to 37 different species. Diet diversity was positively related to the number of wild prey and to low livestock grazing pressure periods. Breeding success was positively related to the number of wild prey, low herbivory pressure and, to a lesser extent, to diet diversity. These results demonstrate the importance of wild prey on Canarian Egyptian vulture's diet, albeit livestock carcasses are the most abundant feeding resource. We argue that livestock have controversial conservation implications for this species because it provides a stable feeding resource, but, in turn, is one of the major ecosystem disruptors. Overgrazing by livestock can negatively affect wild primary consumers, which are essential for this endemic vulture population.

AB  - Simple Summary Using molecular techniques, we assessed the current situation of genetic structure and gene flow among different red deer groups living in the southern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the main distribution area of red deer in China. The result showed that the overall genetic diversity of red deer in the study area was intermediate. Significant genetic differentiation was observed, and a significant correlation was found between landscape variables and genetic differentiation, especially roads, altitude, and settlements, which were considered the main factors affecting the gene flow of red deer in this region. The research suggested that we should pay more attention to artificial landscapes and the supervision of human activities, and the distribution of human-made landscapes should avoid crossing the main habitats of red deer as much as possible. Red deer (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) living in the north of China are restricted and threatened due to human activities and the changes in the natural environment, which influence the dispersal and effective gene flow between different groups of red deer. Effective gene flow plays an important role in maintaining genetic diversity and structure and ensuring population health. In order to evaluate the genetic diversity level and understand the gene flow between different red deer groups, 231 fresh fecal samples were collected from the southern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. A microsatellite marker was used for genetic analysis. The results showed that the genetic diversity of red deer was intermediate in this region. Significant genetic differentiation among different groups was found in the main distribution area (p < 0.01) using F-statistics and the program STRUCTURE. Different degrees of gene flow existed in red deer groups, and the roads (importance = 40.9), elevation (importance = 38.6), and settlements (importance = 14.1) exerted main effects on gene flow between red deer groups. Human-made factors should be noticed and strictly supervised in this region to avoid excessive disturbance to the normal movement of the red deer. Further conservation and management of red deer should reduce the intensity of vehicular traffic in the concentrated distribution areas of red deer, especially during the heat season. This research helps us better understand the genetic level and health status of red deer in the southern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains and provides theoretical references for protecting and restoring the red deer populations in China.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of Gleditsia sinensis pod powder (GSPP), coconut shell biochar (CSB), rice husk biochar (RHB) and their mixtures on vermicomposting of pig manure and wheat straw using Eisenia fetida. The results indicated that the addition of GSPP or/and CSB and RHB could greatly enhance the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, as well as the activities of celluloses, protease, and alkaline phosphatase. However, the earthworm biomass was increased in the GSPP and/or CSB addition treatments but decreased in RHB addition treatments compared with the control. Compared with the control, addition of 4%GSPP+8%CSB significantly (P < 0.05) accelerated the degradation of organic matter and increased the concentration of nutrients (total N, P, K), NO3 - -N in final vermicompost. Germination and growth of tomato seedings were also higher (P < 0.05) in vermicompost produced with the addition of 4%GSPP+8%CSB than in control. Consequently, 4%GSPP+8%CSB addition was suggested as an efficient method to improve the vermicomposting of pig manure and wheat straw.

AB  - Animals select habitats based on food, water, space, and cover. Each of those components are essential to the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce in a particular habitat. Selection of resources is linked to reproductive fitness and individuals likely vary in how they select resources relative to their reproductive state: during pregnancy, while provisioning young when nutritional needs of the mother are high, but offspring are vulnerable to predation, or if they lose young to mortality. We investigated the effects of reproductive state on selection of resources by maternal female desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) by comparing selection during the last trimester of gestation, following parturition when females were provisioning dependent young, and if the female lost an offspring. We captured, and recaptured each year, 32 female bighorn sheep at Lone Mountain, Nevada, during 2016-2018. Captured females were fit with GPS collars and those that were pregnant received vaginal implant transmitters. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate differences in selection between females provisioning and not provisioning offspring, as well as the length of time it took for females with offspring to return levels of selection similar to that observed prior to parturition. Females that were not provisioning offspring selected areas with higher risk of predation, but greater nutritional resources than those that were provisioning dependent young. When females were provisioning young immediately following parturition, females selected areas that were safe from predators, but had lower nutritional resources. Females displayed varying rates of return to selection strategies associated with access to nutritional resources as young grew and became more agile and less dependent on mothers. We observed clear and substantial shifts in selection of resources associated with reproductive state, and females exhibited tradeoffs in favor of areas that were safer from predators when provisioning dependent young despite loss of nutritional resources to support lactation. As young grew and became less vulnerable to predators, females returned to levels of selection that provided access to nutritional resources to restore somatic reserves lost during lactation.

AB  - Current aspirations for nature recovery to address biodiversity loss and climate change will involve changing what landscapes look like, which can create challenging aesthetic experiences for members of the public. In this study, we interrogate the role of aesthetics in shaping visions of nature recovery, focussing on the construction and contestation of 'mess' and 'messiness' in nature recovery. We examine the political aesthetics of messy natures using a qualitative approach investigating visual and text materials across different sites of production in Britain, from newspapers to social media, paying particular attention to visual materials Our results show how the mediated debate around 'rewilding' urban environments and a beaver-themed garden winning a horticultural show are examples of a backlash against untidy environments through a politicised discourse, linking messy nature with left-wing ideologies, in contrast to the perceived orderliness and conservative ideals of good citizenship associated with tidiness. In contrast, social media imagery of messy and wild gardens demonstrates how mess is consciously framed aesthetically as a desirable 'look' for restored nature, symbolising progressive and environmentalist ideals of good citizenship through activities such as nature-friendly gardening and initiatives such as 'No Mow May', which celebrate the aesthetic of a more biodiverse messiness. And finally, we traced how environmental advocacy organisations are prefiguring the future of nature recovery in Britain through commissioned graphical representations that portray a 'tamed messiness' and the return of charismatic megafauna. Although these aesthetics may challenge prevailing pastoral aesthetics, they normalise continued inequality in the form of concentrated land ownership, especially in the Scottish Highlands. Policy implications. Our analysis shows that aesthetics play an important role in shaping views of what is 'natural', 'normal' and 'good' and therefore desirable in what a future (recovered) nature looks like. We suggest that nature recovery initiatives take aesthetics seriously, by interrogating how idealisations of 'how nature should look' may influence decision-making alongside ecological and other considerations. Taking aesthetics seriously also opens avenues for engaging with social and environmental justice, where alternative aesthetics can help in imagining more socially and environmentally just futures.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Foraging behavior of cattle is a critical factor for sustainable grassland grazing. Investigating cattle's behavior under varying grazing strategies can offer valuable insights into the interactions between grazing animals and grasslands. In this study, we used a fenced grazing experiment to test the hypothesis that grazing pressure influences the grass patches by altering the foraging behavior of cattle. Cattle location trajectories were tracked using Global Positioning System collars, and livestock behavior was simultaneously observed and recorded in the field. Five machine learning models-XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, and CatBoost-were employed to classify cattle's behavior and to assess the impact of grazing strategies on these behaviors. The effects of grazing strategies on grassland vegetation were analyzed based on spatial remote sensing data acquired from unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The main findings were: (1) the XGBoost classification model has outperformed the others models, with an average accuracy of 0.947; (2) grazing intensity only significantly affected standing behaviors, while grazing regime significantly influenced foraging, walking, standing, ruminating, and resting behaviors; (3) increased grazing intensity had led to a larger proportion of areas with declining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the study area; however, the proportion of areas with increased NDVI was consistently higher in rotationally grazed regions compared to that of continuously grazed areas; (4) The changes in NDVI were significantly positively correlated with foraging probability in continuously grazed plots; however, NDVI changes in lightly grazed rotational areas had a weak correlation with foraging probability. These results suggest that proper management strategies, such as rotational grazing can enhance grassland health, which provides a scientific foundation and technical support for the development and implementation of sustainable grassland management strategies.

AB  - With fire frequency predicted to increase globally, a more refined understanding of flammability, including the traits that drive its variation, will be critical to better predict postfire vegetation responses. Pausas, Keeley, & Schwilk recently proposed a multidimensional framework comprising three plant strategies for responding to fire: nonflammable, fast-flammable, and hot-flammable species. However, empirical data are still needed to validate this framework. We measured six flammability-related traits on over 2000 leaf samples from the fire-prone longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem. We assessed whether traits group into 'dimensions' of flammability and attempt to explain variation in these dimensions using species' growth form, leaf physiology, and population response to fire. We also investigated whether these dimensions were phylogenetically conserved. Individual samples and species were distributed continuously across three key axes (heat release, flame spread rate, and ignitability) and clustered into functional groups. Further, the axis of flammability related to flame spread rate exhibited a phylogenetic signal. A different combination of growth form, percent leaf carbon, and population response to fire best explained each axis. Here, we identify three dimensions of flammability in our system, providing support for the Pausas, Keeley, and Schwilk framework.

Pausas, Keeley y Schwilk propusieron un marco multidimensional que incluye tres estrategias de respuesta de las plantas al fuego: especies no inflamables, r & aacute;pidamente inflamables y c & aacute;lidamente inflamables. Sin embargo, a & uacute;n se necesitan datos emp & iacute;ricos para validar este marco propuesto. Medimos seis caracter & iacute;sticas relacionadas con la inflamabilidad en m & aacute;s de 2000 hojas provenientes de la sabana de Pinus palustris, que es un ecosistema propenso a incendios. Evaluamos si las caracter & iacute;sticas se agrupan en 'dimensiones' de inflamabilidad y explicamos la variaci & oacute;n en estas dimensiones utilizando la forma de crecimiento de las especies, la fisiolog & iacute;a foliar, y la respuesta de la poblaci & oacute;n al fuego. Tambi & eacute;n investigamos si estas dimensiones est & aacute;n conservadas filogen & eacute;ticamente.

AB  - This empirical study investigates how "gender is done" within Swedish wildlife management by identifying prevailing gender norms, and how gender norms can be challenged from a norm-critical perspective, in order to promote women's participation. The basis for the study is an ongoing evaluation of the Swedish Hunters' Association training initiative to increase women's participation in moose management groups. Three main norm categories are identified: performance; social interaction; and hunting as a lifestyle. Recommendations for continued gender equality work include active leadership in gender equality issues, a review of potentially excluding structures, promoting female mentors and networks, and the use of formal and transparent recruitment procedures. An understanding of norms affecting women's participation (or nonparticipation) in wildlife management is fundamental to design effective training, recruitment and nomination strategies in the future.

AB  - Interactions between physiological and behavioural adaptations to seasonal environments may be key to unravelling the mystery of partial migration. Physiological state, as indicated by body fat, influenced probability of migration in bighorn sheep as well as migration distance and probability of switching migratory tactics across years.
   Accretion of body fat by animals is an important physiological adaptation that may underpin seasonal behaviours, especially where it modulates risk associated with a particular behaviour. Using movement data from male Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae), we tested the hypothesis that migratory behaviours were risk-sensitive to physiological state (indexed by body fat). Sierra bighorn face severe winter conditions at high elevations and higher predation risk at lower elevations. Given that large body fat stores ameliorate starvation risk, we predicted that having small body fat stores would force animals to migrate to lower elevations with more abundant food supplies. We also predicted that body fat stores would influence how far animals migrate, with the skinniest animals migrating the furthest down in elevation (to access the most abundant food supplies at that time of year). Lastly, we predicted that population-level rates of switching between migratory tactics would be inversely related to body fat levels because as body fat levels decrease, animals exhibiting migratory plasticity should modulate their risk of starvation by switching migratory tactics. Consistent with our predictions, probability of migration and elevational distance migrated increased with decreasing body fat, but effects differed amongst metapopulations. Population-level switching rates also were inversely related to population-level measures of body fat prior to migration. Collectively, our findings suggest migration was risk-sensitive to physiological state, and failure to accrete adequate fat may force animals to make trade-offs between starvation and predation risk. In complex seasonal environments, risk-sensitive migration yields a layer of flexibility that should aid long-term persistence of animals that can best modulate their risk by attuning behaviour to physiological state.

AB  - Coral reef fisheries supply nutritious catch to tropical coastal communities, where the quality of reef seafood is determined by both the rate of biomass production and nutritional value of reef fishes. Yet our understanding of reef fisheries typically uses targets of total reef fish biomass rather than individual growth (i.e. biomass production) and nutrient content (i.e. nutritional value of reef fish), limiting the ability of management to sustain the productivity of nutritious catches. Here, we use modelled growth coefficients and nutrient concentrations to develop a new metric of nutrient productivity of coral reef fishes. We then evaluate this metric with underwater visual surveys of reef fish assemblages from four tropical countries to examine nutrient productivity of reef fish food webs. Species' growth coefficients were associated with nutrients that vary with body size (calcium, iron, selenium and zinc), but not total nutrient density. When integrated with fish abundance data, we find that herbivorous species typically dominate standing biomass, biomass turnover and nutrient production on coral reefs. Such bottom-heavy trophic distributions of nutrients were consistent across gradients of fishing pressure and benthic composition. We conclude that management restrictions that promote sustainability of herbivores and other low trophic-level species can sustain biomass and nutrient production from reef fisheries that is critical to the food security of over 500 million people in the tropics.

AB  - Though mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) persist in robust populations throughout most of their North American distribution, habitat loss, unregulated hunting, and other factors have reduced their historical range in Mexico. Two of the 6 putative subspecies inhabiting Mexico's deserts and Baja California peninsula are of conservation concern, occupying islands in the Pacific Ocean (Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis on Cedros Island: endangered) and Sea of Cortes (Odocoileus hemionus sheldoni on Tiburon Island: threatened). Focusing on the desert southwest (n = 448), we sampled Tiburon (n = 22) and Cedros (n = 15) Island mule deer using contemporary samples and natural history museum specimens to complete a phylogeographic evaluation of the species complex, and assess the phylogeography of these insular subspecies. Both insular subspecies formed endemic haplotype lineages, consistent with island biogeographic theory. Bayesian skyline plots were consistent with Holocene demographic expansion. Cedros Island deer were genetically most similar to adjacent mainland Baja California deer, but exhibited a suite of unique haplotypes and reduced genetic variation. Tiburon Island deer haplotypes unexpectedly nested within a mainland lineage found in distant New Mexico, rather than the adjacent mainland Sonoran lineage. Such findings suggest the importance of postglacial climate fluctuations and biotic community turnover in the phylogeographic history of mule deer in the desert southwest. Our genetic data corroborates cultural, archaeological, and phenotypic evidence supporting Cedros and Tiburon deer endemicity and subspecies status. Reduced genetic variation, divergence from mainland populations, and demographic trends on both islands indicate that conservation, monitoring, and management are critical to ensure persistence of these endemic insular subspecies.

AB  - Top predators are important drivers in shaping ecological community structure via top-down effects. However, the ecological consequences and mechanisms of top predator loss under accelerated human impacts have rarely been quantitatively assessed due to the limited availability of long-term community data. With increases in top predator populations in northern China over the past two decades, forests with varying densities of top predators and humans provide an opportunity to study their ecological effects on mammal communities. We hypothesized a priori of concep-tual models and tested these using structural equation models (SEMs) with multi-year camera trap data, aiming to re-veal the underlying independent ecological effects of top predators (tigers, bears, and leopards) and humans on mammal communities. We used random forest models and correlations among species pairs to validate results. We found that top predator reduction could be related to augmented populations of large ungulates ("large ungulate re-lease") and mesopredators ("mesopredator release"), consistent with observations of mammal communities in other ecosystems. Additionally, top predator reduction could be related to reduced small mammal abundance. Hierarchical SEMs identified three bottom-up pathways from forest quality to human activities, large ungulates, and some small mammals, and five top-down pathways from human activities and top predators to some small mammals, large ungu-lates, and mesopredators. Furthermore, our results suggest that humans showed predominant top-down effects on mul-tiple functional groups, partially replacing the role of top predators, rather than be mediated by them; effects of humans and top predators appeared largely independent. Effects of humans on top predators were non-significant. This study provides novel insights into the effects of top predators and humans as super-predators on mammal commu-nities in forest ecosystems and presents cues of bottom-up effects that can be translated into actionable management plans for improving forest quality, thereby supporting top predator recovery and work/life activities of local people.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary history and adaptive process depends on the knowledge that we can acquire from both ancient and modern genomic data. With the availability of a deluge of whole-genome sequencing data from ancient and modern goat samples, a user-friendly database making efficient reuse of these important resources is needed. Here, we use the genomes of 208 modern domestic goats, 24 bezoars, 46 wild ibexes, and 82 ancient goats to present a comprehensive goat genome variation database (GGVD). GGVD hosts a total of similar to 41.44 million SNPs, similar to 5.14 million indels, 6,193 selected loci, and 112 introgression regions. Users can freely visualize the frequency of genomic variations in geographical maps, selective sweeps in interactive tables, Manhattan plots, or line charts, as well as the heatmap patterns of the SNP genotype. Ancient data can be shown in haplotypes to track the state of genetic variants of selection and introgression events in the early, middle, and late stages. For facilitating access to sequence features, the UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, BLAST, LiftOver, and pcadapt are also integrated into GGVD. GGVD will be a convenient tool for population genetic studies and molecular marker designing in goat breeding programs, and it is publicly available at http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/GoatVar.

AB  - Increasing anthropization is detrimental to the natural environment and the quality of life, affecting populations, communities, and the relationships between organisms. One of the most unique relationships in the animal world is parasitism, which often involves tightly specialized interactions between pairs of species. Bat flies, for example, are obligate ectoparasites represented by two highly adapted dipteran families that usually parasite a single bat species or genus. Recent studies have shown that bat flies could carry pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, transmitting them among bat individuals in a colony. Because host roost characteristics can influence bat-fly parasitism, we aimed to assess whether the ecological networks between parasites and their host bats are influenced by the degree of habitat anthropization. Our hypothesis was that bat-fly interaction networks would be less specialized and more nested in highly anthropized sites. We collected bat fly individuals from bats captured at 21 sampling sites located in the Federal District of Brazil and quantified the amount of natural and anthropized area within a 3-km buffer from the sampling site. Areas consisting of agriculture, construction, mining, roads, or any man-made structure were considered anthropized. Sites presented different degrees of anthropization, with areas ranging from 100% anthropized to areas retaining full natural cover. We built bat-bat fly networks for each of the sites and excluded those with sampling completeness values smaller than 0.7. We calculated key weighted structural metrics for each network, such as nestedness, specialization, and modularity. The effect of the reduction in natural cover on structural metrics was assessed through GLMMs, controlling for network size and ectoparasite diversity. Nestedness increased with the amount of anthropization, while specialization and modularity did not change and were overall high in all networks. This result suggests that anthropization may influence the assembly of bat-bat fly networks, leading to the emergence of a hierarchical assembly of interactions as parasites become less specialized and interact with a wider variety of hosts. Less specialized relationships could influence parasite fitness or even increase the likelihood of transmitting pathogens between populations of different bat species.</p>

AB  - Thanatosis (feigning death, defensive tonic immobility) is a widespread anti-predator behavioural strategy in animals. Animals that have evolved this behaviour react to physical contact with the predator by displaying a persistent tonic immobility that makes them look like dead prey. This phenomenon has often been observed in wild animal species. In domestic animals, defensive tonic immobility is well known in domestic chickens. However, feigning death appears to be unusual in domestic mammals, although similar states of tonic immobility, albeit with different evolutionary significance, have been described in many domestic mammals. Here we report on thanatosis in domestic lambs observed in two separate cases. In both cases, it was apparently a defensive anti-predator strategy, as the tonic immobility began during the capture and brief handling of the lamb due to the regular monitoring of birth weight and marking, while the thanatosis was terminated a few minutes later when the threat ceased (withdrawal of the human, calling and approach of the mother). Both lambs that exhibited thanatosis were male, about one day old and lived in a mixed herd of sheep and goats. Several factors may have contributed to the described occurrence of this phenomenon: the young age of the animals and the relatively low presence of humans in the herd in question. The observations show that evolutionary strategies/adaptations that were crucial in the ancestral environment have not disappeared during domestication and artificial selection and can still come into play when certain conditions and circumstances coincide. Ultimately, this observation can also be applied to the ancestor of the sheep, the mouflon, for which there is no report of this phenomenon to date.

AB  - Understanding how functional traits drive plant-herbivore interactions often illuminates the mechanisms driving niche partitioning and functional diversity in this important guild of consumers. On coral reefs, a diverse suite of herbivorous fishes is key for controlling algal abundance and impacting benthic community dynamics. Here, we focus on how algal traits shape complementarity in feeding for a diverse suite of large herbivorous fishes on a coral reef in the wider Caribbean. We used feeding assays in the field to document feeding patterns of the different herbivorous fishes across 50 species of macroalgae. Then, we used a suite of macroalgal traits such as dry mass, nutrient content, calcification, and chemical defenses to assess how these traits influenced patterns of consumption. Algal defenses were the major traits determining the overall vulnerability of algae to herbivores, with uncalcified algae from undefended genera being consumed 40% more rapidly than algae that were either calcified or chemically defended. Nutrient content of algae explained little in patterns of overall herbivory. We found significant niche diversification in feeding both among and within genera with the three major genera having unique feeding patterns on different suites of algae (Acanthurus spp. -red macroalgae, Sparisoma spp. -brown and green macroalgae, and Scarus spp. -benthic filamentous algae). With respect to how algal traits influenced patterns of feeding in individual species, we found that: (1) some herbivore species were almost exclusively influenced by avoiding algal defenses, (2) some species showed strong interactions between algal defenses and nutrient content that determined their feeding, and (3) some species (Kyphosus spp., Pomacanthus arcuatus) targeted chemically-defended algae with high nutrient content. Our work highlights the role that algal traits play in influencing patterns in the diversity and redundancy of feeding in herbivorous fishes on coral reefs.

AB  - Comammox Nitrospira represents a groundbreaking discovery in nitrogen cycle research, showcasing its remarking ability for complete ammonia oxidation, which challenges prior conceptions of nitrification. In this study, we examined the response of comammox Nitrospira gene abundance, diversity, and community structure to different rates of pig manure substitution (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) in subtropical agroforestry soils. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms was assessed by qPCR, whereas the diversity and structure of comammox Nitrospira were determined by high-throughput sequencing. Our findings revealed that pig manure substitution led to an increase in soil pH, available phosphorus (AP), comammox Nitrospira abundance, and diversity within soils under Cinnamomum camphora coppice planting. Soil pH and AP were the primary factors influencing the diversity and community structure of comammox Nitrospira. Moreover, pig manure substitution significantly influenced the composition of comammox Nitrospira, notably by increasing the relative abundance of clade A.2.1 while reducing that of clade A.2.2. However, pig manure substitution did not exert a significant impact on net nitrification rates, suggesting bacterial relative abundances were more sensitive to manure substitution compared to the underlying biogeochemical processes. Overall, our results offer new insights into the response of comammox Nitrospira to different rates of pig manure substitution in Cinnamomum camphora coppice planting soils, highlighting the pivotal role of soil AP and pH as the key determinants shaping comammox Nitrospira diversity and community structure.

AB  - Patterns of Late Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrate diversity across North America have been interpreted primarily in terms of biogeographic provincialism driven by latitude or coastal-inland habitat gradients. A major difficulty in determining the influence of these two gradients is the existence of some large gaps in the terrestrial fossil record, notably the 'Bearpaw gap' caused by a transgression of the inland Bearpaw Seaway during the latter part of the Campanian. In this context, the terrestrial fauna preserved in the Campanian deposits of the Wapiti Formation (west-central Alberta, Canada) is crucial for addressing the information deficit. Deposited at the edge of the palaeo-circumpolar region, Unit 3 of the strictly terrestrial Wapiti Formation (WU3) is coeval with the 'Bearpaw gap', a period when the terrestrial record from better-sampled areas elsewhere in Canada and the U.S. A. gives way to marine sediments. Here we show, based largely on evidence from the recently discovered DC (Dinosaur-Chelonian) Bonebed locality, that the diverse WU3 vertebrate fauna shares similarities with lowland to marginal marine ecosystems in the Oldman and Dinosaur Park formations which were deposited in southern Alberta prior to the Bearpaw gap. In addition, a major change in faunal composition demarcates the upper boundary of WU3, related to the disappearance of the Bearpaw Sea in Canada. Data presented here help, first and foremost, to bridge an ~1.2-million-year gap in the North American record of Campanian terrestrial vertebrates. Resemblances between the WU3 vertebrate fauna and slightly older assemblages from southern Alberta underscore the importance of determining the spatiotemporal changes in environmental factors (e.g., coastal proximity). The occurrence of one seemingly endemic lizard, together with differences in relative taxon abundance, suggest additional latitude-correlated factors, implicating both latitudinal and coastal-inland habitat gradients in driving the taxonomic composition of Late Cretaceous terrestrial faunas.

AB  - Accumulation of silica (Si) by plants can be driven by (1) herbivory pressure (and therefore plant-herbivore interactions), (2) geohydrological cycles, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2), with (1-3) possibly affecting Si concentration with a 1-year delay. To identify the relative significance of (1-3), we analyzed the concentration of Si in fibrous tussock sedge (Carex appropinquata), the population density of the root vole (Microtus oeconomus), and the groundwater level, over 11 years. The largest influence of autumn Si concentration in leaves (Si-leaf) was on the level of the current-year groundwater table, which was positive and accounted for 13.3% of its variance. The previous year's vole population density was weakly positively correlated with Si-leaf, and it alone explained 9.5% of its variance. The only variable found to have a positive, significant effect on autumn Si concentration in rhizomes (Si-rhiz) was the current-year spring water level, explaining as much as 60.9% of its variance. We conclude that the changes in Si concentration in fibrous tussock sedge are predominantly driven by hydrology, with vole population dynamics being secondary. Our results provide only partial support for the existence of plant-herbivore interactions, as we did not detect the significant effects of Si tussock concentration on the vole density dynamics. This was mainly due to the low level of silicification of sedges, which was insufficient to impinge herbivores. Future studies on plant-herbivore interactions should therefore aim at disentangling whether anti-herbivore protection is dependent on threshold values of herbivore population dynamics. Furthermore, studies on Si accumulation should focus on the effect of water-mediated Si availability.

AB  - The degree of prey sociality reflects trade-offs between predation risk, and competition for mates and resources. Consequently, the degree of sociality is predicted to differ spatiotemporally. Variations in nychthemeral sociality are, however, understudied. We assessed the activity of solitary, territorial black wildebeest bulls (Connochaetes gnou) over rutting and non-rutting seasons. We predicted that solitary bulls would reduce their nocturnal use of territorial stands and join herds to reduce predation risk from nocturnally hunting lions (Panthera leo), but that these responses would differ across rutting and non-rutting seasons. We used camera trap data and modelled solitary bull and herd activity over 24-hour daily cycles, across rutting and non-rutting seasons. We calculated the proportion of images with solitary bulls and herds across nocturnal and diurnal periods, across both seasons. We show that solitary bulls are predominantly diurnal across both seasons, but the probability of nocturnal detection is higher in the rutting than in the non-rutting season. Furthermore, we recorded a lower proportion of solitary bulls to herds at night in the non-rutting relative to the rutting season. Thus, wildebeest bulls may trade-off predation risk for mate acquisition during the rutting season but reduce risky solitary behaviour during the non-rutting season.

AB  - A four-dimensional mathematical model is formulated to explore the fear effect exerted by large carnivore in the grassland ecosystem. The model depicts the interactions among herbage, domestic herbivore, wild herbivore and large carnivore, which incorporates both direct predation and anti-predator mechanisms. The dynamic properties of the model are analytically investigated, including the dissipativity of solutions, and the existence and stability of different equilibria. Some numerical simulations are also presented to exhibit rich dynamical behaviors, such as various types of bistabilities, periodic oscillation and chaotic oscillation. The study reveals that the appropriate level of fear factors can stabilize the system and increase the density of herbage and domestic herbivore. The fear effect plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the grassland ecosystem and promoting the economy of human society.

AB  - Non-indigenous species (NIS) can invade marine ecosystems worldwide not only because of higher growth rates and reproductive potential but also due to their ability to escape from native consumers either by defensive traits or by the colonization of spatial refuges. Spatial consumption refuges can be present in tidepools, especially in those from the high shore, with harsh environmental conditions. In order to test this hypothesis, we quantified consumer pressure on NIS in tidepools with different tidal elevations. We deployed tethering assays within 73 tidepools at 30 degrees S (Chile) in 2021 using the following four bait types: two NIS (the green seaweed Codium fragile and the tunicate Ciona robusta) and two reference baits (blades of the kelp Lessonia and dried squid). The two reference baits as well as the two NIS were consumed across all tidepools. Thus, there was no tidal gradient in NIS consumption: higher tidepools did not offer a spatial refuge as native consumers can reach them and consume NIS. Possibly, on wave-exposed coasts, high shore tidepools are frequently splashed, mitigating harsh conditions, and, therefore, reducing the potential for spatial refuges from consumption. While both NIS were eaten by native consumers in tidepools, they are nevertheless successful invaders. Therefore, our results suggest that NIS can compensate for consumer losses in tidepools, which allows them to colonize tidepool systems even if these do not offer spatial refuges from consumption. Tidepools might represent a first invasion window for NIS to enter natural communities, potentially causing important effects on biodiversity of rocky intertidal habitats.

AB  - Succession patterns spanning three seasons for insect fauna on pig cadavers were studied in Changwon, South Korea in 2018 and 2019. A total of 107 species belonging to 41 families in six orders were collected and identified. Four decomposition stages were recognized: fresh, bloated, decay, and dry. The number of species increased significantly after the fresh stage and reached the maximum number by the decay stage. The sequence of insect succession followed a general pattern in which Diptera peaked initially and Coleoptera peaked later. Chrysomya pinguis was the most frequently present species, and the timing of its different developmental stages on cadavers could be the most important indicator for post-mortem interval estimations in Changwon. Spatial and seasonal differences in the richness of insects were not significant. However, Calliphora nigribarbis occurred exclusively in spring and autumn, and Pheropsophus javanus occurred exclusively in one locality. Therefore, these species may be important for characterizing the different seasons or locations during post-mortem interval estimations. A list of the insects associated with above-ground pig cadavers during the three seasons was compiled, and it may be useful for estimating the time since death in areas with a similar bioclimate.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios have proven a valuable tool to investigate marine mammal ecology, including diet, distribution, and migratory movements. While most studies have focused on delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, delta S-34 values have been little used because their pattern of variation and tissue dynamics remain unclear. We examined the sequential variation of delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta S-34 values along the baleen plates from fin whales occurring off West Iceland in summer. All baleen plates exhibited fluctuations along their growing axis. A significant synchronic correlation was found between delta N-15 and delta S-34 values, while the relation of these values to the delta C-13 value was highly variable and inconsistent. These results were similar to those obtained in previous studies of Greenland bowhead whales, although the pattern of the oscillations in fin whales showed an increase in values during winter, while those of bowhead whales showed a decrease. Although seasonal variations in food intake and the associated cycles of protein synthesis and catabolism may have played a role in such fluctuations and the observed differences between species, we suggest that the main driver for the delta S-34 fluctuations reflected in baleen plates is the variation of local baselines between winter and summer grounds. This suggests ample potential for using delta S-34 values to study migratory movements and destinations of marine megafauna, provided that the geographic variation in delta S-34 baselines is clarified.

AB  - Exploring the genetic landscape of native cattle is an exciting avenue for elucidating nuanced patterns of genetic variation and adaptive dynamics. Xiangnan cattle, a native Chinese cattle breed mainly produced in Hunan Province, are well adapted to the high temperature and humidity of the local environment and exhibit strong disease resistance. Herein, we employed whole-genome sequences of 16 Xiangnan cattle complemented by published genome data from 81 cattle. Our findings revealed that Xiangnan cattle are pure East Asian indicine cattle with high genetic diversity and low inbreeding. By annotating the selection signals obtained by the CLR, theta pi, FST, and XP-EHH methods, genes associated with immunity (ITGB3, CD55, OTUD1, and PRLH) and heat tolerance (COX4I2, DNAJC18, DNAJC1, EIF2AK4, and ASIC2) were identified. In addition, the considerable introgression from banteng and gaur also contributed to the rapid adaptation of Xiangnan cattle to the environment of Southern China. These results will provide a basis for the further conservation and exploitation of Xiangnan cattle genetic resources.

AB  - Since the first plans to develop offshore wind farms (OWFs), concerns have been raised about the impacts on marine megafauna. Today, it is required to assess these impacts over the whole lifecycle of the OWF. Before construction, initial assessments are often conducted by visual surveys, but subsequent monitoring over the lifecycle of the OWF has to be digital due to safety requirements, leading to challenges in data comparability. The aim of this study was to attempt to establish generalizable intercalibration factors for this transition between visual and digital monitoring methods. To this end, intercalibration surveys were conducted at five different sites and at different times of the year within a site, using both visual monitoring at low-altitude and digital monitoring at both low and high altitudes. We tested the potential for intercalibration of the results based on the ratio of abundance estimated from data collected by the different methods. We explored factors such as the species under study and site-specific conditions that may influence intercalibration. We computed more than 100 intercalibration factors and found that, on average, abundance estimates from digital methods were higher than those from visual methods and that flight altitude for digital monitoring did not significantly influence abundance estimates. Aside from divergent abundance estimates depending on monitoring method, the findings also revealed significant heterogeneity, only one-third of which was explained by contextual factors such as taxonomy or the sea conditions. This outcome presents a pessimistic outlook on the prospect for the intercalibration of results between an initial assessment carried out with visual observations and subsequent monitoring with digital methods after OWF construction and until decommissioning. The high heterogeneity prevents seamless transferability of intercalibration factors and highlights the importance of local context.

AB  - Hunter-collected data and samples are used as indices of population performance, and monitoring programs often take advantage of such data as ecological indicators. Here, we establish the relationships between measures of skeleton size (lower jawbone length and hind-leg length) and autumn carcass mass of slaughtered individuals of known age and sex of the high Arctic and endemic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). We assess these relationships using a long-term monitoring dataset derived from hunted or culled reindeer. The two skeleton measures were generally strongly correlated within age class. Both jaw length (R-2 = 0.78) and hind-leg length (R-2 = 0.74) represented good proxies of carcass mass. These relationships were primarily due to an age effect (i.e. due to growth) as the skeleton measures reached an asymptotic size at 4-6 years of age. Accordingly, strong positive correlations between skeleton measures and carcass mass were mainly evident at the young age classes (range r [0.45-0.84] for calves and yearlings). For the adults, these relationships weakened due to skeletal growth ceasing in mature animals causing increased variance in mass with age-potentially due to the expected substantial impacts of annual environmental fluctuations. As proxies for carcass mass, skeleton measurements should therefore be limited to young individuals. Although body mass is the 'gold standard' in monitoring large herbivores, our results indicate that skeleton measures collected by hunters only provide similar valuable information for young age classes, particularly calves and yearlings. In sum, jaw length and hind-leg length function as proxies identical to body mass when documenting the impacts of changing environmental conditions on important state variables for reindeer and other herbivores inhabiting highly variable environments.

AB  - Leaf traits often vary with plant neighbourhood composition, which in turn may mediate plant susceptibility to herbivory. However, it is unknown whether there are any common patterns of change in leaf trait expression in response to neighbourhood diversity, and whether these responses confer increased resistance or susceptibility to herbivores.We used meta-analysis to combine data from 43 studies that examined the influence of neighbourhood diversity on eight physical and chemical leaf traits that could affect herbivory. All leaf traits apart from leaf thickness were highly plastic and exhibited significant differences between plant monocultures and species mixtures, but the direction of effect was variable. Leaf toughness was the only trait that displayed a significant decrease with plant diversity, whereas specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen were both marginally increased in species mixtures.The magnitude and direction of leaf trait responses to neighbourhood diversity were independent of plant density and phylogenetic diversity, but changes in SLA correlated positively with plant species richness. SLA was also significantly increased in experimental studies, but not in observational studies, while neighbourhoods containing nitrogen-fixers were associated with increased leaf nitrogen and reduced phenolics. When studies on the over-represented species Betula pendula were removed from the analysis, the effect of neighbourhood diversity on leaf toughness became nonsignificant, but phenolics were significantly reduced in diverse neighbourhoods composed of mature trees, and marginally reduced in species mixtures across all studies.Increases in plant neighbourhood diversity are often associated with reductions of herbivory, although in some cases, the reverse occurs, and plants growing in species mixtures are found to suffer greater herbivory than those in monocultures. This study offers a potential explanation for the latter phenomenon, as our results show that leaf trait expression is highly plastic in response to neighbourhood diversity, and in certain cases could lead to increased leaf quality, which in turn could promote greater rates of herbivory.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Understanding the structure and function of a lake's ecosystem is the premise and foundation to implementing ecosystem-based management. However, evaluating the status of the ecosystem of a lake as a whole is still difficult when it comes to selecting indicators, determining standards, and interpretating results. In order to quantify the ecosystem status of Lake Baiyangdian (BYD), a holistic food web model was built using Ecopath with Ecosim. Eleven Ecological Network Analysis indicators classified into three categories (ecological function, ecological maturity, and food web structure) were selected according to their representativeness and availability. Based on the published literature on similar freshwater lakes or reservoirs in the world, quantile-based classification criteria are obtained. Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process was employed to assign the weight of an indicator according to its importance, sensitivity, and adaptability. An integrated evaluation framework was formed after synthesizing the evaluation value using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. It was concluded that the ecological state of Lake BYD in 2009-2010 could be graded "Bad", featuring a low-quality mature ecosystem, low trophic transfer efficiency, and linear, simple, and fragile connections between trophic levels. More specifically, the "Medium" grade detritivory:herbivory ratio (D:H), mean trophic level of the catch (MTLC), and "Bad" grade of transfer efficiency (TE) indicate that the composition of trophic species is unbalanced and the material and energy transfer is inefficient. "Good" grades of total primary production over biomass (TPP/TB), biomass over total system throughput ratio (TB/TST), and relative ascendency (A/C), together with "Median" grade of total primary production over total respiration ratio (TPP/TR), show characteristics of a mature ecosystem due to a high biomass of macrophytes, although here is a "low quality" in terms of exergy. In terms of the performance of the food web structure, all indicators achieve a "Bad" grade, suggesting a linear, simple, and fragile network. According to our modeling results, controlling the excessive macrophyte biomass, restoring fish biodiversity, and mitigating the pressures of overexploitation are suggested for the ecosystem-based management of BYD. This paper provides an integrated method to evaluate the ecological state of a shallow lake when its own reference state is unavailable.

AB  - The northwestern region of China, known as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Area (QTPA), is characterized by unique climate conditions that support the breeding of various highly-adapted livestock species. Tick vectors play a significant role in transmitting Babesia and Theileria species, posing serious risks to animal health as well as the economy of animal husbandry in QTPA. A total of 366 blood samples were collected from Tibetan sheep (n = 51), goats (n = 67), yaks (n = 43), cattle (n = 49), Bactrian camels (n = 50), horses (n = 65), and donkeys (n = 40). These samples were examined using conventional and nested PCR techniques to detect Theileria and Babesia species. The overall infection rates were 0.3% (1/366) for Babesia spp. and 38.2% (140/366) for Theileria spp. Notably, neither Babesia nor Theileria species were detected in donkeys and yaks. The infection rates of Babesia and Theileria species among animals in different prefectures were significantly different (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Babesia bovis, B. bigemina, B. caballi, and B. ovis were not detected in the current study. To our knowledge, this is the first documented detection of Theileria luwenshuni infection in Bactrian camels and goats, as well as T. sinesis in cattle and T. equi in horses on the Qinghai plateau. These novel findings shed light on the distribution of Babesia and Theileria species among livestock species in QTPA.

AB  - In some species where male mating success largely depends on intrasexual competition, males can adopt migratory or resident strategies to seek breeding opportunities. The resulting mixture of resident and migrant tactics within a population can have important ecological, genetic, and evolutionary consequences for metapopulations. Bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis males establish a linear dominance hierarchy that influences their mating tactics. Some males perform breeding migrations during the pre-rut and rut to seek mating opportunities, but little is known about these seasonal movements. We analyzed presence/absence data for 62 marked bighorn males during six mating seasons (20-32 males/year) in the Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada, where hunting was not allowed. On average, about half of males left their natal population to rut elsewhere. The proportion of males leaving (yearly range 15%-69%) increased as the number of resident mature males increased and the populational sex ratio decreased, with fewer females during the pre-rut. Among those leaving the park, 24% did so in October, while the trophy sheep hunting season was open. Detailed monitoring of breeding migrations in protected populations could inform management strategies to limit evolutionary impacts of hunting, which can alter size-dependent mortality and create artificial pressures driving changes on heritable traits.

AB  - Estimates of demographic parameters for lesser snow geese Anser caerulescens caerulescens have become critical to understand ecosystem change in northern Canada. Exponential increase in abundance has produced hyperdensities of these herbivores that can affect Arctic ecosystem stability through intense foraging. Increased and sustained marking of individually-identifiable lesser snow geese over their breeding distribution now permits joint estimation of local vital rates and movement probabilities among widely scattered subpopulations. We used multi-state models, including an unobservable state, with live captures from 5 subpopulations and dead recoveries to estimate annual probabilities of 1) survival, 2) capture, 3) reported mortality and 4) movement to other subpopulations, as well as derived estimates for probabilities of site fidelity and harvest. Our dataset included 144 719 captures of 139 177 lesser snow geese marked with metal legbands, from 2006 to 2015, of which 5542 were recaptured near breeding sites and 9709 were recovered dead in North America. The best model supported variation in survival by subpopulation and age, with additive effects of subpopulation, age and sex on movement probability. Male breeding dispersal was greater than by females, and juvenile geese were more likely to move than adults. Strong northeastward geographic asymmetry in the probability of breeding movement was consistent with an eastward shift in wintering distribution observed in hunter recoveries. Mean annual survival ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 for adults, and 0.16 to 0.47 for juvenile geese, with a strong negative relationship between regional adult and juvenile survival. Harvest probabilities were all <= 0.03 for adult and <= 0.06 for juvenile geese, suggesting little influence from direct anthropogenic exploitation. Metrics for subpopulation persistence and contributions of each to the metapopulation suggested declines in all but one subpopulation, and a declining Midcontinent population overall. Our study highlights the importance of all subpopulation demographic parameters as modulators of persistence at both local and range-wide population dynamics.

AB  - In the past decade, studies have demonstrated that urban and nonurban wildlife populations exhibit differences in foraging behavior and diet. However, little is known about how environmental heterogeneity shapes dietary variation of organisms within cities. We examined the vertebrate prey components of diets of coyotes (Canis latrans) in San Francisco to quantify territory- and individual-level dietary differences and determine how within-city variation in land cover and land use affects coyote diet. We genotyped fecal samples for individual coyote identification and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition and individual niche differentiation. The highest contributor to coyote diet overall was anthropogenic food followed by small mammals. The most frequently detected species were domestic chicken, pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), domestic pig, and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Diet composition varied significantly across territories and among individuals, with territories explaining most of the variation. Within territories (i.e., family groups), the amount of dietary variation attributed to among-individual differences increased with green space and decreased with impervious surface cover. The quantity of anthropogenic food in scats also was positively correlated with impervious surface cover, suggesting that coyotes consumed more human food in more urbanized territories. The quantity of invasive, human-commensal rodents in the diet was positively correlated with the number of food services in a territory. Overall, our results revealed substantial intraspecific variation in coyote diet associated with urban landscape heterogeneity and point to a diversifying effect of urbanization on population diet.

AB  - This study is aimed at estimating the role of livestock sector in food security by considering the past trends and future forecasts in livestock population, situation of feed & fodder availability and potential adaptation/mitigation strategies in the epoch of climate change. In this regard, secondary data was collected from World Bank, FAO, Ministry of Finance Pakistan and Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and was analyzed using semi-log model, automatic ARIMA, and Lorenz curve methodology. The results of this study forecasted the increase in the population of cattle, buffalo, goat and camel in near future while forecast about population of sheep shows decrease in its population in coming years. Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient revealed relatively equal distribution in the number of cattle and buffalo among herds than that of sheep and goat. The total area under fodder production' and 'fodder productivity' have a declining trend. The linkages among livestock production index, GNI per capita and consumption expenditure elaborate that the livestock is playing a major role in food security of Pakistan and other neighboring countries (China, India and Bangladesh). Analyzing various adaptation and mitigation strategies in the context of Pakistan revealed that in the era of climate change and food insecurity, this sector could help by wisely adopting cost-effective adaptation/mitigation strategies like educating farmers about managing and altering feed production and consumption techniques. Therefore, maintaining a consistent policy to focus livestock economy on the wake of increasing food security concerns and climate change, a holistic approach is required to make decisions for the uplift of the rural economy in the country.

AB  - Behavior of insects, such as pollination and grazing, is usually determined by biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). However, particularly in O3-polluted urban forests, the BVOCs-based plant-insect communication can be disrupted by the reaction of O3 with leaf-emitted BVOCs, such as between Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica) and a leaf beetle (Agelastica coerulea). To understand plant-insect communication in O3-polluted environments, it is necessary to identify chemical species of BVOCs that contribute to attractiveness toward insects but are diminished by elevated O3. In this study, we conducted olfactory response tests and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses to clarify whether there is a similarity of BVOC components among Betulaceae host trees that can explain the attraction of the stenophagous insect A. coerulea. The olfactory response tests indicated that Betulaceae host trees attract A. coerulea via leaf-emitted BVOCs, while there was no preference of the leaf beetles to non-host trees (Sorbus commixta and Morus bombycis). However, GC-MS analyses indicated that the composition of BVOC blends considerably differed among Betulaceae host trees, although alders (Alnus hirsuta and A. japonica) had a similar composition of BVOC blend in each season (June and September) during which the adult leaf beetle is active. A distinct characteristic of the emission from B. platyphylla was that 2-carene and limonene, which are O3-reactive species, were emitted with a high monoterpene ratio irrespective of the season. Thus, these volatiles and the blend could be expected to lead the disrupted communication found between B. platyphylla and A. coerulea under elevated O3 in previous field studies. In addition, our results indicated that A. coerulea is attracted to more than one blend within Betulaceae host trees, suggesting that grazing damages can be affected by different host preferences and O3 reactivity with specific BVOCs in the field. BVOCs-based plant-insect interactions should be further studied in multi-species communities to better understand plant-insect communication in O3-polluted environments.

AB  - Frugivory, that is feeding on fruits, pulp or seeds by animals, is usually considered a mutualism when interactions involve seed dispersal, and an antagonism when it results in the predation and destruction of seeds. Nevertheless, most frugivory interactions involve both benefits and disadvantages for plants, and the net interaction outcomes thus tend to vary along a continuum from mutualism to antagonism. Quantifying outcome variation is challenging and the ecological contribution of frugivorous animals to plant demography thus remains little explored. This is particularly true for interactions in which animals do not ingest entire fruits, that is in seed-eating and pulp-eating. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of Neotropical palm-frugivore interactions, with a focus on how frugivore consumption behaviour (i.e. digestive processing, fruit-handling ability and caching behaviour) and feeding types (fruit-eating, pulp-eating and seed-eating) influence interaction outcomes at different demographic stages of palms. We compiled a total of 1043 species-level palm-frugivore interaction records that explicitly captured information on which parts of palm fruits are eaten by animals. These records showed consumption of fruits of 106 Neotropical palm species by 273 vertebrate species, especially birds (50%) and mammals (45%), but also fish (3%) and reptiles (2%). Fruit-eating involved all four taxonomic vertebrate classes whereas seed-eating and pulp-eating were only recorded among birds and mammals. Most fruit-eating interactions (77%) resulted in positive interaction outcomes for plants (e.g. gut-passed seeds are viable or seeds are successfully dispersed), regardless of the digestive processing type of vertebrate consumers (seed defecation versus regurgitation). The majority of pulp-eating interactions (91%) also resulted in positive interaction outcomes, for instance via pulp removal that promoted seed germination or via dispersal of intact palm seeds by external transport, especially if animals have a good fruit-handling ability (e.g. primates, and some parrots). By contrast, seed-eating interactions mostly resulted in dual outcomes (60%), where interactions had both negative effects on seed survival and positive outcomes through seed caching and external (non-digestive) seed dispersal. A detailed synthesis of available field studies with qualitative and quantitative information provided evidence that 12 families and 27 species of mammals and birds are predominantly on the mutualistic side of the continuum whereas five mammalian families, six mammal and one reptile species are on the antagonistic side. The synthesis also revealed that most species can act as partial mutualists, even if they are typically considered antagonists. Our review demonstrates how different consumption behaviours and feeding types of vertebrate fruit consumers can influence seed dispersal and regeneration of palms, and thus ultimately affect the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems. Variation in feeding types of animal consumers will influence ecosystem dynamics via effects on plant population dynamics and differences in long-distance seed dispersal, and may subsequently affect ecosystem functions such as carbon storage.
   The quantification of intra- and inter-specific variation in outcomes of plant-frugivore interactions - and their positive and negative effects on the seed-to-seedling transition of animal-dispersed plants - should be a key research focus to understand better the mutualism-antagonism continuum and its importance for ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Recent studies on insect interactions on plants have revealed that herbivorous insects indirectly interact with each other through changes in plant traits following herbivory. However, less attention has been given to plant biomass relative to plant quality in relation to indirect interactions among herbivores. We explored the extent to which the larval food demand of two specialist butterflies (Sericinus montela and Atrophaneura alcinous) explains their interaction on a host plant, Aristolochia debilis. A laboratory experiment showed that plant mass consumption by A. alcinous larvae was 2.6 times greater than that by S. montela. We predicted that A. alcinous, which requires more food, is more vulnerable to food shortages than S. montela. In a cage experiment, an asymmetric interspecific interaction was detected between the two specialist butterflies; S. montela larval density significantly decreased the survival and prolonged the development time of A. alcinous, but A. alcinous density affected neither the survival nor the development time of S. montela. The prediction based on the food requirement was partly supported by the fact that increasing A. alcinous density likely caused a food shortage, which more negatively affected A. alcinous survival than S. montela survival. Conversely, increasing the density of S. montela did not reduce the remaining food quantity, suggesting that the negative effect of S. montela density on A. alcinous was unlikely to be due to food shortage. Although aristolochic acid I, a defensive chemical specific to Aristolochia plants, did not influence the food consumption or growth of either butterfly larva, unmeasured attributes of plant quality may have mediated an indirect interaction between the two butterflies. Consequently, our study suggests that not only the quality but also the quantity of plants should be considered to fully understand the characteristics, such as symmetry, of interspecific interactions among herbivorous insects on the same host plant.

AB  - Herbivorous ungulate diets affect population performance and overall forest health through balanced interactions on plant-herbivore relations; therefore, understanding them is critical. Faeces are frequently used in ungulate nutritional ecology because they can provide information about animals' digestive efficiency. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) have different morpho-physiological and ecological constraints, and these differences should be reflected in their faeces. On the other hand, the lack of information about the animal (sex, age, reproductive status, diet selection, etc.) may be challenging for such studies. This study aimed to detect species' different susceptibility to these factors reflected in animals' faeces. Thus, we hypothesised that near-infrared reflectance spectrometry (NIRS) could distinguish between the faecal nutrients of two cervids. We collected 94 usable faeces from both species along the forest transect in Bohemian forests in the Czech Republic, covering 2 500 ha. Roe and red deer overlap was determined using the four faecal nutritional components on two axes. No discrimination occurred, refuting our hypothesis and highlighting that out-of-control variables are critical for faecal studies in uncontrolled settings. Fibrous parts explained the most variance (48%), indicating animals' strong reliance on nutrition quality. Apparently, uncontrolled supplementary feeding produced similar faecal nutrient outcomes during the nutrition-limiting winter, which was theoretically supported by the animal's response to predation and hunting pressure. The inability of NIRS to identify the source of N in faeces may also explain the lack of discrimination.

AB  - Reintroduction and rewilding initiatives are key strategies to reverse human impacts on ecosystems and re-establish natural processes. However, rewilding may involve complex management scenarios, because many expanding species can have economic impacts and cause human-wildlife conflicts. Conflicts can be particularly challenging when carnivores, large herbivores and ecosystem engineers are involved. The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is a key ecosystem engineer that was once present in a large part of the Palearctic, but in Medieval times underwent a severe decline due to the joint effects of habitat loss and hunting. Subsequent legal protection and reintroductions triggered the recovery of the species through most of its original range. Eurasian beavers recently started the recolonization of Italy, because of the joint effects of natural dispersal (from Austria to northern Italy) and illegal reintroductions (central Italy). The lack of data on the most likely colonization routes hampers appropriate management of this species. Here, we identified the areas where beaver populations are most likely to arrive in the near future within Europe, with a specific focus on Italy. First, we developed spatially cross-validated species distribution models to identify the areas with the highest suitability for the Eurasian beaver in Europe. Second, we used connectivity modelling to assess the possible expansion routes of this species in Italy. Large areas of Europe are suitable for the beaver and may soon be colonized. The connectivity model showed a high potential for expansion from central Italy to surrounding areas, while the high isolation of northern Italy populations suggests a slower expansion. Our results can help environmental managers to understand where to focus both the future monitoring of beaver populations and actions aimed at preventing and mitigating possible human-wildlife conflicts that could arise from the expansion of an environmental engineer such as the beaver.

AB  - Drought has a significant impact on plant-insect interactions by altering plant survival, growth, leaf quality, and defense traits. Tropical plants are particularly vulnerable to water depression because of shallow root depth. In the context of climate change, drought events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity; however, their impact on tropical ecosystems remains poorly known. Insect herbivores represent the largest feeding guild of arthropods, and they devour four to five times more plant material than vertebrates do. Understanding how drought affects plant traits and leaf palatability in a keystone and ecologically diverse plant genus, such as Ficus (Moraceae), is crucial for predicting how climate change might alter tropical plant-insect interactions. We examined the impact of drought intensity and duration on the leaf nutritional quality, defensive traits, and herbivory damage by caterpillars in three tropical and one Mediterranean Ficus species in a greenhouse. We also conducted food choice trials with generalist caterpillars to evaluate the impact of drought on herbivores. Drought intensity and duration had no direct effect on leaf palatability across the Ficus species. However, drought indirectly affected leaf palatability via drought-induced leaf traits in a species-specific manner. Drought intensity and duration decreased leaf water content, resulting in decreased leaf palatability in F. benjamina and F. lyrata. Leaf defensive traits such as flavonoid concentration were affected by drought intensity and decreased leaf palatability in F. carica. Drought influenced the leaf traits of F. elastica, but none of them affected leaf palatability. Overall, this study establishes the link between drought and insect feeding on plants via leaf traits. The species-specific responses to drought highlight the significance of climate-related plant life histories in relation to climate change, underscoring the need for further investigations.

AB  - Plants release a complex blend of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to stressors. VOC emissions vary between contrasting environments and increase with insect herbivory and rising temperatures. However, the joint effects of herbivory and warming on plant VOC emissions are understudied, particularly in high latitudes, which are warming fast and facing increasing herbivore pressure. We assessed the individual and combined effects of chemically mimicked insect herbivory, warming, and elevation on dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa) VOC emissions in high-latitude tundra ecosystems in Narsarsuaq, South Greenland. We hypothesized that VOC emissions and compositions would respond synergistically to warming and herbivory, with the magnitude differing between elevations. Warming increased emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and isoprene. Herbivory increased the homoterpene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, emissions, and the response was stronger at high elevation. Warming and herbivory had synergistic effects on GLV emissions. Dwarf birch emitted VOCs at similar rates at both elevations, but the VOC blends differed between elevations. Several herbivory-associated VOC groups did not respond to herbivory. Harsher abiotic conditions at high elevations might not limit VOC emissions from dwarf birch, and high-elevation plants might be better at herbivory defense than assumed. The complexity of VOC responses to experimental warming, elevation, and herbivory are challenging our understanding and predictions of future VOC emissions from dwarf birch-dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Forest pests can cause massive ecological and economic damage worldwide. Ecologically sound solutions to diminish forest insect pest impacts include the use of their natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, as well as entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria or viruses. Phytochemical compounds mediate most interactions between these organisms, but knowledge of such chemically mediated multitrophic relationships is still at its infancy for forest systems, particularly when compared to agricultural systems. Here, we highlight the main gaps in how phytochemicals of forest trees facilitate or interfere with trophic interactions between trees, insect herbivores, and interacting organisms including predators, parasitoids and microbes. We propose future avenues of research on phytochemical-based biocontrol of forest pests taking into account the characteristics of trees and forests.

AB  - For areas at risk for African swine fever (ASF) introduction from neighboring regions, it is important for epidemic control to know how wild boar (Sus scrofa) dispersion dynamics could be used to combat the spread of ASF. In this regard, long-term information based on population genetic data makes an important contribution. We selected our study area as Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, because it had a high density of wild boars and was threatened by ASF via infected wild boars from neighboring Belgium. On an area of around 20,000 km(2), we collected almost 1,200 blood samples from 22 wild boar hunting grounds. The study area included a network of potential barriers to movement, including roads and rivers. We assessed genetic differentiation based on microsatellite data. We used 2 spatial (Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure [BAPS] and TESS) and 1 non-spatial (STRUCTURE) Bayesian model-based approaches to analyze the data. Each of the algorithms detected 4 clusters with different cluster compositions in different areas and identified the highest degrees of differentiation between hunting grounds east and west of the Rhine River, between Pfalz and Eifel-Hunsruck, and to a lesser degree between Westerwald and Taunus and between Eifel and Hunsruck. Thus, genetic evidence suggests barriers of different strength that might be helpful in a setup of complex and expensive measures against the spread of animal diseases such as ASF. The described approach could also provide valuable information for other threatened regions to contain ASF. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - 1. Diseases occurring at low prevalence in free-ranging wildlife can be difficult to study and predict at a landscape scale. This problem is compounded by imperfect pathogen detection.2. We used data from multiple surveillance methods to determine factors influencing spread of a low-prevalence disease, bovine tuberculosis (bTB), among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a bTB endemic area over a 10-year period. We fit dynamic occupancy models to predict spatial spread of bTB through a county in Michigan, USA, within the bTB endemic area, while accounting for imperfect detection and a suite of ecological processes potentially driving bTB spread.3. Detection by all surveillance methods was low overall (posterior mean detection probabilities 0.01-0.03). Probability of bTB occurrence was 1.46 times as likely in the historical centre of the outbreak compared to outside. Deer density had a weakly positive effect on bTB spread.4. The probability of a site being newly infected with bTB annually was low (posterior mean colonization probabilities 0.08-0.27), while the probability of persistence after initial infection was high (posterior mean persistence probability 0.67).5. Synthesis and applications: We used three surveillance methods to estimate probability of presence and spread of a low-prevalence pathogen at a landscape scale under incomplete sampling coverage. Our methods are relevant for determining spatial risk of any wildlife disease that is monitored using multiple methods of surveillance, which is important for prioritization of management actions.

AB  - A 2-year field study was conducted to assess the effects of a Bt-rice line Cr7-1, (Japonica rice cultivar Nakdong) expressing a transgenic Cry1Ac1 gene, which is highly insecticidal against all larval stages of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), compared with an isogenic rice line (Japonica rice cultivar Nakdong). We investigated the community structure of insects with a sweep net and suction device in Bt and non-Bt rice fields during the rice growing season in 2007 and 2008 in Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. Two sampling methods, suction and sweeping, were used considering the habitat, behavior, and vertical distribution of insects in this study. A total of 43 families in 10 orders were identified from 64,099 collected insects and classified into four ecological functional guilds: (i) Herbivores; (ii) Predators; (iii) Parasitoids, and (iv) Detritivores, based on their ecosystem service. The temporal patterns of insect family richness, abundance, and Shannon's index were very similar between Bt and non-Bt rice, although significant differences were observed on a few occasions. In ecological functional guilds, abundance of herbivores and predators were significantly different between Bt and non-Bt rice, but there was no consistent trend in the 2 years. Overall, insect community structure, including diversity, abundance, and dominant families, was not significantly different between Bt and non-Bt rice. The results indicated that the transgenic Cry1Ac rice assessed in this study had no adverse effects on the rice insect community structure and ecological functional guilds in rice fields.

AB  - Rain-on-snow (ROS) events occur across many regions of the terrestrial Arctic in mid-winter. Snowpack properties are changing, and in extreme cases ice layers form which affect wildlife, vegetation and soils beyond the duration of the event. Specifically, satellite microwave observations have been shown to provide insight into known events. Only Ku-band radar (scatterometer) has been applied so far across the entire Arctic. Data availability at this frequency is limited, however. The utility of other frequencies from passive and active systems needs to be explored to develop a concept for long-term monitoring. The latter are of specific interest as they can be potentially provided at higher spatial resolution. Radar records have been shown to capture the associated snow structure change based on time-series analyses. This approach is also applicable when data gaps exist and has capabilities to evaluate the impact severity of events. Active as well as passive microwave sensors can also detect wet snow at the timing of an ROS event if an acquisition is available. The wet snow retrieval methodology is, however, rather mature compared to the identification of snow structure change since ambiguous scattering behaviour needs consideration. C-band radar is of special interest due to good data availability including a range of nominal spatial resolutions (10 m-12.5 km). Scatterometer and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data have therefore been investigated. The temperature dependence of C-band backscatter at VV (V - vertical) polarization observable down to -40 ? is identified as a major issue for ROS retrieval but can be addressed by a combination with a passive microwave wet snow indicator (demonstrated for Metop ASCAT - Advanced Scatterometer - and SMOS - Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity). Results were compared to in situ observations (snowpit records, caribou migration data) and Ku-band products. Ice crusts were found in the snowpack after detected events (overall accuracy 82 %). The more crusts (events) there are, the higher the winter season backscatter increase at C-band will be. ROS events captured on the Yamal and Seward peninsulas have had severe impacts on reindeer and caribou, respectively, due to ice crust formation. SAR specifically from Sentinel-1 is promising regarding ice layer identification at better spatial details for all available polarizations. The fusion of multiple types of microwave satellite observations is suggested for the creation of a climate data record, but the consideration of performance differences due to spatial and temporal cover, as well as microwave frequency, is crucial. Retrieval is most robust in the tundra biome, where results are comparable between sensors. Records can be used to identify extremes and to apply the results for impact studies at regional scale.

AB  - Studies of the spatial patterns of dominant plant species may provide significant insights into processes and mechanisms that maintain stand stability. This study was performed in a permanent 1 ha plot in evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests on Tianmu Mountain. Based on two surveys (1996 and 2012), the dynamics of the spatial distribution pattern of the dominant population (Cyclobalanopsis myrsinifolia (Blume) Oersted) and the intra-and interspecific relationships between C. myrsinifolia and other dominant species populations were analyzed using Ripley's K(r) function. We identified the importance value of a species in a community, which is the sum of the relative density, relative frequency, and relative dominance. The drivers of spatial distribution variation and the maintenance mechanisms of the forest were discussed. The results showed that the importance value of C. myrsinifolia within the community decreased over the past 16 years. The C. myrsinifolia population exhibited a significantly aggregated distribution within a spatial scale of 0-25 m in 1996 whereas it changed to a random distribution at scales larger than 5.5 m in 2012. From 1996 to 2012, the spatial distribution patterns between C. myrsinifolia and Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinsk. and between C. myrsinifolia and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook did not change significantly. In 1996, C. myrsinifolia and Daphniphyllum macropodum Miq. were positively associated at the scale of 0-25 m; this relationship was strongly significant at the scale of 6-10 m. However, there was no association between the populations of two species in terms of the spatial distribution at the scale of 0-25 m in 2012. Our findings indicate that the drivers of variation in the spatial distribution of the C. myrsinifolia population were intra-and interspecific mutual relationships as well the seed-spreading mechanism of this species.

AB  - The Golden Trevally, Gnathanodon speciosus, is a large predatory fish with an extremely broad tropical Indo-Pacific distribution that crosses many biogeographical boundaries. Both published information and freely available imagery suggest that small juvenile G. speciosus are often associated with whale sharks, Rhincodon typus; an association that could explain the unusually widespread distribution of G. speciosus, and suggests a novel nursery relationship. The possibility of such an association has the potential to reshape our understanding of the ecological roles played by long-range migrants such as R. typus and other megafauna, our understanding of the full extent of their conservation value, and how we manage both members of the relationship.

AB  - Wildlife conservation and management need accurate methods for population survey and monitoring. Absolute counts of roe deer populations (Capreolus capreolus) are not possible, but the rapid advancement of motion-sensitive camera technologies and new analytical approaches might potentially lead to more precise estimates at lower costs compared to traditional survey methods. We applied spatially explicit photographic capture-recapture models (SCR) in the Lake Geneva basin, Switzerland, from 25 April to 20 September 2018 to estimate roe deer densities in a pilot survey. We investigated the effect of survey duration and camera density on male roe deer density estimates to select the sampling design that produced density estimates with sufficient accuracy and precision at lower costs (i.e., material, fieldwork, data processing, and analyses). Males could be identified based on their antlers, which allowed us to apply SCR to estimate their density. Because females could not be identified individually, we inferred the overall roe deer density (adult and sub-adult roe deer) based on the sex ratio estimated from motion-sensitive camera photos. According to the results of sub-sampling simulations and by taking into account the financial costs associated with fieldwork and analyses, we conclude that 20 motion-sensitive cameras set over 20 nights (i.e., the 20/20 method) is a good compromise to provide reliable estimates of male roe deer density. Furthermore, studies estimating overall roe deer density using SCR and sex ratio estimates should be conducted from mid-August to the end of October just after rutting season and the peak of yearling dispersal, when the movement rates of males and females, and hence their detection probabilities, are similar and when males are still carrying their antlers. This approach was successfully applied in 4 selected study areas with contrasting roe deer management regimes, resulting in overall roe deer density estimates ranging from 3.9 +/- 1.3 (SE) deer/km(2) forest to 22.5 +/- 6.1 deer/km(2) forest. Our study provides a valuable and cost-effective approach using photographic SCR methodology and sex ratio information to calculate roe deer density estimates that can be used in management measures such as defining hunting quotas.

AB  - Financial tools can present a solution to conservation conflicts. However, their effectiveness may be limited unless they address the underlying drivers of conflict. The restoration of controversial megafauna can be tied to a clash of urban and rural values and rejection by rural landowners of government control over their actions. Here, we consider a latent financial opportunity presented by general public support for large predator restoration to maintain a wolf-livestock coexistence program in Washington state, USA. We measured respondents' (N = 420) willingness-to-pay for gray wolf (Canis lupus) conservation and their preferences for program funding mechanisms, including voluntary contributions, mandatory taxes, and a 'predator-friendly' ranching certification scheme. Respondents were supportive of a publicly funded program, which represented around USD246 million in estimated economic value. This benefit is more than 150 times the cost of the current government-run program. There were mixed preferences for funding mechanisms, so we recommend adopting multiple approaches. A new funding source would allow the program to be rancher-led, shifting agency from government to rural communities, as well as providing outreach opportunities for ranchers to the urban public. As such, our proposal addresses two of the major socio-political conflicts underlying the wolf debate in North America while also generating funding to protect the ranching industry.

AB  - The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster in the To<overline>hoku region of Japan resulted in the release of a large quantity of radionuclides into the environment; while humans were quickly evacuated from the contaminated area, wildlife remained. Changes in human activity and presence can impact habitat use and movement patterns of wild animals across demographic levels, including shifts in resource selection such as incursions into human-abandoned areas. Thus, understanding changes in spatiotemporal patterns of wildlife within humanabandoned landscapes can help mitigate human-wildlife conflict in preparation for anthropogenic resettlement. In this study, we investigated spatial utilization and temporal behaviors of Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) in and around the Fukushima Exclusion Zone (FEZ). We used GPS data from 34 wild boar within the FEZ to conduct second- and third-order resource selection and movement path analyses. We also included GPS data from seven additional wild boar collared surrounding the FEZ to generate hidden Markov models to compare the temporal trends of wild boar inside the FEZ to wild boar outside the FEZ across three behavioral states (e.g., resting, foraging, traveling). We found that wild boar within the FEZ shifted their activity patterns to be more diurnal than those outside the zone where humans continue to reside. Additionally, while wild boar within the FEZ used natural spaces like forests, individuals also selected for human-abandoned areas such as rice paddy fields and urban areas. Our results provide insights into the adaptability of wildlife following human abandonment following large-scale human displacement events.

AB  - Syngnathids are considered flagship species of estuarine and coastal environments. However, most of the Mediterranean species are still classified as data-deficient (DD) at a global level according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In central Italy, several areas host potentially suitable habitats for syngnathids but have not been previously reported in the literature; the estimation of population parameters and habitat partitioning at these sites may help to assess their conservation status. In this study, we investigated the abundance, distribution, and habitat preferences of sympatric populations of Hippocampus hippocampus, H. guttulatus, Syngnathus abaster, and Nerophis ophidion in Sabaudia Lake (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). While confirming the primary importance of a healthy coastal habitat, we retrieved hints about species ecology and habitat use. The species distribution in the study area highlights the role of habitat complexity in supporting local populations of these sensitive species.

AB  - Bats provide important ecosystem services but face severe threats due to land and climate changes. Although bats are an important component of mammal diversity in Iran, the ecology of many species remains virtually unstudied in the country. Here we applied the maximum entropy approach to model habitat suitability of bat species in Iran, identify the most important variables for their distribution, predict high priority areas for field monitoring and conservation, and estimate the coverage of the bat species' suitable habitats by the existing protected areas. We created a richness map for the twelve species to identify high priority areas for field monitoring and conservation. The results of species distribution modeling showed that Pipistrellus kuhlii (828,977.2 km(2)) and Miniopterus pallidus (646,581.9 km(2)) had the largest distribution ranges and Rhinopoma microphyllum (211,202.7 km(2)) and Rousettus aegyptiacus (218,278.6 km(2)) had the smallest distribution ranges in Iran. By averaging the importance of each ecological variable across the 12 species, we found that distance to forests (with a negative association) is the most important ecological driver of bat distribution in Iran. The Zagros Mountains were identified as a hotspot of bats based on the distribution of the 12 species. Our findings showed that small proportions of each species suitable habitats were covered by protected areas and protected suitable habitats varied from 3.2%for Pipistrellus kuhlii to15.9% for Tadarida teniotis. This study highlights the importance of forests for bat conservation showing that forest conservation is a high priority in the country. Areas which have the highest richness should be prioritized for field monitoring and conservation.

AB  - Wild pigs are a destructive invasive species throughout many regions of the world and have proven difficult to control or eliminate. Their success as an invasive species is, in part, from their high reproductive potential, which can vary based on available resources, ancestry, and other factors. We opportunistically collected data on demographics (i.e., age and sex), reproduction, and body mass on 2,762 wild pigs throughout various research and operation control activities in Texas, Alabama, Hawai'i, Guam (USA), and Queensland (Australia) during 2016-2024. We evaluated these data for differences among study sites that might lead to a better understanding of wild pig ecology and more effective control of their populations. We found that the age structures of wild pigs varied greatly among sites, with areas with more intense control having younger populations. The timing and frequency of birth pulses also varied by site. Large disparities among populations demonstrated the elasticities of wild pigs in invaded ranges; for example, the Alabama study site had a mostly young population with fast body mass growth rates and 2 discernable birth pulses per year, whereas the Guam study site had an older population with slow body mass growth rates and an indistinguishable birth pulse. We hypothesized that intense population control may increase reproduction rates in younger females through increased body mass growth rates and subsequent reproductive maturity. We recommend that managers identify the seasonal birth pulses of wild pigs in their region, and then intensively focus on removing wild pigs during the 115 days (i.e., gestation period) prior to those birth pulses. This may be counterintuitive to managers that focus on trapping after observing a birth pulse, but it increases the probability of simultaneously removing pregnant females and any associated offspring from previous litters that remained with the pregnant female. We also recommend evaluating regional-specific intensities of removal that might be required for reducing populations with specific emphasis on whether compensatory reproductive behaviors are generated and how to avoid them.

AB  - Survey and monitoring of wildlife populations are among the key elements in nature conservation. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and light aircrafts as aerial image acquisition systems is growing, as they are cheaper alternatives to traditional census methods. However, the manual localization and identification of species within imagery can be time-consuming and complex. Object detection algorithms, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown a good capacity for animal detection. Nevertheless, most of the work has focused on binary detection cases (animal vs. background). The main objective of this study is to compare three recent detection algorithms to detect and identify African mammal species based on high-resolution aerial images. We evaluated the performance of three multi-class CNN algorithms: Faster-RCNN, Libra-RCNN and RetinaNet. Six species were targeted: topis (Damaliscus lunatus jimela), buffalos (Syncerus caffer), elephants (Loxodonta africana), kobs (Kobus kob), warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) and waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus). The best model was then applied to a case study using an independent dataset. The best model was the Libra-RCNN, with the best mean average precision (0.80 +/- 0.02), the lowest degree of interspecies confusion (3.5 +/- 1.4%) and the lowest false positive per true positive ratio (1.7 +/- 0.2) on the test set. This model was able to detect and correctly identify 73% of all individuals (1115), find 43 individuals of species other than those targeted and detect 84 missed individuals on our independent UAV dataset, with an average processing speed of 12 s/image. This model showed better detection performance than previous studies dealing with similar habitats. It was able to differentiate six animal species in nadir aerial images. Although limitations were observed with warthog identification and individual detection in herds, this model can save time and can perform precise surveys in open savanna.

AB  - Monitoring grazing activity and grasslands productivity has a great interest for the understanding of the feedback processes that regulate dynamic and conservation of grasslands. In this study we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of free foraging sheep and cattle (no shepherd) to understand how the two species adapt to the changes in food availability and quality in alpine and subalpine pastures during the summer. We used two vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 imagery (S2A) to characterize grassland: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). We hypothesized that sheep and cattle would show different spatiotemporal displacement patterns, which would also change over time with phenology of pasture. We tested this using movement data of tagged sheep and cattle with satellite GPS collars. Animals are yearly free ranging in the studied alpine and subalpine pastures since June to end of September, when they are moved to the shelters. According with optimal searching strategy we predicted that displacement distribution would approach to a random searching path when the forage is more nutritive and abundant, i.e., when livestock have just arrived to their summer pastures. As the summer advances, animals would change their searching paths to an auto-correlated random walk, because pastures lose nutritional quality and consequently food availability is smaller, also due to animal consumption in the grasslands. Our results confirmed that hypothesis and showed that average NDII, a proxy of both pasture quality and time of green-up in the summer pastures, influenced the spatiotemporal patterns during grazing activity of free ranging livestock. We provided the first demonstration of two dimension searching path exhibiting a fractal distribution that changes with the availability of food and the intrinsic characteristic of the forager species, i.e., diet selection. The use of temporal sequences of foraging animals can be useful as indicator of food availability for free ranging animals that can be included in the data recording of GPS monitored livestock.

AB  - Plant genotype, water stress and their interaction are among the factors contributing to the susceptibility of plants to herbivory. The plant's nitrogen concentration, a critical and often limiting nutrient, differs with plant genotype and water stress. Still, few studies have investigated the impact of the interaction between genotype and water stress on herbivory and plant nitrogen. We established a common garden in Duluth, MN, of tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima, collected from a local Minnesota site to analyse the effects of goldenrod genotype and water stress on leaf nitrogen and the preference and performance of the chrysanthemum lace bug, Corythucha marmorata. Lace bugs had oviposition, nymph and adult preferences among host plant genotypes, water treatments and among genotype and water treatment combinations. Nymph and adult survival and adult mass varied significantly due to plant genotype, water treatment, the interaction between plant and water treatment and the interaction of treatment with lace bug density. Oviposition preference and offspring performance were significantly positively related. Leaf nitrogen increased with the increasing severity of the water limitation in the absence of lace bugs. However, in the presence of lace bugs, there was no difference in nitrogen among water treatments. We hypothesize that lace bugs reduce leaf nitrogen concentration to a lower threshold and then move between plants until nitrogen concentration equalises among all plants.
   We investigated the effects of plant genotype and drought stress on tall goldenrod and lace bug interactions. The plant genotype by drought interaction significantly affected herbivore preference and performance. Increasing drought intensity increases the concentration of leaf nitrogen but only in the absence of herbivory. image

AB  - 1 The decay process of animal carcasses is a highly complex succession driven by abiotic and biotic variables and their interactions. As an underexplored ecological recycling process, understanding carrion decomposition associated with pandemics such as African swine fever is important for predicting the rate and post-mortem interval (PMI) variation of wild animal carcasses to improve disease management.
   2 To model PMIs of wild boar, we deployed 73 wild boar carcasses in four different forest habitat types throughout a year and monitored the decomposition process, carrion beetles and blow fly larval populations. The 601 single observations were split randomly into 501 training data and 100 validation data.
   3 A linear additive mixed model for log-transformed PMI values using the training data identified the decay stage, day of year, ambient temperature during sampling, habitat and prevalence of Oiceoptoma thoracicum (Silphidae) as predictive variables for time since death, but neither the initial body mass nor if a fresh or previous frozen carcass was used. Using the validation data, this model showed a high predictive power for log-transformed PMI values (R-2 = 0.80).
   4 This study aimed at improving the methodology of estimating the PMI of wild boar carcasses based on important abiotic and biotic environmental factors that can be easily assessed in the field. Using only a small set of predictors, including a conspicuous beetle species, allowed prediction of the mean, minimum and maximum PMI of wild boar carcasses. The strong effects of a few surrogates on PMI in our model suggest that this model can easily be transferred to wider regions of Central Europe by retraining the model with data from a broader environmental space and can thus be instrumental in assessing timing of disease introduction in areas newly affected by emerging diseases such as African swine fever.

AB  - 1. Water is an essential and often limiting resource that pervades all aspects of animal ecology. Yet, water economics are grossly understudied relative to foraging and predation, leaving ecologists ill-equipped to predict how the intensifying disruption of hydrological regimes worldwide will impact communities. For savanna herbivores, reliance on surface water can increase exposure to predators and competitors, and thus strategies that reduce the need to drink are advantageous. Yet, the extent to which increasing dietary water intake while decreasing water loss enables animals to forego drinking remains unknown.
   2. We studied water budgets of sympatric African savanna antelopes that differ in size, bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus, similar to 35 kg) and kudu (T. strepsiceros, similar to 140 kg). We hypothesized that both species compensate for seasonally declining water availability by increasing consumption of moisture-rich plants and reducing faecal water loss, and that these adjustments are sufficient for small-bodied-but not large-bodied-herbivores to avoid spending more time near permanent water sources as the dry season advances. We tested our predictions using temporally explicit data on antelope movements, diets, plant traits and drinking behaviour in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique.
   3. Water content declined between the early and late dry seasons in roughly half of plant taxa consumed by antelope. Although both species reduced faecal water loss and shifted their diets towards relatively moisture-rich plants as the dry season progressed, dietary water intake still declined. Contrary to expectation, kudu reduced selection for surface water in the late dry season without adjusting total time spent drinking, whereas bushbuck increased selection for surface water.
   4. We developed a generalizable approach for parsing the importance of dietary and surface water for large herbivores. Our results underscore that variation in surface-water dependence is a key organizing force in herbivore communities, that simple allometric predictions about the behavioural and ecological consequences of this variation are unreliable. Understanding wildlife water economics is a research frontier that will be essential for predicting changes in species distribution and community composition as temperatures rise and droughts intensify.

AB  - Aerial vehicles equipped with infrared thermal sensors facilitate quick density estimates of wildlife, but detection error can arise from the thermal sensor and viewer of the infrared video. We reviewed published research to determine how commonly these sources of error have been assessed in studies using infrared video from aerial platforms to sample wildlife. The number of annual articles pertaining to aerial sampling using infrared thermography has increased drastically since 2018, but past studies inconsistently assessed sources of imperfect detection. We illustrate the importance of accounting for some of these types of error in a case study on white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in Indiana, USA, using a simple double-observer approach. In our case study, we found evidence of false negatives associated with the viewer of infrared video. Additionally, we found that concordance between the detections of two viewers increased when using a red-green-blue camera paired with the infrared thermal sensor, when altitude decreased and when more stringent criteria were used to classify thermal signatures as deer. We encourage future managers and ecologists recording infrared video from aerial platforms to use double-observer methods to account for viewer-induced false negatives when video is manually viewed by humans. We also recommend combining infrared video with red-green-blue video to reduce false positives, applying stringent verification standards to detections in infrared and red-green-blue video and collecting data at lower altitudes over snow when needed.

AB  - Significant expansion in salmon production globally has been partially enabled through the establishment of large-capacity sea-farms in high-energy environments that collectively produce substantial quantities of organic waste with potential to cause regional scale environmental degradation. We analyse results from comprehensive spatial and temporal surveys of water column particulates and seabed environmental indicators for responses to farm production, and residual effects. Results confirmed that while the particles can and do reach a relatively wide area, benthic effects do not necessarily follow suit. There was limited evidence of longer-term environmental degradation at some near-field locations and spatially removed deeper sites. We concluded that evidence for regional biological effects was negligible, suggesting: i) modern waste tracing techniques are more sensitive than traditional effects indicators, and ii) waste fluxes in the far-field were being assimilated without causing environmental perturbation. Monitoring at potential accumulation points, especially for sites with complex bathymetry and hydrodynamics is advised.

AB  - Kelp forests have declined gradually all over the world. Understanding the trophic structure of such a productive and diverse ecosystem is crucial for its restoration and effective management. Few studies, however, have focused on the trophic structure and functional recovery of kelp forests in the process of restoration. This study was conducted in the eastern coast of Korea where kelp bed restoration was in process with the removal of sea urchins. In addition to quantitative measurement for recovery using common community parameters, we investigated how fast the stability of a food web structure could be established in the newly restored kelp beds with an initially barren condition, using stable isotope analysis, in comparison with a nearby natural bed and barren site. At the restored bed, total algal biomass and diversity reached the levels of the natural bed within 1 year. While the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of macroalgae and organic matter were separated isotopically, they were similar among sites, excluding organic matter at the natural bed in 2019. Most consumers showed similar isotopic values among sites, with overlapping range for delta C-13 of producers. However, some herbivores showed higher delta N-15 values as predators/omnivores, particularly at barrens, which could be explained by trophic plasticity depending on the macroalgal structure. In the restored bed, for the first year, higher trophic diversity (CR, CD) and lower trophic redundancy (MNND, SDNND) showed non-overlapping >50% CIs among sites. However, this distinctive stage moved toward the natural bed upon entering the second year as trophic diversity decreased and trophic redundancy increased while natural bed overlapped at<50% CIs. The recovery speed in this system was fast (1 year for quantitative perspectives and 2 years for functional completion). After removing the sea urchins, recruitment of macroalgae quickly increased concomitantly with consumer groups, boosting the diversity and trophic structure of the restored bed. The trophic structure of the first year of restoration was not an intermediate stage toward the completion, but a transient over-shooting state. This might have been triggered by the fast introduction of diverse macroalgae to the urchin-free bare rock space, providing an interesting finding needed to be tested in other temperate marine systems.

AB  - Camera traps (CT) have been used to study a wide diversity of wildlife around the world. However, despite their widespread use, standardized protocols are lacking, potentially leading to reduced efficiency and inhibiting study comparisons, generalizability, and repeatability. While there are general guidelines and considerations researchers should be aware of when designing a CT survey, studies have shown the vital importance of selecting sampling schemes and camera settings tailored to specific characteristics of the wildlife system of interest. For many species and regions, optimal sampling protocols have not been thoroughly evaluated, especially in vast open landscapes. We used CT data on barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in the open landscape of arctic Alaska as a case study to evaluate and quantify the influence of camera trigger type (i.e., motion detection vs. time-lapse) and time-lapse interval on data generation to inform sampling protocols for future CT research in this system or others like it. Comparing camera trigger types, we found 5 min interval time-lapse generated seven-times more images containing caribou compared to motion detection. However, the detection rate of motion detection was over 11-times greater than time-lapse resulting in more efficient data collection with respect to camera battery life, data storage, and data processing time. Exploring the effect of time-lapse interval length, we found detections were highly sensitive to interval length with a 30 min interval producing 33.7% fewer images containing caribou and identifying 22.2% fewer trap days containing caribou compared to a 5 min interval. Our results provide insight into effective CT sampling protocols for open landscapes and highlight the importance of critically evaluating and selecting camera settings that account for characteristics of the study system to ensure adequate data is generated efficiently to address study objectives.
   To better understand effective camera trap sampling protocols for open landscapes, we used camera trap data on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) collected in arctic Alaska, USA as a case study to evaluate and quantify the influence of camera trigger type (i.e., motion detection vs. time-lapse) and time-lapse interval on data generation. In our system, we found 5 min interval time-lapse contributed seven-times more images containing caribou accounting for almost three-times more caribou trap days compared to motion detection, however, due to a relatively low detection rate, required a greater volume of data to be generated in order to produce comparable datasets. Our study builds on a limited body of research exploring the application of camera traps for monitoring a migratory species in open landscapes and highlights the importance of tailoring camera settings to specific characteristics of the wildlife system of interest. image

AB  - Camellia chrysantha is cultivated as rare genetic resource of the family Theaceae, which mainly distributed in the South of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China. Rhizosphere microbiota may play important roles in C. chrysantha growth and homeostasis through interaction of the plant and soil ecosystem. In order to investigate the bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere soil of three C. chrysantha cultivars under different growing conditions, Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR methods were used in this study. Results indicated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the top six phyla across all the six rhizosphere soil samples. The richness and diversity of bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil from cultivar "Fangpu" grown understorey (LF) in retail planting area were significantly different from the other samples. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that bacterial community composition of the rhizosphere soil from cultivar "Fangpu" grown understorey (LF) and perennial grown undershed (PFC) was obviously separated from each other as well as the other four rhizosphere soil samples. The growing conditions displayed more influences on the bacterial community composition than plant cultivars, and close correlations were found between the soil physicochemical characters of the geographical origins and the bacterial communities. This work improves understanding of the rhizosphere bacterial community composition and the influencing soil physicochemical factors, and provides basic information for cultivation and protection of the C. chrysantha plants in China.

AB  - Insect herbivores are prevalent in terrestrial ecosystems, and plants inevitably and continuously suffer damage by insect herbivores. Numerous studies have reported the effect of insect herbivory on plants; however, its effect on the belowground soil microbial community remains understudied. In the present study, using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the effect of foliar insect herbivory on rhizosphere soil bacterial community. Our results showed that both herbivory intensity and duration after herbivory had no significant effect on the rhizosphere microbial community structure, but microbial assembly processes and association networks were strongly affected by the above two factors. Under moderate and high herbivory and at 6 weeks after herbivory, variable selection explained 55.56% and 51.52% of the community variation indicating that deterministic processes played a dominant role. Network complexity decreased from no herbivory (1.07) to high herbivory (0.97), and network complexity at 2 weeks after herbivory (0.92) was higher than that at 4 and 6 weeks after herbivory (0.79 and 0.84, respectively). The proportion of negative correlations decreased with increasing herbivory intensity and duration after herbivory. The number of keystone species decreased with increasing duration after herbivory but showed no change with increasing herbivory intensity. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to illustrate the response mechanisms of rhizosphere microbial assembly processes and association networks to foliar herbivory. Our findings suggest that the assembly process and association network patterns of microbes are closely associated with herbivory intensity and duration after herbivory and enhance the understanding of insect-plant-soil microbe interactions.

AB  - Identifying and quantifying crop stressors interactions in agroecosystems is necessary to guide sustainable crop management strategies. Over the last 50 years, faba bean cropping area has been declining, partly due to yield instabilities associated with uneven insect pollination and herbivory. Yet, the effect of interactions between pollinators and a key pest, the broad bean beetle Bruchus rufimanus (florivorous and seed predating herbivore) on faba bean yield has not been investigated. Using a factorial cage experiment in the field, we investigated how interactions between two hypothesized stressors, lack of insect pollination by bumblebees and herbivory by the broad bean beetle, affect faba bean yield. Lack of bumblebee pollination reduced bean weight per plant by 15%. Effects of the broad bean beetle differed between the individual plant and the plant-stand level (i.e., when averaging individual plant level responses at the cage level), likely due to high variation in the level of herbivory among individual plants. At the individual plant level, herbivory increased several yield components but only in the absence of pollinators, possibly due to plant overcompensation and/or pollination by the broad bean beetle. At the plant-stand level, we found no effect of the broad bean beetle on yield. However, there was a tendency for heavier individual bean weight with bumblebee pollination, but only in the absence of broad bean beetle herbivory, possibly due to a negative effect of the broad bean beetle on the proportion of legitimate flower visits by bumblebees. This is the first experimental evidence of interactive effects between bumblebees and the broad bean beetle on faba bean yield. Our preliminary findings of negative and indirect associations between the broad bean beetle and individual bean weight call for a better acknowledgment of these interactions in the field in order to understand drivers of crop yield variability in faba bean.

AB  - ContextIn Nepal, naur are usually the staple wild prey for the snow leopard, a solitary stalker hunter, and in some cases, for the wolf who hunts in a pack. We assumed that naur would adapt their anti-predatory responses to the presence of chasing and ambushing predators in the Manang Valley, where there are snow leopards and wolves, and in the Nar Phu valley, an area where there is only the snow leopard.AimsThe aim of this study was to determine if there were differences in anti-predator strategies (vigilance, habitat selection and escape terrain) of naur in two valleys over two seasons, spring and autumn.MethodsIn spring 2019, we conducted a reconnaissance survey on the status of the naur and its habitat in the Manang and Nar Phu valleys of the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal. In spring and autumn 2020 and 2021, we observed 360 focal naur individuals (180 individuals in each valley), using the vigilance behaviour methodology to examine the behaviour of the naur.Key resultsThere was little difference in the size of the naur groups between the Manang and Nar Phu valleys. The naur were twice as vigilant in Manang (15%), where there are snow leopards and wolves, as they were in Nar Phu (9%), with only snow leopards. The distance from the naur to escape cover was significantly shorter in Manang than in Nar Phu valley. Naur used significantly more rolling terrain in Nar Phu than in Manang.ConclusionsThe return of wolves to the Manang valley may have resulted in an increase in the level of naur vigilance. Most likely, the wolves in Manang have already had an effect on the female-to-young-ratio, and this effect will possibly have important consequences for the naur population, as well as at the ecosystem level in the future. Other key determining factors, such as the climate crisis and changes in local resources, could have a significant impact on the naur population, indicating the need for more research.ImplicationsThe findings of this study would provide valuable baseline information for the design of a science-based conservation strategy for conservation managers and scientists on naur, snow leopards and wolves.
   We assessed the foraging behaviour of blue sheep (naur) under the predation risk of several predators (snow leopards and wolves) versus a single predator (the snow leopard only) in rugged mountain terrain. This study provided valuable information but presented major challenges. We examine empirical evidence-based information and highlight the adaptive behaviour of naur under the predation risk of several predators versus that of a single predator in Nepal.

AB  - Animal waste products are an important component of nutrient cycles and result in the trophic transmission of diverse microorganisms. There is growing recognition that the feces of consumers, such as predators, may impact resource species, their prey, via physical effects and/or microbial activity. We tested the effect of feces from distinct fish trophic groups on coral health and used heat-killed fecal controls to tease apart physical versus microbial effects of contact with fecal material. Fresh grazer/detritivore fish feces caused lesions more frequently on corals, and lesions were 4.2-fold larger than those from sterilized grazer/detritivore feces; in contrast, fresh corallivore feces did not cause more frequent or larger lesions than sterilized corallivore feces. Thus, microbial activity in grazer/detritivore feces, but not corallivore feces, was harmful to corals. Characterization of bacterial diversity in feces of 10 reef fish species, ranging from obligate corallivores to grazer/detritivores, indicated that our experimental findings may be broadly generalizable to consumer guild, since feces of some obligate corallivores contained similar to 2-fold higher relative abundances of coral mutualist bacteria (e.g., Endozoicomonadaceae), and lower abundances of the coral pathogen, Vibrio coralliilyticus, than feces of some grazer/detritivores. These findings recontextualize the ecological roles of consumers on coral reefs: although grazer/detritivores support coral reef health in various ways (e.g., promoting coral settlement and herbivory through the removal of detritus and sediments from the algal matrix), they also disperse coral pathogens. Corallivore predation can wound corals, yet their feces contain potentially beneficial coral-associated bacteria, supporting the hypothesized role of consumers, and corallivores in particular, in coral symbiont dispersal. Such consumer-mediated microbial dispersal as demonstrated here has broad implications for environmental management.

AB  - Fungal endophytes of grasses and other herbaceous plants have been known to provide plants with anti-herbivore defence compounds, but there is little information about whether the endophytes of trees also engage in such mutualisms. We investigated the influence of the endophytic fungus Cladosporium sp. on the chemical defences of black poplar (Populus nigra) trees and the consequences for feeding preference and fitness of herbivorous insects and insect community assembly. Endophyte colonisation increased both constitutive- and induced poplar defences. Generalist Lymantria dispar larvae preferred and performed better on uninfected over endophyte-infected poplar leaves, most likely due to higher concentrations of salicinoids in endophyte-inoculated leaves and the endophyte-produced alkaloid stachydrine. Under field conditions, the endophytic fungus shapes insect community assembly i. a. attracting aphids, which can excrete stachydrine. Our results show that endophytic fungi play a crucial role in the defence against insects from different feeding guilds and thereby structuring insect communities.

AB  - Past studies of zooplankton seasonality in large temperate lakes have often neglected the winter period. Winter conditions are rapidly changing (e.g., reduced ice cover extent and duration, altered thermal and mixing regimes) in northern lakes, making it important to fill the existing winter knowledge gap. In this study, we sampled five stations in Lake Superior across a nearshore depth gradient through the full year to assess the phenology of crustacean zooplankton communities and the effect of environmental drivers on them. Across stations, zooplankton densities were the lowest in winter (0.9 +/- 0.6 Ind. L-1) and highest in summer (14.2 +/- 15.1 Ind. L-1). Zooplankton abundances and community composition were less seasonally variable at deeper stations compared to shallower and more terrestrially affected regions. Cladocerans were the dominant taxonomic group during the summer across all stations, while cyclopoid and calanoid copepods were more important during the fall, winter, and spring. Among feeding groups, herbivores were most abundant in summer while omnivores and carnivores dominated in winter. We found that water temperature and food availability were the main drivers of total zooplankton densities through the year and during the cold seasons, but the effect of these factors varied among the main taxonomic groups. Our study demonstrates seasonal and spatial variation in crustacean zooplankton and environmental parameters, with the highest fluctuation at shallower stations. This study offers new information on seasonal crustacean zooplankton dynamics and contributes to understanding the effects of climate change on large lake ecosystems.

AB  - The population decline of the endangered bitterling species, Acheilognathus typus, following non-native bitterling invasion underscores the need to understand interspecific interactions among bitterling fishes. In this study, the dietary habits of A. typus, alongside introduced non-native bitterling species (Acheilognathus rhombeus and Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus) and other omnivorous fishes (Oryzias latipes, Pseudorasbora parva, and Rhinogobius sp.), were investigated in a small pond in Japan using gut content and stable isotope analyses (delta 13C and delta 15N). Analysis revealed that microalgae, particularly diatoms with periphytic or benthic life forms, dominated the gut contents of the three bitterling species, which exhibited high dietary overlaps (Pianka's index range 0.89-0.98). Although bitterling species displayed similar delta 13C (mean range -18.4 to -16.1 parts per thousand) and delta 15N (12.1 to 12.6 parts per thousand) values, the other omnivorous fishes exhibited distinct isotopic signatures: lower delta 13C and higher delta 15N values. Isotopic niche overlaps among the three bitterling species were limited (0-2.4%). Furthermore, A. typus and A. rhombeus showed no overlap in the corrected standard ellipse area. These findings suggest that the three bitterling species may forage on similar food items, primarily microalgae, with differing stable isotope ratios, enabling them to partition foraging sites within the confines of a small pond where competition may arise.

AB  - Brazilian livestock provides a significant fraction of the food consumed globally, making the country one of the largest producers and exporters of meat, milk and eggs. However, current advances in the production of protein from Brazilian animal origin may be directly impacted by climate change and the resulting biophysical effects. Therefore, it is strategically consistent to develop measures to deal with the resulting environmental heat stress on domesticated animal species, especially the need in developing countries. This work aims to (1) evaluate the impacts of climate change on livestock (cattle-dairy, cattle-beef, goats, sheep, pigs, poultry-general) in different regions of Brazil and (2) discuss possible response strategies, associated with animal comfort and welfare. From our results, we can draw better strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on livestock production. The results presented show an increase of high heat stress in South and Southeast and an increase of extreme heat stress in North and Central-West areas of Brazil. The rise in extreme heat stress tends to occur mostly during spring and summer and tends to vary considering the different evaluated species. Within the evaluated species, the ones that seem to be more affected by climate changes are Poultry, pigs, cattle-beef and general (temperature-humidity index value). The differences between the results for the five geographic regions in Brazil suggests that different mitigation measures need to be considered to cope with future heat stress in livestock. To ensure the long-term success of Brazil's influence on the global market for proteins of animal origin, it must achieve sustainable production systems more intensively.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental conditions and species on thermoregulatory responses, acid-base and electrolyte balance of black goats and ewes in an equatorial semi-arid environment. Ten Caninde acute accent goats and seven Morada Nova ewes with black coat color, all multiparous, aged between 2 and 3 years, non-lactating, non-pregnant, and body weight (BW) of 22.84 +/- 4.17 kg for goats and 22.60 +/- 3.18 kg for ewes were used in this study. Air temperature (A(T)) and relative humidity (R-H) were measured. Respiratory rate (R-R), Rectal temperature (R-T), sweating rate (S-R), hydrogen potential (pH), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), venous oxygen pressure (PO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (BE), total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO2), venous oxygen saturation (SO2), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were recorded. Animal species (caprine and ovine) and environmental conditions (Thermoneutral condition, T-C and Heat condition, H-C) were considered as fixed effects. Univariate and multivariate analysis techniques were used. Differences were observed between the two environmental conditions. Significant changes in all thermoregulatory responses for goats and ewes were observed according to the environmental condition effect. The general means of the species showed that only SR was high in ewes (P < 0.05), following a reverse change when compared to goat SR. For the environmental condition effect, only the blood pH of goats did not change under HC (P < 0.05), while the BE and TCO2 did not change for ewes. The general means of PCO2, HCO3, BE, TCO2 and SO2 were higher in ewes compared to goats. For electrolytic balance, Na (+) demonstrated elevations in HC. Brazilian black goats and ewes raised in an equatorial semi-arid environment tend to have particular homeothermy, acid-base and electrolytic balance which mostly depend on the environmental conditions they are raised. The results support the changes in physiological mechanisms between black goats and ewes; however, both are locally adapted.

AB  - The populations of globally significant species in the Himalaya are invariably shrinking due to multiple forms of human manipulation. Over the decades, various species' natural habitats have been influenced by changing climate patterns, and the trends are consistently increasing, which is an issue of concern. The Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. turkestanica Rousi is a critical species native to the Himalaya, belonging to the Elaeagnaceae family. It is widely known for its significant ecological, economic, and social benefits. There is a great need to conserve this species in the cold desert region to improve the livelihood and socioeconomic status of tribal communities. Therefore, the current study aims to assess the population status and predict highly suitable areas for Trans-Himalaya species under changing climatic conditions. The machine learning algorithm showed that Bio_6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month), elevation, and slope were the best suitable variables for the habitat prediction along with the CMIP6 project's MIROC6 and CMCC-ESM2 climate change models to identify the potential distribution area of the species for the future under the SSP245 (middle of the way) and SSP585 (fossil-fueled development) scenarios, respectively. The result found that a 2.20% (4,028 km2) area is highly suitable for the species' occurrence. The potential suitability areas of the species are predicted to expand along the boundary of the present distribution areas at the pace of climatic change. The current study findings will help to determine the species resource reserve in the Trans-Himalaya. The predicted distribution maps of the species would help policymakers and decision-makers design appropriate management and sustainable utilization approaches in the near future.

AB  - Increases in the frequency, intensity and/or diversity of disturbances affecting coral reefs are leading to concerns; some reefs will be overgrown by macroalgae. While numerous studies, particularly in the Pacific, have used macroalgal assays to quantify the rates and agents of herbivory of Sargassum, little is known of the capacity of reef fishes to reduce biomass of Lobophora, a common alga in macroalgal-dominated areas. The aim of this study was to determine the relative palatability of Lobophora to local herbivorous assemblages across two inshore reefs (Havannah Island and Orpheus Island) in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Multiple choice macroalgal assays were deployed on the reef crest on each reef to determine the relative palatability of three macroalgae taxa: Lobophora, Sargassum and Padina. Additional Lobophora-only assays were deployed on the reef crest at Orpheus Island. Overall, the average reduction in macroalgal biomass was greater at Orpheus Island (25.3 g/3 h, pooled across macroalgae taxa) compared to Havannah Island (5.0 g/3 h), with the reduction in Lobophora biomass (0.3-1.5 g/3 h) being significantly lower than Sargassum (4.7-19.1 g/3 h) at both reefs. The reduction in Lobophora biomass at Orpheus Island was consistently low, whether presented in multiple choice (1.5 g/3 h) or Lobophora-only assays (1.7 g/3 h). Video observations revealed that four species of herbivorous fish (Kyphosis vaigiensis, Naso unicornis, Siganus doliatus, and Siganus canaliculatus) were responsible for the majority of the bites recorded on algae. Despite differences in the relative importance of these four species between islands, all four species took more bites from the Sargassum than Lobophora. The limited susceptibility of adult Lobophora to local herbivorous fish assemblages over short (3 h) temporal scales may play a role in the persistence of Lobophora-dominated areas on inshore reefs of the GBR. Future investigations over longer temporal scales and under different contexts are required to fully assess the susceptibility of Lobophora to herbivores.

AB  - In an effort to restore extirpated elk to their historical range, 52 elk were reintroduced to Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) in North Carolina, USA, during 2001 and 2002. Since their reintroduction, elk numbers have increased, and elk have extended their range beyond GRSM boundaries. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) methods based on fecal DNA to identify individual elk and estimate population abundance (N), apparent survival (phi), per capita recruitment (f), and population growth rate (lambda) in western North Carolina. We walked a series of transects during 3 winter field seasons (2020-2022) and collected elk pellets encountered along those transects. We created spatially explicit capture histories and incorporated those data into both closed and open population SCR models. The top performing closed SCR models for males and females estimated density by year and as a function of the scaled distance to the nearest field, with densities decreasing as the distance increased. Combined male and female N were 179 elk (95% CI = 149-215) in 2020, 220 elk (95% CI = 188-256) in 2021, and 240 elk (95% CI = 207-279) in 2022. The top open population model estimated both phi and lambda as functions of sex and year. The estimate of phi for males was 0.682 (95% CI = 0.317-0.908) during 2020-2021 and 0.339 (95% CI = 0.152-0.596) during 2021-2022 and for females was 0.953 (95% CI = 0.830-1.000) during 2020-2021 and 0.829 (95% CI = 0.601-1.000) during 2021-2022. The annual population growth rate (lambda) for males was 1.127 (95% CI = 0.806-1.575) during 2020-2021 and 0.811 (95% CI = 0.566-1.163) during 2021-2022 and for females was 1.559 (95% CI = 1.162-2.091) during 2020-2021 and 1.122 (95% CI = 0.876-1.437) during 2021-2022. Our elk abundance estimates in areas >300 m from fields were negligible, and we suggest that sampling only the areas in and adjacent to fields in the future will result in reliable but more cost-efficient population estimates. Confidence intervals for vital rate parameters were wide for our 3-year dataset, but continued annual pellet sampling will increase sample sizes for vital rate estimation and thus improve precision. If elk herd expansion on public lands is desired, we suggest habitat modification to establish open grasslands adjacent to forests.

Among notable effects, allochthonous energy/matter inputs by seabirds are responsible for shifts in ecosystem functioning next to colonies. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen-15 (ratios of N-15:N-14, expressed as delta N-15) to trace guano incorporation in the intertidal reef community (fish and crab). The study areas were the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA), a remote and very small group of islets in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, and two reference Atlantic islands where intertidal environments are not subject to the influence of guano. SPSPA intertidal reef fauna presented 3-7 parts per thousand higher delta N-15 values in comparison with local seabirds and with the intertidal reef fauna of reference islands. The intertidal food web of SPSPA appears supplemented by guano subsidies with carnivores, omnivores and herbivores N-15-enriched in relation to a local seabird. While no difference in intertidal biota delta N-15 values was detected between references sites, N-15-enrichement observed for SPSPA intertidal reef fauna is supported by guano subsidies. With emerged area < 0.02 km(2), SPSPA is one of the world's smallest archipelagos and only its main islet (Belmonte Island) has a few tidepools apt to be inhabited by fish. As guano readily drains into tidepools and reef crevices adjacent to the seabird colony, allochthonous nutrients become available and support habitat-restricted species in this small and isolated location.

AB  - Coleopterans constitute the second largest order of insects of forensic importance, after the dipterans, which scavenger species are fundamental participants in the process of cadaveric decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. This study aims to: (i) investigate whether coleopterans are indeed more attracted to the final stages of decomposition in the Cerrado, as observed in other biomes; (ii) identify which species colonize carcasses; and (iii) compile a list of forensically relevant beetles for the biome. We performed the experiments in two protected areas between June 2017 and January 2019, in months representative of the dry and rainy seasons. We conducted collections of beetles using 72 pig carcasses throughout all stages of decomposition. A total of 3,006 beetles were identified into 66 taxa from 12 families. Beetles were most abundant in the final stages of decomposition, particularly during the skeletonization stage, which accounted for approximately 45% of the collected individuals. Considering the most abundant families, Scarabaeidae showed no preference in attractiveness amongst the stages of decomposition, whilst Staphylinidae, Silphidae, Dermestidae, and Histeridae were more attracted by the two latter stages of the process. Two species, Dermestes maculatus (De Geer, 1774) and Oxelytrum discicolle (Brull & eacute;, 1840), were observed colonizing the carcasses. This work is pioneering for the Cerrado, uses a large number of carcasses and therefore contributes to a better understanding of ecological processes in the area by approaching the ecology of decomposition of carcasses and scavenger beetles. A list of the species in the region and their utility to forensic entomology is also discussed.

AB  - Baits are a means of orally delivering toxicants, medicaments, or chemical markers to wild boar and feral pigs (Sus scrofa). We tested three bait types, the paraffin-feed-sugar-based IREC bait (green and colorant-free versions), a puffed leguminous bait with the same flavoring as the IREC bait (Flavor), and a plain puffed leguminous bait without flavoring (Plain). Baits were deployed in a fenced hunting estate with year-round feeding to assess bait type preference and study the effect of bait flavoring and coloring, pre-feeding, baiting device, and habituation on bait consumption and bait selectivity. Baits were deployed under heavy pavel stones, targeting adult wild boar, or in piglet-selective feeders. The main bait consumer was the wild boar (IREC 54%; Flavor 15%; Plain 16%) followed by azure-winged magpies (Cyanopica cooki; IREC 11%; Flavor 8%; Plain 17%). The most consumed bait was IREC (n = 164; 71%, mean 4.1 baits per site/day), followed by Flavor (102; 40%; 2.5) and Plain (70; 29%; 1.7). Pre-feeding increased bait consumption of all bait types (IREC 92%; Flavor 63%; Plain 40%). IREC baits were more consumed when deployed under stones (86%) than when deployed in piglet feeders (57%), while no difference between baiting devices was observed for Flavor and Plain baits. Birds preferred color-free baits (consumption ratio of 10% for color-free baits and 0% for green baits), while no other animal showed color preference. We suggest using green IREC-type baits, deployed after pre-baiting using species- and age-specific baiting devices.

AB  - Many animal populations are subject to hunting or fishing in the wild. Detailed knowledge of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, reproduction) and temporal dynamics of such populations is crucial for sustainable management. Despite their relevance for management decisions, structure and size of exploited populations are often not known, and data limited. Recently, joint analysis of different types of demographic data, such as population counts, reproductive data and capture-mark-recapture data, within integrated population models (IPMs) has gained much popularity as it may allow estimating population size and structure, as well as key demographic rates, while fully accounting for uncertainty. IPMs built so far for exploited populations have typically been built as age-structured population models. However, the age of harvested individuals is usually difficult and/or costly to assess and therefore often not available. Here, we introduce an IPM structured by body size classes, which allows making efficient use of data commonly available in exploited populations for which accurate information on age is often missing. The model jointly analyzes size-at-harvest data, capture-mark-recapture-recovery data and reproduction data from necropsies, and we illustrate its applicability in a case study involving heavily hunted wild boar. This species has increased in abundance over the last decades despite intense harvest, and the IPM analysis provides insights into the roles of natural mortality, body growth, maturation schedules and reproductive output in compensating for the loss of individuals to hunting. Early maturation and high reproductive output contributed to wild boar population persistence despite a strong hunting pressure. We thus demonstrate the potential of size-class-structured IPMs as tools to investigate the dynamics of exploited populations with limited information on age, and highlight both the applicability of this framework to other species and its potential for follow-up analyses highly relevant to management.

AB  - The loss of consumers threatens the integrity of ecological systems, but the mechanisms underlying the effects on communities and ecosystems remain difficult to predict. This is, in part, due to the complex roles that consumers play in those systems. Here, we highlight this complexity by quantifying two mechanisms by which molluscan grazers-typically thought of as consumers of their algal resources-facilitate algae on rocky shores. Initial observations in high-zone tide pools revealed that both water-column ammonium concentrations and photosynthetic biomass were higher in pools containing higher densities of grazers, suggesting that local-scale nutrient recycling by the grazers could be enhancing algal biomass. We assessed this possibility by experimentally manipulating grazer abundances at the level of whole tide pools but controlling access of those grazers to experimental plots within each pool. Contrary to predictions that algal biomass inside grazer exclusions would increase as grazer abundances in the pools increased, we found that algal biomass inside grazer-exclusion fences was unaffected by grazer abundances. Instead, the consumptive effects of grazers that were evident at low grazer abundances transitioned to facilitative effects as experimentally manipulated grazer abundances increased. This finding suggested that these positive interactions were associated with the physical presence of grazers and not just grazers' effects on nutrient availability. Subsequent experiments highlighted the potential role of "slime"-the pedal mucous trails left behind as the mollusks crawl on the substratum-in promoting the recruitment of algae and thereby mediating a spatial subsidy of new organic matter into the system. Furthermore, different grazer groups contributed disproportionately to ammonium excretion (i.e., turban snails) versus slime production (i.e., littorine snails), suggesting a potential role for grazer diversity. Our work highlights the complex ways in which consumers affect their resources, including multiple, complementary mechanisms by which these grazers facilitate the algae they consume.

AB  - Over the past century, fire suppression has facilitated broad ecological changes in the composition, structure, and function of fire-dependent landscapes throughout the eastern US, which are in decline. These changes have likely contributed mechanistically to the enhancement of habitat conditions that favor pathogen-carrying tick species, key wildlife hosts of ticks, and interactions that have fostered pathogen transmission among them and to humans. While the long-running paradigm for limiting human exposure to tick-borne diseases focuses responsibility on individual prevention, the continued expansion of medically important tick populations, increased incidence of tick-borne disease in humans, and emergence of novel tick-borne diseases highlights the need for additional approaches to stem this public health challenge. Another approach that has the potential to be a cost-effective and widely applied but that remains largely overlooked is the use of prescribed fire to ecologically restore degraded landscapes that favor ticks and pathogen transmission. We examine the ecological role of fire and its effects on ticks within the eastern United States, especially examining the life cycles of forest-dwelling ticks, shifts in regional-scale fire use over the past century, and the concept that frequent fire may have helped moderate tick populations and pathogen transmission prior to the so-called fire-suppression era that has characterized the past century. We explore mechanisms of how fire and ecological restoration can reduce ticks, the potential for incorporating the mechanisms into the broader strategy for managing ticks, and the challenges, limitations, and research needs of prescribed burning for tick reduction.

AB  - In northern British Columbia and southern Yukon woodland, caribou forage extensively on terrestrial lichens, predominately mat-forming Cladina species in late-successional pine-lichen woodlands. Many of these stands are now reaching a point in their development where lichen abundance declines as feather-moss mats increase. We evaluated the response of forest floor plant communities in pine-lichen woodlands from the southern Yukon Lewes Marsh partial-cutting trial 8 years after harvesting. Photoplot results documented a major decline (>60% +/- 5.6% SE) in the mean surface area of existing large clumps of C. mitis in control (unharvested) treatments, whereas the mean surface area of large C. mitis clumps declined by 28% (+/- 15% SE) in the one-third basal-area removal and showed an increase of 13.5% (+/- 25% SE) in the two-thirds basal-area removal. Line intercept transects documented no changes in overall stand-level lichen abundance between pre-harvest (2012) and post-harvest (2021) measurements, while feather-moss mats and dwarf shrubs showed declines and increases, respectively, in partial-cutting harvest plots. Stand thinning may provide a bridging strategy to extend the period of forage lichen availability in late-seral pine-lichen woodlands, an important consideration in landscapes where increasing severity and frequency of fires are changing the seral-state distribution of caribou habitat.

AB  - Context. Bennett's wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus) was introduced into New Zealand in the late-1800s, and has subsequently become a significant pest to agriculture, silviculture, and native vegetation. Effective management of wallabies requires robust spatial and temporal ecological information, which can be used operationally to increase detection and kill rates. Aims. To determine home range size and shape, resource (i.e. habitat and topography) selection, and daily movement patterns of three populations of Bennett's wallaby in the South Island. Methods. We attached GPS-collars to 38 adult wallabies (17 females, 21 males) between May 2018 and May 2019, and obtained usable location data from 30 individuals. We used kernel density estimators and resource selection functions to quantify seasonal home ranges and resource selection, respectively. Key results. The mean seasonal home range sizes of males and females were similar (26.8 ha and 24.8 ha, respectively; combined range = 1.2-101.9 ha), although the largest home ranges belonged to large males. Resource selection was strongly influenced by distance to concealment cover, ridgelines and streams, i.e. wallabies selected to be closer to these features, though not necessarily at them. Wallabies selected areas close to concealment cover throughout 24-h periods, but most strongly during the day, which is when they bed in dense cover. Wallabies sampled outside of peak breeding moved most during dusk and dawn (median =similar to 50 m/h), whereas those sampled during peak breeding moved widely during day, dusk, and night (110-280 m/h), but not dawn (median =similar to 50 m/h). Conclusions. The home range sizes of wallabies in New Zealand were highly variable, but on average were similar for males and females. Wallabies selected pasture close to areas with some cover, suggesting a trade-off between access to high-quality forage and concealment cover. Implications. Our results provide robust data for modelling management strategies for wallabies, and contribute directly to operational planning by identifying habitats where wallabies are most likely to be found temporally. This information can be used to determine the appropriate survey methods and control tools to maximise detection rates and kill rates of wallabies, based on habitat.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes like Vallisneria spinulosa S. Z. Yan play vital roles in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing sediments, improving water quality, and providing habitat for organisms. However, their populations are declining globally due to environmental stressors like light limitation and bioturbation. This study examined how shading and bioturbation by Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) and Carassius carassius (Linnaeus, 1758) influence V. spinulosa growth and reproduction. Severe shading (50% and 75%) significantly reduced plant height, ramet production, and tuber formation, while mild shading (25%) had limited negative effects by slightly mitigated biomass loss, suggesting that moderate light reduction hardly constrains plant performance. P. clarkii intensified shading stress by mechanically damaging plant structures, causing substantial biomass and reproductive losses, particularly under low-light conditions. In contrast, C. carassius had minimal effects on plant growth and did not significantly interact with shading. While neither shading nor bioturbation strongly affected flowering phenology, P. clarkii tended to induce earlier flowering. These findings highlight the vulnerability of submerged macrophytes to combined light limitation and bioturbation, with invasive P. clarkii amplifying the negative effects of shading. Effective management strategies-including maintaining adequate light availability and controlling P. clarkii populations-are essential for conserving V. spinulosa and other submerged macrophytes under increasing anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Aim: Species geographical range sizes play a crucial role in determining species vulnerability to extinction. Although several mechanisms affect range sizes, the number of biotic interactions and species climatic tolerance are often thought to play discernible roles, defining two dimensions of the Hutchinsonian niche. Yet, the relative importance of the trophic and the climatic niche for determining species range sizes is largely unknown. Location: Central and northern Europe. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Gall--inducing sawflies and their parasitoids. Methods: We use data documenting the spatial distributions and biotic interactions of 96 herbivore species, and their 125 parasitoids, across Europe and analyse the relationship between species range size and the climatic and trophic dimensions of the niche. We then compare the observed relationships with null expectations based on species occupancy to understand whether the relationships observed are an inevitable consequence of species range size or if they contain information about the importance of each dimension of the niche on species range size. Results: We find that both niche dimensions are positively correlated with species range size, with larger ranges being associated with wider climatic tolerances and larger numbers of interactions. However, diet breadth appears to more strongly limit species range size. Species with larger ranges have more interactions locally and they are also able to interact with a larger diversity of species across sites (i.e. higher ss-diversity), resulting in a larger number of interactions at continental scales. Main conclusions: We show for the first time how different aspects of species diet niches are related to their range size. Our study offers new insight into the importance of biotic interactions in determining species spatial distributions, which is critical for improving understanding and predictions of species vulnerability to extinction under the current rates of global environmental change.

AB  - Food hoarding provides animals access to resources during periods of scarcity. Studies on mammalian caching indicate associations with brain size, seasonality and diet but are biased to a subset of rodents. Whether the behaviour is generalizable at other taxonomic scales and/or is influenced by other ecological factors is less understood. Population density may influence food caching due to food competition or pilferage, but this remains untested in a comparative framework. Using phylogenetic analyses, we assessed the role of morphology (body and brain size), climate, diet breadth and population density on food caching behaviour evolution at multiple taxonomic scales. We also used a long-term dataset on caching behaviour of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus fremonti) to test key factors (climate and population density) on hoarding intensity. Consistent with previous smaller scale studies, we found the mammalian ancestral state for food caching was larderhoarding, and scatterhoarding was derived. Caching strategy was strongly associated with brain size, population density and climate. Mammals with larger brains and hippocampal volumes were more likely to scatterhoard, and species living at higher population densities and in colder climates were more likely to larderhoard. Finer-scale analyses within families, sub-families and tribes indicated that the behaviour is evolutionary labile. Brain size in family Sciuridae and tribe Marmotini was larger in scatterhoarders, but not in other tribes. Scatterhoarding in tribe Marmotini was more likely in species with lower population densities while scatterhoarding in tribe Sciurini was associated with warmer climates. Red squirrel larderhoarding intensity was positively related to population density but not climate, implicating food competition or pilferage as an important mechanism mediating caching behaviour. Our results are consistent with previous smaller-scale studies on food caching and indicate the evolutionary patterns of mammalian food caching are broadly generalizable. Given the lability of caching behaviour as evidenced by the variability of our results at finer phylogenetic scales, comparative analyses must consider taxonomic scale. Applying our results to conservation could prove useful as changes in population density or climate may select for different food caching strategies and thus can inform management of threatened and endangered species and their habitats.
   Food hoarding provides animals access to resources during periods of scarcity. We explored the evolution of food hoarding behaviour by integrating hoarding behaviour data for nearly 40% of mammals representing two subclasses and five orders, and a nearly quarter century data set on caching behaviour on Mt. Graham red squirrels. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we found that food caching strategies-whether one stores food in a single larder or scatters food about-are extremely flexible, with many species transitioning between larderhoarding and scatterhoarding numerous times independently. (A) Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that the first mammals (shrew-like Morganucodon from the late Triassic 237 million years ago) likely larderhoarded food, akin to modern-day shrews that have similar lifestyles in analogous forested habitats. (B) We found brain size (EQ) was larger in scatterhoarders due to larger hippocampal volumes for increased spatial memory. Climatic factors (latitude, temperature and seasonality) and population density were also important factors that recurringly influenced food hoarding, with colder temperatures, more seasonal environments and higher population densities being associated with larderhoarding. When we zoomed in on Mt. Graham red squirrels, we found that squirrels tended to invest less in their larderhoards in years when population density was low, implicating competition for food and pilferage as important mechanisms. Our results are consistent with previous smaller scale studies on food caching and indicate the evolutionary patterns of mammalian food caching are broadly generalizable. Applying our results to conservation could prove useful as changes in population density or climate may select for different food caching strategies and thus can inform management of threatened and endangered species and their habitats.image

AB  - Trindade is a remote island far from 1170 km of the Brazilian coast in the Atlantic Ocean, between South America and South Africa. The island has great biodiversity and scientific studies on the fauna and flora of Trindade are still scarce. Accordingly, since crustacean species of the island are also little known, this research features an unprecedented data set, which provides information on the level of potential toxic elements in two crab species: the Grapsus grapsus (herbivore) and the endemic species Gecarcinus lagostoma (omnivorous) which is in threatened status. Although Trindade has experienced contamination from human activities, mainly plastic debris, the element levels found in the samples suggest that there are no relevant inorganic sources into the island. Since minor and trace elements accumulated by marine invertebrates does not present a pattern behavior, our results can support other studies focused on the impact of global warming to the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Evidence of the effects of agriculture on natural systems is widespread, but potential evolutionary responses in nontarget species are largely uncharacterized. To explore whether exposure to agrochemicals may influence selective pressures and phenotypic expression in nonagricultural plant populations, we characterized the expression of putative antiherbivore defense phenotypes in three nonagricultural species found upstream and downstream of irrigated rice fields in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. We found that plants downstream of chemically intensive agriculture showed shifts toward reduced expression of putative antiherbivore defenses relative to upstream counterparts. In two of three tested species, leaf extracts from downstream plants were more palatable to a generalist consumer, suggesting a possible reduction of chemical defenses. In one species with multiple modes of putative defenses, we observed parallel reductions of three metrics of putative biotic and physical defenses. These reductions were concurrent with reduced herbivore damage on downstream plants. Together, these results suggest that agriculture has the potential to alter intraspecific phenotypic expression, ecological interactions, and natural selection in nontarget plant populations.

AB  - Background and Aims Pre-dispersal seed predation is a critical interaction that may significantly affect species fitness. Most studies have addressed this question by focusing on seed size, while the effect of seed position within the fruit remains unexplored. We tested how seed position within fruits affects pre-dispersal seed predation likelihood and progeny performance in two dominant trees, Vachellia aroma and Gleditsia triacanthos (Fabaceae), that are causing encroachment and invasions in Argentina's Chaco Forest.Methods We quantified pre-dispersal seed predation by bruchid beetles across different seed positions (basal, middle, stylar) within fruits. Seed germination and seedling vigour and survival were compared among seeds from such positions.Key Results Pre-dispersal seed predation was highest among seeds from the basal position in both species. In the absence of predators, basal seeds had higher survival and produced more vigorous seedlings than those from the middle and stylar positions.Conclusions Pre-dispersal seed predation not only reduced the quantity of seeds but also disproportionately negatively affected plant progeny performance. This selective predation may decrease seedling recruitment and thus impact population dynamics in both species. Our findings suggest that selective seed predation on seeds that would give rise to the most vigorous progeny may help regulate ecological processes such as invasion dynamics, while potentially promoting biodiversity.

AB  - Sheep function as effective endozoochorous seed vectors in grasslands. Recent laboratory-based studies showed that this important function can be impaired by macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics, which are used to control parasites and enter into the environment mainly via faeces; however, there is a lack of in vivo studies. We conducted a seed-feeding experiment with sheep that included four temperate grassland species from four different families (Achillea ptarmica, Asteraceae; Agrostis capillaris, Poaceae; Dianthus deltoides, Caryophyllaceae; Plantago lanceolata, Plantaginaceae). A series of three feeding trials was carried out after one of two groups of sheep received a single administration of a common oral formulation of the macrocyclic lactone moxidectin. Faeces were collected to determine seedling emergence rate and emergence timing as well as moxidectin concentration via HPLC. Seedling emergence differed significantly between the anthelmintic-treated sheep and the control group. This impact depended on time of seed uptake after anthelmintic administration. Number of emerging seedlings was significantly reduced (27.1 %) when faeces moxidectin concentrations were high (on average 3153 ng g(-1); 1 d post treatment) and significantly increased (up to 68.8 %) when moxidectin concentrations were low (<= 86 ng g(-1); 7, 14 d pt). Mean emergence time was significantly lowered at low moxidectin concentrations. These results demonstrate dose-related effects of deworming on seedling emergence which might affect endozoochory and eventually plant population dynamics in grasslands.

AB  - Plant intraspecific trait variation (ITV) including sex-dependent differences are matters of many ecological consequences, from individual to ecosystem, especially in endangered and rare species. Taxus fuana is an endangered dioecious species with small and isolated populations endemic to the Himalayas region. Little is known about its trait variation between sexes, and among populations. In this study, 18 leaf traits from 179 reproductive trees (males and females) along the altitude (2600-3200m a.s.l.) of the T. fuana populations distributed in Gyirong County, Tibet, China, were measured. ITV and sources of variation in leaf traits were assessed. The relationship between leaf traits of males and females and altitude was analyzed separately. Variations in leaf traits of T. fuana ranged from 3.1% to 24.2%, with the smallest in leaf carbon content and the largest in leaf thickness to area ratio. On average 78.13% of the variation in leaf traits was from within populations and 21.87% among populations. The trends in leaf width, leaf nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio, leaf carbon isotope ratio, and leaf nitrogen isotope ratio in relation to altitude were the same for males and females. Leaf length to width ratio varied significantly with altitude only in males, while leaf phosphorus content, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf carbon to phosphorus ratio varied significantly with altitude only in females. The correlation coefficients of most leaf traits of females with altitude were larger than that of males. In the relationship between leaf traits, there was a high similarity among males and females, but the altitude accounted for more explanation in females than in males. Our results suggested that the variation in leaf traits of T. fuana was small and did not dominate the interspecific competition in the local communities. Adaptation to the altitude gradient of T. fuana might be through altering nutrient storage processes and water use efficiency. Adaptation of male and female T. fuana to environmental changes showed differences, where the males were more tolerant and the females responded greatly to altitude. The differences in adaptation strategies between male and female T. fuana may be detrimental to the maintenance of their populations.

AB  - Purpose Transhumance has rarely been analyzed through LCA approaches, and there is little evidence about its emissions level when conducted under different practices (by truck or on foot) or compared to sedentary livestock systems. Moreover, mobile pastoralism is strongly linked to natural resources by its seasonal grazing patterns, thereby occupying the niche of wild herbivores. Considering natural emission baselines in these ecosystems could have relevant effects when estimating their carbon footprint.
   Materials and methods Inventory data of 20 sheep farms was collected to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of lamb meat produced. Farms were divided into three sub-groups representing typical management practices in the region: (1) sedentary (SED), (2) transhumance by truck (THT), and (3) transhumance on foot (THF). Livestock GHG emissions were modeled according to herd structure and IPCC guidelines. Off-farm emissions from external feeds and fuels were accounted based on existent LCA databases. A natural baseline of wild herbivores was established from the population of red deer reported in a hunting preserve, previously considered to be a reference for the natural carrying capacity in Mediterranean ecosystems. GHG emissions of wild herbivores were estimated through two methods based on (1) IPCC guidelines and (2) allometric regression equations.
   Results and discussion Carbon footprint ranged from 16.5 up to 26.9 kgCO(2)-eq/kg of lamb liveweight (LW). Significant differences were identified among sedentary and transhumant farms, the latter consistently showing lower CF values (SED: 25.1 kg CO2-eq/kg LW, THT: 18.3 kg CO2-eq/kg LW, THF: 18.2 kg CO2-eq/kg LW). Sedentary farms resulted in higher GHG emissions (+27%) and higher CO2 and N2O, contributions derived from the consumption of additional feeds. Both methods applied to compute emissions for wild herbivores led to similar results (25.3-26.8 Mg CO2-eq/km(2)), comparatively lower than estimation for transhumant sheep (47.7 Mg CO2-eq/km(2)). When considering natural baseline emissions, the CF of transhumant lamb meat is reduced by almost 30%, reaching values quite below those reported for intensive lamb production systems in Spain.
   Conclusions From our results, mobility of grazing livestock can be considered as a strategy promoting climate change mitigation. This is achieved mainly by reducing the need of external feeds, while maximizing the use of local forage resources that otherwise would be difficult to valorize. Further reductions in the CF result when considering natural baseline emissions. The application of this new GHG accounting perspective could have relevant implications when aiming at climate neutrality of grazing-based ruminant systems.

AB  - Morphometric differences between ponds and lakes have implications in habitat-dimensioning and coupling. The prevalence of pelagic over benthic habitats in lakes differs from ponds, where macrophytes dominate, offering both within-meadow free water and support for benthic organisms. We assessed four Mediterranean waterbodies (two ponds and two lakes) situated along an environmental-morphometric gradient, combining a model based on taxonomic composition with a multi-interaction network perspective of habitat coupling. The communities' composition (both regarding taxa and their corresponding nodes) fits to this gradient. The composition of benthic and within-meadow habitats was similar in the ponds, while in the lakes, the highest similarity occurred between planktonic habitats (pelagic and within-meadow), and the benthic habitat had unshared populations. The network approach suggests two contrasting patterns of habitat coupling between ponds and lakes. Three functional modules, coupled by macrophytes, herbivores, and mixotrophs, emerged in the ponds: a microbial loop, an autotrophic food chain, and macrophytes hosting benthic microalgae. In the lakes, two disconnected modules appeared: the pelagic plankton plus the within-meadow connector herbivores, and the benthos plus the within-meadow primary producers. Within-meadow herbivores and small phytoplankton nodes were central in the pond and lake networks. Furthermore, benthic nodes showed high functional redundancy and were highly influential in spreading the disturbances' effects. These results demonstrate: (1) the diversity of functional structures in ponds emerging from a mixed composition; (2) the importance of within-meadow organisms as connectors, and (3) the relevance of benthos which has the greatest diversity and redundancy, as well as the most influential network's elements.

AB  - The range-expansion of tropical herbivores due to ocean warming can profoundly alter temperate reef communities by overgrazing the seaweed forests that underpin them. Such ecological interactions may be mediated by changes to seaweed-associated microbiota in response to warming, but empirical evidence demonstrating this is rare. We experimentally simulated ocean warming and marine heatwaves (MHWs) to quantify effects on two dominant temperate seaweed species and their microbiota, as well as grazing by a tropical herbivore. The kelp Ecklonia radiata's microbiota in sustained warming and MHW treatments was enriched with microorganisms associated with seaweed disease and tissue degradation. In contrast, the fucoid Sargassum linearifolium's microbiota was unaffected by temperature. Consumption by the tropical sea-urchin Tripneustes gratilla was greater on Ecklonia where the microbiota had been altered by higher temperatures, while Sargassum's consumption was unaffected. Elemental traits (carbon, nitrogen), chemical defences (phenolics) and tissue bleaching of both seaweeds were generally unaffected by temperature. Effects of warming and MHWs on seaweed holobionts (host plus its microbiota) are likely species-specific. The effect of increased temperature on Ecklonia's microbiota and subsequent increased consumption suggest that changes to kelp microbiota may underpin kelp-herbivore interactions, providing novel insights into potential mechanisms driving change in species' interactions in warming oceans.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) translocated to the semi-arid Nama-Karoo biome in South Africa present a unique opportunity to study body condition in a resource-scarce environment. We used a longitudinal dataset spanning four years to examine how body condition varies in relation to seasonality, rainfall, and age-sex classes. Contrary to our predictions, rainfall and seasonal changes had limited influence on body condition. Instead, yearround availability of principal forage, including resilient plant species such as Vachellia karroo, likely buffered elephants from seasonal fluctuations in body condition. Adult females exhibited the highest body condition scores, while adult males had the lowest, challenging findings from other populations in more resource-abundant habitats. Juvenile elephants had intermediate scores, contrary to predictions that resource scarcity would predominantly affect younger age groups. These findings suggest that current density and resource availability on this fenced reserve support acceptable body condition levels, comparable to other South African fenced reserves. This study underscores the importance of adaptive management practices in marginal environments and highlights potential implications of life history traits and contraception use for elephant welfare and population dynamics.

AB  - Classical biological control (CBC) can be used to decrease the density of invasive species to below an acceptable ecological and economic threshold. Natural enemies specific to the invasive species are selected from its native range and released into the invaded range. This approach has drawbacks, despite the performance of specificity tests to ensure its safety, because the fundamental host range defined under controlled conditions does not represent the actual host range in natura, and these tests omit indirect interactions within community. We focus on Sonchus oleraceus (Asteraceae), a weed species originating from Western Palearctic that is invasive in many countries and notably in Australia. We explore how analyses of interaction network within its native range can be used to (a) inventory herbivores associated to the target plant, (b) characterize their ecological host ranges and (c) guide the selection of candidate biocontrol agents considering interactions with species from higher trophic levels. Arthropods were collected from plant community sympatric to S. oleraceus, in three bioclimatic regions, and interactions were inferred by a combination of molecular and morphological approaches. The networks reconstructed were structured in several trophic levels from basal species (plant community), to intermediate and top species (herbivorous arthropods and their natural enemies). The sub-network centred on S. oleraceus-related interactions contained 116 taxa and 213 interactions. We identified 47 herbivores feeding on S. oleraceus, 15 of which were specific to the target species. Some discrepancies with respect to published findings or conventional specificity tests suggested possible insufficient sampling effort for the recording of interactions or the existence of cryptic species. Among potential candidate agents, six exhibited interactions with natural enemies. Synthesis and applications. Adopting a network approach as prerequisite step of the classical biological control programme can provide a rapid screening of potential agents to be tested in priority. Once ecological host range defined, we suggest that priority should be given to agent used by a minimum species, and, when they exist, to agents that possess enemies from the most distant taxonomical group from those occurring in the range of introduction.

AB  - We propose a design-based strategy to exploit pellet group counts performed within plots of a prefixed size using the clearance count technique with the purposes of analyzing habitat selection, mapping the pellet group presence throughout the study area, and estimating the abundance of deer populations. As is customary in design-based inference, the strategy is free of model assumptions, and the precision and statistical consistency of the proposed estimators are determined by the probabilistic sampling scheme adopted to locate plots. The unique necessary assumptions are the absence of migratory movements during the survey period, the accurate recording of the number of pellet groups deposited within sample plots between the 2 visits, and a precise approximation of the daily defecation rate of the population. In addition to these assumptions, which can be attained by a suitable design of the survey, the statistical soundness of the strategy rests on the use of tessellation stratified sampling, a stratified sampling scheme that ensures an even distribution of plots throughout the study area. The scheme also allows for the estimation of the standard errors and the construction of confidence intervals without involving any other assumptions. We applied this strategy in summer 2019 in a protected area of a Mediterranean coastal region to estimate the density of a fallow deer (Dama dama) population. We estimated the corresponding standard error considering the uncertainty entailed by the estimation of the daily defecation rate, with the purpose of performing reliable monitoring. The proposed strategy provided precise estimates of deer abundance and is readily implementable in the field, standardized, and easily repeatable over time, thus allowing reliable monitoring and comparisons across time and space, which are fundamental attributes for management of deer populations.

AB  - The ability to detect and respond to indicators of risk is vital for any animal and, for many species, humans represent a key threat. We investigated whether wild jackdaws, Corvus monedula, a species that thrives in anthropogenic environments but is regularly persecuted by people, associate human voices with differential degrees of risk and differ in their responses according to local levels of human disturbance. Playbacks showed that nesting females did not discriminate between the voices of familiar men who posed differing levels of threat, generalize to unfamiliar individuals with similar regional ac-cents or discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar accents and voices. They were, however, considerably more wary towards male than female human voices, which may reflect the greater likeli-hood of negative experiences with men than women. Responses to playbacks also differed across fine -scale spatial locations: females nesting in areas of the colony with high levels of disturbance were less likely to leave the nest cup in response to playbacks and were more wary on their return to the nest than birds nesting in less disturbed areas. Nevertheless, levels of local disturbance did not influence repro-ductive success. Together these results indicate that, although vocal cues alone may not suffice for wild jackdaws to discriminate between individual humans or generalize across categories of people, sensi-tivity to cues of gender and local disturbance may help jackdaws to optimize their defensive behaviour and maintain breeding success. Further research into plastic responses towards indicators of human risk is vital to understand and mitigate the impacts of increasing urbanization on wildlife populations.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Algal turf on coral reefs can transition from short productive forms to longer less productive forms that often form a persistent degraded state. We evaluated whether adjacent communities, such as stands of the macroalga Turbinaria ornata, can drive these transitions in Moorea, French Polynesia. We first found that T. ornata stands that overhang turf reduced growth as restricting canopy movement increased turf height compared to controls, implying an overhanging T. ornata canopy shades or abrades adjacent turf. Second, we manipulated T. ornata presence (intact/completely removed) and herbivore access (uncaged/caged) and found that, in the presence of herbivores, removal of stands reduced the height of adjacent turf compared to plots adjacent to intact Turbinaria stands. The presence of intact stands also deterred grazing, demonstrating they provide a refuge for adjacent turf. Thus, algal turf derives both benefits and costs of proximity to macroalgal stands. It is imperative to explore the relative strengths of these costs and benefits as these interactions may drive local transitions to degraded algal states.

AB  - Few studies test the host specificity of tropical dry forest cerambycids, in this study, we examined the host preferences of the cerambycids of a tropical dry forest in central Mexico and the association of cerambycid richness and abundance with the physical characteristics of the wood of their host plants. Branch segments of 81 species of woody plants were cut and left exposed to allow cerambycids oviposition, and the branches were collected and placed in emergence chambers. We measured the density, decomposition rate, and volume of wood for each branch segment. Fifty-seven species of cerambycids emerged. We categorized the cerambycids by the degree of host specificity: 23% were generalists, 14% were specialists, and for 63% of the data were insufficient to determine specificity. For the first time we report, for the tropical dry forest, preference patterns between Cerambycidae (subfamilies and species) and their host plants (families and species). Physical characteristics of wood, such as density and decomposition rate, were strongly related to the presence of cerambycids. Cerambycidae in this forest use wood resources that decompose at an intermediate rate and are relatively soft. The cerambycids were most often generalists, and specific cerambycid/tree species associations were rare, but close commensal relationships were found at the level of subfamilies and plant families. Cerambycid richness and abundance depend on the type of host, medium decomposed woods, and the great abundance of each individual host in the area.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution poses a growing threat to wetland ecosystems, impacting their structure and function. Chenqiao Wetland and Qinglong Lake (Henan, China), key bird habitats in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, were analyzed for heavy metal contamination. We assessed the exposure risks of heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn) to aquatic birds using an integrated model that considered multiple intake variables: soil intake rate (I-s), water intake rate (I-w), plant intake rate (I-df), and prey items intake rate (aquatic animals, I-df). Results revealed significant variation in heavy metal pollution across sampling points, with Cd presenting the highest potential ecological risk in soil. Bioaccumulation coefficients were notably higher in benthic invertebrates compared with fish. Omnivorous and herbivorous birds exhibited significantly higher heavy metal exposure doses (E-j) than carnivorous birds, with the exception of Cr. Among all elements, Zn exhibited the highest E-j, while Pb and Cr posed a high exposure risk (hazard quotient [HQ] > 2) across both food and soil pathways in both omnivorous and herbivorous aquatic birds, which were predominantly exposed to Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cr through plants rather than soil. Conversely, the high Cr HQ in omnivorous and carnivorous birds was primarily associated with the consumption of aquatic animals. This study highlights the importance of considering both food and soil pathways when assessing heavy metal exposure risks in aquatic birds. These findings provide valuable insights for developing strategies to mitigate heavy metal pollution in wetland ecosystems and protect bird populations.

AB  - African forests, especially in Cote d'Ivoire, have been lost during the past three decades. Worldwide, forests are being destroyed to make room for farmland. Deforestation depletes floral resources and fragments habitat. Cocoa growth threatens critical ecological zones, particularly in Cote d'Ivoire. The 2002-2007 conflict impacted Mount Peko National Park (PNMP). This issue has hastened the decline of endangered animal habitats (Colobus and Elephants). The classification approach based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm using the Mean Accuracy Decrease (MDA) has been applied for choosing a variable to select the best predictor variables in the model. A Spectral Index map and time series satellite images of the PNMP from 1985 to 2020 were used to identify land cover changes. RStudio and QGIS 3.4 software have been used to create training data. Among thirteen (13) variables studied, NIR (Near Infrared), Short-Wave Infrared 1 (SWIR 1) and SWIR bands had the increased importance of the variable for the performance of the classification prediction model. The NIR band was the greatest predictor. MDA predicted 75%. User accuracy (UA), Producer accuracy (PA), and Overall accuracy (OA) classifications were 98.75% +/- 1.94, 99% +/- 1.95, 97% +/- 1.93. The park's dense forest remained unchanged, but nonforest was reforested and 12.22% was turned to forest. During the study period, extensive cocoa plantations were established in formerly forested regions.

AB  - Few marine taxa have been comprehensively assessed for their conservation status, despite heavy pressures from fishing, habitat degradation and climate change. Here we report on the first global assessment of extinction risk for 300 species of syngnathiform fishes known as of 2017, using the IUCN Red List criteria. This order of bony teleosts is dominated by seahorses, pipefishes and seadragons (family Syngnathidae). It also includes trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae), shrimpfishes (Centriscidae), cornetfishes (Fistulariidae) and ghost pipefishes (Solenostomidae). At least 6% are threatened, but data suggest a mid-point estimate of 7.9% and an upper bound of 38%. Most of the threatened species are seahorses (Hippocampus spp.: 14/42 species, with an additional 17 that are Data Deficient) or freshwater pipefishes of the genus Microphis (2/18 species, with seven additional that are Data Deficient). Two species are Near Threatened. Nearly one-third of syngnathiformes (97 species) are Data Deficient and could potentially be threatened, requiring further field research and evaluation. Most species (61%) were, however, evaluated as Least Concern. Primary threats to syngnathids are (1) overexploitation, primarily by non-selective fisheries, for which most assessments were determined by criterion A (Hippocampus) and/or (2) habitat loss and degradation, for which assessments were determined by criterion B (Microphis and some Hippocampus). Threatened species occurred in most regions but more are found in East and South-east Asia and in South African estuaries. Vital conservation action for syngnathids, including constraining fisheries, particularly non-selective extraction, and habitat protection and rehabilitation, will benefit many other aquatic species.

AB  - Analysis of microbiome data from feral swine, coyotes, domesticated cattle, and the surrounding environment reveals that wild animals harbor more abundant antibiotic-resistant organisms than livestock, and might act as a source of antibiotic-resistant microbes in outbreaks.
   Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (ARMs) are widespread in natural environments, animals (wildlife and livestock), and humans, which has reduced our capacity to control life threatening infectious disease. Yet, little is known about their transmission pathways, especially at the wildlife-livestock interface. This study investigated the potential transmission of ARMs and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between cattle and wildlife by comparing gut microbiota and ARG profiles of feral swine (Sus scrofa), coyotes (Canis latrans), cattle (Bos taurus), and environmental microbiota. Unexpectedly, wild animals harbored more abundant ARMs and ARGs compared to grazing cattle. Gut microbiota of cattle was significantly more similar to that of feral swine captured within the cattle grazing area where the home range of both species overlapped substantially. In addition, ARMs against medically important antibiotics were more prevalent in wildlife than grazing cattle, suggesting that wildlife could be a source of ARMs colonization in livestock.

AB  - The Arabian gazelle (Gazella arabica) and Arabian sand gazelle (G. marica) are globally threatened. In ongoing restoration efforts within Saudi Arabia, 240 captive-bred sand gazelles and 73 Arabian gazelles were reintroduced to the 12,684 km2 Uruq Bani Ma'arid Protected Area in the western Ar Rub' al-Kha<overline>l & imath;<overline> in the mid-late 1990s. Here, we assess the long-term conservation outcome and compare habitat use by both species. Initial post-release distribution was monitored by VHF radio-tracking. Their distribution and relative abundance were studied 20 years later in 2015-2016 using a large-scale camera-trap survey. Our results show Arabian gazelles established across the western side of the protected area, while sand gazelles were widely distributed across the central protected area, with marked seasonal movement into the interior in the cool season and back to the western margin in the hot season. The results confirm both species have retained their known habitat preferences after captive breeding and release. The study also shows that the Arabian gazelle and to a lesser extent sand gazelle undergo seasonal temporal niche switching of activity patterns, exhibiting nocturnal-crepuscular activity during the hot season and largely diurnal-crepuscular activity during the cool season. Releasing groups of desert gazelles at multiple locations simultaneously, over a 2-3 year period into suitable and protected natural habitat is shown to result in established populations. A large-scale long duration camera-trap array provided effective information on relative abundance and distribution of these species persisting 20 years later in a complex habitat where conventional sampling techniques are difficult to implement.

AB  - Sea turtles migrate across ocean basins to reach foraging and breeding areas but still exhibit significant population structure across nesting beaches. Although five species of sea turtles nest in West Africa, the genetic structure of many species in this region has not been adequately explored. We investigated the diversity of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for nesting olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles in two coastal communities (Mankoadze and Ada Foah) in Ghana that are approximately 160 km apart. Samples were collected during four nesting seasons: 2006, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Analysis of the control region of mtDNA (n = 45) revealed six variable positions defining five haplotypes, of which one was previously undescribed (Lo91). These findings are indicative of population expansion from a small ancestral population and support the scenario of colonization of the Atlantic via founder effect. Eleven microsatellite loci were used to analyze two years (2015 and 2016) from Mankoadze. We determined these nesting cohorts were not genetically distinct (F-ST = 0.025, P = 0.286) and can therefore be considered a single population. This population was compared to six females from Ada Foah across seven loci. Individuals from the two locations were less related than expected under a model of random chance, and showed signs of outbreeding, and reflected moderate variation between the two (F-IS = -0.160, P = 1.00; F-ST = 0.104, P = 0.002). The structuring between locations indicate nesting individuals may utilize different migration mutes, foraging grounds, or breeding grounds and that Ghana may serve as a transitional area between central and west African rookeries.

AB  - Understanding the ecological factors influencing African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) abundance and distribution is crucial for their conservation management in Central Africa. Dung surveys have been conducted at the landscape scale and confirmed the overwhelming impact of anthropogenic activities on forest elephants. We present results from a small-scale survey in a pristine protected area without anthropogenic activities to elucidate the ecological factors influencing forest elephant density. We conducted a line transect dung survey in a small study area (110 km(2)) around Mbeli Bai, a natural forest clearing in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo, and compare results with a landscape survey conducted during the same period. We used habitat specific dung decay data collected on site to estimate elephant density using distance sampling. We fitted Generalized Additive Models to elephant dung encounter rate using explanatory variables collected during the transect survey and from geospatial data. The small-scale survey revealed a precise estimate of forest elephant density that was twice as high as the result from a landscape survey with higher density in mixed species forest for the small-scale survey. We could not find an impact of the proximity of forest clearings and proximity to rivers at the small scale. Fine-scale habitat features, e.g. degree of canopy and understorey closure, had little explanatory power for elephant dung encounter rate. Small-scale dung surveys are a useful method to reveal spatio-temporal variation in forest elephant density and distribution which can inform conservation practitioners in a timely manner. Combining monitoring methods at various spatial scales improves our knowledge and conservation efforts of forest elephants. Nouabale-Ndoki National Park is a stronghold for forest elephants and of global importance for their conservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is a substantial challenge to biodiversity conservation, exerting direct effects on plants and animals alike. Herbivores may be additionally affected by indirect effects, mediated through, for instance, climate change-induced alterations in host-plant quality. Thus, climate change may pronouncedly impact long-evolved plant-animal interactions, but our knowledge is still in its infancy, particularly with regard to the combined effects of temperature and water availability. We here investigate the effects of simulated climate change, considering variation in both temperature and water availability, on (1) host-plant chemistry, (2) herbivore oviposition and larval feeding preference, and (3) larval and adult performance. As study system, we used the butterfly Pieris napi (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and its host plant Sinapis alba (Brassicacae). Host-plant chemistry was affected by simulated climate change, with higher temperatures increasing the carbon-nitrogen ratio and concentrations of glucosinolates, while drought stress led to reduced glucosinolate concentrations. Both egg-laying females and larvae preferred plants with the highest concentrations of the glucosinolate glucosinalbin, potentially acting as oviposition and feeding stimulus. Herbivore performance was positively affected by plants grown at control temperatures or under drought stress and thus reduced glucosinolate concentrations. Hence, P. napi was not able to select the most profitable host. Our study indicates that (1) climate-induced changes in plant chemistry may exert indirect effects on herbivores, (2) effects of climate change will depend on the magnitude of change in specific abiotic parameters and their interactions, whereby positive (e.g. drought) and negative (e.g. temperature) effects may even cancel out each other, and (3) changes in critical chemical cues may diminish host-plant detectability and thereby result in reduced realised fecundity. We thus highlight the important role of temperature and water availability on plant chemistry, which may change interactions between insects and plants. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - The plant communities dominated by Asphodelus ramosus are quite common in the Mediterranean Basin, especially in the most degraded vegetation stages caused by grazing and fires. The aim of this paper is to provide a phytosociological description of the Asphodelus ramosus-dominated plant community of the Murge Plateau, in southeastern Italy, through 28 phytosociological releves. Cluster analysis (flexible Beta method) and ordination (non-metric multidimentional scaling) were used to compare this plant community with other dry grassland associations in the same area and with other Asphodelus ramosus-dominated plant communities from Italy and western Balkans. The results allowed the description of a new association for the Murge Plateau: the Gelasio columnae-Asphodeletum ramosi.The new association has been tentatively classified in the alliance Hippocrepido glaucae-Stipion austroitalicae (Scorzoneretalia villosae order), because of the presence of several species typical of this alliance, although it is intermediate between this alliance and the more thermophilous vegetation of the Lygeo sparti-Stipetea tenacissimae class.

AB  - Wildfires are a major natural disturbance in Canada that are postulated to increase under a warming climate. To derive accurate trends in burned area and to quantify the effects of fire frequency, duration, and extent, a sufficiently long time series of reliable burned area maps is required. With that in mind, we extended Canada's National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) dataset from its previous start year (2004) back to 1986. NBAC consists of annual maps in polygon format where the area burned in each fire event is represented by the best available delineation among various mapping methods and data sources of varying quality. Ordered from more to less reliability, in the new 35-year time series (1986 to 2020), 10% of the total burned area was derived from airborne and high-resolution (<5 m) satellite imagery, 81% from change detection methods using 30 m Landsat satellite imagery, and the remaining 9% was largely from aerial surveys. Total (Canada-wide) annual burned area estimates ranged from 215,797 ha in 2020 to 6.7 million ha (Mha) in 1989. We computed 95% confidence intervals for the estimate of each year from 1986 to 2020 based on the accuracy and relative contribution in that year of the different data sources, for both the new NBAC time series and the polygon version of the Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB), a commonly used source of spatially explicit data on burned area in Canada. NBAC confidence intervals were on average +/- 9.7% of the annual figure, about one-third the width of the confidence intervals derived for CNFDB. The NBAC time series also included nearly 5000 fire events (totalling 4 Mha, with the largest event being 120,661 ha in size) that are missing in the CNFDB. In a regional analysis for the Northwest Territories, retroactive fire mapping from Landsat imagery reduced historical estimates by 3 Mha (16%), which would result in a 1.6 Mha increase in the reported undisturbed critical habitat for threatened woodland caribou. The NBAC dataset is freely downloadable from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.

AB  - Glacial Termination V (T-V) comprised a relatively rapid shift from glacial to interglacial conditions (MIS 12 glacial to the MIS 11c); it was one of the greatest climatic changes of the Pleistocene, and forms part of the major climatic reorganization known as the Mid-Brunhes Event (MBE). The Fucino Basin, located in the Central Apennine chain of central Italy, contains a continuous and well-preserved lacustrine sedimentary record of T-V and MIS 11, dated using tephrochronology. In this paper, we report a high-resolution palynological analysis, supported by geochemical proxies, from the lowermost section of the F4-F5 composite record, to improve understanding of T-V in this region. This record reveals a substantial transition between MIS 12 and MIS 11c at 424.5 +/- 4.0 ka, from a very cold and dry environment indicated by the herbaceous and xerophytic association of Poaceae, Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Ephedra, and Hippoph & auml;e, and sedimentation dominated by inorganic siliciclastic sediments, to a warm and humid period characterised by a significant increase in Abies and a deciduous tree association mainly formed by Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Quercus, Ulmus, and dominated by more organic calcareous sediments. This transition was correlated with a significant lake-level rise, with an enhanced nutrient input into the lake between 425.0 +/- 4.5 ka and 424.0 +/- 3.9 ka, as inferred from the variance between algae, aquatic plants, and terrestrial herbaceous taxa. Following the MIS 11c temperature maximum at 424.2 +/- 3.9 ka, a reduction in summer insolation occurred, provoking a significant increase in humidity that produced the widespread development of Abies. The results from this study suggest that, at Fucino, fluctuations in humidity are predominantly responsible for the vegetation changes observed during T-V.

AB  - Sea urchins play a key role in shallow rocky shores, acting as modulators of abundance, density and species composition of macroalgae. In communities that host more than one species, understanding how trophic resources are used and partitioned is a key aspect of understanding the ecosystem's dynamics in which they are inserted. In Southern Brazil, Echinometra lucunter and Paracentrotus gaimardi show a high spatial overlap, in the upper (1-3 m) subtidal zone. Because trophic niche differentiation largely contributes to the coexistence of species, we hypothesize that the evaluated species have low overlap in diet since they share the same habitat and have access to similar resources. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the stomach contents of twenty (20) individuals of each species, in two sites (Gravata and Matadeiro rocky shores) to verify feeding patterns of the species. Using taxonomic and morphological levels in identifying stomach contents and Pianka's index to assess the degree of trophic overlap between species in each site. It was found that, despite the differences in benthic composition, the feeding patterns of both species were similar in both sites with the species being classified as generalist herbivores. The species showed a low degree of dissimilarity in the acquisition of trophic resources, and a high trophic overlap. The results indicate that the main factor influencing feeding patterns was the availability of resources. The high trophic overlap occurs due to the generalist behavior of the species, which use and share the resources available in the environment. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of areas by native and non-native herbivores in sympatry has frequently led to conflicts between farmers and native animals. Dietary studies integrating methodologies usually provide a better quantified understanding of resource sharing and dietary overlap. This study aims to evaluate diet and niche overlap among three species that occur in sympatry in southern Brazil: a native herbivorous bird in South America, the southern screamer (Chauna torquata), domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus). Three complementary methodologies were used: microhistology and metabarcoding of faeces and stable isotope analysis (SIA) in faeces and whole blood. Bipartite networks were constructed for the three dietary assessments. No significant isotopic niche overlap was found between the native bird and the domestic herbivores by SIA in blood, while the three methods applied to faecal samples showed limited overlap between the bird and the non-native ungulates. Conversely, SIA in faecal samples revealed similarity in the feeding habits and niches of domestic herbivores. The complementary use of the three different techniques allowed the evaluation of the herbivore diet from different perspectives, according to strengths and limitations of each method: while metabarcoding indicated the use of a larger number of plant groups in different proportions and identified several of the components at the species level, Cyperaceae species were only identified by microhistology. Conversely, metabarcoding performed better than microhistology in the detection of some species of Onagraceae and Poaceae. SIA in blood elucidated different proportions of resources assimilated by herbivores, while faecal SIA revealed plants with similar photosynthetic cycles in the diet of the non-native herbivores. Through bipartite network analysis, modules emerged (e.g. SIA = 0.2, 95% IC = 0.1-0.19), confirming the differential use of some groups of resources. The combination of the three techniques, enhanced by comparative bipartite network analysis, was critical for obtaining a detailed understanding of the vast range of potential plants used and interactions among herbivores. The detected patterns of dietary partitioning also confirm that the southern screamer is not competing with cattle and sheep and can even provide ecosystem services through the biological control of aquatic weeds.

AB  - Background The chilla or grey fox (Lycalopex griseus) is a native species from continental Chile and neighboring areas of Argentina. It was introduced to Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego in 1951 and began to increase its abundance, to the chagrin of local sheep ranchers. Since 1998, its hunting has been authorized. Here we update information on the density, abundance, and activity of this fox in the Chilean sector of Tierra del Fuego Island, to evaluate its population trend since the last census conducted by the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG) in 2007. Methods and results We carried out two fox censuses on a 941-km transect on public roads, divided into eight routes, from October to November (spring) of 2021 and 2022, following the same design used by SAG for the fox assessments carried out from 1999 to 2007. We report a reduction of > 50% in the density and abundance of chilla foxes with respect to the 2007 estimate, which could be attributed to the interference by free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), through restricting the use of space by the fox, while transmitting diseases and parasites, and to human hunting pressure and vehicle collisions. Discussion The chilla fox decline highlights the need for an in-depth study to determine the ecological and socioeconomic impact of this exotic species on the ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego Island and the desirability of its management, if needed.

AB  - We present the largest freely available herbivory dataset for Japan representing data collected from a network of 19 natural forest sites across the country. Sampled network sites were part of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project organized by the Ministry of the Environment. Sites were located across a range of climate zones, from subarctic to subtropical, and broadleaf trees (both evergreen and deciduous) were targeted at each site. Litterfall traps were used to assess leaf damage caused by leaf-chewing insects in 2014 and 2015. Using a standardized protocol, we assessed herbivory on 117,918 leaves of 39 dominant tree species. Preliminary analyses suggest that insect herbivory increases with increasing latitude for deciduous broadleaf species. In particular, oak (Quercus crispula) and beech (Fagus crenata) were subject to increased insect herbivory with increasing latitude. In contrast, insect herbivory decreased with increasing latitude in evergreen broadleaf species. The latitudinal gradient of herbivory differed according to leaf type (i.e., evergreen or deciduous). This dataset offers excellent opportunities for meta-analysis and comparative studies of herbivory among various forest types. The complete dataset for this abstract published in the Data Paper section of the journal is available in electronic format in MetaCat in JaLTER at .

AB  - Dredging activities produce large amounts of polluted sediments that require adequate management strategies. Sediment reuse and relocation can involve several environmental issues, such as the release of CO2 and nitrogen compounds in the environment, the transfer of metals to plant tissues and the persistence of phytotoxic compounds. In this framework, the aim of the present work is to evaluate the use of biochar at different doses, in combination with plant growth, to reduce the environmental impacts polluted dredged sediments.
   Irrespective to the plant treatment, the amendment of the sediment with the lowest dose of biochar (3%) reduced by 25% the CO2 emissions of the substrate, by 89% the substrate carbon loss and by 35% the amount of nitrogen released into the environment (average values of the three plant treatments). The negative priming effect of biochar on organic matter mineralization can be responsible for the beneficial reduction of carbon and nitrogen release in the environment. The lack of similar effects observed at the higher biochar doses can depend on the low albedo of the biochar particles, causing the substrate warming (+1 degrees C for highest biochar dose) and accelerating the organic matter mineralization. Finally, shrub growth in combination with 3% biochar was able to offset the CO2 emission of the sediment and to reduce the amount of nitrogen lost.
   This work provides new insight on the potential benefit related to the biochar amendment of organic matter-rich dredged sediments, suggesting that the use of moderate dose of wood biochar in combination with shrub plantation can reduce the release of CO2 and nitrogen compounds in the environment.

AB  - Biological invasions, as a result of human intervention through trade and mobility, are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss. The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs of IAS within its territory. Here, using "InvaCost", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated with IAS from English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (Capra hircus; US$20 million), followed byAedes mosquitoes (US$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus Rubus, a parasitic fly (Philornis downsi), black rats (Rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (Achatina fulica) represented less than US$2 million each. Costs of "mixed-taxa" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; US$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of the IAS reported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country.

AB  - The air environment (e.g., high concentration of carbon dioxide) in a pig house will affect the health conditions and growth performance of the pigs, and the quality of pork as well. In order to reduce the cumulative concentration of carbon dioxide in the pig house, the prediction model was established by the deep learning method to predict the changes of the carbon dioxide cumulative concentration in a pig house. This model will also be used for the real-time monitoring and adjustment of the concentration of carbon dioxide of the pig house. The experiment was designed to collect environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, and carbon dioxide concentration) data in the pig house for several months. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition-gated recurrent unit (EEMD-GRU) prediction model was established in the prediction of carbon dioxide concentration in the pig house. The results show that compared with the other models, the prediction accuracy of the EEMD-GRU model is the highest, and the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and r-squared (R-2) of carbon dioxide concentration in autumn and winter are 123.2 ppm, 88.3 ppm, 3.2%, and 0.99, respectively. The RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-2 for carbon dioxide concentration are 129.1 ppm, 93.2 ppm, 5.9%, and 0.76 in spring and summer. The prediction model proposed in this paper can effectively predict the concentration of carbon dioxide in the pig house and provide effective help for the precise control of the pig house environment.

AB  - Enclosure environments for captive giraffes can be improved by promoting species-specific behaviors and extending foraging behavior. To date, however, the effects of climatic (temperature-humidity index, THI) and environmental factors (landscaping trees) on the enrichment of captive settings have not been studied. Therefore, the present study explored the effects of browsing enrichment on the licking behavior of captive giraffes. From May 2019 to February 2020, three giraffes in the Kyoto City Zoo, Japan, were observed for 270 h over two consecutive seasons (pre- and post-deciduous). Overall, branch foraging behavior and licking behavior were weakly and negatively correlated. In the pre-deciduous period, THI was significantly and negatively correlated with giraffe activity, and some individuals exhibited significantly reduced foraging behavior. Therefore, browsing enrichment under extreme heat may not improve giraffe rearing environments. Moreover, in the post-deciduous period, with decreased availability of leaves on landscaping trees, the non-branch foraging behavior of giraffes was significantly increased, with a corresponding significant increase in licking behavior. Therefore, landscaping trees affect the foraging behavior of captive giraffes.

AB  - Understanding the predator-prey relationship is essential for implementing effective conservation management practices on threatened species. Leopard is a threatened apex mammalian predator that plays a crucial role in ecosystem functions in India's tropical forest. We assessed the diet and activity pattern of leopards in relation to their prey using diet analysis and camera trapping data from Similipal Tiger Reserve, eastern India. Our results indicated that leopard prefers medium-sized prey such as wild pig, common langur and barking deer represented 60% of the total biomass consumed collectively. Results of 6413 camera trap night in 187 locations revealed that leopards showed cathemeral activity pattern and exhibited positive co-occurrence pattern and significant spatial and temporal overlap with their main prey, the wild pig. However, leopards showed very low spatial and temporal overlap with the second main prey, the common langur. Leopards avoided humans and showed low spatial and temporal overlap with humans. Our findings reveal that a trade-off might drive leopard activity between consuming prey and avoiding anthropogenic disturbances like human activity.

AB  - Aerobic composting is commonly used in pig manure treatment, however, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their unclear transformation during composting process make the treated manure land using risky. The effects of enhanced thermophilic phase strategy (external heating (HTC) and thermophiles inoculation (MC)) on ARGs removal and the underlying mechanisms were investigated during swine manure composting. HTC increased the total relative abundance (RA) of ARGs by 32.38%, and MC decreased by 21.50% compared to CK by the end of the composting. Mantel test indicated that it was not temperature (P > 0.05), but environmental parameters (pH, Electric Conductivity (EC), etc.) and metabolic products (nitrogen forms) significantly affected the ARGs profile. Partial least-squares path modeling (PLS-PM) suggested that microbial community structure (bacterial abundance and diversities) was the main factor for ARGs evolution. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that HTC could promote the propagation of ARG hosts in later stage of the composting because the strong selection of thermophiles resulted in ecological niches vacancy, and MC enhanced the competition between hosts and nonhosts for ecological niches by increasing thermophiles diversities. These results suggested that competitive inhibition to potential ARGs hosts could be a helpful strategy in ARGs threaten elimination during composting.

AB  - The application of chemical fertilizer alone may deteriorate the trophic structure of soil nematode community. However, little is known about whether the combined application of organic materials and chemical fertilizer can mitigate the negative effect, and the mechanism that potentially mitigates the negative effect remains poorly understood. In this study, four fertilization regimes, including unfertilized control (CK), chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer (NPK), crop straw combined with NPK (SNPK), and pig manure combined with NPK (MNPK), were used to determine the variations in soil nematode trophic groups, diversity, and functional indices under different fertilization regimes. Results indicate that NPK treatment significantly increased the abundances of both bacterivores and plant parasites, and the increase amplitude in the abundance of plant parasites was higher than that of bacterivores under the NPK treatment in comparison to the CK treatment, which might lead to the deterioration of the trophic structure of nematode community. By comparing the difference in the abundance of the plant-parasitic nematode genera among different fertilization regimes, it can be observed that the increase in the abundance of the plant-parasitic nematode-dominant genus Dolichorhynchus under the NPK treatment mainly contributed to the increase in the abundance of plant parasites and the subsequent deterioration of the trophic structure of nematode community. Compared to the NPK treatment, SNPK and MNPK treatments suppressed the increase in the abundance of the Dolichorhynchus, which will help to mitigate the negative effect of NPK treatment on the trophic structure of nematode community. Moreover, the significantly negative correlation of the Dolichorhynchus and soil total nitrogen (TN) indicates that the suppression of this nematode genus is under high N content. Overall, these results suggest that NPK treatment might deteriorate the trophic structure of nematode community mainly by increasing the abundance of the Dolichorhynchus, while the combined application of crop straw or pig manure and chemical fertilizer could mitigate the negative effect by suppressing the Dolichorhynchus with increasing N concentration, which may be more conducive to maintaining agricultural sustainability.

AB  - This paper presents an exploratory study on the taxonomic diversity of pre-Hispanic archaeofaunas in the South-Central Andes (SCA; western South America) from the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary to the Late-Holocene. The SCA is a complex of diverse environments and has undergone distinct climate events for the last 13,000 years, such as the occurrence of warmer and drier conditions in the Middle-Holocene. The South-Central Andean area was part of the larger Andes interaction area, which was a primary center for animal and plant domestication and the emergence of agro-pastoralist economies. Since subsistence was key to these processes, the SCA provides a relevant case study on the interactions among environment, foodways and sociocultural evolution. Taxonomic diversity was used here as a proxy for diet breadth. A total of 268 archaeofaunal assemblages were sampled from the zooarchaeological literature. Reviewed variables included the cultural chronology and spatial coordinates of the assemblages, as well as the presence and abundance of taxa at the family rank. Taxonomic diversity covered two dimensions: composition (families present in each assemblage) and structure (quantitative relationships among taxa), which was measured through richness (NTAXA), ubiquity and relative abundance (NISP based rank-order). Despite the uneven distribution of samples, the analyses revealed the following trends: (1) a moderate relationship between NTAXA and distance from coastline for most of the Holocene; (2) a potential decrease in assemblage richness for coastal ecoregions during the Late-Holocene; and (3) a generalized increase in the relative abundance of Camelidae.
   Este articulo presenta un estudio exploratorio sobre la diversidad taxonomica de arqueofaunas prehispanicas de los Andes Centro-Sur (ACS, Sudamerica occidental) desde el limite Pleistoceno-Holoceno hasta el Holoceno Tardio. Los ACS son un complejo de diversos ambientes y atravesaron distintos eventos climaticos durante los ultimos 13.000 anos, como el incremento de aridez y temperatura del Holoceno Medio. Los ACS son parte de la gran area de interaccion andina o Andes, que fue un centro de domesticacion de plantas y animales y de la emergencia de comunidades agropastoriles. Los modos de subsistencia fueron claves en estos procesos y los ACS representan un caso de estudio pertinente a los nexos entre ambiente, modos alimentarios y evolucion sociocultural. La diversidad taxonomica se utilizo como un indicador de amplitud de dieta. Una muestra de 268 conjuntos arqueofaunisticos se compilo a partir de la literatura especializada. Las variables incluyen cronologia relativa y coordenadas de los conjuntos y la presencia y frecuencia de taxones al rango familia. La diversidad taxonomica comprende las dimensiones de composicion (ocurrencia de familias en los conjuntos) y estructura (frecuencias de taxones), que fue medida por la riqueza (NTAXA), ubicuidad y abundancia ordinal basada en NISP. Si bien la cobertura de la muestra es desigual, se observaron algunas tendencias: (1) una relacion moderada entre proximidad a la costa y riqueza taxonomica hasta el Holoceno medio inclusive; (2) una posible reduccion relativa de la riqueza de los conjuntos en las ecorregiones costeras durante el Holoceno tardio; (3) un predominio ascendente de Camelidae.

AB  - Rapid changes in climate have the potential to alter habitats faster than evolution may respond, leading to maladapted tree populations. Assisted migration may help foundation tree species persist in future climates by identifying populations and genotypes that are robust to expected climate change-induced alterations. Importantly, community-assisted migration accounts for impacts of those populations and genotypes on the broader community, including herbivores, often adapted to local plants. These impacts have been examined in arthropod communities, but few studies have assessed mammals, and fewer still have leveraged an experimental design to disentangle genetic contributions to herbivore selection among genotypes and populations. We tested whether North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) browsing on Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) is under genetic control in a common garden to uncouple genetic and environmental contributions on browse selection. Porcupines selected trees from climatically similar and cooler areas, where trees from cooler climates suffered greater than 2x more herbivory than trees from warmer areas. Plant genotype was a significant factor for selection, with the most heavily browsed genotype having greater than 10x more herbivory than the least browsed. Broad-sense heritability of porcupine tree selection was H2B = 0.27 among genotypes, indicating a genetic component to tree defenses against porcupine herbivory that can be predicted by source population climate. Our results have important implications for future mammalian herbivore populations, should climate change render local tree genotypes maladaptive. We recommend assisted migration efforts plant stock from areas up to 3 degrees C warmer and climatically similar areas to maintain productivity and mammalian herbivore browsing.

AB  - Understanding long-term changes in the distribution of commercially important species is a key first step for developing appropriate management plans. We estimated multi-decadal changes in the distributions of seven demersal fish species in the central-western Sea of Japan by fitting a multispecies spatiotemporal model to catch and effort data from a Japanese offshore trawl fishery from 1982 to 2020. We then identified any spatiotemporal patterns and discussed their relationship to oceanographic factors. Large distribution expansions were detected for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and blackthroat seaperch (Doederleinia berycoides) in the southwestern region of the study area in the 2000s and 2010s. Combined with previous findings and an interannual trend of water temperature, it is thought that these changes could have been caused by expansions in the distribution of optimal thermal condition for stock-recruitment relationships. Species that did not experience large changes in distribution, such as cold-water flounders [the flathead flounder (Hippoglossoides dubius) and Korean flounder (Glyptocephalus stelleri)], mainly inhabit deep waters that are thought to be dominated by a colder and homogeneous water mass, meaning that their habitats were more likely to remain stable over time. Our results will contribute to improvement of adaptive stock managements for commercially important demersal species.

AB  - Little is known about the structure of S. aureus population and the enterotoxin gene content in wild boar. In 1025 nasal swabs from wild boars, 121 S. aureus isolates were identified. Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes were identified in 18 isolates (14.9%). The seb gene was found in 2 S. aureus isolates, sec in 2 isolates, the see and seh genes were found in 4 and 11 isolates, respectively. The production of SEs was evaluated in bacteria grown in microbial broth. Concentration of SEB reached 2.70 mu g/ml after 24 h and 4.46 mu g/ml at 48 h. SEC was produced at 952.6 ng/ml after 24 h and 7.2 mu g/ml at 48 h. SEE reached 124.1 ng/ml after 24 h and 191.6 ng/ml at 48 h of culture. SEH production reached 4.36 mu g/ml at 24 h and 5.42 mu g/ml at 48 h of culture. Thirty-nine spa types were identified among S. aureus isolates. The most prevalent spa types were t091 and t1181, followed by t4735 and t742, t3380 and t127. Twelve new spa types, i.e., t20572-t20583 were identified. The wild boar S. aureus population was shown to contain previously identified animal/human-associated spa types and spa types not identified in humans or animals. We also indicate that wildlife animals can be a significant reservoir of see-positive S. aureus.

AB  - Timber extraction is one of the most widespread human activities in forested environments, and subsequent environmental degradation and impacts on wildlife have been extensively studied. Reduced impact logging under certification standards could help reconcile forest production with biodiversity conservation. However, whether this is a convenient strategy for the conservation of the medium and large-sized mammal assemblage of the Argentine Austral Yungas remains unknown. Here, we compared species richness, diversity and composition, sign frequency and species identity of medium and large mammals considering body mass and trophic guilds, as well as three mammal-plant interactions (seedling trampling, plant browsing and fruit removal) between an area under logging certification and a similar unlogged area (control). Our results indicate that, 3-4 years after logging stopped, 16 of the 32 variables analyzed showed no changes between the logged area and the control (species composition, richness and 2 diversity indices, frequency of herbivores and omnivores, frequency of 7 species, browsing rate in the 2 lowest strata and trampling rate). In the logged area, we found a higher frequency of medium-sized mammals and 5 mammals species, a higher browsing rate in the upper stratum and a higher fruit removal rate. However, we also found a lower frequency of carnivores, large mammals, and of six mammal species. Although in our study we found certain species-specific differences, with a predominance of generalist species and certain reduced biological interactions in the logged compared to the unlogged area, we propose that forest intervention under responsible management may help to conserve a significant proportion of medium and large-sized mammal diversity of the Argentine Austral Yungas. Effective forest management, which balances the conservation of natural resources with sustainable use, is a crucial solution to preserving biodiversity. Both environmental and governmental organizations should prioritize and support this approach as a way to mitigate deforestation and promote responsible use of our forests.

AB  - Simple Summary The Montado is a characteristic ecosystem of the Mediterranean region, where agricultural activities, animal production and forestry coexist alongside tourism, hunting and leisure activities. Animal grazing is fundamental for the conservation of the Montado, and it is imperative to clearly understand its interactions with the pasture floristic composition (PFC) of the Montado. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sheep grazing, stocking rates and dolomitic limestone application on the floristic composition of permanent dryland pastures, in the Montado agroforestry system of Southern Portugal. The type of grazing influences the PFC, which may be positively or negatively impacted, depending on the adopted system. Deferred grazing seems to benefit the disappearance of undesirable plants and the appearance of desired plants. The results of this study allow for more informed management decisions and a potential increase in animal production but also improve the knowledge of conservation strategies in the Montado. The Montado is a complex agroforestry-pastoral ecosystem due to the interactions between soil-pasture-trees-animals and climate. The typical Montado soil has an acidic pH and manganese toxicity, which affect the pasture's productivity and pasture floristic composition (PFC). The PFC, on the other hand, can also be influenced by the type and intensity of grazing, which can lead to significant decreases in the amount of biomass produced and the biodiversity of species in the pasture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of grazing type, by sheep, and different stocking rates on the PFC throughout the vegetative pasture cycle in areas with and without dolomitic limestone application. Thus, four treatments (P1UC to P4TC) were constituted: P1UC-without limestone application (U) and continuous grazing (CG); P2UD-U and deferred grazing (DG); P3TD-with the application of limestone (T) and DG; P4TC-T and CG. In DG plots, the placement and removal of the animals were carried out as a function of the average height of the pasture (placement-10 cm; removal-3 to 5 cm). The PFC was characterized in winter, at the peak of spring and in late spring. The PFC data were subjected to a multilevel pattern analysis (ISA). The combination of rainfall and temperature influenced the pasture growth rates and consequently the height of the pasture at different times of the year. Therefore, with the different growth rates of the pasture throughout the year, the sheep remain for different periods of time in the deferred grazing treatments. In the four treatments, 103 plant species were identified. The most representative botanical families in the four treatments were Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. ISA identified 14 bioindicator species: eight for the winter period, three for the late spring vegetative period and three for the TC treatment.

AB  - Insects attracted to cadavers can be used to estimate postmortem interval (PMI). In this study, inmature stages and adults of Dermestes maculatus and Chrysomya albiceps were collected in association with a human cadaver in a closed aquatic environment in Caqueta, Colombia, and analyzed to determine the PMI. We also conducted an experiment with a pig carcass to estimate the emersion time, which began three days after carcass submersion. The minimum PMI was 481.5 hours. Time of death, time of emersion and period of insect activity matched the actions of the murder suspects, who confessed to murdering the victim 25 days prior to the discovery of the body.

AB  - Sea urchins have important effects on marine ecosystems such as rocky shores and coral reefs across the world. However, species diversity and molecular phylogeny of most echinoid taxa are poorly known in Iran. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of one of the most abundant species of the genus Echinometra in the Persian Gulf were examined. Echinoids were collected from the intertidal zone of Qeshm Island and Lengeh Port on March and December 2017. Morphological criteria based on valid identification keys combined with molecular analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) protein-coding gene were used to delineate Echinometra species. Our analyses showed that all specimens (N = 15) belong to Echinometra sp. EZ. Tree topologies indicated that our individuals from two sampling sites formed a distinct monophyletic clade with E. sp. EZ, demonstrating high support values. This is the first phylogenetic analysis of E. sp. EZ from Iran.

AB  - Managing game species can require balancing multiple social and conservation goals. For many game species, including white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), harvest is the primary tool for management of population abundance. Hunter interest in harvesting older male deer has encouraged managers to find ways to protect younger deer and recruit them into older age classes. Antler point restrictions (APRs) that protect some yearling antlered deer from harvest can be implemented to increase the availability of older, larger-antlered deer for hunters. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) implemented mandatory APRs in 2 adjacent areas of the state, one beginning in 2005 and the other in 2012. We predicted that APRs would decrease the proportion of yearling antlered deer in the harvest. We also predicted that APRs might result in an increase in the harvest of antlerless deer and harvest success on Deer Management Permits (DMPs), which are permits issued by the DEC that allow harvest of antlerless deer and are used to manage deer population size. We collected harvest information during 2003-2016 from the 2 areas with APRs and from adjacent areas that did not have APRs. The proportion of yearlings in the harvest was initially 51% and 58% in the 2005 and 2012 APR areas, respectively, and declined to 13% and 19% respectively after 5 years. Antler point restrictions did not affect the harvest of antlerless deer or DMP success. Although APRs successfully reduced the proportion of yearlings in the antlered harvest, we also observed a smaller decline (from 62% to 45%) over the same time period in the proportion of yearlings in the harvest in areas adjacent to the 2005 APR.

AB  - Smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus Rafinesque) are a large-bodied fish highly valued and commercially exploited across most of their range. Despite this, relatively little is known of their population demographics compared to other exploited species. To fill these knowledge gaps, we analyzed two independent long-term datasets (30 and 57 years, respectively) and population demographic data (age structure, growth, mortality, age at maturity, and recruitment) from multiple pools of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) and Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Long-term data (30-year dataset) generally show downward trends or significant declines in catch per unit effort in the UMRS, while the 57-year dataset shows a stable trend or a significant increase in the Illinois River. The oldest smallmouth buffalo were estimated to be 39 years old, with nearly every pool sampled having individuals estimated to exceed 30 years of age. Except for Pool 13 of the UMRS, 90% of smallmouth buffalo were estimated to mature between 411 and 470 mm in length or between 8.7 and 11.2 years old. Recruitment was variable: strong year classes were generally preceded by multiple years of weak year classes. Our results indicate that the smallmouth buffalo population may be stable in portions of the UMRS and Illinois River systems, but significant declines in the northern extent of the UMRS may warrant conservation concern. Recent research into ages of buffalofishes shows that consideration should be given to the idea that the UMRS population could be age truncated. Results also emphasize the importance of long-term data and the ability to show changes in exploited populations over time.

FX  - The previously published works on smallmouth buffalo remain a very valuable component of the literature. The intention of this document is not to imply that any of these studies were poorly done or may be incorrect. On the contrary, these previous studies set the stage for current work being done and used the best technology and sampling techniques accepted at the time. This study also highlights the value of long-term data and the multi-agency collaborations that implement them: without long-term datasets such as the LTRM and the five-state footprint of its field stations and the Illinois-based LTEF program, this project would not have been possible at such a vast spatial scale (nine pools stretched over 1300 miles of a navigable river) of a large river system. We thank all past and present UMRR-LTRM and LTEF staff and technicians for their dedicated years of LTRM and LTEF data collection and especially thank the dedicated technicians of the Illinois River Biological Station for assistance with processing all fishes and otoliths for this study. We thank A. Lackmann for initial guidance with ageing fishes.

AB  - Sampling method decisions are critical for the effective monitoring and management of fisheries. Deploying the most effective sampling methodologies is particularly important when responding to new invasive species, where early response efforts have the best chances for eradication. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the invasive Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is sampled using boat electrofishing and the combination method of boat electrofishing within and around a trammel net enclosure. We conducted a field study to compare the effectiveness of the two methods. We used capture data for surrogate taxa (i.e., Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and buffalo Ictiobus spp.) to compare the two methods because few Grass Carp were collected during the study. The sampling methods were compared within an occupancy modeling framework using an information-criteria model selection approach to evaluate seven alternative models. The base model included sampling method, year, water temperature, and sampling effort as covariates in the detection submodel and assumed that occupancy probability was constant across sites. The other six models built on the base model by including site, water body type (i.e., lentic vs. lotic), and interaction covariates in the detection submodel. The top-performing model, built on the base model, accounted for the influence of water body type and assumed the exchangeability of site effects in the detection submodel. The results indicated that the detection probabilities for both taxa were higher for the combination method than for boat electrofishing, with a median estimated difference in detection probability between the two methods of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.04-0.22) for Common Carp and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08-0.28) for buffalo. Given that the combination method was more effective for detecting the surrogate taxa, we expect the combination method may be preferable to only boat electrofishing for Grass Carp removal.

AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of a region of mitochondrial cox-1 as a DNA barcode marker sequence ofGazella subgutturosa (goitered gazelle) in Mongolia. Gazella subgutturosa, a vulnerable species, is threatened by illegal hunting for meat and sport. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox-1) is used as a DNA marker to distinguish mammalian species for the investigation of illegal hunting. In this study, we sequenced a part of the cox-1 gene (709 bp) of six Mongolian G. subgutturosa individuals. Our DNA sequences were clustered in a clade of Gazella which is distinct from other clades of mammalian species in the phylogenetic tree. Our findings suggest that DNA sequences can be useful in the investigation of illegal hunting.

AB  - Extensive and dense macroalgal fields can compromise the ecosystem function of habitat mosaics on reefs owing to their limiting effect on patch connectivity. Macroalgae can maintain and increase their dominance with effective self-reinforcing feedback mechanisms. For example, macroalgae can form dense beds, supressing coral settlement and grazing by herbivores. This compromised ecosystem function can lead to major socioeconomic and ecological changes.
   Dense macroalgal beds were shaded with submerged shade sails of two sizes and changes to the underlying benthos and feeding rates of herbivorous fishes were recorded. The shade sails reduced the algae's ability to photosynthesize by 29%. After 6 weeks, macroalgal cover was reduced by 24% under small sails and by 51% under large sails. Small shade sails reduced turf algal growth by 23%, while large sails reduced growth by 82%.
   Three months after removal of the shade sails, algal beds had almost completely regrown. During this regrowth period, herbivore bites taken from the experiment's substrates were recorded, with grazing impact reducing significantly with time.
   This study is the first to achieve macroalgal reduction via the alteration of the light regime. While macroalgae regrew in this relatively short-term experiment, shading may be a viable reef management approach that aims to maximize habitat mosaics on coral reefs, particularly if used in combination with other intervention methods.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of herbivore habitat use is important for understanding ecological processes and ecosystem management. Past research has mainly focused on explaining herbivore habitat selection, to the extent that environmental variables driving habitat selection can be considered well researched. However, little is known about how environmental variables contribute to patterns of foraging site revisitation, even though revisited sites might represent sites of ecological significance. The increasing elephant population in South Africa is causing a decline in woody species, necessitating insight into elephant habitat use to improve the management of areas in which they occur. This study aimed to gain insight into the spatial patterns of foraging site revisitations by the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). To achieve this, the non-randomness of the spatial locations of revisited sites in terms of their environmental conditions was assessed. Next, the relations between these environmental variables and the revisitation rate per site were analysed. Lastly, a model was constructed to assess which environmental variables had the largest effect on site revisitations. Ten years of GPS tracking data of elephants in the Greater Kruger Area, South Africa, was used. Environmental variables were obtained from existing data sources. The data were analysed with Kolmogorov tests and linear mixed effects models, using AIC-based model selection. The results indicate that elephants select revisitation sites close to water and at intermediate slopes. Cows also selected revisitation sites with intermediate phosphorus concentrations. Yet, elephants revisited sites at intermediate distances from water and higher phosphorus concentrations more frequently. Moreover, phosphorus is the most important environmental variable influencing the revisitation rate. This study shows that analysing revisitation patterns gives valuable insight into how animals use specific sites within their home range, as the environmental covariates related to the selection of the revisitation sites differ from those related to the revisitation rate.

AB  - Background and aims Grazing drives carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics of grasslands through livestock trampling, defoliation, and excretion. Still, the responses of N uptake by plant species and simultaneous C allocation into the soil to grazing intensity remain unclear.
   Methods In-situ (NH4+)-N-15 / (NO3-)-N-15 and C-13-CO2 labeling experiment was conducted in Inner Mongolia grasslands under 5 years of grazing with no, light (4 sheep 1.33 ha(-1)) and heavy (12 sheep 1.33 ha(-1)) intensity to reveal the contribution of plant-derived C into the soil and the fate of N on day one and three after C-13-labeling. Experiment had a completely randomized design (n=3), and every plot included Leymus chinensis, Carex korshinskyi, Cleistogenes squarrosa, and Stipa grandis.
   Results Grazing increased plants' total N uptake compared to control (no grazing); higher NO3- uptake was found compared to NH4+ (aboveground: 0.40-20.78 vs. 0.32-6.58 mu g N m(-2); belowground: 0.04-9.92 vs. 0.01-0.49 mu g N m(-2)), irrespective of grazing intensity. C. korshinskyi showed the highest N uptake (3-21 mu g N m(-2)) under the three grazing intensities. C-13-CO2 assimilation was the lowest under heavy grazing (aboveground: 1.06-10.67 mg C m(-2); belowground: 0.25-1.53 mg C m(-2)) regardless of plant species. C-13-CO2 assimilation by L. chinensis and C. squarrosa decreased 3-5 times with grazing intensity. Grazing increased C-13-SOC irrespective to soil depth compared to no grazing.
   Conclusions Grazing patterns affected the plants' total assimilation C capacity and N uptake and the response varies among plant species, as well as the allocation of plant-C transfer into the soil.

AB  - Understanding how prey abundance affects carnivore species' abundance in sites is critical for the conservation of both prey species and carnivore species. However, research on the effects of prey species on multiple carnivore species in a human dominated landscape in the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia is largely untested. Our central premise was that the abundance of carnivores varies with potential prey abundance in different sites. To test this, we divided the study area into 15 grid cells (2 km x 2 km) and installed a camera trap in each grid for four seasons between 2020 and 2021. The results showed a total of 400 photographs of eight carnivore species, of which white-tailed mongoose and common genet were the most common, while leopards were the rarest. Except for the leopard, the record frequencies of all species varied significantly between camera stations. The Shannon diversity index and evenness index of carnivores for the study area were 1.868 and 0.809, respectively. A total of 28 prey species were identified, of which 13 were birds and 15 were mammals. Overall, the record frequency of prey species was 801, of which 288 were birds and 513 were mammals. Primates and medium-sized ungulates were the most abundant species among prey groups. Medium ungulates and large birds both had a significant positive relationship with carnivore abundance, and they contributed to 76.92% of the carnivore abundance in sites. The community structure analysis showed African civet, common genet, leopard, spotted hyena and white-tailed mongoose were positively correlated with medium ungulates and large bird prey groups. A species-specific model showed the spotted hyena prefers areas with a high abundance of both large and medium ungulates, while the other species mainly prefer areas with medium ungulates and/or large birds. Our findings support the importance of prey groups' abundance for carnivore conservation in the human-dominated rural landscape of the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia

AB  - Investigator disturbance while monitoring seabirds can result in lower survival rates and breeding success, leaving lasting negative impacts on the population and biasing observations. For example, monitoring rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) and other burrowing alcids can reduce breeding success or even survival through handling stress and damage to nesting habitat. For this reason, researchers must seek to decrease colony disturbance. Automated radio-frequency identification (RFID) via passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags is an inexpensive and reliable way to identify individual presence and record attendance behaviour, avoiding the need to recapture seabirds or visit the colony frequently. PIT tags either can be implanted subcutaneously or attached externally to leg bands, but it is unclear which method causes lower disturbance. To examine the impact of PIT tagging on rhinoceros auklets nesting in artificial burrows on Middleton Island, Alaska, we monitored burrow entrances with automated recording RFID readers to collect presence and nest attendance data. PIT-tagged (either band attachment or subcutaneous implant) and control birds had similar breeding success and chick growth rates. Breeding success was similar between nests with one or two parents marked. Birds tagged externally were detected less often than birds marked with a subcutaneous implant. We conclude that PIT tagging of rhinoceros auklets is a relatively non-invasive method for seabird monitoring, and that subcutaneous implants do not cause more disturbance than external attachment.

AB  - Tropical tree-climbing lianas form paths that benefit foraging of dominant ants which might protect the host tree against herbivores. In contrast, lianas are often associated with negative effects on growth and reproduction of host trees due to light obstruction, structural stress and other negative effects. It is unclear if dominant ants could mitigate the negative effects of lianas on host plants. We investigated how lianas and carton nest ants (Azteca chartifex) affected herbivory and reproductive structures of the host tree Byrsonima sericea. Considering 68 trees, almost half of them were naturally colonized by A. chartifex nests (32 trees). We removed lianas from half of the trees (34), establishing a factorial sampling design between A. chartifex and liana presence. We sampled ants and leaf herbivory before and after removing lianas, and measured plant fitness in two consecutive years after removing lianas. Liana removal had no effect on A. chartifex foraging, on leaf herbivory and flower-fruit conversion of host plants. However, A. chartifex decreased leaf herbivory and increased B. sericea flower-fruit conversion irrespective of lianas presence. A noticeable positive effect of ants was detected only in the second year of the experiment, consistently on all plants at each experimental level. The reproductive conditions of the first year resulted in most plants with more than 75% flower-to-fruit conversion success, regardless of the presence of A. chartifex, a success sustained only on those ant-colonized plants in the second year. Our results contribute to understanding multi-trophic interactions in tropical forest canopies as we demonstrated i) that dominant arboreal ants can benefit plants even in a non-obligatory interaction and ii) that the influence of lianas on its host tree is context-dependent, presenting even neutral effects depending on habitat type and species involved.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Small abandoned mining areas of Fe and Mn oxides located in the Portuguese sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW of Europe) have been converted into agrosilvopastoral systems with very few environmental management measures after their closure. Although at the landscape scale, no visible differences were observed between the former mining intervention areas and adjacent areas, it is essential to assess the state and environmental risk of the soil-plant system, especially in the herbaceous pastures grazed by domestic animals. This was carried out in the Ferragudo mining area, where an agrosilvopastoral system, composed of holm oak and dryland pasture, had been established after the closure of the mine at approximate to 45 years. The soils presented neutral pH and variable fertility degree. The pseudo-total soil concentrations of Cu, Mo, and Zn exceeded the Portuguese limit values established for agriculture use (>180 mg Cu/kg; >8.2 mg Mo/kg; 349 mg Zn/kg), but their soil available fractions were small (<8.4% of the pseudo-total concentrations). Trees and herbaceous plants showed good development, and the concentrations of the elements (except Mn) were considered normal or sufficient. For Mn, most of the plant samples exceeded phytotoxic Mn values, but no visual signs of phytotoxicity were observed. Only the concentrations of Fe and K in the shoots of some herbaceous samples exceeded the maximum tolerable levels for cattle and sheep, so the risk to animals can be considered small since other sources are present in animal feed. In general, this agrosilvopastoral system did not pose a significant environmental risk.

AB  - The herbivorous mud skipper, Boleophthalmus pectinirostris and carnivorous eel goby, Odontamblyopus lacepedii are important species in the mudflat ecosystem of the Ariake Sea (Japan). To gain basic knowledge of the ecological and fishery applications of the Ariake tidal flat, an important wetland area, the microbiota of the mudflat and gut contents of B. pectinirostris and O. lacepedii were analysed using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The amplicon sequence variant numbers in the mud and gut of B. pectinirostris and O. lacepedii were 1200, 110, and 140, respectively. The Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity indices of the fish contents were several-fold lower than those of the mud. In mud, Exiguobacteraceae (20%), followed by Anaerolineae (13%), were identified as the predominant bacterial families. In B. pectinirostris gut, Mycoplasmoidaceae (45%) were predominant, followed by Vibrionaceae (28%). In O. lacepedii gut, Desulfovibrionaceae (17%), Brevinemataceae (Spirochaetota) (15%), Vibrionaceae (14%), and Ruminococcaceae (10%) were dominant. These results suggest that, among the wide variety of bacteria in a mud environment, only compatible bacteria can settle in the fish gut. The differences between the two fish species may be due to differences in feeding habitat. The roles of Mycoplasmoidaceae and Brevinemataceae in their hosts are subjects of future research.

AB  - Assessing the geographic distribution and abundance of invasive species is critical for developing sound management and/or eradication policies. Ecological niche modeling approaches that make implicit assumptions about the biology and the effect of aggregate weather are commonly used to predict the potential distribution of invasive species based on their recorded distribution. An alternative approach is weather-driven physiologically based demographic modeling (PBDM), which explicitly incorporates the mathematical description of the observed biology, including trophic interactions, to predict the temporal phenology and dynamics of the species across wide geographic areas. The invasive weed yellow starthistle (YST) (Centaurea solstitialis; Asteraceae) and its interactions with annual grasses and herbivorous biological control agents are used to demonstrate the PBDM approach for analyzing complex invasive species problems. The PBDM predicts the distribution and relative abundance of YST across the western United States, and the results are used to assess climatic effects of temperature, rainfall, competition from grasses and the efficacy of biocontrol efforts including the introduction of a root-feeding weevil to control YST in North America. The model could also include direct effects of rising carbon dioxide levels on YST developmental biology.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the food sources of benthic macroinvertebrates in the arid mangrove of the Persian Gulf. Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values were analyzed for the 23 species and their potential food sources to examine the seasonal variation in the contribution of different potential food sources to macroinvertebrates. Primary food sources, e.g., mangrove leaves, microphytobenthos, sediment organic matter, and particulate organic matter, showed a wide range of delta C-13 values ranging between -28.07 and -13.54 parts per thousand and delta N-15 from 1.44 to 10.72 parts per thousand. The wide range of the isotopic composition of consumers indicated that different food sources are important in the mangrove ecosystem of the Persian Gulf. The grazers tended to be more C-13-depleted than other feeding groups at both sampling seasons. In contrast, predators had significantly high delta C-13, reflecting their carnivorous feeding habit of consuming C-13-enriched foods. The higher delta C-13 values of suspension feeders reflected the significant role of re-suspended microphytobenthos in the benthic-pelagic coupling of the mangrove ecosystem. The Bayesian stable isotope mixing model outputs suggested that the benthic food webs are supported by multiple primary sources. Microphytobenthos contribution was greater (> 40%), indicating their significant ecological role in structuring the food web of the arid mangroves. While sediment and particulate organic matter sources are involved in sustaining deposit feeders and partially suspension feeders, respectively, the mangrove-derived carbon played a significant role in maintaining herbivorous crabs.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes are a key functional group in coral reef ecosystems and have been the focus of a vast body of research. While substantial progress has been made in research, challenges persist, especially in respect to quantifying patterns versus processes. Despite this challenge being recognised over 40 years ago. To help clarify such challenges, and work towards solutions, in this perspective we explore how the definition of 'herbivorous reef fishes' precludes an easy translation between patterns of herbivore abundance and the process of herbivory. Indeed, if herbivorous fishes are defined as, a fish in which the diet is predominantly based on plant material, then this encompasses a diverse suite of fishes which all remove primary producers to varying extents and have markedly different impacts on reef functioning. Given this situation, we explore how our approaches to directly quantifying herbivory on reefs have progressed. We highlight how lessons learnt from macroalgal assays could be applied to the direct quantification of herbivory from algal turfs in the epilithic algal matrix (EAM); a community of primary producers that are invariably difficult to work with and quantify. Nevertheless, given the abundance of turfs on coral reefs, and their relative importance in herbivore dynamics, widespread process-based assessment of EAM herbivory represents an avenue for expanding future research. Recognising the difficulty of translating patterns in herbivore abundance to the process of herbivory, and an enhanced focus on EAM herbivory, will be necessary to comprehensively quantify the process of herbivory on Anthropocene coral reefs.

AB  - The Payment for Forest Ecosystem Services (PFES) policy in Vietnam is a multi -objective policy that aims to both protect forests and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local people. As such, to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy, we are facing the problem of multi -criteria decision -making (MCDM). The objectives of this paper are to assess PFES at a community level through the application of the TOPIS model to solve an MCDM problem and examine factors correlating to the effectiveness of the policy. The study is conducted in the Northwest regions of Vietnam. Using TOPSIS model and fuzzy entropy to create a single aggregation score measuring the policy outcomes, this paper has ranked the level of PFES effectiveness in studied villages and identified factors that significantly correlate to this policy's effectiveness at the grass -root level. Among the interesting factors, cash payments, community involvement, and the transparency of PFES implementation are the most important ones that determine PFES's success.

AB  - Resource selection in sexually dimorphic ungulates is at least partially explained by sex-specific resource requirements and risk aversion strategies. Females generally spend more time in areas with less risk and abundant, high-quality forage due to their smaller body size. However, demographically variable responses to risk are context dependent, and few have concurrently quantified male and female behavior within areas with the same resource base. We captured 111 (54 males, 57 females) adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from 2009 to 2018 on a site in South Carolina, USA, where hunters were the primary source of adult mortality. We fit each deer with a GPS collar programmed to collect locations at 30-min intervals. Upon collar recovery, we analyzed the data to estimate sex- and time-specific selection for, and distance to, various cover types. While both sexes generally avoided risky areas (i.e., sites hunted more frequently) during the day, females (p = .41) were more likely than males (p = .16) to use risky areas containing abundant food resources during the day, where p = probability of selection. Our findings indicate that female white-tailed deer may be forced to utilize high risk areas during high risk periods due to their smaller body size and increased nutritional demands, whereas larger males are better able to forgo foraging opportunities during risky periods to mitigate risk; however, our study design left room for the possibility that our observations were driven by innate sex-specific patterns in white-tailed deer. Nonetheless, our study contributes information to the literature by describing sex-specific resource selection by diel period on a site where sexes shared the same resources and were presented with the same landscape of risk.

AB  - Fragmented landscapes are a mosaic of ecosystems containing diverse communities of plants and herbivorous arthropods. Plant responses to fire in fire-prone ecosystems are well documented, but less is known about how plant-herbivorous arthropod interactions respond to fires. This study compared the responses of plant communities and their interactions with herbivorous arthropods to fire in a highly fragmented fire-prone glade system. Due to the mosaic landscape of the study site, three habitat types were chosen to delineate communities based on plant species composition, geology, and proximity to each other: small enclosed glade, large open glade, mixed hardwood forest, and pine savanna. From 2016-2019, we observed the interspecific interactions between plant and arthropod communities in the Ketona dolomitic glades of Bibb County in central Alabama. We identified plants to genus or species and recorded evidence of herbivory by seven herbivore guilds of arthropods. We used non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling and Analysis of Similarity to determine patterns of change between the habitats and across years for both plant species and interactions with herbivorous arthropods. Plant communities return to pre-burn species diversity within two years. Plant community composition was grouped strongly by habitat type and year, while interactions with herbi-vorous arthropods were homogenous across habitats but grouped strongly by year. Tracking herbi-vorous arthropod guilds using plant association evidence is useful for rapidly and temporally determining overall responses in herbivorous arthropod guild composition. However, it is too coarse to determine changes and responses in herbivorous arthropod guild composition at finer spatial scales.

AB  - Common eland bulls are important game ranching animals in southern Africa, for tourism, breeding/live sales, trophy hunting, and game meat production. Interest has grown in their production potential, intensifying animal husbandry and breeding approaches. However, little scientific information is available regarding the intensive management of this species, including information regarding scientifically based selection criteria for breeding bulls. Often, simple phenotypic traits are utilised unless high-value game animals are being bred, with horn and body size often being the only traits considered for breeding bulls. This study provides basic information about the reproductive tract morphology, symmetry, and their relationships with secondary sexual traits, social rank, and temperament in common eland. Six eland males (2-2.5 years old; 203 +/- 20 kg) were utilised for the study. Social rank, body weight and body condition score, temperament score, and horn size were determined before the animals were culled, and their reproductive tracts were collected for morphometric and histological evaluation. Results indicate relatively low asymmetry in bilateral reproductive tract components. Individual traits of eland bulls such as age, body weight, and social rank correlated the development of some testicular morphologies and thus may possibly be used in zoos, game ranching, and commercial production for the selection of breeding males, but not temperament and horn length, which should be carefully evaluated. Whilst this study provides baseline information from a limited sample size, further studies should incorporate the assessment of testicular hemodynamics, as well as the effects of factors such as season and androgen secretion patterns over a wider age range of common eland males and populations to provide further information for the management practices of breeding common eland bulls.

AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity conservation. However, it experienced dramatic changes in lake inundation due to recent climate change and human activities, causing ecological and economic problems. Here, we applied a multiple-index water detection rule to integrated Landsat and MODIS products to reconstruct surface water series at 30-m and 8-day resolutions and quantified the spatiotemporal inundation dynamics in Poyang Lake over the past 20 years (2000-2019). Furthermore, their influences on habitat suitability for herbivorous birds were also assessed from the perspectives of hydroperiod and vegetation growth threshold. The significant declining trend (-26.66 km(2) yr(-1), p < 0.001) for the annual minimum water areas throughout the 20 years implied that Poyang Lake was undergoing a continuous shrinkage in the low-water season. On the monthly scale, inundation frequency (IF) decreases were more significant in September-January, most of which occurred in the alluvial delta zones near the lake center. The altered water regime after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) might be the dominant contributor responsible for the continuous lake shrinkage during the recent low-water period. The sub-lakes suffered from spring drought rather than winter drought, triggering vegetation successions regarding the reversed trend of the well-documented xerophilization in Poyang Lake. The recent earlier and prolonged dry seasons caused an increase of suitable habitat for herbivorous birds (13.92 km(2) year(-1), p < 0.1), but triggered a potential risk of food quality degradation when the migratory waterbirds peaked in December. These results provide a clear reference for optimizing the hydrologic management and biodiversity conservation of Poyang Lake.

AB  - Galls and gall-inducing insect inventories have allowed us to understand patterns of species richness and differential distribution, and to map interactions between gall-inducing insects and host plants in different Brazilian biomes. Since the first formal inventory of gall- inducing insects, conducted in 1988 by Fernandes and collaborators in the Cerrado biome in Minas Gerais, studies on this topic have continued to increase. Over the past 35 years, there have been 64 inventories in over 185 locations, spanning 114 municipalities in 18 states across the five regions of Brazil, and involving 97 researchers. Despite the advances in recent decades, between 1988 and 2023, there has not been a significant increase in the number of publications. This is mainly due to the decrease in the number of papers published in the last years (2014-2023). We constructed a co-authorship network that shows some authors as important hubs in collaborations between researchers and institutions; however, some still exhibit low penetration and integration in the research network. The results showed that (i) there is a predominance of studies in southeast Brazil, in which predominates the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado; (ii) gall-inducing insects are abundant in any environment but dominant in sclerophyll conditions; (iii) gall-inducing insect richness is positively associated with host plant species richness; (iv) Fabaceae is the richest host family; and (v) Cecidomyiidae (Diptera) are the main gall inducers. In Brazil, 284 species of cecidomyiids, most of which induce gall formation, have been recorded. The majority of species have been described in the Atlantic Forest (184), followed by the Cerrado (70) and the Amazon Forest (31). However, it is important to note that there may be bias in the distribution of knowledge and a significant taxonomic gap that needs to be addressed. These results provide valuable insights for future research.

AB  - Snow is a major, climate-sensitive feature of the Earth's surface and catalyst of fundamentally important ecosystem processes. Understanding how snow influences sentinel species in rapidly changing mountain ecosystems is particularly critical. Whereas effects of snow on food availability, energy expenditure, and predation are well documented, we report how avalanches exert major impacts on an ecologically significant mountain ungulate - the coastal Alaskan mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). Using long-term GPS data and field observations across four populations (421 individuals over 17 years), we show that avalanches caused 23-65% of all mortality, depending on area. Deaths varied seasonally and were directly linked to spatial movement patterns and avalanche terrain use. Population-level avalanche mortality, 61% of which comprised reproductively important prime-aged individuals, averaged 8% annually and exceeded 22% when avalanche conditions were severe. Our findings reveal a widespread but previously undescribed pathway by which snow can elicit major population-level impacts and shape demographic characteristics of slow-growing populations of mountain-adapted animals.
   Snow avalanches-a direct physical process-represent a major source of mortality and comprise a previously undescribed pathway by which climate-linked mechanisms impact demographics of slow-growing populations of mountain-adapted animals.

AB  - Simple Summary We evaluated the effectiveness of antlerless sika deer culling on sika deer population dynamics, based on the population trends in response to spatial variation of antlerless proportion in imposed culls. Deer populations tended to decrease in areas of higher antlerless culling, while they increased in areas of lower antlerless culling, suggesting that a high proportion of antlerless culling can effectively decrease the deer population. Because increasing large herbivore populations have caused environmental damage around the world, antlerless-biased culling could be a crucial measure to manage overabundant populations of herbivores. Increasing populations of large herbivores have caused environmental damage around the world, and it is necessary to improve population management strategies. Culling is a traditional management method. Antlerless deer proportions, consisting of adult female deer and fawn in Cervidae in wildlife statistics, are directly related to population increases; thus, the culling-based removal of individuals from habitats and the removal of these antlerless individuals by game hunting and nuisance control might be effective approaches for reducing population sizes. We evaluated the effectiveness of antlerless culling on 17-year density trends in the sika deer (Cervus nippon) population across an area of 1175 km(2) in Fukuoka Prefecture (Japan). In 11 out of 47 grids (area measuring 5 by 5 km), the densities of sika deer tended to decline; meanwhile, in the remaining 36 grids, the densities increased. These density trends were explained by changes in the proportion of antlerless culling, as the densities declined with increasing proportions of antlerless deer. The results affirm the theory that antlerless culling is effective in population management; it is posited that antlerless-biased culling could be a crucial measure in managing overabundant populations of herbivores, contributing to more effective conservation of forest environments.

AB  - Data on movement of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in island systems is largely restricted to coastal environments and little is known about their space use and movement in freshwater archipelagos. We used data from a GPS-collared wolf in a protected archipelago in Lake Superior, Ontario to examine broad seasonal patterns in space use, movement, and activity. Over approximately 1 y of monitoring, the wolf made 190 crossings between islands and showed more extensive use of the archipelago during the nonwinter season. When ice was present in the archipelago, the mean weekly inter-island crossing rate of the wolf (6 SE) was 6.08 +/- 1.31, with crossings largely restricted to the interior islands bounded by ice, compared to 2.85 +/- 0.45 during the open water season. Mean wolf activity was highest in the nonwinter season, but movement rates were comparable across seasons. Our study is the first to document wolf movements in a freshwater archipelago with seasonal ice cover and supports data collection at fine temporal scales to better understand trends in wolf space use and movement at small spatial scales.

AB  - Indirect interactions are major forces structuring communities. In terrestrial ecosystems, changes in plant traits caused by herbivory have the potential to mediate cascades of indirect interactions that can profoundly affect community structure. We have begun to understand the mechanisms behind indirect effects mediated by trait changes in plants, but we still know little about how these interaction-level mechanisms affect higher levels of community organization, in particular network structure and how this is dependent on community context. In this study, we aimed to understand how herbivory affects floral traits, flower visitation and the position of plant individuals in a plant-flower visitor network. To do this, we assessed the natural incidence of leaf and flowerhead herbivory in a tropical shrub and tested whether it affects flowerhead density and the interactions between flowers and Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera at the pairwise and network levels. We also tested how the local density of conspecific plants adds context dependency to these interactions by affecting both herbivory and flowerhead visitation in focal plants. Increased leaf herbivory reduced flowerhead density per plant and indirectly reduced flowerhead visitation by Hymenoptera, while for Diptera direct effects of herbivory were important and Lepidoptera were not affected. At the network level, plants with more flowerheads were more connected and central. By reducing flowerhead density, leaf herbivory caused individual plants to lose centrality, becoming less connected and therefore peripheral in the plant-flower visitor network. This dynamic is context dependent as increased plant conspecific local density reduced leaf herbivory in the focal plant and indirectly benefited its flowerhead density, flowerhead visitation and network centrality. Synthesis. We demonstrate how the effects of herbivory on a key plant trait can cascade to shape the interactions between individual plants and their flower visitors and how the indirect effects between herbivores and pollinators can modulate the structure of interaction networks.

Neste estudo, queremos entender como a herbivoria foliar afeta atributos florais, a visita & ccedil;& atilde;o floral e a posi & ccedil;& atilde;o dos indiv & iacute;duos de planta na rede de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o planta-visitante floral. Para fazer isso, avaliamos a incid & ecirc;ncia natural de herbivoria foliar e floral em um arbusto tropical e testamos como isso afeta a densidade de infloresc & ecirc;ncias e a intera & ccedil;& atilde;o das infloresc & ecirc;ncias com Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, e Diptera tanto a n & iacute;vel par-a-par, quanto a n & iacute;vel da rede de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o. N & oacute;s tamb & eacute;m testamos como a densidade local de plantas coespec & iacute;ficas adiciona depend & ecirc;ncia de contexto a essas intera & ccedil;& otilde;es ao afetar a herbivoria foliar e floral. O aumento na herbivoria foliar reduziu a densidade de infloresc & ecirc;ncias por planta e indiretamente reduziu a visita & ccedil;& atilde;o por Hymenoptera, enquanto para Diptera efeitos diretos da herbivoria foram mais importantes e a visita & ccedil;& atilde;o por Lepidoptera n & atilde;o foi afetada. A n & iacute;vel da rede de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o, plantas com mais infloresc & ecirc;ncias foram mais conectadas e centrais. Ao reduzir a densidade de infloresc & ecirc;ncias, a herbivoria foliar fez com que as plantas perdessem centralidade e se tornassem perif & eacute;ricas na rede de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o com visitantes florais. Entretanto, o aumento na densidade de plantas coespec & iacute;ficas reduziu a herbivoria foliar e indiretamente beneficiou a densidade de infloresc & ecirc;ncias, a visita & ccedil;& atilde;o floral e a centralidade dos indiv & iacute;duos de planta na rede de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o. Em s & iacute;ntese, demostramos como efeitos da herbivoria em atributos-chave da planta podem percolar para moldar a intera & ccedil;& atilde;o entre indiv & iacute;duos de plantas e seus visitantes florais, e como os efeitos indiretos entre herb & iacute;voros e polinizadores podem modular a estrutura de redes de intera & ccedil;& atilde;o em ecossistemas baseados em plantas.

AB  - Sustainable regeneration of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is important for maintaining and improving the future resilience and protective capacity of mountain forests in the southern Swiss Alps. However, increasing densities of wild ungulates, such as red and roe deer, can hamper the regeneration success of silver fir. A comprehensive understanding of forest-wildlife interactions is essential to plan concrete measures for improving the adaptation potential of mountain forests. Here, we monitored the dynamics of natural silver fir regeneration in mountain protective forests. This study encompassed 30 unfenced permanent plots across two sites, Lostallo and Soazza, located in Valle Mesolcina in the southern Swiss Alps. These sites were selected for their comparable ecological characteristics related to silver fir regeneration, yet contrasting densities of mature, seed-bearing silver fir trees. We recorded the number of seedlings (<10 cm height) and saplings (10-200 cm height), and repeatedly assessed height growth, frequency, and intensity of ungulate browsing on saplings in the summers 2016, 2019, and 2022. In 2022, we additionally recorded the presence of browsing on other tree species in the unfenced plots and the height growth increments of silver fir saplings in pre-existing fences. On average, 509 silver fir seedlings/ha were present in the study area, but there was a lower density of saplings (382 saplings/ha). Between 2016 and 2022, the browsing frequency on silver fir saplings increased from 33 per cent to nearly 100 per cent, accompanied by a significant rise in browsing intensity. Furthermore, sapling height growth from 2019 to 2022 was significantly reduced or even negative in the unfenced plots as compared to the growth of saplings in the fenced plots. The observed seedling density indicated a good potential for natural regeneration of silver fir, irrespective of the differences in the density of seed-bearing trees between the two sites. However, the increased ungulate browsing impaired successful regeneration in the considered mountain forests in the southern Swiss Alps. Thus, without an effective control of ungulate browsing, silver fir may not be able to substantially contribute to the transition to more resilient and future-proof mountain forests.

AB  - Fowler Lake is a small reservoir atop Cave Mountain at the Buffalo National River in Arkansas, U.S.A. We report on the floristic community at this reservoir in addition to describing large floating vegetation mats that occur in this system and the mechanisms that allow their formation. In 2019, floristic surveys assessed 30 species of hydrophytes and helophytes representing 16 families and 26 genera. In addition to the speciose families Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae, the families Araceae and Polygonaceae were represented by three or more species. Six species observed at Fowler Lake represent new county records. Floristic surveys provide valuable information to assess ecological impacts and management decisions in areas like the Ozark Plateau, where relatively little work has been done on regional aquatic macrophytes. This study represents the first comprehensive floristic survey of Fowler Lake at the Buffalo National River and serves as a reference for continued study of that system and aquatic plants throughout the Ozark Plateau.

AB  - Corales de Profundidad National Natural Park (CPNNP), at the central Colombian Caribbean margin, has an extension of 142.195 ha with depths ranging from 34 to 1,234 m. The CPNNP's essential ecological value is Madracis spp. as potential structure-forming deep-water coral; this work represents the first footages of these unique habitats for the Colombian Caribbean. In 11 sectors, remote video surveys are conducted, based on a detailed digital elevation model. From these sectors, four cover mesophotic zones (46-169m depth), and seven cover aphotic zones (up to 354m depth). After still images' description and interpretation, a guide was generated with nine types of macrohabitats surrounding the coral formations of the CPNNP: soft substrate (mud/sand), soft substrate/ rubble/rock with solitary corals, coral and shell rubble, rock/ledges with attached fauna, rugged stones with attached fauna, hard substrate with attached fauna, sandstone with attached fauna, soft substrate with burrows, and pockmark with attached fauna. Video transect analysis confirms the occurrence of Madracis spp., with coral patches as the main framework builder of the CPNNP. These patches comprise many clumped 50 to 80 cm high coral colonies that developed over slow slopes, with seafloor elevations between 107 and 233 m and textured soils of soft and not very compact ridges, associated with the macrohabitat sandstone with attached fauna. This information is being used for the management and monitoring of this unique protected area.

AB  - Discovering how organisms respond to the combinations of stressors they face in their environment is an enduring challenge for ecologists. A particular focus has been how natural enemies and abiotic stressors faced by plants may interact in their effect on the ecology and evolution of plant defense strategies. Here, we report on the results of an experiment measuring how reproduction in the clonal herbaceous plant horsenettle (Solanum carolinense) is affected by damage by leaf-feeding and by flower-feeding herbivores-as well as how horsenettle's tolerance of these different types of herbivory may be altered by nutrient stress. Leaf herbivory by lace bugs reduced horsenettle's seed production and root growth, and the relative impacts were greater in fertilized than in nutrient-stressed plants. In contrast, simulated-floral herbivory reduced seed production to a similar degree in fertilized and nutrient-stressed plants. However, compensation for floral herbivory through increased root growth occurred to a much greater extent in the fertilized than in the nutrient-stressed plants. These results can be explained in terms of the limiting resource model of plant tolerance, with leaf damage interpreted as exacerbating carbon limitation in the fertilized plants and floral damage ameliorating carbon limitation in the fertilized plants. These results can be extended to predicting patterns in the field: Although plants in a nutrient-poor environment may have overall low fitness, they are likely to be more tolerant of leaf herbivores-though this benefit may be countered by lower tolerance of any floral herbivores that share the environment.

AB  - Symbiotic bacteria play a pivotal role in the biology and ecology of herbivorous insects, affecting host growth and adaptation. However, the effects of host identity on the symbiotic microbiota of gall-inducing insects remain less explored. In this study, we utilized high-throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of different oak hosts on the structure and diversity of the symbiotic microbial community in the asexual larvae of the gall-inducing wasp Trichagalma acutissimae. Host plant species significantly altered the alpha and beta diversity of symbiotic microbiota of T. acutissimae. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria was the predominant microflora in both groups, with significantly higher abundance in larvae parasitizing Quercus acutissima than in those parasitizing Q. variabilis. Pseudomonas, which has been identified as responsible for tannin decomposition, was the most dominant genus in T. acutissimae larvae infesting both hosts. LEfSe analysis revealed substantial differences in the symbiotic microbial communities between the two hosts while also highlighting some commonalities. Functional prediction analysis indicated no significant difference in the functional roles of symbiotic bacteria between larvae infesting the two hosts. These findings suggest that the symbiotic microbiome of T. acutissimae larvae is influenced by host plant species, yet different microbial compositions may perform similar functions, implying the potential role of symbiotic microbiota in the adaptation to high-tannin oak leaves. This research enhances our understanding of the symbiotic relationship between forest pests and their associated microbes.

AB  - Soil-microbe-enzyme C-N-P stoichiometry is a key indicator of nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience. This study examines its response to plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) disturbance in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results demonstrated that plateau pika disturbance significantly enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) by 28.97%, soil total nitrogen (STN) by 8.25%, and soil total phosphorus (STP) by 9.15%. Microbial biomass C (MBC), and N (MBN) increased by 5.60% and 6.30%, respectively. Enzyme activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) were also elevated in disturbed plots compared to undisturbed plots. Soil C:N, C:P ratios, and enzyme N:P ratio were 19.62%, 19.65%, and 4.48% higher, respectively, while MBN: MBP ratio was 21.63% lower in disturbed plots. Additionally, the soil C:N imbalance increased, and C:P homeostasis became weakly homeostatic (H ' = 2.38) under plateau pika disturbance. Moreover, STP and underground biomass were identified as key factors regulating soil-enzyme C-N-P stoichiometry in undisturbed plots, while SOC was the strongest factor associated with microbe C:N:P stoichiometry in disturbed plots. These results indicate that plateau pika disturbance drives a shift in microbial metabolic strategies toward C utilization and progressively transforms alpine meadow soils from N- to P-limitation with increasing disturbance intensity. Therefore, this study proposes targeted N supplementation under low disturbance intensity, whereas P fertilization is recommended under high disturbance intensity to mitigate nutrient limitation.

AB  - Two introduced invasive red macroalgae, Eucheuzna denticulatum (Burman) Collins & Hervey and Gracilaria salicornia C. Ag., progressively declined in abundance in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, following similar to 30 years of increase since their introduction in the mid-1970s. The declines were not the result of biological control or mechanical control efforts, but instead were the result of grazing by native herbivores, probably fishes, as demonstrated by field experiments conducted in 2014 with algal thalli exposed to, and protected from grazing. Two long-term time-series of the abundance of herbivorous fishes at Kane'ohe Bay patch and fringing reef sites indicated that the abundance of herbivorous fishes increased from 2007 through 2014 over the period when these macroalgae declined in cover. Analyses of data of algal cover from surveys of Kane'ohe Bay reefs carried out between 1996 and 2018 indicate that the declines in E. denticulatum and G. salicornia began in approximately 2008, several years before control programs commenced on some of the reefs in the bay. In addition to intense herbivory, high summer water temperatures in 2014 and 2015 may have contributed to the decline in E. denticulatum. Naturally occurring declines in the abundance of alien invasive marine algal species have rarely been reported in the literature. These reductions in macroalgal abundance are the second instance of decline in invasive macroalgae in Kane'ohe Bay since 2006, and have reduced competition between macroalgae and corals on reef flats and reef slopes across the bay.

AB  - Over the past few decades, studies on empirical ecological networks have primarily focused on single antagonistic or mutualistic interactions. However, many species engage in multiple interactions that support distinct ecosystem functions. The architecture of networks integrating these interactions, along with their cascading effects on community dynamics, remains underexplored in ecological research. In this study, we compiled two datasets of empirical plant-herbivore/host-parasitoid (PHP) and pollinator-plant-herbivore (PPH) networks, representing two common types of tripartite networks in terrestrial ecosystems: antagonism-antagonism and mutualism-antagonism. We identified the patterns of subnetwork structures and interconnection properties in these networks and examined their relationships with community stability. Our findings revealed distinct pathway effects of network architecture on persistence and local stability in both PHP and PPH networks, with subnetwork modularity and nestedness showing a few strong direct effects and mediating the indirect effects of subnetwork size and connectance. In PHP networks, subnetwork modularity enhanced persistence and local stability, whereas subnetwork nestedness directly undermined them. However, both subnetwork topologies consistently mediated the destabilizing effects of subnetwork size and connectance on the entire network. In PPH networks, persistence was primarily affected by the plant-herbivore subnetwork, while the size, connectance, and modularity of different subnetworks had opposing effects on local stability. Regarding interconnection properties, the correlation of interaction similarity destabilized PHP networks, whereas the correlation of interaction degree promoted local stability in PPH networks. Further analysis indicated that structure-persistence relationships vary significantly across guilds, and the network-level effects of network architecture can be reversed, negligible, or biased in specific guilds. These findings advance our understanding of how network architecture influences ecosystem stability and underscore the importance of considering multiple interaction types when predicting community dynamics.

AB  - Urbanization is an ongoing global environmental change. Wildlife may respond using anthropized environments and resources, which is known as synurbization, creating human -wildlife interactions. Wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) populations have become common in urban areas, including the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Humans respond to wild boars in urban environments either habituating, with lower conflict perception and higher wild boar acceptance, or sensitizing, with reduced tolerance towards wild boars. Since citizen response influences conflict management, this study analysed the drivers of human responses, which should allow adopting sociallyaccepted measures to manage synurbic wild boar populations. Interviews to 1956 Barcelona citizens were performed, grouping the response variables to score citizen and urban characteristics, as well as citizen layknowledge, emotions, experiences, and perception of wild boar. Five citizen clusters were identified: cluster 1 (3.3 %), highly habituated and active wild boar feeder; cluster 2 (11.3 %), habituated to wild boars with positive feelings; cluster 3 (19.8 %), not habituated nor sensitized, willing to maintain urban wild boar populations; cluster 4 (29.1 %), sensitized and concerned, defending to reduce wild boar; and cluster 5 (40.1 %), highly sensitized and proposing to reduce or even eliminate wild boar. Positive attitudes associated wild boar to aesthetic value, closeness to nature and sympathy, and were more frequent in young citizens with urban background and high education, animal lovers habituated to wild boar through contact without negative experiences. Conversely, negative attitudes were concerned about city fouling, safety or health, accepted lethal management measures, and were more frequent in older citizens with rural background, lower education, low contact with wild boar or sensitized through negative experiences. We document for the first time the sensitization and reciprocal habituation of humans to wild boar in urban areas. The identification of the drivers of citizen attitudes towards urban wildlife should be useful to design socially -accepted management measures.

AB  - Research demonstrates substantial urban consumption of wildmeat and the existence of trade networks in the Brazilian Amazon. Yet rural-urban mobility persists in this urbanized region, with the circulation of people, goods and ideas, blurring boundaries between rural and urban lives. Here we examined the relationships between rural-urban mobility and wildmeat access in highly forested areas of central Brazilian Amazonia. We surveyed 798 urban households in four towns and 311 rural households in 63 riverine communities. Rural-urban mobility was common amongst urban households: 49.7% maintained rural livelihoods and 57.3% were headed by rural in-migrants. Although many urban consumers purchased wildmeat, gifting was equally important. Urban households with greater rural-urban mobility consumed more wildmeat and were less likely to purchase it. Buying wildmeat was rare in rural areas but emergent in larger rural communities. Rural consumption was greater in remote areas, non-floodplain communities and during the high-water season. Urban populations placed particular pressure on three preferred species: the lowland paca Cuniculus paca, tapir Tapirus terrestris and white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari. Rural consumption was more diverse, and per-capita wildmeat consumption was four times greater in rural than urban households (21 vs 5 kg/person/year). Total estimated annual wildmeat consumption was 3,732 t across 43 riverine urban centres compared to 11,351 t in surrounding rural areas. Because of poverty in these towns and socially mediated wildmeat acquisition, it is debatable whether urban consumers should or could be denied access to wildmeat. Nonetheless, the probable future increase in urban demand and related risks to sustainable, equitable resource use necessitate the monitoring and management of rural-urban wildmeat flows.

AB  - The Silver-backed Chevrotain (Tragulus versicolor), a mammal endemic to the unique coastal arid ecosystem in south-central Vietnam, is an enigmatic mouse deer with little information available about its ecology and evolutionary history. The recent rediscovery of the species provides a rare opportunity to clarify its taxonomy and phylogenetic relationship within the genus Tragulus. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for samples of T. versicolor and T. kanchil from Vietnam. Our molecular results show that the species forms a distinct evolutionary lineage sister to all other species in the genus, confirming the earlier hypothesis based on morphological evidence. However, further research is needed to assess the genetic diversity of the species and design appropriate conservation measures. As the species has not been secured over much of its range, it is recommended that the population in Nui Chua National Park, the only one covered by a protected area, be prioritized for conservation actions. Conserving the species in this unique and imperiled ecosystem will also benefits a suite of locally endemic and threatened species of fauna and flora.

AB  - Production of pork based on monoculture cereal-based cropping systems causes sub-stantial environmental pressures and feed-food competition. This study evaluated the environmental consequences of five different scenarios involving inclusion of rotational grass-clover leys and incorporation of grass-clover biomass in pig diets: (1) a conven-tional reference scenario without grass-clover biomass; (2) a conventional scenario with replacement of feed with grass-clover silage in a total mixed ration, i.e., with grass-clover biomass replacing other feed; (3) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage for enrichment purposes only; (4) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage for enrichment purposes and additional grass-clover leys for green manuring; and (5) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage and pasture to replace feed. The functional unit was 1 kg of pork slaughter weight and the system boundary was from cradle to farm gate. We used life cycle assessment, the introductory carbon balance method and human edible feed conversion efficiency to assess the performance of the pig production system. Introducing grass-clover biomass as a total mixed ration in conventional pig diets, reduced the climate impact (-17%), eutrophication (-7.1%), marine eutrophication (-15%), energy use (-13%), and feed-food competition (-20%) per kg of pork meat, while acidification (+2.7%) and land use (+1.5%) were slightly increased compared with the reference. The lower climate impact (without considering soil carbon change) was attributable to reduced fertilizer and diesel needs due to pre-crop effects. Overall, feeding grass-clover biomass decreased several environmental impact categories, feed-food competition and improved cereal-based cropping systems by the introduction of grass-clover leys.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Using two scales, landscape and microhabitat, we analysed the factors determining nest-site and brood-rearing habitat selection in the endangered Canarian Houbara Bustard Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae. We measured vegetation cover and food abundance, presence of human infrastructure, and visibility using a very high-resolution LiDAR-based digital elevation model of the terrain. Houbara females choose nest-sites with abundant arthropod biomass and high vegetation. To rear their brood, they look for substrates with few stones, high species richness, and low density of human infrastructure. These features allow females to hide the nest, themselves and their chicks from predators, reduce anthropogenic disturbance, and secure access to food during the whole breeding process. The less stony ground during brood-rearing allows female and chicks to walk more easily and safely, something that is important in a ground-dwelling bird. This study represents the first detailed analysis of nesting and breeding site selection for this globally threatened subspecies. To minimise disturbance during such a sensitive phase, and considering the major tourist destination in which this species lives, we recommend to restrict vehicle and human traffic in the breeding areas, prohibit new constructions in houbara habitats, and preserve the vegetation and breeding-habitat quality, avoiding the current indiscriminate ploughing of uncultivated fields and limiting goat grazing areas.
   Nistplatzwahl und Bruthabitat der kanarischen Saharakragentrappe: die Bedeutung von Nahrungsangebot und m & ouml;glichen Verstecken.Auf zwei verschiedenen Ebenen-umgebende Landschaft und Mikrohabitat-analysierten wir die Auswahlkriterien, die bei der gef & auml;hrdeten kanarischen Saharakragentrappe Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae f & uuml;r die Wahl des Nistplatzes und des Habitats f & uuml;r die Aufzucht der Jungen ausschlaggebend sind. Hierf & uuml;r erfassten wir mithilfe eines hochaufl & ouml;senden LiDAR-basierten digitalen H & ouml;henmodells die Vegetationsdecke und das Nahrungsangebot, das Vorhandensein menschengemachter Infrastrukturen und die Sichtverh & auml;ltnisse im Gel & auml;nde. Die Weibchen w & auml;hlten Nistpl & auml;tze mit reichhaltiger Arthropoden-Biomasse und hohem Pflanzenbestand. F & uuml;r die Aufzucht ihrer Jungen suchten sie nach B & ouml;den mit wenig Steinen, mit hohem Artenreichtum und mit nur wenig anthropogener Infrastruktur. So k & ouml;nnen die Weibchen das Nest, ihre Jungen und sich selbst vor Raubtieren verstecken, St & ouml;rungen durch den Menschen reduzieren und den Zugang zu Nahrung w & auml;hrend der gesamten Brutzeit sicherstellen. Der steinarme Boden erm & ouml;glicht es Weibchen und K & uuml;ken w & auml;hrend der Aufzucht, leichter und sicherer zu laufen, was f & uuml;r einen bodenbewohnenden Vogel besonders wichtig ist. Diese Untersuchung ist die erste detaillierte Analyse der Nist- und Brutplatzwahl bei dieser weltweit bedrohten Unterart. Um St & ouml;rungen in dieser sensiblen Phase so gering wie m & ouml;glich zu halten, empfehlen wir in Anbetracht der touristischen Bedeutung der Insel, auf der diese Unterart lebt, den Verkehr von Fahrzeugen und Menschen in den Brutgebieten einzuschr & auml;nken, alle Neubauten in den Lebensr & auml;umen der Saharakragentrappe zu verbieten und die Pflanzenvielfalt des Bruthabitats in ihrer jetzigen Qualit & auml;t zu erhalten, indem das derzeitige wahllose Pfl & uuml;gen von unbestellten Feldern vermieden und die Weidefl & auml;chen f & uuml;r Ziegen eingeschr & auml;nkt werden.

AB  - Lichen communities are known to be most resistant and adapted organisms to the extreme environments; however, their abundance is not well mapped. Extensive lichen surveys were conducted as part of the 39th Indian scientific expedition and in-situ spectra (350 nm-2500 nm) of lichens were collected in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica during austral summer of 2020. Lichen abundance mapping was carried out with the help of Sentinel2 MSI L2 data and surveyed records along with in-situ spectra. We generated feature collections for lichen, snow, water, bare surface and trained a random forest (RF) classification algorithms implemented in GEE and generated multi-class outputs. We finally merged all non-lichen classes and produced binary pixels with a confidence value (between 0 and 100) depicting similarity of its spectral response to that of a lichen pixel. Total 92 lichen points, 20 bare rock points, 26 points of water and 74 snow points were used to generate the probabilistic lichen abundance map. Resubstitution accuracy of 97.31% was obtained with 10 number of RF trees. Validation was done with geotagged ground photographs having 232 lichens, 20 bare rocks, 22 water and 69 snow points and achieved test accuracy of 82.44%.
