AB  - The primary cilium is a plasma membrane-protruding sensory organelle that efficiently conveys signaling cascades in a highly ordered microenvironment. Its signaling is mediated, in part, by a limited set of GPCRs preferentially enriched in the cilium membrane. This includes melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) receptor 1 (MCHR1), which plays a role in feeding and mood. In addition to its receptor composition, the length of the cilium is a characteristic parameter that is implicated in its function. We previously found that MCH can dynamically shorten cilia length via the Gi/o and Akt pathways in both MCHR1-expressing hTERT-RPE1 cells (hRPE1 cells) and rat hippocampal neurons. However, the detailed mechanisms by which MCH regulates cilia length through ciliary MCHR1 remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the transcriptome changes in MCHR1-expressing hRPE1 cells in response to MCH to identify the target molecules involved in cilia length regulation via MCHR1 activation. RNA sequencing analysis of ciliated cells subjected to MCH treatment showed upregulation of 424 genes and downregulation of 112 genes compared with static control cells. Validation by quantitative real-time PCR, knocking down, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout technology identified a molecule, PDZ and LIM domain-containing protein 5 (PDLIM5). Thus, it was considered as the most significant key factor for MCHR1-mediated shortening of cilia length. Additional analyses revealed that the actin-binding protein alpha-actinin 1/4 is a crucial downstream target of the PDLIM5 signaling pathway that exerts an effect on MCHR1-induced cilia shortening. In the endogenous MCHR1-expressing hippocampus, transcriptional upregulation of PDLIM5 and actinin 1/4, following the application of MCH, was detected when the MCHR1-positive cilia were shortened. Together, our transcriptome study based on ciliary MCHR1 function uncovered a novel and important regulatory step underlying cilia length control. These results will potentially serve as a basis for understanding the mechanism underlying the development of obesity and mood disorders.

AB  - Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), a major enzyme responsible for cAMP degradation in the hippocampus, has been implicated in mood regulation. Although PDE4D inhibition exerts antidepressant effects, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of PDE4D in chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Using a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model, we found that PDE4D expression was significantly upregulated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of CRS mice, leading to suppressed CREB signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired AHN. PDE4D knockout (PDE4D-KO) restored mitochondrial quality by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, normalizing mitophagy, and improving oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via the nucleus and mitochondria cAMP/CREB signaling, ultimately promoting AHN and alleviating depression-like symptoms. These findings define PDE4D as a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and AHN, suggesting that targeting PDE4D in the hippocampal DG may represent a novel treatment mechanism for depression.

AB  - The most common type of kidney cancer in adults is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for approximately 90% of cases. RCC is a variant disease with numerous subtypes; the most common subtype is clear cell RCC (ccRCC, 75%), followed by papillary RCC (pRCC, 10%) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC, 5%). To identify a genetic target for all subtypes, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases of ccRCC, pRCC, and chromophobe RCC. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes a methyltransferase, was observed to be significantly upregulated in tumors. The EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat induced anticancer effects in RCC cells. TCGA analysis revealed that large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1), a key tumor suppressor of the Hippo pathway, was significantly downregulated in tumors; the expression of LATS1 was increased by tazemetostat. Through additional experiments, we confirmed that LATS1 plays a crucial role in EZH2 inhibition and has a negative association with EZH2. Therefore, we suggest that epigenetic control could be a novel therapeutic strategy for three subtypes of RCC.

AB  - While the opioid crisis has justifiably occupied news headlines, emergency rooms are seeing many thousands of visits for another cause: cannabinoid toxicity. This is partly due to the spread of cheap and extremely potent synthetic cannabinoids that can cause serious neurological and cardiovascular complications-and deaths-every year. While an opioid overdose can be reversed by naloxone, there is no analogous treatment for cannabis toxicity. Without an antidote, doctors rely on sedatives, with their own risks, or 'waiting it out' to treat these patients. We have shown that the canonical synthetic 'designer' cannabinoids are highly potent CB1 receptor agonists and, as a result, competitive antagonists may struggle to rapidly reverse an overdose due to synthetic cannabinoids. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) have the potential to attenuate the effects of synthetic cannabinoids without having to directly compete for binding. We tested a group of CB1 NAMs for their ability to reverse the effects of the canonical synthetic designer cannabinoid JWH018 in vitro in a neuronal model of endogenous cannabinoid signaling and also in vivo. We tested ABD1085, RTICBM189, and PSNCBAM1 in autaptic hippocampal neurons that endogenously express a retrograde CB1-dependent circuit that inhibits neurotransmission. We found that all of these compounds blocked/reversed JWH018, though some proved more potent than others. We then tested whether these compounds could block the effects of JWH018 in vivo, using a test of nociception in mice. We found that only two of these compounds-RTICBM189 and PSNCBAM1-blocked JWH018 when applied in advance. The in vitro potency of a compound did not predict its in vivo potency. PSNCBAM1 proved to be the more potent of the compounds and also reversed the effects of JWH018 when applied afterward, a condition that more closely mimics an overdose situation. Lastly, we found that PSNCBAM1 did not elicit withdrawal after chronic JWH018 treatment. In summary, CB1 NAMs can, in principle, reverse the effects of the canonical synthetic designer cannabinoid JWH018 both in vitro and in vivo, without inducing withdrawal. These findings suggest a novel pharmacological approach to at last provide a tool to counter cannabinoid toxicity.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is an important factor that exacerbates neuronal death and abnormal synaptic function in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Due to the complex pathogenesis and the presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB), no effective clinical drugs are currently available. Previous results showed that N-salicyloyl tryptamine derivatives had the potential to constrain the neuroinflammatory process. In this study, 30 new N-salicyloyl tryptamine derivatives were designed and synthesized to investigate a structure-activity relationship (SAR) for the indole ring of tryptamine in order to enhance their antineuroinflammatory effects. Among them, both in vitro and in vivo compound 18 exerted the best antineuroinflammatory effects by suppressing the activation of microglia, which is the culprit of neuroinflammation. The underlying mechanism of its antineuroinflammatory effect may be related to the inhibition of transcription, expression and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that subsequently regulated downstream cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and activity. With its excellent BBB permeability and pharmacokinetic properties, compound 18 exhibited significant neuroprotective effects in the hippocampal region of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced mice than former N-salicyloyl tryptamine derivative L7. In conclusion, compound 18 has provided a new approach for the development of highly effective antineuroinflammatory therapeutic drugs targeting microglia activation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia, causing the loss of cognitive function. Our previous study has shown, using a doubly mutated mouse model of AD (APP/PS1), that the neural adhesion molecule L1 directly binds amyloid peptides and decreases plaque load and gliosis when injected as an adeno-associated virus construct (AAV-L1) into APP/PS1 mice. In this study, we microinjected AAV-L1, using a Hamilton syringe, directly into the 3-month-old APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus and waited for a year until significant neurodegeneration developed. We stereologically counted the principal neurons and parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, estimated the density of inhibitory synapses around principal cells, and compared the AAV-L1 injection models with control injections of green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP) and the wild-type hippocampus. Our results show that there is a significant loss of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the APP/PS1 mice, which was improved by AAV-L1 injection, compared with the AAV-GFP controls (p < 0.05). There is also a generalized loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which is ameliorated by AAV-L1 injection, compared with the AAV-GFP controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, AAV-L1 injection promotes the survival of inhibitory synapses around the principal cells compared with AAV-GFP controls in all three hippocampal subfields (p < 0.01). Our results indicate that L1 promotes neuronal survival and protects the synapses in an AD mouse model, which could have therapeutic implications.<br />

AB  - Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is an aromatic herb known for its culinary and medicinal uses for centuries. Both unprocessed (white) and processed (black) garlic are known to protect against the pathobiology of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which has been attributed to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The information on the effects of processed and unprocessed garlic on neuronal process outgrowth, maturation, and synaptic development is limited. This study aimed at investigating and comparing the effects of the ethanol extracts of unprocessed (white garlic extract, WGE) and processed (black garlic extract, BGE) garlic on the maturation of primary hippocampal neurons. Neurite outgrowth was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by both WGE and BGE and the most effective doses were 15 mu g/mL and 60 mu g/mL, respectively, without showing cytotoxicity. At this optimal concentration, both extracts promoted axonal and dendritic growth and maturation. Furthermore, both extracts substantially increased the formation of functional synapses. However, the effect of WGE was more robust at every developmental stage of neurons. In addition, the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed a chemical profile of various bioactives in both BGE and WGE. Linalool, a compound that was found in both extracts, has shown neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in neuronal cultures, suggesting that the neurotrophic activity of garlic extracts is attributed, at least in part, to this compound. By using network pharmacology, linalool's role in neuronal development can also be observed through its modulatory effect on the signaling molecules of neurotrophic signaling pathways such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3 beta), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk1/2), which was further verified by immunocytochemistry. Overall, these findings provide information on the molecular mechanism of processed and unprocessed garlic for neuronal growth, survival, and memory function which may have the potential for the prevention of several neurological disorders.

In this study, we examined the rapid modulatory effect of adenosine on serotonin release in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) of mouse brain slices by using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. To mimic adenosine release during damage, a rapid microinjection of adenosine at 50 pmol was applied before electrical stimulation of serotonin release. Transient adenosine significantly reduced electrically evoked serotonin release in the first 20 s after application, but serotonin release recovered to baseline as adenosine was cleared from the slice. The continuous perfusion of adenosine did not change the evoked serotonin release. Surprisingly, the modulatory effects of adenosine were not regulated by A1 receptors as adenosine still inhibited serotonin release in A1KO mice and also after perfusion of an A1 antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyl xanthine). The inhibition was also not regulated by A3 receptors as perfusion of the A3 antagonist (MRS 1220) in A1KO brain slices did not eliminate the inhibitory effects of transient adenosine. In addition, adenosine also inhibited serotonin release in A(2A)KO mice, showing that A(2A) did not modulate serotonin. However, perfusion of a selective 5HT1A autoreceptor antagonist drug [(S)-WAY 100135 dihydrochloride] abolished the inhibitory effect of transient adenosine on serotonin release. Thus, the transient neuromodulatory effect of adenosine on DRN serotonin release is regulated by serotonin autoreceptors and not by adenosine receptors. Rapid, transient adenosine modulation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin may have important implications for diseases such as depression and brain injury.

AB  - Sesquiterpene lactones possess excellent anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines, including glioma, the most common type of malignant brain tumor with high mortality. However, the detailed mechanism of this type of constituent, especially the potential target for anti-glioma effect, is still unclear. Here, we collected 52 sesquiterpene lactones from Elephantopus scaber Linn. for network pharmacology analysis. The results demon-strated that the targets of the active components were markedly enriched on the pathways in cancer, which were closely related to cell proliferation regulation. Next, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and DisGeNET were analyzed by bioinformatics, and 429 glioma-related targets were obtained. Furtherly, 34 common targets of compounds and glioma were revealed, and they were significantly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway. Sub-sequently, we constructed a common target-compound network, and glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) had the highest degree value, which explained its significance in the network. Therefore, we speculated that the compounds might exert an anti-glioma effect by targeting GSTP1. To verify the above results, we obtained part of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from E. scaber in our laboratory and evaluated their activities against glioma U87 cells. Among these sesquiterpene lactones (1-27), compounds 1 (elephantopinolide A), 2 (cis-scabertopin) and 3 (elephantopinolide F) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect, and the IC50 values were 4.22 +/- 0.14 mu M, 4.28 +/- 0.21 mu M and 1.79 +/- 0.24 mu M, respectively. The results from molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), as well as RT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggested that the compounds exerted an inhibitory effect by targeting GSTP1. Meanwhile, the compounds also activated JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that 1, 2 and 3 could suppress cell proliferation and also induce mitochondrial dysfunction as well as oxidative stress, eventually leading to cellular apoptosis. Taken together, this study revealed that sesquiterpene lactones from E. scaber could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of glioma by targeting GSTP1.

AB  - The protein corona effect refers to the phenomenon wherein nanomaterials in the bloodstream are coated by serum proteins, yet how protein coronated nanomaterials interact with blood vessels and its toxicity implications remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated protein corona-related vessel toxicity by using an all-humanized assay integrating blood vessel organoids and patient-derived serum. Initially, we screened various nanomaterials to discern how parameters including size, morphology, hydrophobicity, surface charge, and chirality-dependent protein corona difference influence their uptake by vessel organoids. For nanomaterials showing substantial differences in vessel uptake, their protein corona was analyzed by using label-free mass spectra. Our findings revealed the involvement of cancer staging-related cytoskeleton components in mediating preferential uptake by cells, including endothelial and mural cells. Additionally, a transcriptome study was conducted to elucidate the influence of nanomaterials. We confirmed that protein coronated nanomaterials provoke remodeling at both transcriptional and translational levels, impacting pathways such as PI3K-Akt/Hippo/Wnt, and membraneless organelle integrity, respectively. Our study further demonstrated that the remodeling potential of patient-derived protein coronated nanomaterials can be harnessed to synergize with antiangiogenesis therapeutics to improve the outcomes. We anticipate that this study will provide guidance for the safe use of nanomedicine in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary Nociceptin (NC) is a small peptide implicated in the physiology of pain, learning and memory. Here we investigated the role of NC in the induction of antioxidants in the kidney, liver, and the brain of diabetic rats using morphological and biochemical methods. Normal and diabetic animals were treated with NC for 5 days. Catalase (CAT) was expressed in the kidney, liver, and the neurons of the brain. Although CAT was markedly (p < 0.05) lower in the tubules of the kidney of normal and diabetic animals after NC treatment, NC significantly (p < 0.001) increased the presence of CAT in the liver and brain of diabetic rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed in kidney tubules, hepatocytes, and neurons of the brain. Treatment with NC markedly (p < 0.001) increased the level of SOD in hepatocytes and neurons of the brain. Glutathione reductase (GRED) was seen in the convoluted tubules of the kidney, hepatocytes and neurons of the brain. Treatment with NC markedly increased (p < 0.001) the expression of GRED in kidney tubules, hepatocytes and neurons of the brain. In conclusion, NC can help diabetic patients mitigate the effects of oxidative stress by its ability to induce endogenous antioxidants. Nociceptin (NC) consists of 17 amino acids (aa) and takes part in the processing of learning and memory. The role of NC in the induction of endogenous antioxidants in still unclear. We examined the effect of NC on the expression of endogenous antioxidants in kidney, liver, cerebral cortex (CC), and hippocampus after the onset of diabetes mellitus, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. Exogenous NC (aa chain 1-17; 10 mu g/kg body weight) was given intraperitoneally to normal and diabetic rats for 5 days. Our results showed that catalase (CAT) is present in the proximal (PCT) and distal (DCT) convoluted tubules of kidney, hepatocytes, and neurons of CC and hippocampus. The expression of CAT was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the kidney of normal and diabetic rats after treatment with NC. However, NC markedly (p < 0.001) increased the expression CAT in the liver and neurons of CC of diabetic rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is widely distributed in the PCT and DCT of kidney, hepatocytes, and neurons of CC and hippocampus. NC significantly (p < 0.001) increased the expression of SOD in hepatocytes and neurons of CC and the hippocampus but not in the kidney. Glutathione reductase (GRED) was observed in kidney tubules, hepatocytes and neurons of the brain. NC markedly increased (p < 0.001) the expression of GRED in PCT and DCT cells of the kidney and hepatocytes of liver and neurons of CC. In conclusion, NC is a strong inducer of CAT, SOD, and GRED expression in the kidney, liver and brain of diabetic rats.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The widespread use of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A in organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders has been associated with renal damage as an adverse effect. The present work aimed to examine the potential of camel milk, a natural agent with marked anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties, to mitigate cyclosporine-induced renal injury. The present findings revealed that cyclosporine A induced severe renal damage in rats, as indicated by the increased levels of nephrotoxicity markers (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and kidney injury molecule 1). Moreover, cyclosporine A triggered a marked renal inflammation, as seen by increased renal pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18), renal degradation enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9), and activation of renal inflammatory signaling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappa B pathways). Furthermore, cyclosporine A instigated renal oxidative reactions and lowered the renal antioxidant defenses. Interestingly, camel milk (10 mL/kg/day; for 3 weeks by oral route) mitigated the aforementioned nephrotoxicity markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines, degradation enzymes, inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and augmented the renal antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, camel milk may be a promising natural agent that can inhibit cyclosporine-triggered renal damage.
   Renal damage is a devastating adverse effect for cyclosporine; a widely used immunosuppressant drug. The present work examined the potential of camel milk, a natural agent with marked anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties, to attenuate cyclosporine-induced renal injury. The kidney tissue was examined with the aid of Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays, including colorimetric and ELISA kits. The present findings revealed that camel milk (10 mL/kg/day; for 3 weeks by gavage) significantly lowered serum creatinine, BUN, and KIM-1 renal dysfunction markers. Mechanistically, camel milk inhibited renal inflammation, as seen by significant decrease of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-18) and extracellular degradation signals (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and enhanced the generation of the anti-inflammatory IL-10. Moreover, it inhibited the upstream pro-inflammatory p38/ERK/JNK MAPK pathway by lowering the phosphorylation of the 3 subfamilies of MAPKs (p38 MAPK, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2). Furthermore, camel milk curbed the NF-kappa B pathway activation by downregulating the protein expression of activated NF-kappa Bp65, p-NF-kappa Bp65, and p-I kappa B alpha proteins. Additionally, camel milk inhibited renal oxidative stress by lowering the MPO activity and augmenting the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio and total antioxidant capacity. These findings propose that camel milk may be a promising agent that inhibits cyclosporine-triggered renal inflammation via curtailing the p38/ERK/JNK MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways, matrix metalloproteinases, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Single-domain antibodies, including variable domains of the heavy chains of heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs) from camelids and variable domains of immunoglobulin new antigen receptors (VNARs) from cartilaginous fish, show the therapeutic potential of targeting antigens in a cytosol reducing environment. A large proportion of single-domain antibodies contain non-canonical cysteines and corresponding non-canonical disulfide bonds situated on the protein surface, rendering them vulnerable to environmental factors. Research on non-canonical disulfide bonds has been limited, with a focus solely on VHHs and utilizing only cysteine mutations rather than the reducing agent treatment. In this study, we examined an anti-lysozyme VNAR and an anti-BC2-tag VHH, including their non-canonical disulfide bond reduced counterparts and non-canonical cysteine mutants. Both the affinity and stability of the VNARs and VHHs decreased in the non-canonical cysteine mutants, whereas the reduced-state samples exhibited decreased thermal stability, with their affinity remaining almost unchanged regardless of the presence of reducing agents. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the decrease in affinity of the mutants resulted from increased flexibility of the CDRs, the disappearance of non-canonical cysteine-antigen interactions, and the perturbation of other antigen-interacting residues caused by mutations. These findings highlight the significance of non-canonical cysteines for the affinity of single-domain antibodies and demonstrate that the mutation of non-canonical cysteines is not equivalent to the disruption of non-canonical disulfide bonds with a reducing agent when assessing the function of non-canonical disulfide bonds.

AB  - Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, is limited by its low oral bioavailability. To overcome this drawback, we have developed novel camel milk casein-derived nanoparticles as a drug delivery system. Camel milk casein is not only biocompatible on oral administration but is actually a dietary protein of pharmaceutical relevance. Casein is used because of its amphiphilic nature, self-assembling property, ability to show sustained release, and capability of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. In this study, camel milk casein nanoparticles loaded with sorafenib were developed and characterized. Characterization of casein nanoparticles was done by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, scanning light microscopy (SEM), and FTIR. The drug content in nanoparticle and drug-protein binding studies were conducted by UV spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity and cellular uptake efficiency studies were performed in HepG2 cell lines. It was observed that the cytotoxic effect of sorafenib loaded camel milk casein nanoparticles was more than free sorafenib in HepG2 cells.

AB  - A novel mesoporous Zn/MgO hexagonal-nano-plate catalyst was synthesized by a simple template-free hydrothermal method and applied in the base-catalyzed transesterification of Camelina oil for biodiesel synthesis. The Zn/MgO catalyst calcinated at 873 K exhibited the highest catalytic activity with a yield of 88.7%. This catalytic reaction was performed using 3% w/w of the catalyst with a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 24:1 at 393 K in 8 h. The excellent catalytic performance is possibly attributed to its favorable textural features with relatively high surface area (69.1 m(2) g(-1)) and appropriate size of the mesopores (10.4 nm). In addition, the as-synthesized catalyst demonstrated a greater basic sites density than single mesoporous MgO, which might have been promoted by the addition of Zn, leading to a synergetic interaction that enhanced its catalytic activity. This catalytic system demonstrated high stability for five catalytic runs and catalytic activity with over 84% yield.

AB  - Background. Ovarian cancer (OC) is a malignancy exhibiting high mortality in female tumors. Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins but research has failed to demonstrate a systematic link between glycosylation-related signatures and tumor environment of OC. Purpose. This study is aimed at developing a novel model with glycosylation-related messenger RNAs (GRmRNAs) to predict the prognosis and immune function in OC patients. Methods. The transcriptional profiles and clinical phenotypes of OC patients were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. A weighted gene coexpression network analysis and machine learning were performed to find the optimal survival-related GRmRNAs. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and Cox regression were carried out to calculate the coefficients of each GRmRNA and compute the risk score of each patient as well as develop a prognostic model. A nomogram model was constructed, and several algorithms were used to investigate the relationship between risk subtypes and immune-infiltrating levels. Results. A total of four signatures (ALG8, DCTN4, DCTN6, and UBB) were determined to calculate the risk scores, classifying patients into the high-and low-risk groups. High-risk patients exhibited significantly poorer survival outcomes, and the established nomogram model had a promising prediction for OC patients' prognosis. Tumor purity and tumor mutation burden were negatively correlated with risk scores. In addition, risk scores held statistical associations with pathway signatures such as Wnt, Hippo, and reactive oxygen species, and nonsynonymous mutation counts. Conclusion. The currently established risk scores based on GRmRNAs can accurately predict the prognosis, the immune microenvironment, and the immunotherapeutic efficacy of OC patients.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, and the exploration of potential therapeutic drugs for its treatment is still ongoing. Vitamin D has emerged as a promising treatment due to its potential neuroprotective effects and anti-epileptic properties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D on epilepsy and neuroinflammation in juvenile mice using network pharmacology and molecular docking, with a focus on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Experimental mouse models of epilepsy were established through intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine, and in vitro injury models of hippocampal neurons were induced by glutamate (Glu) stimulation. The anti-epileptic effects of vitamin D were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis were used to identify potential targets and regulatory pathways of vitamin D in epilepsy. The involvement of the mTOR signaling pathway in the regulation of mouse epilepsy by vitamin D was validated using rapamycin (RAPA). The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene and protein expressions were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to analyze the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. In in vivo experiments, vitamin D reduced the Racine scores of epileptic mice, prolonged the latency of epilepsy, and inhibited the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Furthermore, network pharmacology analysis identified RAF1 as a potential target of vitamin D in epilepsy, which was further confirmed by molecular docking analysis. Additionally, the mTOR signaling pathway was found to be involved in the regulation of mouse epilepsy by vitamin D. In in vitro experiments, Glu stimulation upregulated the expressions of RAF1 and LC3II/LC3I, inhibited mTOR phosphorylation, and induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanistically, vitamin D activated the mTOR signaling pathway and alleviated mouse epilepsy via RAF1, while the use of the pathway inhibitor RAPA reversed this effect. Vitamin D alleviated epilepsy symptoms and neuroinflammation in juvenile mice by activating the mTOR signaling pathway via RAF1. These findings provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-epileptic effects of vitamin D and further supported its use as an adjunctive therapy for existing anti-epileptic drugs.

AB  - The Hippo signaling primarily includes LATS1/2 and YAP1. Recent work has demonstrated a novel negative feedback between YAP1 and LATS1/2. However, how YAP-LATS negative feedback regulates cancer progression remains elusive. We constructed a multi-scale model which integrates angiogenesis, spatiotemporal variation of microenvironmental factors and phenotypic switch of tumor cells. Our simulation replicated the findings that YAP overexpression markedly attenuated cell proliferation owing to elevated negative feedback strength. After disruption of YAP-LATS negative feedback loop, however, YAP overexpression would promote cell proliferation. Consistently, LATS overexpression inhibited cell growth and lowered the proliferation potential. We also employed a putative LATS agonist and identified its dose-dependent tumor suppressive effects. Furthermore, targeted delivery could more effectively inhibit tumor growth. Our model has reconciled experimental findings and implied that reconstruction of functional and/or hyperactivated YAP-LATS negative feedback might be a promising strategy to homeostatic maintenance and tumor suppression.

AB  - During their differentiation, neurons establish a highly polarized morphology by forming axons and dendrites. Cortical and hippocampal neurons initially extend several short neurites that all have the potential to become an axon. One of these neurites is then selected as the axon by a combination of positive and negative feedback signals that promote axon formation and prevent the remaining neurites from developing into axons. Here, we show that Pip5k1 gamma is required for the formation of a single axon as a negative feedback signal that regulates C3G and Rap1 through the generation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Impairing the function of Pip5k1 gamma results in a hyper-activation of the Fyn/C3G/ Rap1 pathway, which induces the formation of supernumerary axons. Application of a hyper-osmotic shock to modulate membrane tension has a similar effect, increasing Rap1 activity and inducing the formation of supernumerary axons. In both cases, the induction of supernumerary axons can be reverted by expressing constitutively active Pip5k. Our results show that PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane properties limit the activity of C3G and Rap1 to ensure the extension of a single axon.

AB  - Despite decades of intense study, the molecular basis of asynchronous neurotransmitter release remains enigmatic. Synaptotagmin (syt) 7 and Doc2 have both been proposed as Ca2+ sensors that trigger this mode of exocytosis, but conflicting findings have led to controversy. Here, we demonstrate that at excitatory mouse hippocampal synapses, Doc2 alpha is the major Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release, while syt7 supports this process through activity-dependent docking of synaptic vesicles. In synapses lacking Doc2 alpha, asynchronous release after single action potentials is strongly reduced, while deleting syt7 has no effect. However, in the absence of syt7, docked vesicles cannot be replenished on millisecond timescales. Consequently, both synchronous and asynchronous release depress from the second pulse onward during repetitive activity. By contrast, synapses lacking Doc2 alpha have normal activity-dependent docking, but continue to exhibit decreased asynchronous release after multiple stimuli. Moreover, disruption of both Ca2+ sensors is non-additive. These findings result in a new model whereby syt7 drives activity-dependent docking, thus providing synaptic vesicles for synchronous (syt1) and asynchronous (Doc2 and other unidentified sensors) release during ongoing transmission.

AB  - ObjectivesDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) can be improved by modulating gut microbiota. We aimed to investigate a probiotic mixture comprising Bifidobacterium Longum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus (BSL) in mitigating acetaminophen induced liver injury (AILI), and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.MethodsGut bacterial communities were analyzed in fecal samples from patients with DILI and healthy controls. Mice were pretreated with BSL or PBS for 10 days, then subjected to a single dose of acetaminophen (300 mg/kg) gavage and euthanized 24 h later. Transcriptome sequencing, microbiome, and metabolome sequencing were performed on mouse samples, respectively.ResultsGut bacterial dysbiosis existed in DILI patients, with a decrease in Gram-positive bacteria and an increase in Gram-negative bacteria. A similar situation occurred in AILI mice. Pretreatment of BSL significantly improved APAP-induced disorders of gut bacteria and alleviated hepatic inflammation and necrosis. Transcriptome sequencing showed that BSL inhibited the hepatic damage pathways, such as Hippo and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Metabolomic profiling revealed an obvious increase in oligopeptides containing branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in AILI mice, whereas these metabolites were significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of BSL, but positively with key genes of Hippo pathway. In vitro experiments showed that leucine exerted a dose-related exacerbation pattern on APAP-mediated hepatocellular injury. Mice supplemented with leucine resulted in the further overexpression of Yes-associated protein, an increase in oxidative stress, and a worsening of AILI.

AB  - Ubiquitin (Ub), a central regulator of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinson's disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, Pink1 knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Ischemic stroke is caused by local lesions of the central nervous system and is a severe cerebrovascular disease. A traditional Chinese medicine, Yiqi Tongluo Granule (YQTL), shows valuable therapeutic effects. However, the substances and mechanisms remain unclear. Purpose: We combined network pharmacology, multi-omics, and molecular biology to elucidate the mechanisms by which YQTL protects against CIRI. Study design: We innovatively created a combined strategy of network pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics and molecular biology to study the active ingredients and mechanisms of YQTL. We performed a network pharmacology study of active ingredients absorbed by the brain to explore the targets, biological processes and pathways of YQTL against CIRI. We also conducted further mechanistic analyses at the gene and protein levels using transcriptomics, proteomics, and molecular biology techniques. Results: YQTL significantly decreased the infarction volume percentage and improved the neurological function of mice with CIRI, inhibited hippocampal neuronal death, and suppressed apoptosis. Fifteen active ingredients of YQTL were detected in the brains of rats. Network pharmacology combined with multi-omics revealed that the 15 ingredients regulated 19 pathways via 82 targets. Further analysis suggested that YQTL protected against CIRI via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway. Conclusion: We confirmed that YQTL protected against CIRI by inhibiting nerve cell apoptosis enhanced by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts social interaction and sensory processing, is rising. Valproic acid (VPA) exposure during pregnancy causes autistic-like traits in offspring. Olanzapine (OLZ), an atypical antipsychotic, is used to treat ASD. We assessed the impact of OLZ on behavior, neuromorphology, and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the hippocampus using prenatal VPA treatment in rats. It is commonly known that ASD patients exhibit sensory abnormalities. As such, we utilized the tail flick test to validate the ASD model. In the novel object recognition test (NORT), VPA exposure reduces the discrimination index (DI) in the first introduction to the novel object. Moreover, OLZ and vehicle-treated rats perform differently in the second exposition to the DI of the novel object, suggesting that OLZ reverses VPA-induced deficits in recognition memory. The latency to find the hidden platform in the Morris water maze test of memory and learning improves in VPA-exposed rats after OLZ administration, indicating that OLZ improves spatial memory in these rats. Administration of prenatal VPA induces neuronal hypotrophy and reduces spine density in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Treatment with OLZ corrects the neuromorphological changes brought on by VPA. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, VPA treatment increases the number of neurons, which normalizes with OLZ treatment. OLZ increases the NO levels in the dorsal hippocampus in control rats. In rats exposed to VPA, the second-generation antipsychotic OLZ reduces memory-related and neuroplastic alterations. The current findings support the use of OLZ in this illness and further validate the use of prenatal VPA as a model of ASD.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is currently achieving impressive success in all fields. However, autonomous navigation remains a major challenge for AI. Reinforcement learning is used for target navigation to simulate the interaction between the brain and the environment at the behavioral level, but the Artificial Neural Network trained by reinforcement learning cannot match the autonomous mobility of humans and animals. The hippocampus-striatum circuits are considered as key circuits for target navigation planning and decision-making. This paper aims to construct a bionic navigation model of reinforcement learning corresponding to the nervous system to improve the autonomous navigation performance of the robot. The ventral striatum is considered to be the behavioral evaluation region, and the hippocampal-striatum circuit constitutes the position-reward association. In this paper, a set of episode cognition and reinforcement learning system simulating the mechanism of hippocampus and ventral striatum is constructed, which is used to provide target guidance for the robot to perform autonomous tasks. Compared with traditional methods, this system reflects the high efficiency of learning and better Environmental Adaptability. Our research is an exploration of the intersection and fusion of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, which is conducive to the development of artificial intelligence and the understanding of the nervous system.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is considered as to be one of the most consumed beverages globally and a reservoir of phytochemicals with immense health benefits. Despite numerous advantages, tea compounds lack a robust multi-disease target study. In this work, we presented a unique in silico approach consisting of molecular docking, multivariate statistics, pharmacophore analysis, and network pharmacology approaches. Eight tea phytochemicals were identified through literature mining, namely gallic acid, catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate (ECG), quercetin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid, based on their richness in tea leaves. Further, exploration of databases revealed 30 target proteins related to the pharmacological properties of tea compounds and multiple associated diseases. Molecular docking experiment with eight tea compounds and all 30 proteins revealed that except gallic acid all other seven phytochemicals had potential inhibitory activities against these targets. The docking experiment was validated by comparing the binding affinities (Kcal mol(-1)) of the compounds with known drug molecules for the respective proteins. Further, with the aid of the application of statistical tools (principal component analysis and clustering), we identified two major clusters of phytochemicals based on their chemical properties and docking scores (Kcal mol(-1)). Pharmacophore analysis of these clusters revealed the functional descriptors of phytochemicals, related to the ligand-protein docking interactions. Tripartite network was constructed based on the docking scores, and it consisted of seven tea phytochemicals (gallic acid was excluded) targeting five proteins and ten associated diseases. Epicatechin gallate (ECG)-hepatocyte growth factor receptor (PDB id 1FYR) complex was found to be highest in docking performance (10 kcal mol(-1)). Finally, molecular dynamic simulation showed that ECG-1FYR could make a stable complex in the near-native physiological condition.

AB  - Juniper species contain abundant compounds that are used in the medicine, cosmetic, and wood industry. Furthermore, these components protect the genus against herbivores, pathogens and detrimental abiotic conditions. Stains and specific reagents can be used individually or simultaneously to mark cell shape, arrangement and the material they are made from. Microchemical analyses using specific reagents and stains under light microscopy are helpful for the characterization of chemical compounds present in plant tissues. The autofluorescence of endogenous fluorophores is used to enable their localization in plant cells and tissues. This paper aims to investigate the cytochemical and histochemical traits of the shoots (leaves and stems) and female cones (berries) of Juniperus seravschanica. Light and florescent microscopy techniques were used to analyze the cytology and localization of different compounds for the first time. Microscopy-based histochemical analyses revealed various products in terms of composition and distribution among the shoots and female cones. These specific compounds contained lignin, tannins, polysaccharides, starch, phenolic compounds, chlorophyll, terpenoids, neutral lipids, and proteins. However, the anatomical position of each metabolite and its concentration was different among leaf, stem, and female cone. Phenolic cells of young cones were differentiated into sclereid cells during development. The density of phenolic cells, sclereid cells, and resin glans was higher in female cones than leaves and stems. The high levels of various components can be related to high resistance of the species against biotic and abiotic stresses, confirm its industrial, pharmaceutical and agricultural applications and is useful for identification of diagnostic taxonomic traits.

AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an essential role in tumor therapeutic resistance. Although the lethal effect of ferroptosis on tumor cells is well reported, how TAMs inhibit the effect of ferroptosis in tumors has not been clearly defined. In this study, it is demonstrated that TAM-secreted taurine suppresses ferroptosis in prostate cancer (PCa) by activating the Liver X receptor alpha/Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (LXR alpha/SCD1) pathway. Blocking taurine intake via inhibition of taurine transporter TauT restores the sensitivity to ferroptosis in tumors. Furthermore, LXR alpha activates the transcription of both miR-181a-5p and its binding protein FUS to increase the recruitment of miR-181a-5p in tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). It is observed that macrophages appear to be recipient cells of the miR-181a-5p-enriched EVs. Intake of miR-181a-5p in macrophages promotes their M2 polarization and enhances the taurine export by inhibiting expression of its target gene lats1, which in turn inactivates the hippo pathway and results in a Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear translocation for transcriptional activation of both M2 polarization-related genes such as ARG1 and CD163 and the taurine transport gene TauT. Taken together, the findings indicate a reciprocal interaction between PCa cells and TAMs as a positive feedback-loop to repress ferroptosis in PCa, mediated by TAM-secreted taurine and tumor EV-delivered miR-181a-5p.
   Taurine inhibits ferroptosis mediated by the crosstalk between tumor cells and TAMs via activation of LXR alpha/SCD1 axis in PCa. LXR alpha promotes miR-181a-5p expression/recruitment into tumor-released EVs. Intake of miR-181a-5p induces M2 polarization in macrophages to enhance taurine export as a positive feedback loop. Targeting TauT-mediated taurine transport is a promising strategy to restore the sensitivity to ferroptosis during PCa treatment.image

AB  - Astrocytes crucially contribute to synaptic physiology and information processing. One of their key characteristics is to express high levels of connexins (Cxs), the gap junction-forming protein. Among them, Cx30 displays specific properties since it is postnatally expressed and dynamically upregulated by neuronal activity and modulates cognitive processes by shaping synaptic and network activities, as recently shown in knockout mice. However, it remains unknown whether local and selective upregulation of Cx30 in postnatal astrocytes within a physiological range modulates neuronal activities in the hippocampus. We here show in mice that, whereas Cx30 upregulation increases the connectivity of astroglial networks, it decreases spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission. This effect results from a reduced neuronal excitability and translates into an alteration in the induction of synaptic plasticity and an in vivo impairment in learning processes. Altogether, these results suggest that astroglial networks have a physiologically optimized size to appropriately regulate neuronal functions.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease caused by the over-synchronization of neurons leading to brain dysfunction. Recurrent seizures can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits, and irreversible brain damage. While the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulates various physiological processes of neurons and glia, it may also lead to abnormal neuronal signal transduction under pathological conditions, including that of epilepsy. Everolimus (Eve), an mTOR inhibitor, may modulate neuronal excitability and therefore exert protection against epilepsy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Everolimus on seizureinduced brain injury and its regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and NF-kB/IL-6 signaling pathway. Kainic acid (KA) 15 mg/kg was used to induce seizures and Everolimus (1, 2, 5 mg/kg) was administered as a pretreatment. Hippocampal tissue was extracted 24 h post-seizure.
   Results: The protein and mRNA expression levels of PI3K?p-AKt?p-mTOR?NF-kB and IL-6 as well as neuronal apoptosis and microglia activation, significantly increased after KA-induced seizures, however, these effects were inhibited by Everolimus treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment with Everolimus decreased seizure scores and increased seizure latency. Conclusions: Everolimus can decrease the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and NF-kB/IL-6 signaling pathway, reduce neuronal apoptosis and microglia activation, and attenuate seizure susceptibility and intensity, thus having a protective effect on seizure-induced brain damage.

AB  - Cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug containing platinum, is considered a neurotoxic agent. On the other hand, crocin, the primary component of saffron, possesses neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. In this study, 28 healthy adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were used (6-7 weeks old). Rats were divided into a control group (Ctr), a crocin group (Cro), a cisplatin group (Cis), and a crocin with cisplatin group (Cro + Cis). Rotarod, open field, and shuttle box tests were performed to assess balance, explorative behavior, and avoidance memory. After behavioral testing, the hippocampus was extracted to analyze oxidative stress parameters such as GPx (glutathione peroxidase), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and MDA (malondialdehyde) activity. Shuttle box, rotarod, and open field results showed that crocin can substantially mitigate the deleterious effects of cisplatin on avoidance memory, explorative behavior, motor coordination, and balance. Crocin was also able to effectively avoid the negative effects of cisplatin on MDA, GPx, and CAT during the assessment of oxidative indicators, while the beneficial effect of crocin on cisplatin was not statistically significant in terms of SOD level. In conclusion, since free radicals produced by cisplatin are a contributing factor to memory loss and movement disorders, crocin, owing to its antioxidant properties, improved passive avoidance learning as well as motor activity.

AB  - The adenosine modulation system is mostly composed by inhibitory A(1) receptors (A(1)R) and the less abundant facilitatory A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R), the latter selectively engaged at high frequency stimulation associated with synaptic plasticity processes in the hippocampus. A(2A)R are activated by adenosine originated from extracellular ATP through ecto-5'-nucleotidase or CD73-mediated catabolism. Using hippocampal synaptosomes, we now investigated how adenosine receptors modulate the synaptic release of ATP. The A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 (10-100 nM) enhanced the K+-evoked release of ATP, whereas both SCH58261 and the CD73 inhibitor alpha,beta-methylene ADP (100 mu M) decreased ATP release; all these effects were abolished in forebrain A(2A)R knockout mice. The A(1)R agonist CPA (10-100 nM) inhibited ATP release, whereas the A(1)R antagonist DPCPX (100 nM) was devoid of effects. The presence of SCH58261 potentiated CPA-mediated ATP release and uncovered a facilitatory effect of DPCPX. Overall, these findings indicate that ATP release is predominantly controlled by A(2A)R, which are involved in an apparent feedback loop of A(2A)R-mediated increased ATP release together with dampening of A(1)R-mediated inhibition. This study is a tribute to Maria Teresa Miras-Portugal.

AB  - Shikonin is widely acknowledged as a bioactive substance extracted from the root of lithospermum erythrorhizon with multifunction. It alleviates ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in liver and brain. Due to the similar pathogenesis of I/R and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-stimulated injury, we aimed to explore the potential pharmacological effects of Shikonin on the myocardial injury. The rats with myocardial I/R injury and the primary cardiomyocytes with H/R-stimulated injury were taken as in vivo and in vitro models. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and ELISA kits were used for detection of myocardial infarction and cardiac injury. Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry staining were used to analyze the effect of Shikonin on autophagy histology. Western blot was performed to detect the proteins related to autophagy and Hippo pathway. The results showed that SHK reduces the size of myocardial infarction, improved cardiac function, suppressed the expression of autophagy-related proteins, and reduced the amount of autophagosomes. The underlying mechanism is to activate Hippo pathway. In vitro assay also suggested that SHK enhanced the cell viability, reduced the apoptotic rates in rat primary cardiomyocytes. Collectively, our results demonstrated that SHK protects against myocardial I/R injury by inhibiting autophagy, of which the underlying molecular mechanism is to activate the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - The hippocampal memory deficit stands out as a primary symptom in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. While numerous therapeutic candidates have been proposed, they primarily serve to delay disease progression. Given the irreversible brain atrophy or injury associated with these conditions, current research efforts are concentrated on preventive medicine strategies. Herein, we investigated whether the extracts of Capsicum annuum L. seeds (CSE) and Capsicum annuum L. pulp (CPE) have preventive properties against glutamate-induced neuroexcitotoxicity (one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease) in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. Pretreatment with CSE demonstrated significant anti-neuroexcitotoxic activity, whereas CPE did not exhibit such effects. Specifically, CSE pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited the elevation of excitotoxic elements (intracellular calcium influx and reactive oxygen species; ROS) and apoptotic elements (p53 and cleaved caspase-3). In addition, the glutamate-induced alterations of neuronal activity indicators (brain-derived neurotrophic factor; BDNF and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation; CREB) were significantly attenuated by CSE treatment. We also found that luteolin is the main bioactive compound corresponding to the anti-neuroexcitotoxic effects of CSE. Our results strongly suggest that Capsicum annuum L. seeds (but not its pulp) could be candidates for neuro-protective resources especially under conditions of neuroexcitotoxicity. Its underlying mechanisms may involve the amelioration of ROS-mediated cell death and BDNF-related neuronal inactivity and luteolin would be an active compound.

AB  - The rapid development of quantum technology challenges the security of modern cryptography, which causes concern from the cryptographic community about the quantum implementation of cryptographic algorithms, as it is an important component of many quantum attacks. In this paper, the construction of quantum circuits for Camellia block cipher is investigated. Firstly, a 4-bit S-box is derived from the hardware circuit of the Camellia S-box, which divides the S-box circuit into three parts. Then, based on the rearranged circuit, as well as the implementation of the CCCNOT gate, the construction of the NCT-based circuit for the Camellia S-box is researched. Meanwhile, combined with the observations on the rearranged S-box circuit and the discussion on the in-place implementation of different matrices, a quantum circuit for the Camellia S-box with lower T-depth is presented. As an application, the various S-box circuits are used to construct quantum circuits for the Camellia family. The results reveal that the memory-efficient and depth-efficient quantum circuits of Camellia can be constructed with lower T-depth and T & sdot;M value. Besides, for each instance of Camellia, compared with existing state-of-the-art implementation with lowest T-depth and T & sdot;M value, the depth-efficient circuit designed in this work only costs about 35% of the qubits.

AB  - Integrin alpha v beta 6 holds promise as a therapeutic target for organ fibrosis, yet targeted therapies are hampered by concerns over inflammatory-related side effects. The role of alpha v beta 6 in renal inflammation remains unknown, and clarifying this issue is crucial for alpha v beta 6-targeted treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we revealed a remarkable positive correlation between overexpressed alpha v beta 6 in proximal tubule cells (PTCs) and renal inflammation in CKD patients and mouse models. Notably, knockout of alpha v beta 6 not only significantly alleviated renal fibrosis but also reduced inflammatory responses in mice, especially the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, conditional knockout of alpha v beta 6 in PTCs in vivo and co-culture of PTCs with macrophages in vitro showed that depleting alpha v beta 6 in PTCs suppressed the migration and pro-inflammatory differentiation of macrophages. Screening of macrophage activators showed that alpha v beta 6 in PTCs activates macrophages via secreting IL-34. IL-34 produced by PTCs was significantly diminished by alpha v beta 6 silencing, and reintroduction of IL-34 restored macrophage activities, while anti-IL-34 antibody restrained macrophage activities enhanced by alpha v beta 6 overexpression. Moreover, RNA-sequencing of PTCs and verification experiments demonstrated that silencing alpha v beta 6 in PTCs blocked hypoxia-stimulated IL-34 upregulation and secretion by inhibiting YAP expression, dephosphorylation, and nuclear translocation, which resulted in the activation of Hippo signaling. While application of a YAP agonist effectively recurred IL-34 production by PTCs, enhancing the subsequent macrophage migration and activation. Besides, reduced IL-34 expression and YAP activation were also observed in global or PTCs-specific alpha v beta 6-deficient injured kidneys. Collectively, our research elucidates the pro-inflammatory function and YAP/IL-34/macrophage axis-mediated mechanism of alpha v beta 6 in renal inflammation, providing a solid rationale for the use of alpha v beta 6 inhibition to treat kidney inflammation and fibrosis.

AB  - Simple Summary An early time course study of the proteins associated to synaptic dynamics and cognitive behavior. Study evaluated the expression levels and activation state of markers in hippocampal synaptosomes. Changes in enzymatic activities and proteins levels were detected early during the disease. Study used two different models of impaired insulin signaling in the brain. The two models used exhibited different effects on the parameters tested. Abstracts In hyperglycemia/diabetes, impaired insulin signaling in the brain causes a cerebral pathology and cognitive impairments as in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). To improve our understanding of the role of impaired insulin signaling in cognitive dysfunction, we examined the expression levels and activation states of mediators of neuronal survival and cytoskeletal dynamics/plasticity in the hippocampus in rats treated with intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ). We studied early changes (1, 3, or 6 weeks) in response to STZ treatment. Cognitive function was assessed using the novel object recognition (NOR) test and T-maze. The activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and Na+/K+-ATPase was measured biochemically and the expression levels and phosphorylation states of mediators of neuronal survival and synaptosomal dynamics/plasticity (PI3K, Akt, GSK-3 & beta;, PAK, LIMK-1, and cofilin-1) were examined by immunoblotting. Significant cognitive losses were observed in STZ-injected rats, together with elevated AChE and reduced Na+/K+-ATPase activity. STZ administration reduced the ratio of phosphorylated/total PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3 & beta; and increased the ratio of phosphorylated/total PAK, LIMK-1, and coflin-1. Significant differences between the IP and ICV administration of STZ were observed in the expression levels and phosphorylation states of different markers. Cognitive impairments at 3W and 6W were significantly correlated with changes in the ratio of phosphorylated/total proteins. We conclude that impaired insulin signaling causes early deleterious changes in mediators of synaptic dynamics/plasticity. This study provides mechanistic insights into early events involved in mediating sAD and highlights potential intervention opportunities.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by brain atrophy, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons. 8-Oxoguanine, a major oxidatively generated nucleobase highly accumulated in the AD brain, is known to cause neurodegeneration. In mammalian cells, several enzymes play essential roles in minimizing the 8-oxoguanine accumulation in DNA. MUTYH with adenine DNA glycosylase activity excises adenine inserted opposite 8-oxoguanine in DNA. MUTYH is reported to actively contribute to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson and Huntington diseases and some mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases by accelerating neuronal dysfunction and microgliosis under oxidative conditions; however, whether or not MUTYH is involved in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the contribution of MUTYH to the AD pathogenesis. Using postmortem human brains, we showed that various types of MUTYH transcripts and proteins are expressed in most hippocampal neurons and glia in both non-AD and AD brains. We further introduced MUTYH deficiency into App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) knock-in AD model mice, which produce humanized toxic amyloid-beta without the overexpression of APP protein, and investigated the effects of MUTYH deficiency on the behavior, pathology, gene expression, and neurogenesis. MUTYH deficiency improved memory impairment in App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) mice, accompanied by reduced microgliosis. Gene expression profiling strongly suggested that MUTYH is involved in the microglial response pathways under AD pathology and contributes to the phagocytic activity of disease-associated microglia. We also found that MUTYH deficiency ameliorates impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus, thus improving memory impairment. In conclusion, we propose that MUTYH, which is expressed in the hippocampus of AD patients as well as non-AD subjects, actively contributes to memory impairment by inducing microgliosis with poor neurogenesis in the preclinical AD phase and that MUTYH is a novel therapeutic target for AD, as its deficiency is highly beneficial for ameliorating AD pathogenesis.

AB  - To investigate the effects and potential mechanism of miR-634 that regulates aquaporin 5 (AQP5) to regulate the inflammatory response and apoptosis in LPS-induced human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs). The mRNA expressions of miR-634 and AQP5 in the tissues of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and LPS-induced HNEpCs were detected by qRT-PCR. Western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression of AQP5 in HNEpCs. The apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The cell viability was detected by CCK-8 kit. Combined with bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter and western blotting, the interaction between AQP5 and miR-634 were predicted and verified. It proved that the mRNA expression of miR-634 in CRS group was significantly up-regulated, while AQP5 was down-regulated. And the expression of AQP5 in CRS group was down-regulated compared with control group. In vitro experiments indicated that the expression of miR-634 increased gradually, while AQP5 decreased gradually with the increase of LPS concentration. The cell viability was inhibited and apoptosis was promoted in LPS-induced group. In addition, it was found that miR-634 could inhibit cell viability and promote apoptosis. QRT-PCR results implied that miR-634 up-regulated the expression of inflammatory factor-related mRNA in LPS-induced HNEpCs. Combined with bioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCR, it was confirmed that AQP5 was the direct target of miR-634. MiR-634 directly targeted AQP5 to regulate CRS progression, including inhibiting cell viability, promoting apoptosis and aggravating inflammatory response, which may provide theoretical basis for its use as a biomarker for CRS treatment.

AB  - Selenium in the form of selenoproteins is formed through a unique translocation recoding pathway and plays a vital role in human metabolism. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) when synthesized using green synthesis from plant extract offer more advantages than physical and chemical methods. Previous studies have synthesized selenium nanoparticles from green tea and white tea; here, we report the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles from Camillia sinensis (L) Kuntze leaves (black tea) by green synthesis. Moreover, we have tested the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the plant extract, SeNPs, and combination of plant extract and SeNPs which have not been previously studied. The antimicrobial efficacy of SeNPs was tested against Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans, and Staphylococcus aureus. They showed inhibitory effects against these organisms individually and in combination with Camellia sinensis leaf extract. The antioxidant properties of SeNPs were checked using FRAP and DPPH assays, where high radical scavenging activity was exhibited by SeNPs and in combination with the plant extract. Furthermore, synthesized SeNPs were examined for cytotoxicity tolerance against Vero cells and their IC50 values determine that plant-mediated SeNPs showed high cytotoxicity at minimal concentrations. If explored further, the reducing, capping, and stabilizing capabilities of SeNPs may demonstrate other inhibitory effects and could be explored for understanding the role of selenium in cellular metabolism.

AB  - The distinctive flavor and numerous health benefits of tea are attributed to the presence of theanine, a special amino acid found in tea plants. Nitrogen metabolite is greatly impacted by drought; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the synthesis of theanine in drought-stricken tea plants is still not clear. Through the drought transcriptome data of tea plants, we have identified a gene CsMOF1 that appears to play a role in theanine biosynthesis under drought stress, presenting a significantly negative correlation with both theanine content and the expression of CsGS1. Further found that CsMOF1 is a transcription factor containing a MYB binding domain, localized in the nucleus. Upon silencing CsMOF1, there was a prominent increase in the level of the theanine and glutamine, as well as the expression of CsGS1, while glutamic acid content decreased significantly. Conversely, overexpression of CsMOF1 yielded opposite effects. Dual luciferase reporter assay and electromobility shift assays demonstrated that CsMOF1 binds to the promoter of CsGS1, thereby inhibiting its activity. These results indicate that CsMOF1 plays a crucial role in theanine biosynthesis in tea plants under drought stress, acting as a transcriptional repressor related to theanine biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the tissue-specific regulation of theanine biosynthesis and aids with the cultivation of new varieties of tea plants.

AB  - Lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a remote sensing survey tool for animal monitoring in several fields, such as precision livestock farming. Together with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, UAV technology has drastically escalated our ability to acquire and analyse visual data in the field, lowering both costs and complications associated with collection and analysis. This paper addresses monitoring mammalian herbivores using the unexploited field of thermal Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) in UAV imagery. In our research, a state-of-the-art MOTS algorithm (Track R-CNN) was trained and evaluated in the segmentation, detection and tracking of dairy cattle. Data collection was carried out in two farms with a UAV carrying a thermal camera at various angles and heights, and under different light (overcast/sunny) and thermal (16.5 degrees C range) conditions. Our findings suggest that dataset diversity and balance, especially regarding the range of conditions under which the data was collected, can significantly enhance tracking efficiency in specific scenarios. For training the algorithm, transfer learning was used as a knowledge migration method. The performance of our best model (68.5 sMOTSA, 79.6 MOTSA, 41 IDS, 100 % counting accuracy, and 87.2 MOTSP), which utilizes 3D convolutions and an association head, demonstrates the applicability and optimal performance of Track R-CNN in detecting, tracking, and counting herbivores in UAV thermal imagery under heterogenous conditions. Our findings demonstrate that 3D convolutions outperform Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) convolutions. However, LSTM convolutions also show optimal performance, offering a viable alternative. Furthermore, our results highlight the inability of Optical Flow to track motionless animals (-15 sMOTSA, -4.1 MOTSA and 2076 IDS) and the proficiency of the association head in differentiating static animals from the background. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in automated mammalian herbivore monitoring, with potential applications such as precision livestock farming and wildlife conservation.

AB  - Modulation of the endocannabinoid system has emerged as an effective approach for the treatment of many neurodegenerative and neuropsychological diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Using a repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) mouse model, we found that there was an impairment in locomotor function and working memory within two weeks post-injury, and that treatment with MJN110, a novel inhibitor of the principal 2-arachidononyl glycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase dose-dependently ameliorated those behavioral changes. Spatial learning and memory deficits examined by Morris water maze between three and four weeks post-TBI were also reversed in the drug treated animals. Administration of MJN110 selectively elevated the levels of 2-AG and reduced the production of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in the TBI mouse brain. The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, accumulation of astrocytes and microglia in the TBI mouse ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus were significantly reduced by MJN110 treatment. Neuronal cell death was also attenuated in the drug treated animals. MJN110 treatment normalized the expression of the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B, the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2, and the GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha 1, beta 2,3 and gamma 2, which were all reduced at 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. The reduced inflammatory response and restored glutamate and GABA receptor expression likely contribute to the improved motor function, learning and memory in the MJN110 treated animals. The therapeutic effects of MJN110 were partially mediated by activation of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors and were eliminated when it was co-administered with DO34, a novel inhibitor of the 2-AG biosynthetic enzymes. Our results suggest that augmentation of the endogenous levels of 2-AG can be therapeutically useful in the treatment of TBI by suppressing neuroinflammation and maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.

AB  - The traditional Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithm has high computational cost, poor convergence, and poor performance in robot spatial cognition and navigation tasks, and it cannot fully explain the ability of animals to quickly adapt to environmental changes and learn a variety of complex tasks. Studies have shown that vicarious trial and error (VTE) and the hippocampus forward prediction mechanism in rats and other mammals can be used as key components of action selection in MBRL to support "goal-oriented" behavior. Therefore, we propose an improved Dyna-Q algorithm inspired by the forward prediction mechanism of the hippocampus to solve the above problems and tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This algorithm alternately presents the potential path in the future for mobile robots and dynamically adjusts the sweep length according to the decision certainty, so as to determine action selection. We test the performance of the algorithm in a two-dimensional maze environment with static and dynamic obstacles, respectively. Compared with classic RL algorithms like State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) and Dyna-Q, the algorithm can speed up spatial cognition and improve the global search ability of path planning. In addition, our method reflects key features of how the brain organizes MBRL to effectively solve difficult tasks such as navigation, and it provides a new idea for spatial cognitive tasks from a biological perspective.

AB  - With the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, rural residences have become an essential component of China's building energy conservation efforts. However, most existing research has focused more on urban buildings, with less attention given to rural residences. This study, taking rural residential buildings (RRBs) in the hot summer and cold winter zones in China as an example, proposes a more precise, two-stage optimization design framework using Rhino-Grasshopper for the overall optimization of RRBs. First, field surveys and numerical analysis of collected rural residential design drawings were conducted to clarify spatial characteristics and air conditioning usage. The parametric optimization design of RRBs was then conducted in two steps. The first step involves room function positioning, where spatial geometric models are established. Annual dynamic simulation analyses of AC (air conditioning) and AL (artificial lighting) energy consumption are performed to obtain energy intensity distribution maps. Based on the principle that "space with higher energy consumption is set in the location with lower energy consumption intensity" and the habit of functional space distribution, room function positioning, and adjustments are made. In the second step, the SPEA-2 genetic algorithm was applied for multi-objective optimization of room width, depth, WWR (window-to-wall ratio), SHGC (solar heat gain coefficient), and VLT (visible light transmittance), all based on the logical relationships of the building structure. The final Pareto front solution sets were obtained by multi-objective optimization simulation (MOO). A typical three-bay RRB was selected for application in this study, and the optimized design led to a total energy savings rate of 11% in annual AC and AL energy consumption.

AB  - Due to the unpredictable nature of renewable sources such as sun and wind, the integration of such sources to a grid is complicated. However, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) can solve this problem. Constructing a reliable HRES in remote areas is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a new methodology incorporating a crow search algorithm (CSA) for optimizing the scale of an HRES installed in a remote area. The constructed system comprises photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines (WTs), batteries, and diesel generators (DGs). The target is to achieve the most economical and efficient use of renewable energy sources (RESs). The CSA is used as it is simple in implementation, it only requires a few parameters, and it has a high flexibility. The designed system is constructed to serve an electrical load installed in the northeastern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The load data are provided by the Saudi Electricity Company, including those of the Aljouf region (Sakaka, Alqurayyat, Tabarjal, Dumat Aljandal, and its villages) and the northern border region (Arar, Tarif, Rafha, and its affiliated villages). The temperature, irradiance, and wind speed of the Aljouf region (latitude 29.764 degrees and longitude 40.01 degrees) are collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from 1 January to 31 December 2020. Three design factors are considered: the PV number, the WT number, and the number of days of battery autonomy (AD). We compared our results to the reported approaches of an elephant herding optimizer (EHO), a grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), a Harris hawks optimizer (HHO), a seagull optimization algorithm (SOA), and a spotted hyena optimizer (SHO). Moreover, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is calculated to assess the constructed system's reliability. The proposed COA succeeded in achieving the best fitness values of 0.03883 USD/kWh, 0.03863 USD/kWh, and 0.04585 USD/kWh for PV/WT/battery, PV/battery, and WT/battery systems, respectively. The obtained results confirmed the superiority of the proposed approach in providing the best configuration of an HRES compared to the others.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing thoroughly quantifies the individual cell transcriptomes but renounces the spatial structure. Conversely, recently emerged spatial transcriptomics technologies capture the cellular spatial structure but skimp cell or gene resolutions. Ligand-receptor interactions reveal the potential of cell proximity since they are spatially constrained. Cell-cell affinity values estimated by ligand-receptor interaction can partially represent the structure of cells but falsely include the pseudo affinities between distant or indirectly interacting cells. Here, we develop a software package, SPROUT, to reconstruct the single-cell resolution spatial structure from the transcriptomics data through diminished pseudo ligand-receptor affinities. For spatial data, SPROUT first curates the representative single-cell profiles for each spatial spot from a candidate library, then reduces the pseudo affinities in the intercellular affinity matrix by partial correlation, spectral graph sparsification, and spatial coordinates refinement. SPROUT embeds the estimated interactions into a low-dimensional space with the cross-entropy objective to restore the intercellular structures, which facilitates the discovery of dominant ligand-receptor pairs between neighboring cells at single-cell resolution. SPROUT reconstructed structures achieved shape Pearson correlations ranging from 0.91 to 0.97 on the mouse hippocampus and human organ tumor microenvironment datasets. Furthermore, SPROUT can solely de novo reconstruct the structures at single-cell resolution, i.e., reaching the cell-type proximity correlations of 0.68 and 0.89 between reconstructed and immunohistochemistry-informed spatial structures on a human developing heart dataset and a tumor microenvironment dataset, respectively.

AB  - Covalent target modulation with small molecules has been emerging as a promising strategy for drug discovery. However, covalent inhibitory antibody remains unexplored due to the lack of efficient strategies to engineer antibody with desired bioactivity. Herein, we developed an intracellular selection method to generate covalent inhibitory antibody against human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) 3C protease through unnatural amino acid mutagenesis along the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3). A library of antibody mutants was thus constructed and screened in vivo through co-expression with the target protease. Using this screening strategy, six covalent antibodies with proximity-enabled bioactivity were identified, which were shown to covalently target HRV14-3C protease with high inhibitory potency and exquisite selectivity. Compared to structure-based rational design, this library-based screening method provides a simple and efficient way for the discovery and engineering of covalent antibody for enzyme inhibition.

AB  - A substantial body of evidence demonstrates an association between a malfunction in the resolution of acute inflammation and the development of chronic inflammation. Recently, in this context, the importance of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) has been underlined. FPR2 activity is modulated by a wide range of endogenous ligands, including specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (e.g., LXA4 and AT-LXA4) and synthetic ligands. Since SPMs have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, we aimed to evaluate the protective and pro-resolving effects of a new potent FPR2 agonist, compound CMC23, in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The protective activity of CMC23 limited the lactate dehydrogenase release in LPS-stimulated cultures. This activity was mediated by the interaction with FPR2 as pretreatment with the FPR2 selective antagonist WRW4 abolished CMC23-induced protection. Furthermore, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1 beta and IL-6 were observed after CMC23 administration in LPS-treated OHCs. CMC23 also diminished the LPS-induced increase in IL-17A and both IL-23 subunits p19 and p40 in OHCs. Finally, we demonstrated that CMC23 exerts its beneficial impact via the STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway since it attenuated the level of phospho-STAT3 and maintained the LPS-induced SOCS3 levels in OHCs. Collectively, our research implies that the new FPR2 agonist CMC23 has beneficial protective and anti-inflammatory properties in nanomolar doses and FPR2 represents a promising target for the enhancement of inflammation resolution.

AB  - RTP801/REDD1 is a stress-regulated protein whose upregulation is necessary and sufficient to trigger neuronal death. Its downregulation in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease models ameliorates the pathological phenotypes. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the coding gene for RTP801, DDIT4, is responsive to A beta and modulates its cytotoxicity in vitro. Also, RTP801 mRNA levels are increased in AD patients' lymphocytes. However, the involvement of RTP801 in the pathophysiology of AD has not been yet tested. Here, we demonstrate that RTP801 levels are increased in postmortem hippocampal samples from AD patients. Interestingly, RTP801 protein levels correlated with both Braak and Thal stages of the disease and with GFAP expression. RTP801 levels are also upregulated in hippocampal synaptosomal fractions obtained from murine 5xFAD and rTg4510 mice models of the disease. A local RTP801 knockdown in the 5xFAD hippocampal neurons with shRNA-containing AAV particles ameliorates cognitive deficits in 7-month-old animals. Upon RTP801 silencing in the 5xFAD mice, no major changes were detected in hippocampal synaptic markers or spine density. Importantly, we found an unanticipated recovery of several gliosis hallmarks and inflammasome key proteins upon neuronal RTP801 downregulation in the 5xFAD mice. Altogether our results suggest that RTP801 could be a potential future target for theranostic studies since it could be a biomarker of neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity severity of the disease and, at the same time, a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of AD.

AB  - With Zn deficiency increasing in the global population, functional plant food (including tea) can help to fill the nutrition gap that the main crops cannot meet. Glycinebetaine (GB), an important bioactive substance with a wide range of natural sources, has received limited attention towards its effects on Zn biofortification and the quality of tea. The Zn enrichment and metabolite responses of albino tea [cv. White leaf No. 1 (WL-1)] to the foliar application of GB, Zn, and their combination (Zn + GB) were investigated in a field experiment. The result indicated that the 100-buds weight, total N, Zn, Thea, and total amino acid content in the young leaves of WL-1 with Zn2 + GB2 treatment were significantly increased, whereas the Chla contents were decreased (p < 0.05). The total catechins and CAF contents of Zn2 + GB2 treatment were lower than those of other treatments, with significance (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis and general quantitative analysis returned complementary results, revealing that Zn2 + GB2 treatment was better for the apparent and functional quality of WL-1. The more theanine and Zn, limited chlorophyll, catechin, and caffeine contributed to the quality improvement, as well as to maintaining the leaf albinistic characteristics, inhibiting astringency and bitterness, exerting flavor and umami, and improving the ultimate beneficial functions. The combined application of Zn and GB is a promising practice for Zn biofortification and for the quality improvement of tea, with spraying 750 L ha(-1) of 2.0 g L-1 Zn fertilizer and 3.2 g L-1 GB mixture recommended.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment accompanied by aberrant neuronal apoptosis. Reports suggest that the pro-apoptotic mammalian set20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) instigates neuronal apoptosis via activating the Hippo signaling pathway under various stress conditions, including AD. However, whether inhibiting MST1/2 has any therapeutic benefits in AD remains unknown. Thus, we tested the therapeutic effects of intervening MST1/2 activation via the pharmacological inhibitor Xmu-mp-1 in a sporadic AD rat model. Sporadic AD was established in adult rats by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) injection (3 mg/kg body weight). Xmu-mp-1 (0.5 mg/kg/body weight) was administered once every 48 h for two weeks, and Donepezil (5 mg/kg body weight) was used as a reference standard drug. The therapeutic effects of Xmu-mp-1 on ICV-STZ rats were determined through various behavioral, biochemical, histopathological, and molecular tests. At the behavioral level, Xmu-mp-1 improved cognitive deficits in sporadic AD rats. Further, Xmu-mp-1 treatment reduced STZ-associated tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta deposition, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal apoptosis, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, Xmu-mp-1 exerted these neuroprotective actions by inactivating the Hippo signaling while potentiating the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling in the AD rats. Together, the results of the present study provide compelling support that Xmu-mp-1 negated the neuronal dysregulation in the rat model of sporadic AD. Therefore, inhibiting MST/Hippo signaling and modulating its crosstalk with the Wnt/beta-Catenin pathway can be a promising alternative treatment strategy against AD pathology. This is the first study providing novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic use of Xmu-mp-1 in sporadic AD.

AB  - Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of Telmisartan (TEL), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, on the mitochondria-specific genes expression in a mouse model of Parkinsonism. Materials and methods: Mice were divided into 5 groups with 6 in each Group I received 0.5% CMC (control) + saline, Group II received 0.5% CMC + 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (positive control), Group III & IV received MPTP + TEL 3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o. respectively, Group V received TEL 10 mg/kg, p.o. (drug control). MPTP was given 80 mg/kg intraperitoneal in two divided doses (40 mg/kg x 2 at 16 h time interval). Vehicle or TEL was administered 1 h before the MPTP injection. Motor function was assessed 48 h after the first dose of MPTP and animals were euthanized to collect brain. Results: Mice intoxicated with MPTP showed loco-motor deficits and significant upregulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), downregulation of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), and Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Striatum (STr) regions of brains. In addition, MPTP intoxication down-regulated mitochondria-specific genes such as DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin, enriched with leucine repeats kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene expfression. Pre-treatment with TEL restored locomotor functions and upregulated PINK1, Parkin, LRRK2, DJ-1, MTA1 and UCHL1. Conclusion: The present study evidences that TEL has the ability to improve mitochondrial functions in PD.

AB  - Renal fibrosis is a fundamental pathological change in the progression of various chronic kidney diseases to the end stage of renal disease. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionary highly conserved signaling pathway that is involved in the regulation of organ size, tissue regeneration, and human reproduction and development. Currently, many studies have shown that it is closely associated with renal diseases, such as, renal fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, and renal cancer. Here, we review the current researches on the effect of Hippo signaling pathway on renal fibrosis, which provides new ideas and theoretical basis for clinical therapeutics of renal fibrosis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the application of photocatalytic advanced oxidation (PAO) for the treatment of water contaminated with dark humic material from fynbos biome plants, which cannot be treated by conventional methods. The study used a fynbos species (Aspalathus linearis) to create a model wastewater that was compared with a brew made from black tea (Camellia sinensis). Two photocatalysts (TiO2 and ZnO) and three light sources (natural, halogen light, and UV light) were tested, with and without hydrogen peroxide. The treatment of the two teas by only photolysis was observed to be minimal. The study found that natural sunlight was not effective, but a combination of ZnO and halogen lamp exhibited the best performance, with a 60% degradation in 20 min under solar irradiation. The optimum catalyst concentration was identified as 10 g/L for both photocatalysts. The influence of some process parameters showed that a combination of an optimum dose of 5 mM H2O2 and solar radiation improved the performance of TiO2 from 16 to 47%. The photocatalytic reaction data were fitted to the pseudo first and second-order kinetic models in order to exploit the kinetic process of the photo-destruction reaction. The kinetic fits showed that the degradation reaction better adhered to the second-order kinetic model when only ZnO and solar radiation were applied, regardless of the tea type employed. The application of PAO in this novel and cost-effective way has potential for the abatement of contaminated water to potable water. The use of heterojunction photocatalysts could be explored in future research to further improve the process.

AB  - Subterranean termite-induced damage to earth embankments in agricultural systems occurs globally. NaCl-laden soil barriers (NLSBs) are an environmentally sustainable termite control method, and have exhibited good potential in preventing termite-related tunneling damage in Zhejiang Province, China. The persistence of the NaCl concentration in NLSBs is a key characteristic for the long-term prevention of subterranean termite infestations. This study is a scientific attempt to estimate the field efficacy and barrier longevity of NLSBs in reservoir embankments based on the Richards equation and the convection-dispersion equation using HYDRUS (2D/3D). The observed and simulated NaCl concentrations at the end of a 1915-day simulation were compared. The results indicated that the proposed model performed well and can effectively characterize the water flow and salt transport in NLSBs. The salt desalination rate of the NLSB in the upstream slope was higher than that in the downstream slope, both of which were significantly higher than that at the embankment axis. Regardless of the type of embankment (homogeneous or core-wall), the barrier longevity of NaCl-laden soil against subterranean termites can reach 50 years with an optimized NaCl/soil ratio in different parts of the embankment.

AB  - Adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) control fear memory and the underlying processes of synaptic plasticity in the amygdala. In other brain regions, A(2A)R activation is ensured by ATP-derived extracellular adenosine formed by ecto-5 '-nucleotidase or CD73. We now tested whether CD73 is also responsible to provide for the activation of A(2A)R in controlling fear memory and amygdala long-term potentiation (LTP). The bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of the CD73 inhibitor alpha beta-methylene ADP (AOPCP, 1 nmol/ventricle/day) phenocopied the effect of the A(2A)R blockade by decreasing the expression of fear memory, an effect disappearing in CD73-knockout (KO) mice and in forebrain neuronal A(2A)R-KO mice. In the presence of PPADS (20 mu M) to eliminate any modification of ATP/ADP-mediated P2 receptor effects, both AOPCP (100 mu M) and the A(2A)R antagonist, SCH58261 (50 nM), decreased LTP magnitude in synapses of projection from the external capsula into the lateral amygdala, an effect eliminated in slices from both forebrain neuronal A(2A)R-KO mice and CD73-KO mice. These data indicate a key role of CD73 in the process of A(2A)R-mediated control of fear memory and underlying synaptic plasticity processes in the amygdala, paving the way to envisage CD73 as a new therapeutic target to interfere with abnormal fear-like emotional processing.

TI  - The impact of Semaphorin 4C/Plexin-B2 signaling on fear memory via remodeling of neuronal and synaptic morphology
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
LA  - English
AB  - Aberrant fear is a cornerstone of several psychiatric disorders. Consequently, there is large interest in elucidation of signaling mechanisms that link extracellular cues to changes in neuronal function and structure in brain pathways that are important in the generation and maintenance of fear memory and its behavioral expression. Members of the Plexin-B family of receptors for class 4 semaphorins play important roles in developmental plasticity of neurons, and their expression persists in some areas of the adult nervous system. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of Semaphorin 4C (Sema4C) and its cognate receptor, Plexin-B2, in the expression of contextual and cued fear memory, setting a mechanistic focus on structural plasticity and exploration of contributing signaling pathways. We observed that Plexin-B2 and Sema4C are expressed in forebrain areas related to fear memory, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and the hippocampus, and their expression is regulated by aversive stimuli that induce fear memory. By generating forebrain-specific Plexin-B2 knockout mice and analyzing fear-related behaviors, we demonstrate that Sema4C-PlexinB2 signaling plays a crucial functional role in the recent and remote recall of fear memory. Detailed neuronal morphological analyses revealed that Sema4C-PlexinB2 signaling largely mediates fear-induced structural plasticity by enhancing dendritic ramifications and modulating synaptic density in the adult hippocampus. Analyses on signaling-related mutant mice showed that these functions are mediated by PlexinB2-dependent RhoA activation. These results deliver important insights into the mechanistic understanding of maladaptive plasticity in fear circuits and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies against fear-related disorders.

In addition, by employing drug repurposing approaches, it was demonstrated that dihydroergotamine (DHE), an FDA drug approved to treat migraines, inhibits Histamine N Methyl Transferase (HNMT), the enzyme responsible for the inactivation of histamine in the brain. For this reason, in the present work, the effect of DHE on histamine levels in the hippocampus and its effects on memory was evaluated, employing the scopolamine-induced amnesia model, the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) paradigm, and the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Furthermore, the role of histamine 1 receptor (H1R) and histamine 2 receptor (H2R) antagonists in the improvement in memory produced by DHE in the scopolamine-induced amnesia model was evaluated. Results showed that the rats that received DHE (10 mg/kg, i.p.) showed increased histamine levels in the hippocampus after 1 h of administration but not after 5 h. In behavioral assays, it was shown that DHE (1 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 20 min before the training reversed the memory impairment produced by the administration of scopolamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after the training in the NOR paradigm and MWM. Additionally, the effects in memory produced by DHE were blocked by pre-treatment with pyrilamine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 30 min before the training in the NOR paradigm and MWM. These findings allow us to demonstrate that DHE improves memory in a scopolamine-induced amnesia model through increasing histamine levels at the hippocampus due to its activity as an HNMT inhibitor.

AB  - The study evaluates the dependence of p53 protein expression on the appearance of dark neurons (DNs) in the hippocampus in rats during experimental modeling of septoplasty. Septoplasty simulation was carried out on 15 sexually mature male Wistar rats. We studied histological sections of the hippocampus stained with Nissl toluidine blue and antibodies to the p53 protein. In the CA1 subfield, the number of p53-positive neurons significantly increased on the 2nd, 4th (p < 0.001) and 6th days (p < 0.05). In the dynamics, the peak of the growth of p53 protein expression in the cytoplasm of CA1 and CA2 neurons fell on the 2-4th day after the operation, and on the 6th day the number of these neurons decreased (p < 0.001). In the cytoplasm of CA3 neurons in all periods after surgery, an increase in the expression of the p53 protein as compared to the control group was noted. In the CA1 pyramidal layer, the number of DNs decreased on the 6th day (p < 0.001). In CA2, after 2 days, a minimum of DNs as compared with the 4th day (p < 0.001) was noted. In CA3, on the 4th day, there was a peak in DNs as compared with the rest of the days (p < 0.001). A positive strong association was found in all periods of assessment and in all subfields of the hippocampus between an increase in the number of dark and p53-positive neurons. The appearance of dark and p53-positive neurons in the hippocampal formation in rats after simulating septoplasty are typical responses of nervous tissue to stress. It is obvious that the expression of the p53 protein is associated with the basophilia of the cytoplasm of neurons, their morpho-functional state. Presumably, the p53 protein can trigger not only the activation of damaged neurons in the hippocampus but also play a neuroprotective role. Upcoming studies should determine the role of the p53 protein in the further fate of damaged neurons in the pyramidal layer and differentiate the mechanisms of its expression.

AB  - This study evaluated the dependence of p53 protein expression on the occurrence of dark neurons (DNs) in the hippocampus of rats during experimental modeling of septoplasty. Septoplasty simulation was carried out on 15 sexually mature male Wistar rats. We studied histological sections of the hippocampus stained with Nissl toluidine blue and antibodies to p53 protein. In the CA1 subfield, the number of p53-positive neurons significantly increased on the second, fourth (p < 0.001), and sixth days (p < 0.05). Dynamic assessment detected the peak of p53 protein expression in the cytoplasm of CA1 and CA2 neurons from the second to fourth days after surgery, while the number of these neurons decreased on the sixth day (p < 0.001). In the cytoplasm of CA3 neurons at all periods after surgery, the expression of p53 protein increased compared to the control group. In the CA1 pyramidal layer, the number of DNs decreased on the sixth day (p < 0.001). After 2 days, the minimal number of DNs was noted in CA2 compared with the fourth day (p < 0.001). In CA3, there was a peak in number of DNs on the fourth day compared with the other days (p < 0.001). A strong positive correlation was found at all periods of assessment and in all subfields of the hippocampus between the increase in the number of dark and p53-positive neurons. The occurrence of dark and p53-positive neurons in the hippocampal formation of rats after septoplasty modeling is a typical response of nervous tissue to stress.

AB  - Inflammation is the critical component of neuropathic pain; therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential anti-inflammatory effects of Cannabis sativa L. extracts in a vincristine-induced model of neuropathic pain. The effects of different doses (5.0-40.0 mg/kg) of two Cannabis sativa L. extracts (B and D) on COX-1, COX-2, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappa B mRNA and protein levels were examined in the rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and blood lymphocytes. There were statistically significant differences in COX-1, COX-2, and TNF-alpha mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, with significant differences in COX-2 and TNF-alpha in the lymphocytes. Extract D dose-dependently increased COX-1 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, Extract B dose-dependently increased COX-1 mRNA and decreased COX-2 mRNA (in a dose of 7.5 mg/kg) and TNF-alpha protein levels in the cortex. Cannabis sativa L. extracts significantly influenced the expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, with effects varying based on dose and tissue type. The increased expression of COX-1, COX-2, and TNF-alpha (in comparison to groups receiving NaCl, vincristine, and gabapentin) in the rat hippocampus and COX-1 in the cerebral cortex suggests that Cannabis may have a pro-inflammatory effect. Due to species specificity, the results of our research based on rats require confirmation in humans. However, Cannabis sativa should be recommended with caution for treating pain with an inflammatory component.

AB  - Despite evidence implicating microglia in the etiology and pathophysiology of major depression, there is paucity of information regarding the contribution of microglia-dependent molecular pathways to antidepressant procedures. In this study, we investigated the role of microglia in a mouse model of depression (chronic unpredictable stress-CUS) and its reversal by electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), by examining the effects of microglia depletion with the colony stimulating factor-1 antagonist PLX5622. Microglia depletion did not change basal behavioral measures or the responsiveness to CUS, but it completely abrogated the therapeutic effects of ECS on depressive-like behavior and neurogenesis impairment. Treatment with the microglia inhibitor minocycline concurrently with ECS also diminished the antidepressant and pro-neurogenesis effects of ECS. Hippocampal RNA-Seq analysis revealed that ECS significantly increased the expression of genes related to neurogenesis and dopamine signaling, while reducing the expression of several immune checkpoint genes, particularly lymphocyte-activating gene-3 (Lag3), which was the only microglial transcript significantly altered by ECS. None of these molecular changes occurred in microglia-depleted mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that ECS reversed the CUS-induced changes in microglial morphology and elevation in microglial LAG3 receptor expression. Consistently, either acute or chronic systemic administration of a LAG3 monoclonal antibody, which readily penetrated into the brain parenchyma and was found to serve as a direct checkpoint blocker in BV2 microglia cultures, rapidly rescued the CUS-induced microglial alterations, depressive-like symptoms, and neurogenesis impairment. These findings suggest that brain microglial LAG3 represents a promising target for novel antidepressant therapeutics.

AB  - Regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific neuronal populations and brain regions exhibit selective vulnerability. Understanding the basis of this selective neuronal and regional vulnerability is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology. However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the incomplete understanding of the intricate functional and spatial diversity of neuronal subtypes in the human brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that neuronal subpopulations with high neuropeptide (NP) co-expression are disproportionately absent in the entorhinal cortex of AD brains at the single-cell level, and there is a significant decline in hippocampal NP expression in naturally aging human brains. Given the role of NPs in neuroprotection and the maintenance of microenvironments, we hypothesize that neurons expressing higher levels of NPs (HNP neurons) possess unique functional characteristics that predispose them to cellular abnormalities, which can manifest as degeneration in AD with aging. To test this hypothesis, multiscale and spatiotemporal transcriptome data from similar to 1900 human brain samples were analyzed using publicly available datasets. The results indicate that HNP neurons experienced greater metabolic burden and were more prone to protein misfolding. The observed decrease in neuronal abundance during stages associated with a higher risk of AD, coupled with the age-related decline in the expression of AD-associated neuropeptides (ADNPs), provides temporal evidence supporting the role of NPs in the progression of AD. Additionally, the localization of ADNP-producing HNP neurons in AD-associated brain regions provides neuroanatomical support for the concept that cellular/neuronal composition is a key factor in regional AD vulnerability. This study offers novel insights into the molecular and cellular basis of selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to AD in human brains.

AB  - Synthetic agents are regularly used as preservatives in pork meat products such as sausages. However, these compounds can be harmful to human health, due to their carcinogenic potential. As a result, natural antioxidants derived from herbs and medicinal plants are continuously and thoroughly assessed to replace/minimize the application of synthetic agents during meat processing and storage. The current study was consequently implemented to highlight the effects of natural polyphenols and/or an herbal mix on the quality characteristics of pork sausages. Five batches of sausages were manufactured using the same recipe and raw materials; the control, without sodium nitrate and natural preservatives (CON), and four groups supplemented with sodium nitrate at 0.015% (SN), olive polyphenols at 0.2% (POL), an herbal mix containing rosemary, savory, camelia, thyme, lemon balm and turmeric at 0.2% (NM), or the concomitant addition of olive polyphenols (0.1%) and the herbal mix (0.1%) (POL + NM). Assessment of pH, color, cooking loss, tenderness and oxidative stability was implemented immediately after the manufacture of the sausages (day 0) and at 1, 2 and 3 months after refrigerated storage. It was illustrated that the oxidative stability of sausages was ameliorated as a consequence of POL or/and NM addition, since the values of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly decreased compared to the control (p < 0.001) at months 1, 2 and 3, and the values were similar to those observed in the SN group that served as a positive control. Values for the lightness (L), shear force and cooking loss were similar among the experimental treatments (p > 0.05). On the other hand, pH values were greater in the SN and NM groups than in the other groups (p < 0.05). Redness (a*) was significantly higher in the SN group and yellowness (b*) in the NM and POL + NM groups compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). It can be concluded that the examined polyphenols and/or herbal mix could be used as an alternative to nitrates for the amelioration of oxidative stability in pork sausages.

AB  - Recent evidences indicate that there is a substantial increase in worldwide cases of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and may contribute to 60-70% of cases. Quercetin is a unique bioflavonoid that has numerous therapeutic benefits such as anti-allergy, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-cancer, immuno-modulatory, anti-infective, antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, neuroprotective effects, etc. In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of orally administered quercetin with memantine in albino Wistar rats after inducing neurotoxicity through AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, p.o.). Chronic administration of AlCl3 resulted in poor retention of memory and significant oxidative damage. Various behavioral parameters, such as locomotor activity, Morris water maze, elevated plus maze, and passive avoidance test, were assessed on days 21 and 42 of the study. The animals were euthanatized following the completion of the last behavioral assessment. Various oxidative stress parameters were assessed to know the extent of oxidative damage to brain tissue. Quercetin with memantine has shown significant improvement in behavioral studies, inhibition of AChE activity, and reduction in oxidative stress parameters. Histopathological studies assessed for cortex and hippocampus using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and Congo red stain demonstrated a reduction in amyloid-beta plaque formation after treatment of quercetin with memantine. Immunohistochemistry showed that quercetin with memantine treatment also improved the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inhibited amyloid-beta plaque formation. The present study results demonstrated protective effects of treatment of quercetin with memantine in the neurotoxicity linked to aluminum chloride in albino Wistar rats.

AB  - Floor tile is an essential building material, which is extensively used in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Current existing design-aid approaches for floor tiles are based on simulating the manual design, lacking the attention to proactive planning on cut tiles. Therefore, the existing design-aid tools cannot enable users to generate accurate and comprehensive design results to reduce material and labor waste. Building information modeling (BIM) and parametric design (PD) approaches show considerable potential in optimizing building materials' design. This research proposed a workflow based on the BIM and PD approaches to generate and optimize floor tiles' layout design intelligently. The workflow formalizes the trades know-how cutting and planning rules of floor tiles, including the proactive planning of cut tiles, into a design algorithm to automatically generate the floor tiles planning and while reducing material waste. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is then integrated with the workflow to conduct goal-oriented optimization for the generated planning. Moreover, due to the formalized design algorithm considering the cut tiles planning, the workflow expects to output accurate and comprehensive results, including uncut and cut tiles' graphical and numerical results. We developed a prototype system in Rhino (a BIM platform) and Grasshopper (a PD platform) to verify the feasibility of the proposed workflow. The results show that the prototype system effectively generates and optimizes floor tiles' layout design (using 19.1s-116.4s) and provides accurate and comprehensive coordinate points for positioning the cutting and laying of uncut and cut tiles. Compared with the industry benchmark (i.e., 10%-15%), the material waste rates of the generated layouts have been significantly reduced, which are 3.43%-5.50%. The outcomes are summarized to provide deeper insight for improving floor tile prefabrication, robot construction, and transportation, as well as the promotion of the sustainable development of the AEC industry.

AB  - Aging is an inevitable biological process, and emerging research has highlighted the potential of dietary and pharmacological interventions to decelerate the trajectory of age-related diseases and prolong the health span. This study evaluates the protective effects of Musa balbisiana seed on healthy aging using D-galactose-induced accelerated aging rats. The results suggested that the bioactive ethyl acetate fraction of Musa balbisiana seed extract (BF) exhibited protective effects against aging-induced oxidative stress by reducing oxidative DNA damage, advanced glycation end-product formation, and malondialdehyde levels while restoring antioxidant and glyoxalase enzyme activities. BF also ameliorated neurodegeneration by decreasing acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and amyloid beta plaque formation. Histopathological analysis demonstrated the protective effects of BF against brain aging, liver disruption, renal damage, and intestinal barrier dysfunction. BF further restored intestinal permeability by upregulating the tight junctions (zonula occludens 1 and 2, claudin 1,2,3 and 4, and occludin) and mucin (mucin 2 and mucin 5ac) gene expression while downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). BF significantly induced the phosphorylation of FoxO3a proteins and upregulated the gene expression of SIRT1, PGC-1 alpha, and TFAM in the hippocampus. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16s rRNA amplicons of fecal metagenomics DNA and metabolites profiling showed that BF intervention restructured the gut microbiota and altered core metabolites related to cholesterol metabolism. Overall, our findings demonstrated the multifaceted protective effects of Musa balbisiana seed against D-galactose-induced aging.

AB  - The effect of perinatal asphyxia (PA) on oligodendrocyte (OL), neuroinflammation, and cell viability was evaluated in telencephalon of rats at postnatal day (P)1, 7, and 14, a period characterized by a spur of neuronal networking, evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)-treatment. The issue was investigated with a rat model of global PA, mimicking a clinical risk occurring under labor. PA was induced by immersing fetus-containing uterine horns into a water bath for 21 min (AS), using sibling-caesarean-delivered fetuses (CS) as controls. Two hours after delivery, AS and CS neonates were injected with either 5 mu L of vehicle (10% plasma) or 5 x 10(4) MSCs into the lateral ventricle. Samples were assayed for myelin-basic protein (MBP) levels; Olig-1/Olig-2 transcriptional factors; Gglial phenotype; neuroinflammation, and delayed cell death. The main effects were observed at P7, including: (i) A decrease of MBP-immunoreactivity in external capsule, corpus callosum, cingulum, but not in fimbriae of hippocampus; (ii) an increase of Olig-1-mRNA levels; (iii) an increase of IL-6-mRNA, but not in protein levels; (iv) an increase in cell death, including OLs; and (v) MSCs treatment prevented the effect of PA on myelination, OLs number, and cell death. The present findings show that PA induces regional- and developmental-dependent changes on myelination and OLs maturation. Neonatal MSCs treatment improves survival of mature OLs and myelination in telencephalic white matter.

AB  - Ovarian endometriosis (OEM) is a chronic inflammatory condition that impairs ovarian function. While its effects on ovarian reserve are well established, the long-term consequences of OEM on ovarian dysfunction, premature ovarian failure (POF), and systemic health, particularly in the context of accelerated aging, remain insufficiently studied. In this study, we employed an OEM mouse model and bulk RNA sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results show that OEM accelerates primordial follicle depletion and upregulates mTOR signaling pathway gene expression, along with mechanical stress and paracrine signaling via the Hippo and Myc pathways. OEM also induces irregular estrus and ovarian fibrosis in aging mice, decreases serum AMH levels, and increases FSH levels. Systemically, elevated serum IgG levels contribute to osteoporosis and cognitive decline, both linked to ovarian dysfunction and POF in OEM. These findings elucidate the mechanisms driving premature ovarian reserve depletion in OEM and highlight its broader systemic effects. This study emphasizes the importance of monitoring ovarian health and ectopic tissue to safeguard ovarian reserves and mitigate long-term risks such as osteoporosis and cognitive decline.

AB  - Given their dominant role in energy expenditure within China's Hot Summer and Warm Winter (HSWW) zone, high-fidelity performance prediction and multi-objective optimization framework during the early design phase are critical for achieving sustainable energy efficiency. This study presents an innovative approach integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms and multi-objective genetic optimization to predict and optimize the performance of high-rise office buildings in China's HSWW zone. By integrating Rhino/Grasshopper parametric modeling, Ladybug Tools performance simulation, and Python programming, this study developed a parametric high-rise office building model and validated five advanced and mature machine learning algorithms for predicting energy use intensity (EUI) and useful daylight illuminance (UDI) based on architectural form parameters under HSWW climatic conditions. The results demonstrate that the CatBoost algorithm outperforms other models with an R2 of 0.94 and CVRMSE of 1.57%. The Pareto optimal solutions identify substantial shading dimensions, southeast orientations, high aspect ratios, appropriate spatial depths, and reduced window areas as critical determinants for optimizing EUI and UDI in high-rise office buildings of the HSWW zone. This research fills a gap in the existing literature by systematically investigating the application of ML algorithms to predict the complex relationships between architectural form parameters and performance metrics in high-rise building design. The proposed data-driven optimization framework provides architects and engineers with a scientific decision-making tool for early-stage design, offering methodological guidance for sustainable building design in similar climatic regions.

AB  - Over a third of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are not effectively treated with current anti-seizure drugs, spurring the development of gene therapies. The injection of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) into the brain has been shown to be a safe and viable approach. However, to date, AAV expression of therapeutic genes has not been regulated. Moreover, a common property of antiepileptic drugs is a narrow therapeutic window between seizure control and side effects. Therefore, a long-term goal is to develop drug-inducible gene therapies that can be regulated by clinically relevant drugs. In this study, a first-generation doxycycline-regulated gene therapy that delivered an engineered version of the leak potassium channel Kcnk2 (TREK-M) was injected into the hippocampus of male rats. Rats were electrically stimulated until kindled. EEG was monitored 24/7. Electrical kindling revealed an important side effect, as even low expression of TREK M in the absence of doxycycline was sufficient to cause rats to develop spontaneous recurring seizures. Treating the epileptic rats with doxycycline successfully reduced spontaneous seizures. Localization studies of infected neurons suggest seizures were caused by expression in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. In contrast, doxycycline increased the expression of TREK-M in excitatory neurons, thereby reducing seizures through net inhibition of firing. These studies demonstrate that drug-inducible gene therapies are effective in reducing spontaneous seizures and highlight the importance of testing for side effects with pro-epileptic stressors such as electrical kindling. These studies also show the importance of evaluating the location and spread of AAV-based gene therapies in preclinical studies.

AB  - The neural stem cells (NSCs) are essential for normal brain development and homeostasis. The cell state (i.e. quiescent versus activated) and fate (i.e. the cell lineage of choice upon differentiation) of NSCs are tightly controlled by various redox and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. There is an increasing appreciation that redox and epigenetic regulations are intimately linked, but how this redox-epigenetics crosstalk affects NSC activity remains poorly understood. Another unresolved topic is whether the NSCs actually contribute to brain ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we aim to 1) distill concepts that underlie redox and epigenetic regulation of NSC state and fate; 2) provide examples of the redox-epigenetics crosstalk in NSC biology; and 3) highlight potential redox- and epigenetic-based therapeutic opportunities to rescue NSC dysfunctions in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Pteris laeta Wall., as a traditional tea, is popular in Southwest China, but its role in preventing cognitive impairment is unclear. In this study, Pteris laeta Wall. extracts (PW) and its active compounds were evaluated for preventive effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that PW diminished oxidative stress damage and apoptosis of Afi-induced HT22 cells and also rescued cognitive deficits, and ameliorated pathological injury and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. Besides, a new pterosin sesquiterpene, named pterosinsade A (PA), and nine known compounds were discovered from the EtOAc extract that possessed the best neuroprotective activity. PA reduced apoptosis of APP-overexpressing neural stem cells and promoted their proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Meanwhile, PW and PA promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, which proved to be associated with activating the Wnt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that PW and PA are candidates for AD prevention.

AB  - Tea, the world's most popular beverage, is prepared using different pre- and post-harvesting techniques, leading to its unique sensory characteristics and bioactive ingredients. However, knowledge about the impact of these processing methods on the phenolic compositions and health properties of commercially available ready-to-drink teas is limited. To fill this research lacuna, the phenolic compositions, antioxidant potentials, and inhibitory activities against the key enzymes relevant to non-communicable diseases including hyperlipidemia (lipase), type II diabetes (alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV), and Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and beta-secretase) of eleven commercially available ready-to-drink teas were investigated. The results indicated that pre-harvest shading led to higher contents of catechin, epicatechin gallate, chlorogenic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, while fermentation significantly increased rutin content, which, in turn, led to higher total phenolic contents. Antioxidants in shaded tea tended to follow a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-based mechanism, while the single electron transfer (SET)-based mechanism was a preferable reaction pathway for antioxidants in fermented teas. The ability to inhibit key enzymes was more pronounced in fermented teas than in shaded tea, potentially attributed to the biological activities of certain phenolics, either individually or working together as effective inhibitors. The addition of flavors (honey lemon, kyoho grape, watermelon, and roasted rice) led to higher contents of catechins than the original green tea (without added flavor), while the contents of other general phenolics varied, leading to similar or higher TPCs. Antioxidant potentials and enzyme inhibitions varied for different ready-to-drink tea varieties. The knowledge from this research will benefit the development of ready-to-drink teas with particular phenolics and healthrelated properties.

AB  - Prolonged high-fat diet (HFD) feeding impairs cognitive function in rodents. However, the mechanism of caloric restriction (CR) for remedying HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CR on HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism. BALB/c mice were fed with HFD for 16 weeks and subsequently subjected to CR for 12 weeks. After cognitive function was evaluated by behavioral tests such as Morris water maze and three-chamber paradigm tests, the mice were sacrificed. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were rapidly harvested and deposited at -80 degrees C. The neuroprotective mechanisms of CR on HFD-induced cognitive deficits were evaluated by histopathological and electron microscopy observations, western blotting and immunofluorescence. Compared with the normal control group, HFD mice exhibited obvious cognitive deficits, glucose tolerance impairment, neuronal degeneration and abnormalities of synaptic ultrastructure in the cortex and hippocampus. CR treatment improved cognitive dysfunction and histopathological changes as well as increased the cognition-related protein levels of PSD-95, synaptophysin and BDNF. Meanwhile, HFD increased the protein levels of pro-inflammatory factors including iNOS, COX-2 and IL-1 beta but decreased the protein levels of anti-inflammatory factors such as CD206, TGF-beta, Ym-1 and Arg 1 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, downregulated the protein levels of TREM2 and PI3K and decreased the phosphorylation level of AKT, which can be reversed by CR treatment. Therefore, our results indicated that CR ameliorated cognitive deficits of mice induced by a high-fat diet. The underlying mechanism is associated with the attenuation of the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the TREM2-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

AB  - Genistein (GS), an isoflavone compound found in soybean, plays a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of its action remains unclear. Herein, binding ability between GS and GRP78 was predicted by molecular docking, and the effect of GS in vivo and vitro were further studied. In this study, the effects of GS on learning and memory ability, changes of hippocampal neurons and ultrastructure of hippocampal CA3 region in AD rats were investigated. Besides, the protein or mRNA levels of the related proteins were detected. The results showed GS could effectively improve the learning and the memory ability, reduce the damage of hippocampal neurons, and decrease the protein or mRNA expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, Caspase-12, Cle-Caspase-9, Cle-Caspase-3, PERK, and p-PERK. Taken together, our data reveal GS has a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting the ERS-mediated apoptotic pathway, which may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Context Lily bulb and Rehmannia decoction (LBRD), consisting of Lilium henryi Baker (Liliaceae) and Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn) DC (Plantaginaceae), is a specialized traditional Chinese medicine formula for treating depression. However, the underlying mechanisms, especially the relationship between LBRD efficacy and metabolomics, remains unclear. Objective This study was aimed to investigate the metabolic mechanism of LBRD in treating depression. Materials and methods Network pharmacology was conducted using SwissTargetPrediction, DisGeNET, DrugBank, Metascape, etc., to construct component-target-pathway networks. The depression-like model was induced by intraperitoneal injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.3 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days. After the administration of LBRD (90 g/kg) and fluoxetine (2 mg/kg) for 14 days, we assessed behaviour and the levels of neurotransmitter, inflammatory cytokine and circulating stress hormone. Prefrontal metabolites of rats were detected by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics method. Results The results of network pharmacology showed that LBRD mainly acted on neurotransmitter and second messenger pathways. Compared to the model group, LBRD significantly ameliorated depressive phenotypes and increased the level of 5-HT (13.4%) and GABA (24.8%), as well as decreased IL-1 beta (30.7%), IL-6 (32.8%) and TNF-alpha (26.6%). Followed by LBRD treatment, the main metabolites in prefrontal tissue were contributed to retrograde endocannabinoid signalling, glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, autophagy signal pathway, etc. Discussion and conclusions LBRD were effective at increasing neurotransmitter, attenuating proinflammatory cytokine and regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism and glutamatergic synapse, thereby ameliorating depressive phenotypes. This research will offer reference for elucidating the metabolomic mechanism underlying novel antidepressant agents contained LBRD formula.

AB  - The closed-loop control of pathological brain activity is a challenging task. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of continuous epileptiform short discharge generation to electrical stimulation applied at different phases between the discharges using an in vitro 4-AP-based model of epilepsy in rat hippocampal slices. As a measure of stimulation effectiveness, we introduced a sensitivity function, which we then measured in experiments and analyzed with different biophysical and abstract mathematical models, namely, (i) the two-order subsystem of our previous Epileptor-2 model, describing short discharge generation governed by synaptic resource dynamics; (ii) a similar model governed by shunting conductance dynamics (Epileptor-2B); (iii) the stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)-like model applied for the network; (iv) the LIF model with potassium M-channels (LIF+KM), belonging to Class II of excitability; and (v) the Epileptor-2B model with after-spike depolarization. A semi-analytic method was proposed for calculating the interspike interval (ISI) distribution and the sensitivity function in LIF and LIF+KM models, which provided parametric analysis. Sensitivity was found to increase with phase for all models except the last one. The Epileptor-2B model is favored over other models for subthreshold oscillations in the presence of large noise, based on the comparison of ISI statistics and sensitivity functions with experimental data. This study also emphasizes the stochastic nature of epileptiform discharge generation and the greater effectiveness of closed-loop stimulation in later phases of ISIs.

AB  - Ketamine, a general anesthetic, has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects when administered at lower doses. Anesthetic levels of ketamine reduce excitatory transmission by binding deep into the pore of NMDA receptors where it blocks current influx. In contrast, the molecular targets responsible for antidepressant levels of ketamine remain controversial. We used electrophysiology, structure-based mutagenesis, and molecular and kinetic modeling to investigate the effects of ketamine on NMDA receptors across an extended range of concentrations. We report functional and structural evidence that, at nanomolar concentrations, ketamine interacts with membrane-accessible hydrophobic sites on NMDA receptors, which are distinct from the established pore-blocking site. These interactions stabilize receptors in pre-open states and produce an incomplete, voltage- and pH-dependent reduction in receptor gating. Notably, this allosteric inhibitory mechanism spares brief synaptic-like receptor activations and preferentially reduces currents from receptors activated tonically by ambient levels of neurotransmitters. We propose that the hydrophobic sites we describe here account for clinical effects of ketamine not shared by other NMDA receptor open-channel blockers such as memantine and represent promising targets for developing safe and effective neuroactive therapeutics.

AB  - Our study investigates potential neurochemical effects of (17 & alpha;,20E)- 17,20-[(1-methoxyethylidene)bis(oxy)]-3-oxo-19-norpregna-4,20-diene-21-carboxylic acid methyl ester (YK11), a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), in the rat hippocampus, with a particular focus on oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, as well as its potential effect when combined with exercise (EXE). To validate YK11's anabolic potential, we performed a molecular docking analysis with the androgen receptor (AR), which showed high affinity with YK11, high-lighting hydrogen interactions in Arg752. During the five-week protocol, we divided male Wistar rats into the following groups: Control, YK11 (0.35 g/kg), EXE (swimming protocol), and EXE+YK11. The administration of YK11 resulted in alterations in the endogenous antioxidant system, promoting increased oxidative stress and proteotoxic effects, impairing all mitochondrial function markers in the hippocampus. In contrast, EXE alone had a neuroprotective effect, increasing antioxidant defenses and improving mitochondrial metabolism. When combined, EXE+YK11 prevented alterations in some mitochondrial toxicity markers, including MnSOD/SOD2 and MTT reduction capacity, but did not reverse YK11's neurochemical impairments regarding increased oxidative stress and dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial dynamics regulatory proteins in the hippocampus. In summary, our study identifies important pathways of YK11's hippocampal ef-fects, revealing its potential to promote oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the administration of YK11 may pose potential neurological risks for athletes and bodybuilders seeking to enhance performance. These findings highlight the need for further research to assess the safety and efficacy of YK11 and SARM use in humans.

AB  - Although radiotherapy is a well-known effective non-surgical treatment for malignant gliomas, the therapeutic efficacy is severely limited due to the radioresistance of tumor cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Yes-associated protein (YAP) promotes glioma malignant progression. However, whether YAP plays a role in radioresistance and its potential value in cancer treatment are still unclear. In this study, we found that high YAP expression is associated with poor prognosis in malignant glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy. Research in immortalized cell lines and primary cells from GBM patients revealed that YAP exhibited a radioresistant effect on gliomas via promoting DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, after radiation, YAP was translocated into the nucleus, where it promoted the expression and secretion of FGF2, leading to MAPK-ERK pathway activation. FGF2 is a novel target gene of YAP. Inhibition of YAP-FGF2-MAPK signaling sensitizes gliomas to radiotherapy and prolongs the survival of intracranial cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that YAP-FGF2-MAPK is a key mechanism of radioresistance and is an actionable target for improving radiotherapy efficacy.

AB  - Circadian disruptions impact nearly all people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizing both their potential role in pathology and the critical need to investigate the therapeutic potential of circadian-modulating interventions. Here, we show that time-restricted feeding (TRF) without caloric restriction improved key disease components including behavioral timing, disease pathology, hippocampal transcription, and memory in two transgenic (TG) mouse models of AD. We found that TRF had the remarkable capability of simultaneously reducing amyloid deposition, increasing Ab42 clearance, improving sleep and memory, and normalizing daily transcription patterns of multiple genes, including those associated with AD and neuroinflammation. Thus, our study unveils for the first time the pleiotropic nature of timed feeding on AD, which has far-reaching effects beyond metabolism, ameliorating neurodegeneration and the misalignment of circadian rhythmicity. Since TRF can substantially modify disease trajectory, this intervention has immediate translational potential, addressing the urgent demand for accessible approaches to reduce or halt AD progression.

AB  - Young women undergoing anticancer treatment are at risk of premature ovarian failure (POF). Endometrialderived stem cells (EnSCs) have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential for treating ovarian insufficiency, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood. This study aims to further investigate the therapeutic effects of EnSCs, particularly through the paracrine action of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), on POF. The findings show that exogenous FGF2 enhances the survival of ovarian granulosa cells damaged by cisplatin. FGF2 stimulates the proliferation of these damaged cells by suppressing the Hippo signaling pathway and activating YAP expression. In vivo experiments also revealed that FGF2 treatment significantly improves ovarian reserve and endocrine function in mice with POF. These results suggest that FGF2 can boost the proliferative capacity of damaged ovarian granulosa cells through the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, providing a theoretical foundation for using EnSCs and FGF2 in clinical treatments for POF.

AB  - The medial temporal lobe memory system has long been identified as the brain region showing the first histopathological changes in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the functional decline observed in patients also points to a loss of function in this brain area. Nonetheless, the exact identity of the neurons and networks that undergo deterioration has not been determined so far. A recent study has identified the entorhinal and hippocampal neural circuits responsible for encoding new episodic memories. Using this novel model we describe the elements of the episodic memory network that are especially vulnerable in early AD. We provide a hypothesis of how reduced reelin signaling within such a network can promote AD-related changes. Establishing novel associations and creating a temporal structure for new episodic memories are both affected in AD. Here, we furnish a reasonable explanation for both of these previous observations.

AB  - Clinical and preclinical studies have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons as critical elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, disinhibition of SST neurons in mice results in resilience to the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Here, we established a low-dose chronic chemogenetic protocol to map these changes in positively and negatively motivated behaviors to specific brain regions. AAV-hM3Dq-mediated chronic activation of SST neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PLC) had antidepressant drug-like effects on anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behaviors in male but not female mice. Analogous manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) had such effects in female but not male mice. Moreover, the activation of SST neurons in the PLC of male mice and the vHPC of female mice resulted in stress resilience. Activation of SST neurons in the PLC reversed prior chronic stress-induced defects in motivated behavior in males but was ineffective in females. Conversely, activation of SST neurons in the vHPC reversed chronic stress-induced behavioral alterations in females but not males. Quantitation of c-Fos+ and FosB+ neurons in chronic stress-exposed mice revealed that chronic activation of SST neurons leads to a paradoxical increase in pyramidal cell activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GABAergic microcircuits driven by dendrite targeting interneurons enable sex- and brain-region-specific neural plasticity that promotes stress resilience and reverses stress-induced anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behavior. The data provide a rationale for the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines and superior efficacy of dendrite-targeting, low-potency GABAA receptor agonists, independent of sex and despite striking sex differences in the relevant brain substrates.

AB  - Reviving the neuronal functions in neurodegenerative disorders requires the promotion of neurite outgrowth. Thymol, which is a principal component of Trachyspermum ammi seed extract (TASE), is reported to have neuroprotective effects. However, the effects of thymol and TASE on neuronal differentiation and outgrowth are yet to be studied. This study is the first report investigating the neuronal growth and maturation effects of TASE and thymol. Pregnant mice were orally supplemented with TASE (250 and 500 mg/kg), thymol (50 and 100 mg/kg), vehicle, and positive controls. The supplementation significantly upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and early neuritogenesis markers in the pups' brains at post-natal day 1 (P1). Similarly, the BDNF level was significantly upregulated in the P12 pups' brains. Furthermore, TASE (75 and 100 mu g/mL) and thymol (10 and 20 mu M) enhanced the neuronal polarity, early neurite arborization, and maturation of hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner in primary hippocampal cultures. The stimulatory activities of TASE and thymol on neurite extension involved TrkB signaling, as evidenced by attenuation via ANA-12 (5 mu M), which is a specific TrkB inhibitor. Moreover, TASE and thymol rescued the nocodazole-induced blunted neurite extension in primary hippocampal cultures, suggesting their role as a potent microtubule stabilizing agent. These findings demonstrate the potent capacities of TASE and thymol in promoting neuronal development and reconstruction of neuronal circuitry, which are often compromised in neurodegenerative diseases and acute brain injuries.

AB  - Novel components in the noncanonical Hippo pathway that mediate the growth, metastasis, and drug resistance of breast cancer (BC) cells need to be identified. Here, we showed that expression of SAM and SH3 domain-containing protein 1 (SASH1) is negatively correlated with expression of mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) in a subpopulation of patients with luminal-subtype BC. Down- regulated SASH1 and upregulated MAP4K4 synergistically regulated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of luminalsubtype BC cells. The expression of LATS2, SASH1, and YAP1 and the phosphorylation of YAP1 were negatively regulated by MAP4K4, and LATS2 then phosphorylated SASH1 to form a novel MAP4K4-LATS2-SASH1-YAP1 cascade. Dephosphorylation of Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1), YAP1/TAZ nuclear translocation, and downstream transcriptional regulation of YAP1 were promoted by the combined effects of ectopic MAP4K4 expression and SASH1 silencing. Targeted inhibition of MAP4K4 blocked proliferation, cell migration, and ER signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Our fi ndings reveal a novel MAP4K4-LATS2-SASH1-YAP1 phosphorylation cascade, a noncanonical Hippo pathway that mediates ER signaling, tumorigenesis, and metastasis in breast cancer. Targeted intervention with this noncanonical Hippo pathway may constitute a novel alternative therapeutic approach for endocrine-resistant BC.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of Environmental Enrichment (EE) on neuron morphology in the CA1, CA3 and dentate hilus (DH) regions of the hippocampus by quantitating the total dendritic arborizations. EE is a potential intervention for stress and diabetes. It is capable of mitigating diabetes and stress-induced cognitive and memory deficit. Diabetes and stress were induced in male Wistar rats (4-5 weeks). Diabetic and stressed rats were exposed to EE on Day 2 post STZ injection and subsequently once daily for 30 days. All animals were sacrificed on Day 30. The hippocampus was dissected and processed for Golgi staining to quantitate dendritic arborizations at the CA1, CA2 and DH regions. Diabetes (D) and Diabetes+stress (D+S) groups had significantly fewer apical and basal dendritic branching points (ADBP, BDBP) at CA1 (p<0.01), CA3 (p<0.001) and DH (p<0.001) relative to control group (NC). Diabetes and stressed rats exposed to EE: [D+EE and D+S+EE groups] exhibited significantly denser ADBP and BDBP at all regions relative to D (p<0.001) and (D+S+EE) (p<0.001) groups respectively. EE significantly preserved neuronal arborizations in hippocampus of diabetic and stressed rats, suggesting a potential entity of diabetes and stress management.

AB  - Chronic stress causes several pain conditions including fibromyalgia. Its pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown, and the therapy is unresolved. Since the involvement of interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been described in stress and inflammatory pain but no data are available regarding stress-induced pain, we studied its role in a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model. Female and male C57Bl/6J wild-type (WT) and IL-1 alpha beta-deficient (knock-out: IL-1 KO) mice were exposed to 6 h of immobilization/day for 4 weeks. Mechanonociception, cold tolerance, behavioral alterations, relative thymus/adrenal gland weights, microglia ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) and astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) integrated density, number and morphological transformation in pain-related brain regions were determined. CRS induced 15-20% mechanical hyperalgesia after 2 weeks in WT mice in both sexes, which was significantly reduced in female but not in male IL-1 KOs. Increased IBA1+ integrated density in the central nucleus of amygdala, primary somatosensory cortex hind limb representation part, hippocampus cornu ammonis area 3 (CA3) and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) was present, accompanied by a cell number increase in IBA1+ microglia in stressed female WTs but not in IL-1 KOs. CRS induced morphological changes of GFAP+ astrocytes in WT but not in KO mice. Stress evoked cold hypersensitivity in the stressed animals. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors, thymus and adrenal gland weight changes were detectable in all groups after 2 but not 4 weeks of CRS due to adaptation. Thus, IL-1 mediates chronic stress-induced hyperalgesia in female mice, without other major behavioral alterations, suggesting the analgesic potentials of IL-1 in blocking drugs in stress-related pain syndromes.

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of Camelina sativa cake dietary inclusion on quail meat fatty acids (FA), amino acids (AA), and sensory characteristics. To this, 480 broiler quails were allocated to four dietary treatments (12 replicated cages/treatment): a control diet (Control) and three diets with 15% camelina cake, containing a commercial cultivar (Calena) and two improved lines (Pearl: low linoleic acid; Alan: low glucosinolates). After slaughter, breast meat FA and AA profiles and contents were analysed, alongside a sensory evaluation by trained panellists. The dietary inclusion modified breast meat FA profile and contents (p < .001), notably increasing alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3), which improved overall n-3 PUFA and reduced the n-6/n-3 ratio to recommended levels. Health indices improved in a line-dependent manner: atherogenicity lowered in Alan compared to Control and Calena (p < .01), while thrombogenicity reduced in all camelina treatments than the Control (p < .001). Camelina-fed groups showed an AA profile in line with the Control one, and Pearl displayed a higher essential AA content compared to Alan (p < .05). Sensory results indicated no substantial changes in meat attributes across treatments, except for tenderness and animal fat flavour: the first lowered in Alan meat compared to the Control (p < .05), while the latter was higher in the Control than in Alan and Calena groups (p < .01). In conclusion, the 15% dietary inclusion of different camelina cakes in quail diets positively influenced meat FA, enhancing product healthiness without negatively impacting its nutritional quality and sensory attributes. Findings indicated that camelina cake is an effective feedstuff to improve quail meat quality.HIGHLIGHTSOnce fed to quails, all tested camelina cakes increased meat n-3 PUFA and reduced the n-6/n-3 by about 5 and 7 times, respectively.Meat atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indices of camelina-fed quails improved, indicating enhanced product healthiness.Camelina inclusion did not alter quail meat sensory attributes compared to the control group.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine is one of the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicine therapies for depression. Integrated Chinese-western therapies have been extensively applied in numerous diseases due to their superior efficiency in individual treatment. We used the meta-analysis, network pharmacology, and bioinformatics studies to identify the putative role of Longya Lilium combined with Fluoxetine in depression. Depression-like behaviors were mimicked in mice after exposure to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The underlying potential mechanism of this combination therapy was further explored based on in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the expression of COX-2, PGE2, and IL-22, activation of microglial cells, and neuron viability and apoptosis in the hippocampus. The antidepressant effect was noted for the combination of Longya Lilium with Fluoxetine in mice compared to a single treatment. COX-2 was mainly expressed in hippocampal CA1 areas. Longya Lilium combined with Fluoxetine reduced the expression of COX-2 and thus alleviated depression-like behavior and neuroinflammation in mice. A decrease of COX-2 curtailed BV-2 microglial cell activation, inflammation, and neuron apoptosis by blunting the PGE2/IL-22 axis. Therefore, a combination of Longya Lilium with Fluoxetine inactivates the COX-2/PGE2/IL-22 axis, consequently relieving the neuroinflammatory response and the resultant depression.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly produced in cells, an excess of which causes oxidative stress. ROS has been linked to regulation of the Hippo pathway; however, the underlying detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that MOB1, a substrate of MST1/2 and co-activator of LATS1/2 in the canonical Hippo pathway, interacts with and is acetylated at lysine 11 by acetyltransferase CBP and deacetylated by HDAC6. MOB1-K11 acetylation stabilizes itself by reducing its binding capacity with E3 ligase Praja2 and subsequent ubiquitination. MOB1-K11 acetylation increases its phosphorylation and activates LATS1. Importantly, upstream oxidative stress signals promote MOB1 acetylation by suppressing CBP degradation, independent of MST1/2 kinase activity and HDAC6 deacetylation effect, thereby linking oxidative stress to activation of the Hippo pathway. Functionally, the acetylation-deficient mutant MOB1-K11R promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and accelerates tumor growth in vivo, compared to the wild-type MOB1. Clinically, acetylated MOB1 corresponds to better prediction of overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, as demonstrated, an oxidative stress-CBP regulatory axis controls MOB1-K11 acetylation and activates LATS1, thereby activating the Hippo pathway and suppressing YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation and tumor progression.

AB  - Maniraptoran dinosaurs include the ancestors of birds, and most used their hands for grasping and in flight, but early-branching maniraptorans had extraordinary claws of mysterious function. Alvarezsauroids had short, strong arms and hands with a stout, rock-pick-like, single functional finger. Therizinosaurians had elongate fingers with slender and sickle-like unguals, sometimes over one metre long. Here we develop a comprehensive methodological framework to investigate what the functions of these most bizarre bony claws are and how they formed. Our analysis includes finite element analysis and a newly established functional-space analysis and also involves shape and size effects in an assessment of function and evolution. We find a distinct functional divergence among manual unguals of early-branching maniraptorans, and we identify a complex relationship between their structural strength, morphological specialisations, and size changes. Our analysis reveals that efficient digging capabilities only emerged in late-branching alvarezsauroid forelimbs, rejecting the hypothesis of functional vestigial structures like T. rex. Our results also support the statement that most therizinosaurians were herbivores. However, the bizarre, huge Therizinosaurus had sickle-like unguals of such length that no mechanical function has been identified; we suggest they were decorative and lengthened by peramorphic growth linked to increased body size.
   Biomechanical and shape analyses explore the function of forelimb claws, revealing adaptations for digging and display in maniraptoran theropods.

AB  - Recent work has revealed that spontaneous release plays critical roles in the central nervous system, but how it is regulated remains elusive. Here, we report that synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11), a Ca2+-independent Syt isoform associated with schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, suppressed spontaneous release. Syt11-knockout hippocampal neurons showed an increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents while over-expression of Syt11 inversely decreased the frequency. Neither knockout nor over-expression of Syt11 affected the average amplitude, suggesting the pre-synaptic regulation of spontaneous neurotransmission by Syt11. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and affinity-purification experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of Syt11 with vps10p-tail-interactor-1a (vti1a), a non-canonical SNARE protein that maintains spontaneous release. Importantly, knockdown of vti1a reversed the phenotype of Syt11 knockout, identifying vti1a as the main target of Syt11 inhibition. Domain analysis revealed that the C2A domain of Syt11 bound vti1a with high affinity. Consistently, expression of the C2A domain alone rescued the phenotype of elevated spontaneous release in Syt11-knockout neurons similar to the full-length protein. Altogether, our results suggest that Syt11 inhibits vti1a-containing vesicles during spontaneous release.

AB  - BackgroundSemen Aesculi, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has a long history of use for treating chest and abdominal pain with distension. In addition, the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) is another species of Aesculus in Europe and has notable clinical significance in alleviating chronic venous insufficiency, hemorrhoids, and postoperative edema. Thus, highlighting the comparative study of Semen Aesculi and horse chestnut may broaden clinical applications. ObjectivesTo conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis on the chemical profiling of these two varieties and determine whether they have equivalent clinical efficacy by integrating plant metabolomics and multivariate statistical methods. MethodsInitially, a comprehensive characterisation was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) platform, and in total 44 active ingredients were identified. Then, untargeted metabolomics combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied for the discrimination of a German species and three official Chinese species. Next, 24 marker compounds responsible for the discrimination of different species were screened out and used to predict the species of unknown samples by genetic algorithm-optimised support vector machine (GA-SVM) with a high prediction accuracy. Finally, a heatmap visualisation was employed for clarifying the distribution of the identified active ingredients. ResultsThe three species of Chinese Semen Aesculi showed distinct separation from each other, while European horse chestnut and Aesculus chinensis Bunge were similar in chemical composition. ConclusionsThis work provided experimental evidence for further expanding the clinical application of Chinese Semen Aesculi and promoted the species identification and quality control of Semen Aesculi.

AB  - We previously have found in mice that reducing the body temperature only during cerebral ischemia prevents the development of delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Inflammatory responses are profoundly involved in the development of neuronal death associated with cerebral ischemia, and the expression of inflammation-related genes and the accumulation and activation of glial cells are upregulated after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in neuroinflammation. In this study, the effect of hypothermia (HT) during GCI on the expression of inflammation-related genes and the accumulation and activation of glial cells in the hippocampus after reperfusion was investigated. As a result, we found that increases in mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, CCL2, and COX-2 after GCI-reperfusion were suppressed by HT during GCI. Immunohistochemical evaluation also showed that HT during GCI suppressed the enhancement of the expression of the ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein 1 (Iba1), a microglial marker, by GCI in the hippocampus, whereas that of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytic marker, was unaffected by HT. Our findings suggest that HT during GCI suppresses the inflammatory responses after reperfusion in the hippocampus, particularly the accumulation of activated microglia, and elucidating the mechanism may lead to the development of novel neuroprotective drugs.

AB  - Impaired cerebral inhibition is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders and may represent a vulnerability factor for their development. The hippocampus plays a key role in inhibition among adults and undergoes significant and rapid changes during early brain development. Therefore, the structure represents an important candidate region for early identification of pathology that is relevant to inhibitory dysfunction. To determine whether hippocampal function corresponds to inhibition in the early postnatal period, the present study evaluated relationships between hippocampal activity and sensory gating in infants 4-20 weeks of age (N = 18). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure hippocampal activity, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and fractional ALFF. Electroencephalography during a paired-stimulus paradigm was used to measure sensory gating (P50). Higher activity of the right hippocampus was associated with better sensory gating (P50 ratio), driven by a reduction in response to the second stimulus. These findings suggest that meaningful effects of hippocampal function can be detected early in infancy. Specifically, higher intrinsic hippocampal activity in the early postnatal period may support effective inhibitory processing. Future work will benefit from longitudinal analysis to clarify the trajectory of hippocampal function, alterations of which may contribute to the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and represent an intervention target.

AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a prevalent hemorrhagic cerebrovascular emergency. Alleviating neurological damage in the early stages of ICH is critical for enhancing patient prognosis and survival rate. A novel form of cell death called ferroptosis is intimately linked to hemorrhage-induced brain tissue injury. Although studies have demonstrated the significant preventive impact of bovine serum albumin-stabilized selenium nanoparticles (BSA-SeNPs) against disorders connected to the neurological system, the neuroprotective effect on the hemorrhage stroke and the mechanism remain unknown. Therefore, based on the favorable biocompatibility of BSASeNPs, h-ICH (hippocampus-intracerebral hemorrhage) model was constructed to perform BSA-SeNPs therapy. As expected, these BSA-SeNPs could effectively improve the cognitive deficits and ameliorate the damage of hippocampal neuron. Furthermore, BSA-SeNPs reverse the morphology of mitochondria and enhanced the mitochondrial function, evidenced by mitochondrial respiration function (OCR) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Mechanistically, BSA-SeNPs could efficiently activate the Nrf2 to enhance the expression of antioxidant GPX4 at mRNA and protein levels, and further inhibit lipid peroxidation production in erastininduced ferroptotic damages. Taken together, this study not only sheds light on the clinical application of BSA-SeNPs, but also provides its newly theoretical support for the strategy of the intervention and treatment of neurological impairment following ICH.

AB  - Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is a common central nervous system complication of diabetes mellitus without effective therapy currently. Recent studies have highlighted synaptic mitochondrial damages as a possible pathological basis for DE, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous work has revealed that phosphatidate phosphatase Lipin1, a critical enzyme involved with phospholipid synthesis, is closely related to the pathogenesis of DE. Here, we demonstrate that Lipin1 is significantly down-regulated in rat hippocampus of DE. Knock-down of Lipin1 within hippocampus of normal rats induces dysregulation of homeostasis in synaptic mitochondrial dynamics with an increase of mitochondrial fission and a decrease of fusion, then causes synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic plasticity deficits as well as cognitive impairments, similar to that observed in response to chronic hyperglycemia exposure. In contrast, an up-regulation of Lipin1 within hippocampus in the DE model ameliorates this cascade of dysfunction. We also find that the effect of Lipin1 that regulating mitochondrial dynamics results from maintaining appropriate phospholipid components in the mitochondrial membrane. In conclusion, alterations in hippocampal Lipin1 contribute to hippocampal synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive deficits observed in DE. Targeting Lipin1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of DE.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined how aerobic exercise affect the IL-33/ST2-MyD88 signaling pathway in mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depression Method: Thirty-six C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned t three groups: a control group (CG), a model group (MG), and an exercise group (ME). We created a depression model using chronic unpredictable mild stress, after which the ME group underwent 8 weeks of aerobic training. After exercise intervention, neurobehavioral assessment was performed. ELISA was used to detect the levels of IL-33, IL-1(3 and IL-10 in the serum of mice. Toluidine blue Nissl staining was used to observe the structure of hippocampal neurons. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples using magnetic beads and from hippocampal tissue or neurons using Trizol. The levels of IL-33, ST2, MyD88, IL-1(3, IL-10 and NF-kappa B mRNA in mice were detected by RT-PCR Result: The number of lattice crossings and modification times were significantly reduced in MG group, the exercise time was significantly shortened, and the sugar and water preference index was significantly reduced, while the immobility time in forced swimming and tail suspension tests were significantly prolonged. The results indicated that CUMS successfully induced anhedonia and depression-like behaviors in the mice. In the ME group, there was a significant increase in the number of crossing lattices, modification times, exercise duration, and sugar and water preference index, while the immobility time in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests significantly decreased. Compared with the CG group, serum levels of inflammatory factors IL-33, IL-1(3, and NF kappa B significantly increased in the MG group, while these levels significantly decreased in the ME group. It decreased and IL-10 showed a very significant increase. Nissl staining results indicated that hippocampal nerve cells in MG group were sparsely arranged, with widened gaps, severe nucleus contraction, and shallow staining. The ME group had reduced neuronal vacuoles and improved nuclear shrinkage. Immunohistochemical results revealed that in MG group, the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1(3 and MyD88 increased. In Contrast, the ME group exhibited a decrease in IL-1(3 and MyD88, alongside a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. In the RT-PCR test results, the blood inflammation signal pathway IL-33/ST2 and its downstream factors MyD88, NF-kappa B, and IL-1(3 mRNA were significantly up-regulated, and the inhibitory factor IL-10 mRNA was up-regulated in MG group. Gene expression trends for IL-33 mRNA, ST2 mRNA, IL-1(3 mRNA, MyD88 mRNA and NF-kappa B mRNA in hippocampus tissue were similar to those in blood, all showing significant up-regulation. In contrast, IL-10 mRNA did not exhibit significant up-regulation. While IL-33/ST2 expression did not significantly decrease, other pro-inflammatory factors showed significant down-regulation, and anti-inflammatory factors demonstrated significant up-regulated. Similarly, IL-33 mRNA, ST2 mRNA and MyD88 mRNA expressions in the hippocampus of ME mice mirrored the changes observed in blood when compared to MG mice. NF-kappa B mRNA was significantly down-regulated, while IL-1(3 mRNA showed no significant change, and IL-10 mRNA was up-regulated, albeit not significantly. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise may counteract the CUMS depression model in mice by regulating the IL-33/ST2-MyD88 signaling pathway.
   The strong correlation of inflammatory cytokines between blood and hippocampus indicated that assessing inflammatory damage in the hippocampus could be done through blood tests of the signaling pathway and related cytokine levels.

AB  - A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation rat model was used to study the effects of ouabain (OUA) at low concentrations, which can interact with the Na,K-ATPase, causing the modulation of intracellular signalling pathways in the Central Nervous System. Our study aimed to analyse the effects of OUA on glutamate transport in the hippocampus of rats with LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: OUA (1.8 mu g/kg), saline (CTR), LPS (200 mu g/kg), and OUA + LPS (OUA 20 min before LPS). The animals were sacrificed after 2 h, and the hippocampus was collected for analysis. After treatment, we determined the activities of Na,K-ATPase and glutamine synthetase (GS). In addition, expression of the alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase and the glutamate transporters, EAAT1 and EAAT2, were also analysed. Treatment with OUA caused a specific increase in the alpha 2 isoform expression (similar to 20%), whereas LPS decreased its expression (similar to 22%), and treatment with OUA before LPS prevented the effects of LPS. Moreover, LPS caused a decrease of approximately 50% in GS activity compared with that in the CTR group; however, OUA pre-treatment attenuated this effect of LPS. Notably, it was found that treatment with OUA caused an increase in the expression of EAAT1 (similar to 30%) and EAAT2 (similar to 25%), whereas LPS caused a decrease in the expression of EAAT1 (similar to 23%) and EAAT2 (similar to 25%) compared with that in the CTR group. When treated with OUA, the effects of LPS were abrogated. In conclusion, the OUA pre-treatment abolished the effect caused by LPS, suggesting that this finding may be related to the restoration of the interaction between FXYD2 and the studied membrane proteins.

AB  - This work describes an untargeted analytical approach for the screening, identification, and characterization of the trans-epithelial transport of green tea (Camellia sinensis) catechin extracts with in vitro inhibitory effect against the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) activity. After specific catechin extraction, a chromatographic separation obtained six fractions were carried out. The fractions were assessed in vitro against the PLpro target. Fraction 5 showed the highest inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (IC50 of 0.125 mu g mL(-1)). The untargeted characterization revealed that (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) was the most abundant compound in the fraction and the primary molecule absorbed by differentiated Caco-2 cells. Results indicated that fraction 5 was approximately 10 times more active than ECG (IC50 value equal to 11.62 & PLUSMN; 0.47 mu g mL(-1)) to inhibit the PLpro target. Overall, our findings highlight the synergistic effects of the various components of the crude extract compared to isolated ECG.

AB  - Hepatocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80% of all adult liver cancers. In the present report, data on the cytotoxicity of African medicinal plants and their phytoconstituents against HCC cell line HepG2 were retrieved from various scientific databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Scholar Google. They were further compiled and ranked according to the established cut-off values for cytotoxic products from a natural source, to identify the potential phytomedicine. A total of 45 active cytotoxic botanicals and 112 phytochemicals are documented. The most active botanicals in HepG2 cells were those from Millettia macrophylla, Elephantopus mollis, Albizia adianthifolia, Curcuma longa, Prosopis farcta, and Gladiolus segetum. The 10 most active phytochemicals against HepG2 were 2-acetyl-7-methoxynaphtho[2,3-b]furan4,9-quinone (1), plumbagin (2), longistylin A (3), hydnocarpin (4), isotetrandrine (5), canniflavone (6), 3-O-[beta-(D)-glucopyranosyl-(1-2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-4)-beta-(D)-xylopyranosyl]-2 beta,3 beta,16 alpha-trihydroxyolean-12-en-23,28-dioic acid-28-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-4)-alpha-(l)-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-2)-beta-(d)-glucopyranosyl-(1-2)-alpha-(l)-arabinopyranoside (7), thonningiol (8), 8,8-bis-(dihydroconiferyl)-diferulate (9), isogarcinol (10), and isoxanthochymol (16). Scientists are prompted to perform further in-depth studies on these natural products to develop new drugs to combat liver cancers.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out in the municipality of Coronel Pacheco, Minas Gerais State, Brazil in 2020 and 2021 to identify additional herbicide options for weed control during early elephant grass pasture establishment. Thirteen pre-emergence herbicides were compared to svecel-free and werely-controls in arenelomtced complete bloek-design-with- 4 replications. Forage yield losses were significant as a result of weed interference throughout the entire crop cycle. The most phytotoxic treatments were trifluralin and diuron hexazinone. Weed control was effective for all treatments, except for trifluralin applied alone. Elephant grass dry matter yield was not influenced by diuron, ametryne, flumioxazin and metribuzin, identifying them as potential pre-emergence herbicides for weed control in elephant grass pastures.

AB  - Introduction Widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in bacterial multiple drug resistance, thereby searching for natural antimicrobial agents from plants becomes an effective and alternative approach. In the present study, we selected six foodborne bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial activities of 12 medicinal plants ethyl acetate (EA) extracts. Objective This study aims to search for natural antibiotic substitutes from plant extracts. The antibacterial components were further discussed through chemometric and mass spectroscopic analyses. Methodology Agar well diffusion and the microdilution methods were used to test the antibacterial activity. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were used to judge the active phytochemicals. To further characterise the potential antibacterial components, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) coupled with Pearson correlation and feature-based molecular network (FBMN) were proposed. Results Most of the plant extracts possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi. Toona sinensis shoots and Firmiana simplex barks showed high inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysenteriae, and Escherichia coli strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 mg/mL, respectively. Salmonella typhi was highly sensitive to Firmiana simplex barks with an inhibitory diameter up to 21.67 +/- 0.95 mm, and MIC at 0.78 mg/mL. Moreover, Toona sinensis shoots and Firmiana simplex barks had the highest TPCs. Conclusion Our results indicated that Toona sinensis shoots, Koelreuteria paniculate seeds, and Firmiana simplex barks could be supplied as potential sources of antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, 36 potential bioactive compounds were identified mainly as polyphenols, glycosides, and terpenoids.

AB  - Human prion and non-prion neurodegenerative diseases share pathogenic mechanisms and neuropathological features. The lesion profile of a particular entity results from specific involvement of vulnerable neuron populations and connectivity circuits by a pathogenic protein isoform with strain-like properties. The lesion profile of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was studied in postmortem tissue of 143 patients with human prion disease (HPD) including sporadic, genetic, and acquired forms. Most cases (90%) were classified according to PrPres type and/or PRNP codon 129 status, in addition to a full neuropathological profile. Mixed histotypes represented 29.4% of total sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) cases. An intensity score of involvement including spongiosis and astrogliosis was determined for the amygdala, presubiculum, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, CA1 to CA4 sectors of the hippocampal cortex, and dentate gyrus. Connectivity hubs within the MTL presented the highest scores. Diverse lesion profiles were obtained for different types and subtypes of HPD. Impact of mixed PrPres types on the MTL lesion profile was higher for sCJDMV2K cases than in other histotypes. Differences between MTL profiles was globally consistent with current evidence on specific strains in HPD. These results may be relevant for the analysis of possible strain effects in focal non-prion neurodegenerative conditions limited to the MTL.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a typical type of inflammatory bowl disease, which is accompanied by an increased risk of depression and anxiety-related psychological symptoms. Betaine is a naturally derived compound that can function as an anti-inflammatory drug and a neuromodulator. In-depth exploration of the potential role of betaine in treating UC-related depression and anxiety is crucial. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of betaine on UC-related depression and anxiety and clarify the underlying mechanisms. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice model was established by 4% DSS drinking ad libitum for 7 days. The colonic injury was measured using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff (AB-PAS) staining. Depression and anxiety-like behaviors were separately evaluated using a forced swimming test (FST), a tail suspension test (TST), a light-dark box test (LDBT), and an open field test (OFT). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect DNA damage and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Western blotting was applied to detect the protein levels of macrophage polarization in mice colons and the alteration of mitochondrial dysfunction and the cGAS-STING pathway in the hippocampus. Betaine strongly alleviated mucosal structural disorder and mucin secretion reduction and promoted M2-macrophage polarization in the colon of DSS-treated mice. In addition, betaine could mitigate depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in DSS-treated mice, reduce the DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibit the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Our study reveals the antidepression/anxiety effects of betaine and further demonstrates the potential mechanism by which betaine inhibits DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction to block the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby repairing neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate, through in vivo and in vitro methodologies, the effect of acute trans, trans-farnesol (12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.) administration on behavioral and neurochemical parameters associated with pilocarpine-induced epileptic seizure (300 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice. The initial results showed that the compound in question presents no anxiolytic-like or myorelaxant effects, despite reducing locomotor activity in the animals at all doses tested. In addition, the lowest dose increased the latency to onset of the first epileptic seizure, and the time to death. In addition to decreasing the mortality percentage in mice submitted to the pilocarpine model. In this same model, pretreatment with the lowest dose of the compound decreased the hippocampal concentrations of thiobarbituric acid and nitrite, and partially restored striatal concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Taken together, the results suggest that trans,trans-farnesol presents a central depressant effect which contributes to its antiepileptic action which, in turn, seems to be mediated by the antagonism of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, reduction of oxidative stress. and modulation of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system.

AB  - The present study aimed to identify crucial tipping points during neuronal development in a post-mitotic state using Raman spectroscopy and a dynamic network biomarker (DNB) analysis. A DNB analysis is a promising method to detect early signal during state transition. We previously developed an in vitro model that mimics neuronal development. The neurodevelopmental model was generated from a principal component analysis (PCA) with a Raman spectral dataset obtained from rat hippocampal neurons cultured for 120 days. In the present study, a DNB analysis was employed to identify the tipping point during the maturation of neurons. We reused the Raman spectral dataset obtained in our previous study. Based on our previous PCA findings, the dataset obtained from neurons after 8 days of culture was used in the DNB analysis. Raman spectral fluctuations were observed after 15 days of culturing. The Raman band of lactate (1048 cm-1) was identified as a DNB Raman band. These results suggest that lactate acts as an energy source and a factor affecting neuronal development. The present study also indicates that PCA effectively established the control group for a DNB analysis.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is a pleiotropic hormone with multiple functions in several tissues and organs, including the brain. PRL decreases lesion-induced microgliosis and modifies gene expression related to microglial functions in the hippocampus, thereby providing a possible mechanism through which it might participate in neuroimmune modulatory responses and prevent neuronal cell damage. However, the direct contribution of microglial cells to PRL-mediated neuroprotection is still unclear and no studies have yet documented whether PRL can directly activate cellular pathways in microglial cells. The aim of this study is to elucidate in vitro actions of PRL on the immortalized SIM-A9 microglia cell line in basal and LPS-stimulated conditions. PRL alone induced a time-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. Pretreatment with PRL attenuated LPS (200 ng/ml) stimulated pro-inflammatory markers: nitric oxide (NO) levels, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukins (IL)-6, -1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) expression at 20 nM dosage. PRL suppressed LPS-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappa appaB (NF-kappa B) p65 subunit phosphorylation and its upstream p-ERK1/2 activity. In conclusion, PRL exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated SIM-A9 microglia by downregulating pro-inflammatory mediators corresponding to suppression of LPS-activated ERK1/2 and NF-kappa B phosphorylation.

AB  - In vitro studies have shown that hippocampal pyramidal neurons employ a mechanism similar to stochastic resonance (SR) to enhance the detection and transmission of weak stimuli generated at distal synapses. To support the experimental findings from the perspective of multicompartment model analysis, this paper aimed to elucidate the phenomenon of SR in a noisy two-compartment hippocampal pyramidal neuron model, which was a variant of the Pinsky-Rinzel neuron model with smooth activation functions and a hyperpolarization-activated cation current. With a bifurcation analysis of the model, we demonstrated the underlying dynamical structure responsible for the occurrence of SR. Furthermore, using a stochastically generated biphasic pulse train and broadband noise generated by the Orenstein-Uhlenbeck process as noise perturbation, both SR and suprathreshold SR were observed and quantified. Spectral analysis revealed that the distribution of spectral power under noise perturbations, in addition to inherent neurodynamics, is the main factor affecting SR behavior. The research results suggested that noise enhances the transmission of weak stimuli associated with elongated dendritic structures of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, thereby providing support for related laboratory findings.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Due to the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the influence of traditional medication habits (TCM has no toxicity or side effects), arsenic poisoning incidents caused by the abuse of realgar and realgar-containing Chinese patent medicines have occurred occasionally. However, the potential mechanism of central nervous system toxicity of realgar remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to clarify the specific mechanism of realgar-induced neurotoxicity. Materials and methods: In this study, the roles of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in realgar-induced neuronal autophagy and overactivation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor (Nrf2) signalling pathways was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Results: The arsenic in realgar passed through the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in the brain, resulting in damage to neurons, synapses and myelin sheaths in the cerebral cortex and a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity. The specific mechanism is that the excessive activation of Nrf2 is regulated by the upstream signalling molecules ERK1/2 and p38MAPK. At the same time, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 interfere with autophagy, thereby promoting autophagy initiation but causing subsequent dysfunctional autophagic degradation and inducing the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 feedback loop to promote Nrf2 signalling pathway activation and nerve cell apoptosis. Conclusions: This study confirmed the role of the signalling molecules p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in perturbing autophagy and inducing the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 feedback loop to activate the Nrf2 signalling pathway in realgarinduced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) characterized by hyperglycemia leads to a variety of complications, including cognitive impairment or memory loss. The hippocampus is a key brain area for learning and memory and is one of the regions that is most sensitive to diabetes. However, the pathogenesis of diabetic neuronal lesion is not yet completely understood. We focused on the association of microglia activation and brain lesions in diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether and how signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in microglia affects neuronal lesions in diabetic brains. Using a streptozotocin-induced type 1 DM model, we showed enhanced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis that was associated with increased STAT3 activation. We found that hyperglycemia increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-6, in the diabetic hippocampus. In particular, IFN-gamma induced autocrine activation of microglia, and STAT3 activation is important for this process. We also demonstrated that STAT3 activation in microglia increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression; subsequently, TNF-alpha increased neuronal apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the neuronal cells. We also took advantage of mice lacking STAT3 in microglia and demonstrated that depletion of microglial STAT3 reduced neuronal apoptosis in the diabetic hippocampus. Taken together, these results suggest that STAT3 activation in microglia plays an important role in hyperglycemia-induced neuronal apoptosis in the diabetic hippocampus and provide a potential therapeutic benefit of STAT3 inhibition in microglia for preventing diabetic neuronal lesions.

AB  - Ethnophamacological relevance: Morinda officinalis oligosaccharides (MOs) is a mixture of oligosaccharides extracted from the roots of Morinda officinalis (MO). It is approved by Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for depression treatment. MOs could improve the antidepressant efficacy of escitalopram in clinic. Aim of the study: We aim to explore the antidepressant activity and potential mechanism of the combination usage of MOs and escitalopram on animal model of depression. Materials and methods: Depressive animal model was induced by chronic mild stress (CMS). Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of MOs and escitalopram. Serum neurotransmitter levels were detected by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were applied to assay the hippocampus neurotrophic factors ' mRNA and protein levels. Peripheral cytokines levels were measured through Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Micorglia polization phenotype was assayed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Results: MOs and escitalopram obviously attenuated depression -like behaviors of CMS mice. Importantly, MOs plus escitalopram exhibited better antidepressant activity on CMS mice than monotherapy. At the same time, MOs combined escitalopram treatment significantly increased hippocampus neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factor levels, stimulated hippocampus neurogenesis and relieved central nervous system (CNS) microglia overactivation of CMS mice. The combination therapy had greater effect on neuroprotection and inflammation attenuation of CMS mice than monotherapy. Conclusion: Our results indicates MOs combined escitalopram might produce antidepressant activity through protecting neuron activity, relieving inflammation and modulating microglia polarization process.

AB  - Pharmacological suppression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase (GABA-T), the sole GABA-degrading enzyme and a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders such as epilepsy, increases not only phasic inhibition but also tonic inhibition. However, the specific cellular source, neuromodulatory effects and potential therapeutic benefits of this enhanced tonic inhibition remain unexplored due to the lack of cell-type-specific gene manipulation studies. Here we report that the increase in tonic GABA currents observed after GABA-T suppression is predominantly due to increased tonic GABA release from astrocytes rather than action-potential-dependent synaptic GABA spillover. General GABA-T knockdown (KD) by a short hairpin RNA considerably increased tonic GABA currents in dentate granule cells, thereby enhancing tonic inhibition. An astrocyte-specific rescue of GABA-T following general GABA-T KD normalized the elevated tonic GABA currents to near control levels. Tetrodotoxin-insensitive tonic GABA currents were significantly increased after general GABA-T KD, whereas tetrodotoxin-sensitive tonic GABA currents showed no significant increase, suggesting that this enhanced tonic inhibition is primarily action-potential independent. General GABA-T KD reduced the spike probability of granule cells and impaired dorsal hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, which were fully reversed by astrocyte-specific GABA-T rescue. These findings suggest that suppressing astrocytic GABA-T may be sufficient to influence the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain and associated behaviors. Our study implies that the therapeutic benefits of pharmacological GABA-T suppression may be largely attributed to the modulation of astrocytic GABA-T and its impact on tonic GABA release from astrocytes.Here, we report distinct effects of GABA-T suppression depending on cell type; suppressing GABA-T in astrocytes enhances tonic inhibition, while its suppression in GABAergic neurons augments phasic inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that targeted suppression of astrocytic GABA-T not only enhances tonic GABA release from astrocytes but also significantly influences the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain, with consequential effects on behavior. This suggests that astrocytic GABA-T modulation holds promising potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating cognitive and neurological disorders through the regulation of astrocytic GABA metabolism.

AB  - The entorhinal cortex is of great importance in cognition and memory, its dysfunction causes a variety of neurological diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet so far, research on entorhinal cortex is still limited. Here, we provided the first single-nucleus transcriptomic map of primate entorhinal cortex aging. Our result revealed that synapse signaling, neurogenesis, cellular homeostasis, and inflammation-related genes and pathways changed in a cell-type-specific manner with age. Moreover, among the 7 identified cell types, we highlighted the neuronal lineage that was most affected by aging. By integrating multiple datasets, we found entorhinal cortex aging was closely related to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, particularly for AD. The expression levels of APP and MAPT, which generate beta-amyloid (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, were increased in most aged entorhinal cortex cell types. In addition, we found that neuronal lineage in the aged entorhinal cortex is more prone to AD and identified a subpopulation of excitatory neurons that are most highly associated with AD. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas of the primate entorhinal cortex at single-cell resolution and provides new insights into potential therapeutic targets against age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The pain-relieving properties of opioids in inflammatory and neuropathic pain are heightened by hydrogen sulfide (H2S). However, whether allodynia and functional and/or emotional impairments related to osteoarthritis (OA) could be reduced by activating delta-opioid receptors (DOR) and the plausible influence of H2S on these actions has not been completely established. In female C57BL/6J mice with OA pain generated via monosodium acetate (MIA), we analyze: (i) the effects of UFP-512 (a DOR agonist), given alone and co-administered with two H2S donors, on the symptoms of allodynia, loss of grip strength (GS), and anxiodepressive-like comportment; (ii) the reversion of UFP-512 actions with naltrindole (a DOR antagonist), and (iii) the impact of UFP-512 on the expression of phosphorylated NF-kB inhibitor alpha (p-IKB alpha) and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) and glutathione sulfur transferase M1 (GSTM1); and the effects of H2S on DOR levels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), amygdala (AMG), and hippocampus (HIP) of MIA-injected animals. Results showed that systemic and local administration of UFP-512 dose-dependently diminished the allodynia and loss of GS caused by MIA, whose effects were potentiated by H2S and reversed by naltrindole. UFP-512 also inhibited anxiodepressive-like behaviors, normalized the overexpression of p-IKB alpha in DRG and HIP, and enhanced the expression of SOD-1 and GSTM1 in DRG, HIP, and/or AMG. Moreover, the increased expression of DOR triggered by H2S might support the improved analgesic actions of UFP-512 co-administered with H2S donors. This study proposes the use of DOR agonists, alone or combined with H2S donors, as a new treatment for OA pain.

AB  - Pneumonia causes short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in a high proportion of patients, although the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pneumonia-elicited cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants: (1) are present in the circulation during infection; (2) lead to impairment of long-term potentiation; and, (3) inhibit long-term potentiation dependent upon tau. Cytotoxic amyloid and tau species were recovered from the blood and the hippocampus following pneumonia, and they were present in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation oxygenators of patients with pneumonia, especially in those who died. Introduction of immunopurified blood-borne amyloid and tau into either the airways or the blood of uninfected animals acutely and chronically impaired hippocampal information processing. In contrast, the infection did not impair long-term potentiation in tau knockout mice and the amyloid- and tau-dependent disruption in hippocampal signaling was less severe in tau knockout mice. Moreover, the infection did not elicit cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants in tau knockout mice. Therefore, pneumonia initiates a tauopathy that contributes to cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Pyroptosis is closely involved in the pathopoiesis of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury which seriously dangers human's life. Studies report that tangeretin (TANG), which is enriched in the peel of Citrus reticulata, has neuroprotective effects. Here, we explored whether absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis is involved in the cerebral I/R injury and the protective mechanism of TANG against cerebral I/R injury. In this study, we found that TANG treatment effectively alleviated I/R-induced brain injury and inhibited neuronal pyroptosis in an in vivo mice model with middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury and in an in vitro hippocampal HT22 cell model with oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury. Furthermore, we found TANG inhibited cerebral I/R-induced neuronal AIM2 inflammasome activation in vivo and in vitro via regulating nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Moreover, administration of ML385, a chemical inhibitor of NRF2, notably blocked the neuroprotective effects of TANG against cerebral I/R injury. In conclusion, TANG attenuates cerebral I/R-induced neuronal pyroptosis by inhibiting AIM2 inflammasome activation via regulating NRF2. These findings indicate TANG is a potential therapeutic agent for cerebral I/R injury.

AB  - Background Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that involves cognitive and motor dysfunctions due to hepatic failure. The clinical and experimental studies suggest that the angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme (ACE), Ang II, and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), which compose the classical pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), exacerbate neuroinflammation in different neurologic diseases. Conversely, Ang-(1-7), ACE2, and Mas receptor, which integrate the alternative RAS axis, have been shown as promising therapeutic targets in neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to neuroprotection. Objective This study aimed to investigate the potential participation of the RAS components in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE in mice. Methods We also evaluated the levels of neurotrophic factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokine in the central nervous system of TAA-induced HE in mice. Mice were submitted to acute liver failure induced by TAA administration by intraperitoneal route. Measurements of RAS components (ACE, Ang II, ACE2 and Ang1-7) and neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF and NGF) were obtained by ELISA assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-12p70) and the chemokine (CCL2) were quantified by cytometric bead array. The student's t-test was applied for statistical analysis. Results Mice presented increased cortical levels of ACE, while Ang-(1-7) levels were decreased in cortical and hippocampal samples compared to controls. Moreover, HE mice had an increase in the Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio along with reduced levels of neural growth factor (NGF) in the prefrontal cortex. They also showed elevated levels of IFN-gamma and CCL2 in the prefrontal cortex and of TNF, IL-6, IL-12, and CCL2 in the hippocampus compared with controls. Conclusion This study suggested that the reduction of components of the alternative RAS axis was associated with the deleterious effects of neuroinflammation and lower neuroprotective effects of NGF during TAA-induced HE.

AB  - Background: It is now widespread in livestock and plant breeding to use genotyping data to predict phenotypes with genomic prediction models. In parallel, genomic annotations related to a variety of traits are increasing in number and granularity, providing valuable insight into potentially important positions in the genome. The BayesRC model integrates this prior biological information by factorizing the genome according to disjoint annotation categories, in some cases enabling improved prediction of heritable traits. However, BayesRC is not adapted to cases where markers may have multiple annotations.
   Results: We propose two novel Bayesian approaches to account for multi-annotated markers through a cumulative (BayesRC+) or preferential (BayesRC pi) model of the contribution of multiple annotation categories. We illustrate their performance on simulated data with various genetic architectures and types of annotations. We also explore their use on data from a backcross population of growing pigs in conjunction with annotations constructed using the PigQTLdb. In both simulated and real data, we observed a modest improvement in prediction quality with our models when used with informative annotations. In addition, our results show that BayesRC+ successfully prioritizes multi-annotated markers according to their posterior variance, while BayesRC pi provides a useful interpretation of informative annotations for multi-annotated markers. Finally, we explore several strategies for constructing annotations from a public database, highlighting the importance of careful consideration of this step.
   Conclusion: When used with annotations that are relevant to the trait under study, BayesRC pi and BayesRC+ allow for improved prediction and prioritization of multi-annotated markers, and can provide useful biological insight into the genetic architecture of traits.

AB  - Functional data analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing complex patterns and relationships in a variety of fields, allowing for more precise modeling, visualization, and decision-making. For example, in healthcare, functional data such as medical images can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans. However, understanding the causal relationships between functional predictors and time-to-event outcomes remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a functional causal framework including a functional accelerated failure time (FAFT) model and three causal effect estimation approaches. The regression adjustment approach is based on conditional FAFT with subsequent confounding marginalization, while the functional-inverse-probability-weighting approach is based on marginal FAFT with well-defined functional propensity scores. The double robust approach combines the strengths of both methods and is robust to model specifications. Our method provides accurate causal effect estimations and is robust to different censoring rates. We demonstrate the performance of our framework with simulations and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Our findings provide more precise subregions of the hippocampus that align with medical research, highlighting the power of this work for improving healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Except for biochemical effects, suspension state (Sus) is proved to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) mechanically. However, the difference between the effects of the mechanical microenvironment in capillaries (simplified as shear stress (SS) and Sus) and single Sus on EMT is unclear, nor the underlying mechanism. Here, breast tumor cells (BTCs) were loaded with Sus and SS to mimic the situation of CTCs stimulated by these two kinds of mechanics. It was demonstrated that the EMT of BTCs was enhanced by Sus and SS and the mechanotransductor yes-associated protein (YAP) was partially cytoplasmic stored with microRNA (miR)-29b decreased, which was detected by miR sequencing. Though it couldn't possess a feedback regulation, YAP promoted miR-29b expression and posttranscriptionally regulated BTCs EMT through miR-29b, where transforming growth factor beta involved. Analysis of clinical database showed that high miR-29b expression was beneficial to high survival rate stabilizing its role of tumor suppressor. This study discovers the mechanism that Sus and SS promote BTCs EMT by YAP through miR-29b posttranscriptionally and highlight the potential of YAP and miR-29b in tumor therapy.

AB  - The flavonoid constituents of Aesculus wilsonii , a source of the Chinese medicinal drug Suo Luo Zi, and their in vitro anti-inflammatory effects were investigated. Fifteen flavonoids, including aeswilflavonosides IA-IC (1-3) and aeswilflavonosides IIA-IIE (4-8), along with seven known derivatives were isolated from a seed extract. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods, acid and alkaline hydrolysis, and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. Among them, compounds 3 and 7 possess a 5-[2-(carboxymethyl)-5-oxocyclopent-yl]pent-3-enylate or oleuropeoylate substituent, respectively, which are rarely reported in flavonoids. Compounds 2, 3, 7 , and 12-15 were found to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cell lines. In a mechanistic assay, the flavonoid glycosides 2, 3 , and 7 reduced the expressions of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced by lipopolysaccharide. Further investigations suggest that 2 and 3 downregulated the protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38. Compound 7 was found to reduce the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 through inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B signaling pathway. Compounds 2, 3 , and 7 possessed moderate inhibitory activity on the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3. Taken together, the data indicate that the flavonoid glycosides of A. wilsonii seeds exhibit nitric oxide release inhibitory activity through mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 cross-talk signaling pathways.

AB  - Background Increased exposure of humans to toxic metals and high-fat diet (HFD) consumption severely damages brain health. Natural plant extracts have shown huge potential to treat multiple human diseases. Objective The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of Shogaol (an active component of ginger) in neuroinflammation and behavioral paradigms in mice treated with metals and HFD. Methods 8-11 weeks old male mice model was developed by giving a combination of metals, i.e., Arsenic (As), Lead (Pb) and Aluminum (Al), 25mg/kg each mixed in drinking water with laboratory prepared HFD (40% fat) for a total duration of 72 days. Shogaol treated groups received two doses (2mg/kg & 12mg/kg) of Shogaol along with metals and HFD. The biochemical parameters, including body weights, blood glucose, and kidney and liver functions, were assessed along with the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The expression analysis of neuroinflammatory genes (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta & GFAP) was performed using q-PCR in the hippocampus and cortex. The exploratory and anxiety-like behavior was assessed using an open field test, and depressive behavior was assessed through the forced swim test, while learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze test and y-maze test. Results Shogaol (2mg/kg & 12mg/kg) treatment improved metabolic profile and reduced expression of neuroinflammatory genes in the cortex and the hippocampus. Shogaol treatment improved BBB integrity. Results of the behavioral analysis showed that Shogaol treatment (2mg/kg & 12mg/kg) rescued behavioral impairment and improved anxiety and depression. Conclusion Shogaol treatment showed strong therapeutic potential in metals & HFD induced neuroinflammation and improved cognitive functions; thus, can be considered a potential drug candidate in the future.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is the key to synaptic health, and aberrant synaptic plasticity, which in turn impairs the functioning of large-scale brain networks, has been associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The best known and most studied form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity remains long-term potentiation (LTP), which is controlled by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors (NMDAR) and considered to be a mechanism crucial for cellular learning and memory. Over the past two decades, discrepancies have arisen in the literature regarding the contribution of NMDAR subunit assemblies in the direction of NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here, the nonspecific NMDAR antagonist ketamine (5 and 10 mg/kg), and the selective NR2B antagonists CP-101606 and Ro 25-6981 (6 and 10 mg/kg), were administered intraperitoneally in Sprague Dawley rats to disentangle the contribution of NR2B subunit in the LTP induced at the Schaffer Collateral-CA1 synapse using the theta burst stimulation protocol (TBS). Ketamine reduced, while CP-101606 and Ro 25-6981 did not alter the LTP response. The administration of CP-101606 before TBS did not influence the effects of ketamine when administered half an hour after tetanization, suggesting a limited contribution of the NR2B subunit in the action of ketamine. This work confirms the role of NMDAR in the LTP form of synaptic plasticity, whereas specific blockade of the NR2B subunit was not sufficient to modify hippocampal LTP. Pharmacokinetics at the doses used may have contributed to the lack of effects with specific antagonists. The findings refute the role of the NR2B subunit in the plasticity mechanism of ketamine in the model.

AB  - Hypoxic microenvironments are intricately linked to malignant characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the progression of GBM and closely associated with hypoxia. Nevertheless, the differential expression profiles as well as functional roles of lncRNAs in GBM cells under hypoxic conditions remain largely obscure. We explored the expression profiles of lncRNAs in hypoxic U87 cells as well as T98G cells using sequencing analysis. The effect of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) was assessed through bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, the expression of lncRNAs significantly dysregulated in both U87 and T98G cells was further validated using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Relevant cell functional experiments were also conducted. We used predicted RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to construct an interaction network via the interaction prediction module. U87 and T98G cells showed dysregulation of 1115 and 597 lncRNAs, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that altered lncRNA expression was associated with nucleotide-excision repair and cell metabolism in GBM cells. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed the association between dysregulated lncRNAs and the Hippo signaling pathway under hypoxia. The dysregulation of six selected lncRNAs (ENST00000371192, uc003tnq.3, ENST00000262952, ENST00000609350, ENST00000610036, and NR_046262) was validated by qRT-PCR. Investigation of lncRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA networks centered on HIF-1 alpha demonstrated cross-talk between the six validated lncRNAs and 16 related miRNAs. Functional experiments showed the significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by the knockdown of uc003tnq.3 in vitro. Additionally, uc003tnq.3 was used to construct a comprehensive RBP-transcription factor (TF)-miRNA interaction network. The expression of LncRNAs was dysregulated in GBM cells under hypoxic conditions. The identified six lncRNAs might exert important effect on the development of GBM under hypoxic microenvironment.

AB  - Working memory (WM) deficits predict clinical and functional outcomes in schizophrenia but are poorly understood and unaddressed by existing treatments. WM encoding and WM retrieval have not been investigated in schizophrenia without the confounds of illness chronicity or the use of antipsychotics and illicit substances. Moreover, it is unclear if WM deficits may be linked to cannabinoid 1 receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia. Sixty-six volunteers (35 controls, 31 drug-free patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) completed the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm during an fMRI scan. Neural activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval was indexed using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent hemodynamic response. A subset of volunteers (20 controls, 20 drug-free patients) underwent a dynamic PET scan to measure [C-11] MePPEP distribution volume (ml/cm(3)) to index CB1R availability. In a whole-brain analysis, there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the superior parietal lobule during WM encoding, and the bilateral hippocampus during WM retrieval. Region of interest analyses in volunteers who had PET/fMRI indicated that there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC, left ACC during encoding; and in the bilateral hippocampus, striatum, ACC and right DLPFC during retrieval. Striatal CB1R availability was positively associated with mean striatal activation during WM retrieval in male patients (R = 0.5, p = 0.02) but not male controls (R = -0.20, p = 0.53), and this was significantly different between groups, Z = -2.20, p = 0.02. Striatal CB1R may contribute to the pathophysiology of WM deficits in male patients and have implications for drug development in schizophrenia.

AB  - The consumption of fruits or by-products from plants of the Passifloraceae family has been associated with multiple health and nutritional benefits, due to their phenolic compound content. Likewise, the effects of polyphenols from Camellia sinensis (green tea) have been explored and are considered a reference for different biological actions of these bioactive substances. This study compared the hypoglycemic and antilipemic activity of polyphenol-rich extracts of Passiflora ligularis Juss (passion fruit) and Camellia sinensis (green tea) given to a group of Wistar rats induced to be overweight. The individuals were subjected to three doses of supplementation of both sources of polyphenols in the drinking water. An additional group without polyphenol supplementation served as a control group. Water consumption, weight gain, glycemia, cholesterol, serum triglycerides and percentage of fecal ethereal extracts were analyzed. Although Passiflora ligularis Juss had five times less polyphenol content than Camellia sinensis, rats fed doses of 2.5 and 3.0 g/L Passiflora ligularis Juss showed reduced glycemia by 16%, suggesting an antiglycemic activity similar to that of Camellia sinensis. On the other hand, higher doses of polyphenols from Passiflora ligularis Juss and Camellia sinensis significantly reduced triglyceride levels (p = 0.05) by more than 17% compared to the unsupplemented control group. The polyphenol-rich extracts produced effective inhibitory activity of lipemic metabolites with a reduction in the percentage of fecal lipids (p < 0.05), with no side effects on liver tissue. The 3.0 g/L dose produced the best result on signs of metabolic syndrome associated with excess weight. Polyphenols extracted from fresh Colombian passion fruit showed the potential to decrease metabolic syndrome risk factors in a murine model.

AB  - A tight relationship between gut-liver diseases and brain functions has recently emerged. Bile acid (BA) receptors, bacterial-derived molecules and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play key roles in this association. This study was aimed to evaluate how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) impact the BA receptors Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) expression in the brain and to correlate these effects with circulating BAs composition, BBB integrity and neuroinflammation. A mouse model of NAFLD was set up by a high-fat and sugar diet, and NASH was induced with the supplementation of dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS) in drinking water. FXR, TGR5 and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) expression in the brain was detected by immunohistochemistry, while Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, Occludin and Plasmalemmal Vesicle Associated Protein-1 (PV-1) were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Biochemical analyses investigated serum BA composition, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and S100 beta protein (S100 beta) levels. Results showed a down-regulation of FXR in NASH and an up-regulation of TGR5 and Iba-1 in the cortex and hippocampus in both treated groups as compared to the control group. The BA composition was altered in the serum of both treated groups, and LBP and S100 beta were significantly augmented in NASH. ZO-1 and Occludin were attenuated in the brain capillary endothelial cells of both treated groups versus the control group. We demonstrated that NAFLD and NASH provoke different grades of brain dysfunction, which are characterized by the altered expression of BA receptors, FXR and TGR5, and activation of microglia. These effects are somewhat promoted by a modification of circulating BAs composition and by an increase in LBP that concur to damage BBB, thus favoring neuroinflammation.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often co-morbid with unprovoked seizures, making clinical diagnosis and management difficult. Although it has an important role in both AD and epilepsy, abnormal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission is recognized only as a compensative change for glutamatergic damage. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling can promote GABA release and suppress epileptogenesis, but its effects on cognition in AD are still controversial.MethodsFour-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice (APP mice) were used as animal models in the early stage of AD in this study. Acute/chronic chemical-kindling epilepsy models were established with pentylenetetrazol. Electroencephalogram and Racine scores were performed to assess seizures. Behavioral tests were used to assess cognition and emotion. Electrophysiology, western blot and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the alterations in synapses, GABAergic system components and NRG1-ErbB4 signaling. Furthermore, NRG1 was administrated intracerebroventricularly into APP mice and then its antiepileptic and cognitive effects were evaluated.ResultsAPP mice had increased susceptibility to epilepsy and resulting hippocampal synaptic damage and cognitive impairment. Electrophysiological analysis revealed decreased GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus. This abnormal GABAergic transmission involved a reduction in the number of parvalbumin interneurons (PV+ Ins) and decreased levels of GABA synthesis and transport. We also found impaired NRG1-ErbB4 signaling which mediated by PV+ Ins loss. And NRG1 administration could effectively reduce seizures and improve cognition in four-month-old APP mice.ConclusionOur results indicated that abnormal GABAergic transmission mediated hippocampal hyperexcitability, further excitation/inhibition imbalance, and promoted epileptogenesis in the early stage of AD. Appropriate NRG1 administration could down-regulate seizure susceptibility and rescue cognitive function. Our study provided a potential direction for intervening in the co-morbidity of AD and epilepsy.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex stress-related disorder induced by exposure to traumatic stress that is characterized by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyper-arousal. While it is widely accepted that brain regions involved in emotional regulation and memory-e.g., the amygdala and hippocampus-are dysregulated in PTSD, the pathophysiology of the disorder is not well defined and therefore, pharmacological interventions are extremely limited. Because stress hormones norepinephrine and cortisol (corticosterone in rats) are heavily implicated in the disorder, we explored whether preemptively and systemically antagonizing & beta;-adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors with propranolol and mifepristone are sufficient to mitigate pathological changes in synaptic plasticity, gene expression, and anxiety induced by a modified social defeat (SD) stress protocol. Young adult, male Sprague Dawley rats were initially pre-screened for anxiety. The rats were then exposed to SD and chronic light stress to induce anxiety-like symptoms. Drug-treated rats were administered propranolol and mifepristone injections prior to and continuing throughout SD stress. Using competitive ELISAs on plasma, field electrophysiology at CA1 of the ventral hippocampus (VH) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), quantitative RT-PCR, and behavior assays, we demonstrate that our SD stress increased anxiety-like behavior, elevated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the VH and BLA, and altered the expression of mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and glutamate receptors. These measures largely reverted to control levels with the administration of propranolol and mifepristone. Our findings indicate that SD stress increases LTP in the VH and BLA and that prophylactic treatment with propranolol and mifepristone may have the potential in mitigating these and other stress-induced effects.

AB  - The accumulated evidence suggests that varying levels of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway activity may regulate opiate-associated neuroadaptation of noradrenergic system. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) interacts with tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRKs), binding mainly to TRKC receptors, which are expressed within noradrenergic neurons in the blue spot (locus coeruleus, LC). Considering the difficulties in delivering full-length neurotrophins to the CNS after systemic administration, low-molecular mimetics of loop 4 in NT-3, hexamethylenediamide bis-(N-monosuccinyl-L-asparaginyl-L-asparagine) (GTS-301), and hexamethylenediamide bis-(N-gamma-oxybutyryl-L-glutamyl-L-asparagine) (GTS-302), activating TRKC and TRKB receptors, were synthesized. The aim of the study is comparative examination of the effects of NT-3 dipeptide mimetics on the signs of morphine withdrawal in outbred white rats with opiate dependence, as well as investigation of activation of postreceptor signaling pathways by the mimetics. Dipeptides GTS-301 and GTS-302 after acute administration at doses of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg (i.p., intraperitoneal) had a dose-dependent effect on the specific morphine withdrawal symptoms with the most effective dose being 1.0 mg/kg. Maximum decrease in the total index of morphine withdrawal syndrome for GTS-301 was 31.3% and for GTS-302 - 41.4%. Unlike GTS-301, GTS-302 weakened mechanical allodynia induced by morphine withdrawal, reducing tactile sensitivity. When studying activation of the postreceptor signaling pathways by the NT-3 mimetics in the HT-22 hippocampal cell culture, a different pattern of postreceptor signaling was shown: GTS-302 (10-6 M), similar to NT-3, activates all three MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and PLC gamma 1 pathways, while GTS-301 (10-6 M) triggers only MAPK/ERK and PLC gamma 1 pathways. Thus, the identified features of attenuation of the morphine withdrawal syndrome in the rats under GTS-301 and GTS-302 effects could be associated with different activation pattern of the postreceptor pathways.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent, irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and one of the pathological features is amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition. Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylserine (PS) enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) exhibited significant effects in preventing and alleviating the progress of AD. However, no studies have focused on the differences in the preventive effects on AD between EPA-PS and DHA-PS. Here, the effects of EPA-PS and DHA-PS on A beta production, A beta-induced neurotoxicity and A beta clearance have been studied. The results show that DHA-PS significantly reduced A beta production in CHO-APP/PS1 cells compared to EPA-PS. Moreover, both EPA-PS and DHA-PS significantly protected the primary hippocampal neurons against A beta-induced toxicity by inhibiting the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway and phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Compared to DHA-PS, EPA-PS administration significantly improved the A beta phagocytic capacity of BV2 cells. In addition, EPA-PS and DHA-PS significantly promoted the neurite outgrowth of primary hippocampal neurons. These findings might provide dietary guidance for the prevention of AD as well as a reference for the development of related functional foods.

AB  - Encephalitis has an estimated prevalence of <= 0.01%. Even with extensive diagnostic work-up, an infectious etiology is identified or suspected in <50% of cases, suggesting a role for etiologically unclear, noninfectious processes. Mild encephalitis runs frequently unnoticed, despite slight neuroinflammation detectable postmortem in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. A widely unexplored field in humans, though clearly documented in rodents, is genetic brain inflammation, particularly that associated with myelin abnormalities, inducing primary white matter encephalitis. We hypothesized that "autoimmune encephalitides" may result from any brain inflammation concurring with the presence of brain antigen-directed autoantibodies, e.g., against N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor NR1 (NMDAR1-AB), which are not causal of, but may considerably shape the encephalitis phenotype. We therefore immunized young female Cnp(-/-) mice lacking the structural myelin protein 2 '-3 '-cyclic nucleotide 3 '-phosphodiesterase (Cnp) with a "cocktail" of NMDAR1 peptides. Cnp(-/-) mice exhibit early low-grade inflammation of white matter tracts and blood-brain barrier disruption. Our novel mental-time-travel test disclosed that Cnp(-/-) mice are compromised in what-where-when orientation, but this episodic memory readout was not further deteriorated by NMDAR1-AB. In contrast, comparing wild-type and Cnp(-/-) mice without/with NMDAR1-AB regarding hippocampal learning/memory and motor balance/coordination revealed distinct stair patterns of behavioral pathology. To elucidate a potential contribution of oligodendroglial NMDAR downregulation to NMDAR1-AB effects, we generated conditional NR1 knockout mice. These mice displayed normal Morris water maze and mental-time-travel, but beam balance performance was similar to immunized Cnp(-/-). Immunohistochemistry confirmed neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration in Cnp(-/-) mice, yet without add-on effect of NMDAR1-AB. To conclude, genetic brain inflammation may explain an encephalitic component underlying autoimmune conditions.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a disease characterised by the inflammation of the nasal and paranasal cavities. It is a widespread condition with considerable morbidity for patients. Current treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis consists of appropriate medical therapy followed by surgery in medically resistant patients. Although oral steroids are effective, they are associated with significant morbidity, and disease recurrence is common when discontinued. The development of additional steroid sparing therapies is therefore needed. Mesalazine is a commonly used therapeutic in inflammatory bowel disease, which shares a similar disease profile with chronic rhinosinusitis. This exploratory in vitro study aims to investigate whether mesalazine could be repurposed to a nasal wash, which is safe on human nasoepithelial cells, and retains its anti-inflammatory effects. CRS patients' human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were collected. HNECs were grown at an air-liquid interface (ALIs) and in a monolayer and challenged with mesalazine or a non-medicated control. Transepithelial electrical resistance, paracellular permeability, and toxicity were measured to assess epithelial integrity and safety. The anti-inflammatory effects of mesalazine on the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were analysed using human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1). mesalazine did not impact the barrier function of HNEC-ALIs and was not toxic when applied to HNECs or THP-1 cells at concentrations up to 20 mM. mesalazine at 0.5 and 1 mM concentrations significantly inhibited TNF-alpha release by THP-1 cells. mesalazine effectively decreases TNF-alpha secretion from THP-1 cells, indicating the possibility of its anti-inflammatory properties. The safety profile of mesalazine at doses up to 20 mM suggests that it is safe when applied topically on HNECs.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern. Each year, over 50 million individuals worldwide suffer from TBI, and this leads to a number of acute and chronic health issues. These include affective and cognitive impairment, as well as an increased risk of alcohol and drug use. The dopaminergic system, a key component of reward circuitry, has been linked to alcohol and other substance use disorders, and previous research indicates that TBI can induce plasticity within this system. Understanding how TBI modifies the dopaminergic system may offer insights into the heightened substance use and reward-seeking behavior following TBI. The hippocampus, a critical component of the reward circuit, is responsible for encoding and integrating the spatial and salient aspects of rewarding stimuli. This study explored TBI-related changes in neuronal D2 receptor expression within the hippocampus, examining the hypothesis that sex differences exist in both baseline hippocampal D2 receptor expression and its response to TBI. Utilizing D2-expressing tdTomato transgenic male and female mice, we implemented either a sham injury or the lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI and subsequently performed a region-specific quantification of D2 expression in the hippocampus. The results show that male mice exhibit higher baseline hippocampal D2 expression compared to female mice. Additionally, there was a significant interaction effect between sex and injury on the expression of D2 in the hippocampus, particularly in regions of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, TBI led to significant reductions in hippocampal D2 expression in male mice, while female mice remained mostly unaffected. These results suggest that hippocampal D2 expression varies between male and female mice, with the female dopaminergic system demonstrating less susceptibility to TBI-induced plasticity.

AB  - Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) is an organophosphate flame retardant and used as a plasticizer in various household products such as plastics, floor polish, varnish, textiles, furniture, and electronic equipment. However, little is known about the effects of TBEP on the brain and behavior. We aimed to examine the effects of dietary exposure of TBEP on memory functions, their-related genes, and inflammatory molecular markers in the brain of allergic asthmatic mouse models. C3H/HeJSlc male mice were given diet containing TBEP (0.02 (TBEP-L), 0.2 (TBEP-M), or 2 (TBEP-H) mu g/kg/day) and ovalbumin (OVA) intratracheally every other week from 5 to 11 weeks old. A novel object recognition test was conducted in each mouse at 11 weeks old. The hippocampi were collected to detect neurological, glia, and immunological molecular markers using the real-time RT-PCR method and immunohistochemical analyses. Mast cells and microglia were examined by toluidine blue staining and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule (Iba)-1 immunoreactivity, respectively. Impaired discrimination ability was observed in TBEP-H-exposed mice with or without allergen. The mRNA expression levels of N-methyl-D aspartate receptor subunits Nr1 and Nr2b, inflammatory molecular markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha oxidative stress marker heme oxygenase 1, microglia marker Iba1, and astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly increased in TBEP-H-exposed mice with or without allergen. Microglia and mast cells activation were remarkable in TBEP-H-exposed allergic asthmatic mice. Our results indicate that chronic exposure to TBEP with or without allergen impaired object recognition ability accompanied with alteration of molecular expression of neuronal and glial markers and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of mice. Neuron-glia-mast cells interaction may play a role in TBEP-induced neurobehavioral toxicity.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine if modulating transporters like transient receptor potential cation channels, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7) underlies the hippocampal neuroprotection afforded by melatonin (Mel) in rats exposed to cerebral hypoperfusion (CHP). Experimental groups included control, Mel-treated (1.87 g/kg), CHP, and CHP + Mel (1.87 g/kg)-treated rats. CHP was induced by the permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (2VO) method and treatments were conducted for 7 days, orally. Mel prevented the damage of the dental gyrus and memory loss in CHP rats and inhibited the hippocampal reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6), interleukine-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It also reduced the hippocampal transcription of the TRPM7 channels and lowered levels of calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+). Mel Also enhanced the levels of total glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus of the control and CHP-treated rats. In conclusion, downregulation of TRPM7 seems to be one mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of Mel against global ischemia and is triggered by its antioxidant potential.

AB  - In this work, the extraction procedure of a natural pigment from the flower of Ceiba speciosa (A. St.-Hil.) was optimized by response surface methodology. It is the first time that the extraction of the flower pigment of C. speciosa (FPCS) has been reported, along with an evaluation of its stability and biological activity under various conditions, and an exploration of its potential use as a food additive and in medicine. Specifically, the effects of ethanol concentration, solid-liquid ratio, temperature and time on the extraction rate of FPCS were determined using a Box-Behnken design. The optimum extraction conditions for FPCS were 75% ethanol with a solid-liquid ratio of 1:75 mg/mL) at 66 degrees C for 39 min. The purification of FPCS using different macroporous resins showed that D101 performed best when the initial mass concentration of the injection solution was 1.50 mg/mL, resulting in a three-fold increase in color value. The yield of dry flowers was 9.75% of fresh petals and the FPCS extraction efficiency was 43.2%. The effects of light, solubility, pH, temperature, sweeteners, edible acids, redox agents, preservatives and metal ions on FPCS were also investigated. Furthermore, the characteristics of FPCS were determined by spectrophotometry at a specific wavelength using the Lambert-Beer law to correlate the mass of FPCS with its absorbance value. An acute toxicological test performed according to Horne's method showed that FPCS is a non-toxic extract and thus may be used as a food additive or in other ingestible forms. Finally, western blotting showed that FPCS prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced hippocampal oxidative stress in mice. The study suggests that FPCS may function as an antioxidant with applications in the food, cosmetics and polymer industries.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory neurotransmission are believed to be the neuronal basis of learning and memory. Both processes are primarily mediated by neuronal activity-induced transport of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). While AMPAR subunits and their specific phosphorylation sites mediate differential AMPAR trafficking, LTP and LTD could also occur in a subunit-independent manner. Thus, it remains unclear whether and how certain AMPAR subunits with phosphorylation sites are preferentially recruited to or removed from synapses during LTP and LTD. Using immunoblot and immunocytochemical analysis, we show that phosphomimetic mutations of the membrane-proximal region (MPR) in GluA1 AMPAR subunits affect the subunit dependent endosomal transport of AMPARs during chemical LTD. AP-2 and AP-3, adaptor protein complexes necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking, respectively, are reported to be recruited to AMPARs by binding to the AMPAR auxiliary subunit, stargazin (STG), in an AMPAR subunit-independent manner. However, the association of AP-3, but not AP-2, with STG was indirectly inhibited by the phosphomimetic mutation in the MPR of GluA1. Thus, although AMPARs containing the phosphomimetic mutation at the MPR of GluA1 were endocytosed by a chemical LTD-inducing stimulus, they were quickly recycled back to the cell surface in hippocampal neurons. These results could explain how the phosphorylation status of GluA1-MPR plays a dominant role in subunit independent STG-mediated AMPAR trafficking during LTD.

AB  - Lead is an environmental pollutant that possesses harmful effects on the nervous system. The current study was conducted to investigate the impacts of eucalyptol, a type of monoterpene, on anxiety behaviors, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death in the hippocampus of rats exposed to lead and its possible protective mechanism. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into Control, Lead, Eucalyptol, and Lead + Eucalyptol groups. The Lead and Lead + Eucalyptol groups were given lead acetate (25 mg/kg, gavage) daily for fourteen days. The Eucalyptol and Lead + Eucalyptol groups also received eucalyptol (100 mg/kg, gavage). The results showed that eucalyptol prevented an increase in malondialdehyde levels and a decrease in glutathione levels, as well as a reduction in the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes in the hippocampus of Lead + Eucalyptol animals. It also prevented an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)- 1 beta, and IL- 6, and a decrease in the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. In addition, this monoterpene prevented the reduction in sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and the increase in nuclear factor kappa b (NF-kappa B) expression. It enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at the level of mRNA and protein and reduced neuronal death in different subfields of the hippocampus. Eucalyptol also improved the performance of rats receiving lead acetate in elevated plus maze and open field tests. We concluded that eucalyptol reduces anxiety behaviors in lead-exposed rats by suppressing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death in the hippocampus. The anxiolytic effect of eucalyptol in lead pollution is likely mediated by modulating SIRT1/NF-kappa B signaling and increasing BDNF expression.

AB  - Simple Summary Monopolar spindle One Binder1 (MOB1) proteins regulate key cellular functions, namely cell multiplication and cell division. The unicellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii transitions between several morphological stages, with the need to control the number of parasites in its cellular environment. We hypothesized that MOB1 proteins could participate in the regulation of the T. gondii life cycle, having identified one MOB1 protein (TgMOB1) coded in its genome. However, this study shows that TgMOB1 presents divergent features. While in organisms studied to date the lack of MOB1 has led to cell division defects, this did not occur in T. gondii in vitro cultures where mob1 was not an essential gene. Additionally, the identification of TgMOB1 proximity interacting partners detected novel MOB1 interactors. Still, TgMOB1 localizes to the region between the new-forming nuclei during cell division, and T. gondii parasites multiply slower with TgMOB1 overexpression and faster when there is a lack of TgMOB1, indicating an intricate role for TgMOB1 in T. gondii. This study uncovers new features of the T. gondii biology, a zoonotic parasite and model organism for the phylum Apicomplexa, and highlights the complex roles MOB1 proteins may assume, with possible implications for disease processes. Monopolar spindle One Binder1 (MOB1) proteins are conserved components of the tumor-suppressing Hippo pathway, regulating cellular processes such as cytokinesis. Apicomplexan parasites present a life cycle that relies on the parasites' ability to differentiate between stages and regulate their proliferation; thus, Hippo signaling pathways could play an important role in the regulation of the apicomplexan life cycle. Here, we report the identification of one MOB1 protein in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. To characterize the function of MOB1, we generated gain-of-function transgenic lines with a ligand-controlled destabilization domain, and loss-of-function clonal lines obtained through CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Contrary to what has been characterized in other eukaryotes, MOB1 is not essential for cytokinesis in T. gondii. However, this picture is complex since we found MOB1 localized between the newly individualized daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis. Moreover, we detected a significant delay in the replication of overexpressing tachyzoites, contrasting with increased replication rates in knockout tachyzoites. Finally, using the proximity-biotinylation method, BioID, we identified novel members of the MOB1 interactome, a probable consequence of the observed lack of conservation of some key amino acid residues. Altogether, the results point to a complex evolutionary history of MOB1 roles in apicomplexans, sharing properties with other eukaryotes but also with divergent features, possibly associated with their complex life cycle.

AB  - The objectives of this study were the selection of the best tea clones with high catechin content among the known tea clones in Rwanda and Kenya, the examination of their antiproliferative effects on the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (4T1), and an evaluation of their combination index with cisplatin. The quantification of catechin contents in 14 different tea clones and 5 different processed teas was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A comparative study of antiproliferative activities of catechin extracts from purple, TRFK306, and BB35 tea clones on the TNBC cell line (4T1) was undertaken, and their combination index (CI) with cisplatin and the dose reduction index (DRI) were determined. The catechin extract from BB35 had the highest concentration of total catechins (817.81 +/- 24.2 mg/g DW). After 72 h, the catechin extracts from TRFK306 showed a high IC50 of 68.68 +/- 3.30 mu g/mL. The catechin extracts from TRFK306 showed the best synergism with cisplatin (CI=0.59), and they reduced the doses of cisplatin with the highest DRI=3.74493. Catechin extracts from purple tea showed higher antiproliferative activity and synergism with cisplatin against the TNBC cell line.

AB  - The assembly of the mammalian brain is orchestrated by temporally coordinated waves of gene expression. Post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) is a key aspect of this program. Indeed, deletion of neuron-enriched miRNAs induces strong developmental phenotypes, and miRNA levels are altered in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the mechanisms used by miRNAs to instruct brain development remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified miR-218 as a critical regulator of hippocampal assembly. MiR-218 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and enriched in both excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs). Early life inhibition of miR-218 results in an adult brain with a predisposition to seizures. Changes in gene expression in the absence of miR-218 suggest that network assembly is impaired. Indeed, we find that miR-218 inhibition results in the disruption of early depolarizing GABAergic signaling, structural defects in dendritic spines, and altered intrinsic membrane excitability. Conditional knockout of Mir218-2 in INs, but not PNs, is sufficient to recapitulate long-term instability. Finally, de-repressing Kif21b and Syt13, two miR-218 targets, phenocopies the effects on early synchronous network activity induced by miR-218 inhibition. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-218 orchestrates formative events in PNs and INs to produce stable networks.

AB  - Background Let-7a is a small non-coding RNA that has been found to take part in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The hippo-YAP1 axis, known as a tumour suppressor pathway, also plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. YAP1, TAZ, and phospho-YAP1 play key roles in actions of the hippo-YAP1 axis. Adenomyosis (ADS) is a proliferative disease leading to a large uterus in patients with prolonged illness. Abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the uterine endometrial-myometrial junctional zone (JZ) is an important reason for developing ADS. This study aimed to explore the expression levels of let-7a and components of the hippo-YAP1 axis in SMCs in the uterine endometrial-myometrial JZ in ADS and to explore the roles of let-7a and the hippo-YAP1 axis of JZ SMC proliferation and apoptosis in ADS. Methods We collected JZ tissues for the primary culture of SMCs from 25 women diagnosed with ADS and 27 women without ADS. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting to measure the mRNA and protein expression levels of let-7a, YAP1, TAZ, and phospho-YAP1 in ADS JZ SMCs. A CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis were utilized to test the proliferation and apoptosis of JZ SMCs. The let-7a overexpression lentiviral vector GV280 was used to increase the expression level of let-7a. We added verteporfin to block the phosphorylation of components of the hippo-YAP1 axis. Results We found that the let-7a level was decreased, while the YAP1 and TAZ levels were increased in ADS JZ SMCs. Upregulated let-7a affected the expression levels of components of the hippo-YAP1 axis, accelerated apoptosis, and inhibited proliferation in JZ SMCs. Furthermore, accumulated YAP1 led to increasing proliferation of JZ SMCs after verteporfin treatment to block the phosphorylation of components of the hippo-YAP1 axis. If components of the hippo-YAP1 axis were unphosphorylated, upregulated let-7a could not inhibit the proliferation of ADS JZ SMCs. Upregulated let-7a could not activate the hippo-YAP1 axis in verteporfin treatment. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the let-7a and hippo-YAP1 axis may act as important regulators of JZ SMCs proliferation, and upregulated let-7a may be an effective method to treat ADS.

AB  - The function of neuronal networks is determined not only by synaptic connectivity but also by neuromodulatory systems that broadcast information via distributed connections and volume transmission. To understand the molecular constraints that organize neuromodulatory signaling in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish, we used transcriptomics and additional approaches to delineate cell types, to determine their phylogenetic conservation, and to map the expression of marker genes at high granularity. The combinatorial expression of GPCRs and cell -type markers indicates that all neuronal cell types are subject to modulation by multiple monoaminergic systems and distinct combinations of neuropeptides. Individual cell types were associated with multiple (typically >30) neuromodulatory signaling networks but expressed only a few diagnostic GPCRs at high levels, suggesting that different neuromodulatory systems act in combination, albeit with unequal weights. These results provide a detailed map of cell types and brain areas in the zebrafish telencephalon, identify core components of neuromodulatory networks, highlight the cell -type specificity of neuropeptides and GPCRs, and begin to decipher the logic of combinatorial neuromodulation.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD), the second cause of dementia, is caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, producing progressive damage to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and white matter. Ligustilide (LIG), one of the main active ingredients of Angelica sinensis, exerts the neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism remains unclear. An in vivo model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were employed in this study. LIG (20 or 40 mg/kg/day) was intragastrically administered to the VaD rats for four weeks. The results of the Morris water maze test demonstrated that LIG effectively ameliorated learning and memory deficiency in VaD rats. LIG obviously relieved neuronal oxidative stress damage by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and decreasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in VaD rats. Nissl staining showed that LIG increased the number of the Nissl body in VaD rats. After LIG administration, the apoptotic-related protein, Bax, was decreased and Bcl-2 was increased in the hippocampus of VaD rats. Moreover, the expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were decreased, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) and phospho-inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha (P-IRE1 alpha), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) were increased in VaD rats. After LIG treatment, these changes were reversed. The immunofluorescence results further showed that LIG upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and downregulated the expression of P-IRE1 alpha in VaD rats. In addition, in vitro experiment showed that EX-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) partly abolished the inhibitory effect of LIG on the IRE1 alpha/XBP1s/CHOP pathway. In conclusion, these studies indicated that LIG could improve cognitive impairment by regulating the SIRT1/IRE1 alpha/XBP1s/CHOP pathway in VaD rats.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe disease of unknown pathogenesis that will affect -10% of people during their lifetime. Therapy for MDD requires prolonged treatment and often fails, predicating a need for novel treatment strategies. Here, we report increased ceramide levels in the blood plasma of MDD patients and in murine stress-induced models of MDD. These blood plasma ceramide levels correlated with the severity of MDD in human patients and were independent of age, sex, or body mass index. In addition, intravenous injection of anti-ceramide antibodies or neutral ceramidase rapidly abrogated stress-induced MDD, and intravenous injection of blood plasma from mice with MDD induced depressionlike behavior in untreated mice, which was abrogated by ex vivo preincubation of the plasma with anti-ceramide antibodies or ceramidase. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ceramide accumulated in endothelial cells of the hippocampus of stressed mice, evidenced by the quantitative measurement of ceramide in purified hippocampus endothelial cells. We found ceramide inhibited the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) in endothelial cells in vitro and in the hippocampus in vivo and thereby decreased phosphatidic acid in the hippocampus. Finally, we show intravenous injection of PLD or phosphatidic acid abrogated MDD, indicating the significance of this pathway in MDD pathogenesis. Our data indicate that ceramide controls PLD activity and phosphatidic acid formation in hippocampal endothelial cells and thereby mediates MDD. We propose that neutralization of plasma ceramide could represent a rapidacting targeted treatment for MDD.

AB  - Introduction Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. These factors can lead to the overactivation of c-JNK and p38MAPK.Methods In rats, stereotactic intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of propionic acid (PPA) results in autistic-like characteristics such as poor social interaction, repetitive behaviours, and restricted communication. Research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of phytochemicals derived from plants in treating neurological disorders. Tanshinone-IIA (Tan-IIA) is a chemical found in the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza. It has neuroprotective potential by inhibiting c-JNK and p38MAPK against behavioral and neurochemical alterations in PPA-induced autistic rats. We observe behavioral changes, alterations in apoptotic markers, myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament-Light (NEFL), inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotransmitter imbalances using different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum), as well as biological samples, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood plasma.Results Persistent administration of 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg Tan-IIA via intraperitoneal injection reduced these alterations dose-dependently. Anisomycin (3 mg/kg.,i.p.) as a SAPK (c-JNK and p38MAPK) agonist was administered to assess the neuroprotective effect of Tan-IIA in autistic rats. Tan-IIA's molecular interactions with c-JNK and p38MAPK were confirmed using silico analysis. We also observed gross morphological, histopathological, and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) myelin straining changes in whole and coronal brain sections.Conclusion Thus, Tan-IIA has a neuroprotective potential by inhibiting the c-JNK and p38MAPK signalling pathways, which reduces the behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities induced by PPA in adult Wistar rats, indicating that current results should be studied further for the diagnosis and treatment of autism.

AB  - The reward and novelty-related neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesised proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzosko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here, we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP), which is mediated via the Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis. Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of Viola tricolor extract on hippocampal neuronal death, interleukin (IL) -6 and IL-10 expression, spatial memory, anxiety, and depression in rats exposed to chronic immobilization stress. Rats were divided into groups Control, Viola300, Viola600, Stress, Stress-Viola300, and Stress-Viola600. Animals were placed in a restrainer (6h/21 days) to stress exposure. V. tricolor hydroalcoholic extract was also administrated at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg by gavage. The extract caused immobilized animals to spend more time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test. It also increased the percentage of entries into the open arm and the percentage of time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze in immobilized rats. Treatment with the V. tricolor extract significantly reduced the immobility time of stressed rats in the forced swimming test. Furthermore, it significantly reduced neuronal death and expression of IL-6 in the hippocampus of immobilized animals but could not prevent the decrease of IL-10 expression. We concluded that V. tricolor protects rats from stress-induced behavioral damages, at least in part, by suppressing neuronal death and decreasing IL-6 expression.

AB  - The uptake of insecticidal Cry1Ab from genetically engineered (GE) maize, via herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi, to a predator Harmonia axyridis and its potential intergenerational transfer were investigated. Cry1Ab concentration was found to be 400-fold lower in R. padi compared to GE maize, and more than two-fold lower in H. axyridis. For 62% of H. axyridis samples, Cry1Ab was under the limit of detection (LOD), for another 13% were under the limit of quantification (LOQ). The concentration of Cry1Ab was similar between H. axyridis exposed short-term and long-term with the exception of adults after long-term. There was no correlation between Cry1Ab in females and eggs and neonates. The performance of H. axyridis was comparable between Cry1Ab and control. Histological investigation did not show any pathological changes in the digestive and reproductive systems. The detected route of exposure is unlikely to be important for functional biological control by H. axyridis in agroecosystem.

AB  - Cocaine misuse induces microglial activation and neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments. Prior studies have shown that cocaine induces mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated mitophagy, and lysosomal impairment in microglia. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in mitigating cocaine-induced microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Mouse primary microglial cells (MPMs) were pretreated with NAC (5 mM) for 1 h prior to cocaine exposure (10 mu M, 24 h) and analyzed for markers of microglial activation, mitophagy, and lysosomal integrity using Western blot, Seahorse assays, lysosomal pH, and membrane potential measurements. In vivo, C57BL/6N mice received NAC (200 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before daily cocaine injections (20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days. Behavioral assays (open field, novel object recognition) and brain biomarker analyses (frontal cortex, hippocampus) were performed. Cocaine exposure elevated CD11b, mitophagy markers (PINK1, PARK, and DLP1), and autophagy proteins (Beclin1, and p62), while impairing mitochondrial and lysosomal functions. NAC pretreatment restored mitochondrial and lysosomal function, reduced reactive oxygen species, and normalized protein expression. In vivo, NAC also alleviated cocaine-induced microglial activation and behavioral deficits. These findings highlight NAC as a promising therapeutic agent to counteract cocaine-mediated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity.

AB  - Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of stratified squamous epithelial cells causes nearly 5% of cancer cases worldwide. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers harbor few mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway compared to HPV-negative cancers at the same anatomical site, prompting the hypothesis that an HPV-encoded protein inactivates the Hippo pathway and activates the Hippo effector yes-associated protein (YAP1). The HPV E7 oncoprotein is required for HPV infection and for HPV-mediated oncogenic transformation. We investigated the effects of HPV oncoproteins on YAP1 and found that E7 activates YAP1, promoting YAP1 nuclear localization in basal epithelial cells. YAP1 activation by HPV E7 required that E7 binds and degrades the tumor suppressor protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14). E7 required YAP1 transcriptional activity to extend the lifespan of primary keratinocytes, indicating that YAP1 activation contributes to E7 carcinogenic activity. Maintaining infection in basal cells is critical for HPV persistence, and here we demonstrate that YAP1 activation causes HPV E7 expressing cells to be retained in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. We propose that YAP1 activation resulting from PTPN14 inactivation is an essential, targetable activity of the HPV E7 oncoprotein relevant to HPV infection and carcinogenesis.

AB  - Neuronal connectivity is essential for adaptive brain responses and can be modulated by dendritic spine plasticity and the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to aberrant neuronal activity, which has been associated with numerous neurological disorders including autism, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal neuronal connectivity remain unclear. We previously found that the serine/threonine kinase Microtubule Affinity Regulating Kinase 2 (MARK2), also known as Partitioning Defective 1b (Par1b), is important for the formation of dendritic spines in vitro. However, despite its genetic association with several neurological disorders, the in vivo impact of MARK2 on neuronal connectivity and cognitive functions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of MARK2 in vivo results in changes to dendritic spine morphology, which in turn leads to a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. Additionally, the loss of MARK2 produces substantial impairments in learning and memory, reduced anxiety, and defective social behavior. Notably, MARK2 deficiency results in heightened seizure susceptibility. Consistent with this observation, electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices indicates underlying neuronal hyperexcitability in MARK2-deficient neurons. Finally, RNAseq analysis reveals transcriptional changes in genes regulating synaptic transmission and ion homeostasis. These results underscore the in vivo role of MARK2 in governing synaptic connectivity, neuronal excitability, and cognitive functions.
   The loss of MARK2 in mice results in reduced excitatory transmission as evidenced by a reduced number of mature dendritic spines and a reduction in mEPSC frequency. MARK2 heterozygotes and knockouts also exhibit impairments in learning and memory, reduced social behavior, and reduced anxiety. Interestingly, MARK2 loss results in increased seizure susceptibility, which can be explained by underlying neuronal hyperexcitability. Finally, RNAseq analysis of MARK2 knockout hippocampi suggests that the dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling and ion channels may be driving these phenotypes.image

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There are currently no effective treatments for TBI, and trauma survivors suffer from a variety of long-lasting health consequences. With nutritional support recently emerging as a vital step in improving TBI patients' outcomes, we sought to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefits of nutritional supplements derived from bovine thymus gland, which can deliver a variety of nutrients and bioactive molecules. In a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI), we determined that animals supplemented with a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus (TNF) display greatly improved performance on beam balance and spatial memory tests following CCI. Using RNA-Seq, we identified an array of signaling pathways that are modulated by TNF supplementation in rat hippocampus, including those involved in the process of autophagy. We further show that bovine thymus-derived extracts contain antigens found in neural tissues and that supplementation of rats with thymus extracts induces production of serum IgG antibodies against neuronal and glial antigens, which may explain the enhanced animal recovery following CCI through possible oral tolerance mechanism. Collectively, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the potency of a nutritional supplement containing nuclear fraction of bovine thymus in enhancing the functional recovery from TBI.

AB  - With the rapid development of machine learning technology, it has become possible to automatically identify cultural heritage elements in traditional buildings. This research aimed to develop a machine learning model based on the YOLOv4 architecture to identify the traditional Chinese porcelain inlay pattern in the Lingnan region. The researchers collected and annotated a large quantity of Lingnan Chinese porcelain inlay image data and then used these data to train the studied model. The research results show that (1) the model in this study was specifically adjusted to effectively identify a variety of Chinese porcelain inlay pattern types, including traditional patterns such as plum blossoms and camellias. (2) In the 116th epoch, the model showed excellent generalization ability, and the verification loss reached the lowest value of 0.88. The lowest training loss in the 195th epoch was 0.99, indicating that the model reached an optimal balance point for both recognition accuracy and processing speed. (3) By comparing different models for detecting Chinese porcelain inlay images across 581 pictures, our YOLOv4 model demonstrated greater accuracy in most classification tasks than did the YOLOv8 model, especially in the classification of chrysanthemums, where it achieved an accuracy rate of 87.5%, significantly outperforming YOLOv8 by 58.82%. However, the study also revealed that under certain conditions, such as detecting apples and pears in low-light environments, YOLOv8 showed a lower missing data rate, highlighting the limitations of our model in dealing with complex detection conditions.

AB  - Many insects rely on microbial protection in the early stages of their development. However, in contrast to symbiont-mediated defense of eggs and young instars, the role of microbes in safeguarding pupae remains relatively unexplored, despite the susceptibility of the immobile stage to antagonistic challenges. Here, we outline the importance of symbiosis in ensuring pupal protection by describing a mutualistic partnership between the ascomycete Fusarium oxysporum and Chelymorpha alternans, a leaf beetle. The symbiont rapidly proliferates at the onset of pupation, extensively and conspicuously coating C. alternans during metamorphosis. The fungus confers defense against predation as symbiont elimination results in reduced pupal survivorship. In exchange, eclosing beetles vector F. oxysporum to their host plants, resulting in a systemic infection. By causing wilt disease, the fungus retained its phytopathogenic capacity in light of its symbiosis with C. alternans. Despite possessing a relatively reduced genome, F. oxysporum encodes metabolic pathways that reflect its dual lifestyle as a plant pathogen and a defensive insect symbiont. These include virulence factors underlying plant colonization, along with mycotoxins that may contribute to the defensive biochemistry of the insect host. Collectively, our findings shed light on a mutualism predicated on pupal protection of an herbivorous beetle in exchange for symbiont dissemination and propagation.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Neurogenesis plays a crucial role in postischemic functional recovery. Alcohol dose-dependently affects the prognosis of ischemic stroke. We investigated the impact of light alcohol consumption (LAC) on neurogenesis under physiological conditions and following ischemic stroke. C57BL/6J mice (three months old) were fed with 0.7 g/kg/day ethanol (designed as LAC) or volume-matched water (designed as control) daily for eight weeks. To evaluate neurogenesis, the numbers of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)(+)/doublecortin (DCX)(+) and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) neurons were assessed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus (DG), ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The locomotor activity was determined by the accelerating rotarod and open field tests. LAC significantly increased BrdU(+)/DCX+ and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in the SVZ under physiological conditions. Ischemic stroke dramatically increased BrdU(+)/DCX+ and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in the DG, SVZ, ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The increase in BrdU(+)/DCX+ cells was significantly greater in LAC mice compared to the control mice. In addition, LAC significantly increased BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells by about three folds in the DG, SVZ, and ischemic cortex. Furthermore, LAC reduced ischemic brain damage and improved locomotor activity. Therefore, LAC may protect the brain against ischemic stroke by promoting neurogenesis.

AB  - Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used to treat a variety of tumors. Nonetheless, MTX-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity is a well-defined dose-limiting adverse effect that limits clinical utility. Proinflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress are possible mechanisms for MTX-induced neurotoxicity. Buspirone (BSP), a partial agonist of the 5-HT1a receptor (5-HT1aR), has emerged as an anxiolytic drug. BSP has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The current study investigated BSP's potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in attenuating MTX-induced hippocampal toxicity. Rats received either BSP (1.5 mg/kg) orally for 10 days and MTX (20 mg/kg) i.p. on Day 5. BSP administration markedly protected hippocampal neurons from drastic degenerated neuronal changes induced by MTX. BSP significantly attenuated oxidative injury by downregulating Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 expression while potently elevating hippocampal Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor expression. BSP dampened inflammation by reducing NO2-, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and interleukin 1 beta levels mediated by downregulating NF-?B and neuronal nitric oxides synthase expression. Moreover, BSP potently counteracted hippocampal pyroptosis by downregulating NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved-caspase-1 proteins. Therefore, BSP may represent a promising approach to attenuate neurotoxicity in patients receiving MTX.

AB  - Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia, but effective treatments are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GGQLD) on AD and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Using network pharmacology and bioinformatics, we identified 376 active ingredients of GGQLD and 427 drug targets. Among these, 7 potential targets (CASP1, MKI67, NFKB1, TLR4, NLRP3, IL1B, and AKT1) were identified as intersecting targets of both GGQLD and AD. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that GGQLD regulates pyroptosis-related pathways. In vivo, GGQLD was administered to AD rat models to assess its effects on spatial learning, memory, and brain tissue injury. Results: GGQLD significantly reduced latency time by 40 % and increased platform crossings by 60 % in AD rats, demonstrating improved spatial learning and memory abilities. It also reduced hippocampal tissue damage and abnormal A(3 deposition. Mechanistically, GGQLD downregulated pyroptosis-related targets (TLR4, NF-kappa B, NLRP3, IL-1(3, and Caspase-1), which were significantly upregulated in AD. ROC analysis demonstrated strong diagnostic significance for these genes, with AUC values exceeding 0.70. Functional enrichment and KEGG analysis further indicated that GGQLD exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways, particularly the NOD-like receptor pathway, Necroptosis, and NF-kappa B pathway. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that GGQLD improves spatial learning, reduces brain tissue damage, and alleviates inflammation in AD through the regulation of pyroptosis-related pathways, providing evidence for its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.

AB  - Sasanquasaponin (SQS), a secondary metabolite that is derived from Camellia seeds, reportedly possesses notable biological properties. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of SQS and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly explored. Herein, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of SQS against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 cells, focusing on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and MAPK signaling pathways. SQS was isolated using a deep eutectic solvent and D101 macroporous adsorption resin and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The viability of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate. The expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and ELISA. Western blot was performed to analyze the protein expression of LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Herein, SQS exhibited anti-inflammatory activity: 30 mu g/mL of SQS significantly reduced ROS generation, inhibited the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2, and attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The anti-inflammatory activity was potentially mediated by inhibiting the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha and p65 in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK in the MAPK signaling pathway. Accordingly, SQS could inhibit inflammation in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells by suppressing the NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. This study demonstrated the potential application of SQS as an anti-inflammatory agent.

AB  - Exercise activates the dorsal hippocampus that triggers synaptic and cellar plasticity and ultimately promotes memory formation. For decades, these benefits have been explored using demanding and stress-response-inducing exercise at moderate-to-vigorous intensities. In contrast, our translational research with animals and humans has focused on light-intensity exercise (light exercise) below the lactate threshold (LT), which almost anyone can safely perform with minimal stress. We found that even light exercise can stimulate hippocampal activity and enhance memory performance. Although the circuit mechanism of this boost remains unclear, arousal promotion even with light exercise implies the involvement of the ascending monoaminergic system that is essential to modulate hippocampal activity and impact memory. To test this hypothesis, we employed our physiological exercise model based on the LT of rats and immunohistochemically assessed the neuronal activation of the dorsal hippocampal sub-regions and brainstem monoaminergic neurons. Also, we monitored the extracellular concentration of monoamines in the dorsal hippocampus using in vivo microdialysis. We found that even light exercise increased neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampal sub-regions and elevated the extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine. Furthermore, we found that tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were activated even by light exercise and were both positively correlated with the dorsal hippocampal activation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that light exercise stimulates dorsal hippocampal neurons, which are associated with LC-noradrenergic and VTA-dopaminergic activation. This shed light on the circuit mechanisms responsible for hippocampal neural activation during exercise, consequently enhancing memory function.

AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana, local wounding and herbivore feeding provoke leaf-to-leaf propagating Ca2+ waves that are dependent on the activity of members of the glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs). In systemic tissues, GLRs are needed to sustain the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) with the subsequent activation of JA dependent signaling response required for the plant acclimation to the perceived stress. Even though the role of GLRs is well established, the mechanism through which they are activated remains unclear. Here, we report that in vivo, the amino-acid-dependent activation of the AtGLR3.3 channel and systemic responses require a functional ligand-binding domain. By combining imaging and genetics, we show that leaf mechanical injury, such as wounds and burns, as well as hypo-osmotic stress in root cells, induces the systemic apoplastic increase of L-glutamate (L-Glu), which is largely independent of AtGLR3.3 that is instead required for systemic cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Moreover, by using a bioelectronic approach, we show that the local release of minute concentrations of L-Glu in the leaf lamina fails to induce any long-distance Ca2+ waves.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a complex role in health and disease. They actively survey the brain parenchyma by physically interacting with other cells and structurally shaping the brain. Yet, the mechanisms underlying microglial motility and significance for synapse stability, especially in the hippocampus during adulthood, remain widely unresolved. Here, we investigated the effect of neuronal activity on microglial motility and the implications for the formation and survival of dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1 neurons in vivo. We used repetitive two-photon in vivo imaging in the hippocampus of awake and anesthetized mice to simultaneously study the motility of microglia and their interaction with dendritic spines. We found that CA3 to CA1 input is sufficient to modulate microglial process motility. Simultaneously, more dendritic spines emerged in mice after awake compared to anesthetized imaging. Interestingly, the rate of microglial contacts with individual dendritic spines and dendrites was associated with the stability, removal, and emergence of dendritic spines. These results suggest that microglia might sense neuronal activity via neurotransmitter release and actively participate in synaptic rewiring of the hippocampal neural network during adulthood. Further, this study has profound relevance for hippocampal learning and memory processes.

AB  - The extent to which evolution is deterministic is a key question in biology,1-9 with intensive debate on how adaptation6,10-13 and constraints14-16 might canalize solutions to ecological challenges.4-6 Alternatively, unique adaptations1,9,17 and phylogenetic contingency1,3,18 may render evolution fundamentally unpredict-able.3 Information from the fossil record is critical to this debate,1,2,11 but performance data for extinct taxa are limited.7 This knowledge gap is significant, as general morphology may be a poor predictor of biome-chanical performance.17,19,20 High-fiber herbivory originated multiple times within ornithischian dinosaurs,21 making them an ideal clade for investigating evolutionary responses to similar ecological pressures.22 How-ever, previous biomechanical modeling studies on ornithischian crania17,23-25 have not compared early -diverging taxa spanning independent acquisitions of herbivory. Here, we perform finite-element analysis on the skull of five early-diverging members of the major ornithischian clades to characterize morphofunc-tional pathways to herbivory. Results reveal limited functional convergence among ornithischian clades, with each instead achieving comparable performance, in terms of reconstructed patterns and magnitudes of functionally induced stress, through different adaptations of the feeding apparatus. Thyreophorans compensated for plesiomorphic low performance through increased absolute size, heterodontosaurids expanded jaw adductor muscle volume, ornithopods increased jaw system efficiency, and ceratopsians combined these approaches. These distinct solutions to the challenges of herbivory within Ornithischia underpinned the success of this diverse clade. Furthermore, the resolution of multiple solutions to equivalent problems within a single clade through macroevolutionary time demonstrates that phenotypic evolution is not necessarily predictable, instead arising from the interplay of adaptation, innovation, contingency, and constraints.1-3,7-9,18

AB  - Recording action potentials extracellularly during behavior has led to fundamental discoveries regarding neural function-hippocampal neurons respond to locations in space,1 motor cortex neurons encode movement direction,2 and dopamine neurons signal reward prediction errors3-observations undergirding current theories of cognition,4 movement,5 and learning.6 Recently it has become possible to measure calcium flux, an internal cellular signal related to spiking. The ability to image calcium flux in anatomically7,8 or genetically9 identified neurons can extend our knowledge of neural circuit function by allowing activity to be monitored in specific cell types or projections, or in the same neurons across many days. However, while initial studies were grounded in prior unit recording work, it has become fashionable to assume that calcium is identical to spiking, even though the spike-to-fluorescence transformation is nonlinear, noisy, and unpredictable under real-world conditions.10 It remains an open question whether calcium provides a high-fidelity representation of single-unit activity in awake, behaving subjects. Here, we have addressed this question by recording both signals in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rats during olfactory discrimination learning. Activity in the OFC during olfactory learning has been well-studied in humans,11-14 nonhuman primates,15,16 and rats,17-21 where it has been shown to signal information about both the sensory properties of odor cues and the rewards they predict. Our single-unit results replicated prior findings, whereas the calcium signal provided only a degraded estimate of the information available in the single-unit spiking, reflecting primarily reward value.

AB  - The sequential activation of Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing protein 1 (Nlrp1) inflammasome, Caspase-1 (Casp1), and Caspase-6 (Casp6) is implicated in primary human neuron cultures and Alzheimer Disease (AD) neurodegeneration. To validate the Nlrp1-Casp1-Casp6 pathway in vivo, the APP(Swedish/Indiana) J20 AD transgenic mouse model was generated on either a Nlrp1, Casp1 or Casp6 null genetic background and mice were studied at 4-5 months of age. Episodic memory deficits assessed with novel object recognition were normalized by genetic ablation of Nlrp1, Casp1, or Casp6 in J20 mice. Spatial learning deficits, assessed with the Barnes Maze, were normalized in genetically ablated J20, whereas memory recall was normalized in J20/Casp1(-/-)and J20/Casp6(-/-), and improved in J20/Nlrp1(-/-) mice. Hippocampal CA1 dendritic spine density of the mushroom subtype was reduced in J20, and normalized in genetically ablated J20 mice. Reduced J20 hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA3 synaptophysin levels were normalized in genetically ablated J20. Increased Iba1(+)-microglia in the hippocampus and cortex of J20 brains were normalized by Casp1 and Casp6 ablation and reduced by Nlrp1 ablation. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and CXCL1, in the J20 hippocampus were normalized by Nlrp1 or Casp1 genetic ablation. CXCL1 was also normalized by Casp6 genetic ablation. IFN-gamma was increased and total amyloid beta peptide was decreased in genetically ablated Nlrp1, Casp1 or Casp6 J20 hippocampi. We conclude that Nlrp1, Casp1, or Casp6 are implicated in AD-related cognitive impairment, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis. These results indicate that Nlrp1, Casp1, and Casp6 represent rational therapeutic targets against cognitive impairment and inflammation in AD.

AB  - The photoperiod is the main environmental cue that drives seasonal adaptive responses in reproduction, behavior, and metabolism in seasonal animals. Increasing evidence suggests that (poly)phenols contained in fruits can also modulate seasonal rhythms. (Poly)phenol-rich diets are associated with an improvement in cognitive function and neuroprotection due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. However, it is unknown whether cherries affect neuroprotection in a photoperiod-dependent manner. To test this, F344 rats were exposed to L6 (6 h light/day), L12 (12 h light/day) and L18 (18 h light/day) photoperiods and fed a standard chow diet supplemented with either a control, lyophilized cherry 1 or cherry 2 with distinctive phenolic hallmarks. Physiological parameters (body weight, eating pattern index (EPI), testosterone, T4/T3) and hypothalamic key genes (Dio2, Dio3, Raldh1 and Ghrh) were strongly regulated by the photoperiod and/or fruit consumption. Importantly, we show for the first time that neurotrophs (Bdnf, Sod1 and Gpx1) in the hippocampus are also regulated by the photoperiod. Furthermore, the consumption of cherry 2, which was richer in total flavonols, but not cherry 1, which was richer in total anthocyanins and flavanols, enhanced neuroprotection in the hippocampus. Our results show that the seasonal consumption of cherry with a specific phenolic composition plays an important role in the hippocampal activation of neuroprotection in a photoperiod-dependent manner.

AB  - Although n-hexane can induce ovarian damage by inducing ovarian granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis, the mechanism underlying this induction of apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, rat ovarian GCs were exposed to different concentrations of 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) (the main metabolite of n-hexane) in vitro to observe apoptosis, and the mechanism was further explored via mRNA microarray analysis. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry suggested that the apoptosis rate of ovarian GC apoptosis was significantly increased in the 2,5-HD-treated group. Subsequently, microarray analysis revealed that a total of 5677 mRNAs were differentially expressed, and further GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in many signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway. A total of 7 differentially expressed genes that function upstream of the Hippo signaling pathway (Nf2, Wwc1, Ajuba, Llgl1, Dlg3, Rassf6 and Rassf1) were selected to confirm the microarray results by qRT-PCR, and the expression of these genes did change. Subsequently, the expression of key effector genes (Yap1, Mst1 and Lats1) and target genes (Ctgf and Puma) of the Hippo signaling was measured, and the results suggested that the mRNA and protein levels of Yap1, Mst1, Lats1, and Ctgf were significantly decreased while those of Puma were significantly increased after 2,5-HD treatment. Further CO-IP analysis suggested that the interaction between YAP1 and TEAD was significantly reduced after 2,5-HD treatment, while the interaction between YAP1 and P73 was not affected. In summary, during the 2,5-HD-induced apoptosis of ovarian GCs, the Hippo signaling pathway is inhibited, and downregulation of the pro-proliferation gene Ctgf and upregulated of the pro-apoptosis gene Puma are important. Decreased Ctgf expression was associated with decreased binding of YAP1 to TEAD. However, increased PUMA expression was not associated with YAP1 binding to P73.

AB  - All terrestrial species interact with the airspace.1 The principles derived from the study of those interactions, i.e., from the field of aeroecology,2 are most often used to model species movements (e.g., Miller et al.3 and Nourani et al.4). Despite this, they are almost never used to understand species distributions,5 an issue fundamental to ecology, conservation, and management.6-8 We used resource selection functions and species distribution models to (1) show that aeroecological principles are a driver of seasonally variable distributions for critically endangered California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) and (2) predict range expansion for this heavily managed and rapidly growing population. Condors used thermal updraft either directly in proportion to, or less frequently than, predicted by its availability. However, during winter, when thermals are weak, they used orographic (deflected) updraft more than would be expected, suggesting that condor distribution was limited by the availability of predictable orographic updraft. Furthermore, resource selection functions for condors always performed better with than without aeroecological predictors. Aeroecological species distribution models predicted that habitat selected most strongly by condors would vary seasonally with changes in the weather, from 1.7%-5.0% (winter) to 6.6%-11.1% (spring/autumn) of California and Oregon. Explaining seasonal variation in condor distribution with aeroecological principles led to insights contrary to conventional wisdom that interannual movement of soaring avian scavengers responds to transiting of their food, domesticated and wild ungulates. Incorporating aeroecological principles into models of species distributions can lead to better understanding of animal movement and distributions and provide information with substantial consequence to endangered species management.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of partial and drug-resistant epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures originating from temporal lobe structures like the hippocampus. Hippocampal sclerosis and oxidative stress are two important factors in the pathogenesis of TLE that exacerbate epileptic seizures in this form of epilepsy. Recently, royal jelly (RJ) shown to have neuroprotective and antioxidant activities in several neurodegenerative models. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the pretreatment effect of RJ on epileptic seizures, hippocampal neuronal loss, and oxidative stress in the rat model of kainic acid (KA)-induced TLE. To this aim, 40 male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were divided into 4 groups, including control, vehicle, KA, and RJ + KA. Rats received RJ (150 mg/kg/day) for 14 days before induction of TLE with KA. Epileptic behaviors were evaluated according to Racine's scale. Oxidative stress markers including, malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (using Nissl staining) were evaluated in all groups. Our findings showed that RJ pretreatment significantly reduced the seizure score and increased the latency to the first seizure. RJ also reduced MDA and TOS while increasing TAC. In addition, RJ reversed neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. In conclusion, our results suggest that RJ has anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects in KA induced TLE via its antioxidative properties.

AB  - Depression is a chronic and recurrent disease without satisfactory treatment strategies. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture is well known in Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) due to its unique nonpharmacological nature. Electroacupuncture (EA) for antidepressant therapy has been widely recognized and used in clinic. In this study, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mice model was used to evaluate the anti-depressant effects of EA treatment. Open Field Test (OFT), Force Swimming Test (FST), and Sucrose Preference Test (SPT) were utilized to detect the ethological alterations in mice. The transcriptology technique was used to evaluate the changes in the hippocampal transcriptome in different groups. We measured protein levels using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that LPS induced ethological alterations in mice and enhanced the gene expression related to gene ontology such as the banded collagen fibril, fibrillar collagen trimer, and collagen fibril organization, pathways such as collagen chain trimerization, collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes, and collagen formation. EA could reverse the ECM deposition by inhibiting collagen type IV trimer, extracellular matrix organization, and collagen formation. EA could enhance the MMP1 and MMP9 expression and promote synaptic plasticity. These data indicated that EA possesses an antidepressant effect, this may achieve by increasing MMPs expression and then remodeling the ECM surrounding the neurons, ultimately repairing neural circuits and promoting synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Efficient clearance of amyloid-beta (A beta) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine-rich lipids (metformin-inspired MLS and arginine-contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone-mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co-assembled with oleic acid-modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro-autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons-microglia crosstalk for A beta elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine-rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A beta into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A beta. The lipoplex-boosted neuron-microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra- and extra-cellular A beta aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates approximate to 86.9% of A beta plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A beta clearance in AD treatment.

AB  - Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress coexist and interact in the progression of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and other neurodegenerative disease. Mounting studies reveal that Dexmedetomidine (Dex) possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, whether Dex exerts neuroprotective effect on the cognitive sequelae of oxidative stress and inflammatory process remains unclear. A mouse model of abdominal exploratory laparotomy-induced cognitive dysfunction was employed to explore the underlying mechanism of neuroprotective effects exerted by Dex in POCD. Aged mice were treated with Dex (20 mu g/kg) 20 min prior to surgery. Open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) were employed to examine the cognitive function on postoperative day 3 (POD 3) or POD 7. In the present study, mice underwent surgery exhibited cognitive impairment without altering spontaneous locomotor activity, while the surgery-induced cognitive impairment could be alleviated by Dex pretreatment. Dex inhibited surgery-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines accumulation and microglial activation in the hippocampi of mice. Furthermore, Dex decreased MDA levels, enhanced SOD activity, modulated CDK5 activity and increased BDNF expression in the hippocampus. In addition, Dex remarkably reduced the surgery-induced increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and apoptotic neurons in the hippocampi of aged mice. Collectively, our study provides evidence that Dex may exert neuroprotective effects against surgery-induced cognitive impairment through mechanisms involving its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as the suppression on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and apoptosis-related pathway.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that peripheral inflammation induces cognitive dysfunction. Several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in animal models of not only peripheral inflammation but also Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not clear which HDAC expressed in the central nervous system or peripheral tissues is involved in the therapeutic effect of HDAC inhibition on cognitive dysfunction. Hence, the present study investigated the effect of peripheral HDAC inhibition on peripheral inflammation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor that is mainly distributed in peripheral tissues after intraperitoneal administration, was found to prevent peripheral inflammation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, pretreatment with SAHA dramatically increased mRNA expression of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in peripheral and central tissues and attenuated peripheral inflammation-induced microglial activation in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Minocycline, a macrophage/microglia inhibitor, also ameliorated cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, as a result of treatment with liposomal clodronate, depletion of peripheral macrophages partially ameliorated the peripheral inflammation-evoked cognitive dysfunction. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of peripheral HDAC plays a critical role in preventing cognitive dysfunction induced by peripheral inflammation via the regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine production and the inhibition of microglial functions in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings could provide support for inhibition of peripheral HDAC as a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammation-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the intrinsic mechanism by which an extremely lowfrequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) influences neurons in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) region of rat hippocampus using electrophysiological techniques. ELF-EMF has an interesting effect on synaptic plasticity: it weakens long-term potentiation and enhances long-term depression. Here, the magnetic field effect disappeared after a blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcineurin, which are key components in the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway, with two blockers, cadmium chloride and cyclosporin A. This fully establishes that the effect of ELF-EMF on synaptic plasticity is mediated by the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway and represents a novel technique for studying the specific mechanisms of action of ELF-EMF on learning and memory.

AB  - Activation of the sympatho-(3-adrenergic receptor ((3AR) system is the hallmark of heart disease with adverse consequences that facilitate the onset and progression of heart failure (HF). Use of (3-blocking drugs has become the front-line therapy for HF. Last decade has witnessed progress in research demonstrating a pivotal role of Hippo pathway in cardiomyopathy and HF. Clinical studies have revealed myocardial Hippo pathway activation/ YAP-TEAD1 inactivation in several types of human cardiomyopathy. Experimental activation of cardiac Hippo signaling or inhibition of YAP-TEAD1 have been shown to leads dilated cardiomyopathy with severe mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming. Studies have also convincingly shown that stimulation of (3AR activates cardiac Hippo pathway with inactivation of the down-stream effector molecules YAP/TAZ. There is strong evidence for the adverse consequences of the (3AR-Hippo signaling leading to HF. In addition to promoting cardiomyocyte death and fibrosis, recent progress is the demonstration of mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming mediated by (3AR-Hippo pathway signaling. Activation of cardiac (3AR-Hippo signaling is potent in downregulating a range of mitochondrial and metabolic genes, whereas expression of proinflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors are upregulated. Coupling of (3AR-Hippo pathway signaling is mediated by several kinases, mechanotransduction and/or Ca2+ signaling, and can be blocked by (3-antagonists. Demonstration of the converge of (3AR signaling and Hippo pathway bears implications for a better understanding on the role of enhanced sympathetic nervous activity, efficacy of (3-antagonists, and metabolic therapy targeting this pathway in HF. In this review we summarize the progress and discuss future research directions in this field.

AB  - Saccharum ravannae, known as "Ekra" in the Northeast region of India, is an elephant grass species that abundantly grows in the natural habitat of Assam. This study aims to utilize this wild grass species and extract alkaline lignin of high purity through KOH-mediated alkaline hydrothermal pretreatment using the Oil bath process. Lignin recovery was optimized using RSM (response surface methodology) combined with a central composite model. Three process parameters, namely KOH concentration (1-3 %), reaction time (50-200 min), and solid loading (5-15 %), varied to optimize the combined effect of these parameters. RSM predicted a maximum lignin recovery of 15.38 g/100 g of raw biomass at optimum conditions (2.4 % KOH, 6.41 % solid loading, 176.57 min). Three experimental runs were performed at optimum conditions, and 15.81 +/- 0.32 g/100 g lignin recovery was obtained, thus verifying the predicted result. Maximum 93.7 % purity of extracted lignin was achieved in a different operating condition (3 % KOH, 10 % solid loading, 125 min). The commercial and extracted alkaline lignin with maximum purity was characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extracted lignin shows higher phenolic content and more functional groups than commercial lignin and can be used for future applications.

AB  - Bronze Age agriculture in Europe is marked by the adoption of new crops, such as broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), broad bean (Vicia faba) and gold-of-pleasure (Camelina sativa). Yet, at a regional level, it is sometimes unclear when, where and why these crops are adopted and whether they were all adopted at the same time. Croatia is one such region where archaeobotanical research is limited, making it difficult to discuss Bronze Age agriculture and diet in more detail. The discovery of a burnt-down house with crop stores at Kalnik-Igrisce provides a unique archaeobotanical assemblage and snapshot of late Bronze Age agriculture (1000-800 BC). From the carbonised plant remains discovered at Kalnik-Igrisce we see a dominance in the crops broomcorn millet, barley (Hordeum vulgare), free-threshing wheat (Triticum aestivum/durum/turgidum) and broad bean. Emmer (Triticum dicoccum), spelt (Triticum spelta), and lentil (Lens culinaris) were also found, suggesting they were probably minor crops, while spatial analysis indicates distinct crop storage areas within the building. Overall, these finds support the adoption and integration of these new crops within northern Croatia by the late Bronze Age, while highlighting implications for seasonal strategies, risk management, and cultural dietary choice.

AB  - Iodine is an essential trace element in the human body. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy leads to obvious intellectual disability in the offspring. The effects of iodine deficiency on brain development have been demonstrated, but there is no clear evidence of the effects of iodine excess on brain development. To clarify the effects of iodine excess on the brain development of offspring and to provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the effects of iodine deficiency and iodine excess on the brain development of offspring. In this study, animal models with different iodine intakes were constructed using potassium iodate (KIO3). The models included four experimental groups (low-iodine group one (LI, 0 mu g/L iodine), low-iodine group two (LII, 5 mu g/L iodine), high-iodine group one (HI, 3000 mu g/L iodine), and high-iodine group two (HII, 10000 mu g/L iodine)) and one control group (NI, 100 mu g/L iodine). There were 20 female rats in each group, and 8 offspring were chosen from each group following birth to assess metabolic alterations. The metabolites of subsets of brain hippocampal tissue were profiled by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-linked electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS) and the results were subjected to multivariate data analysis. Differential substances were screened by t test (p<0.05), principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares analysis (PLS-DA, VIP>1). The thyroid function of the female rats in the experimental group was abnormally changed. Metabolic analysis showed that the five groups were separated which revealed significant differences in hippocampal tissue metabolism among the five groups of offspring. A total of 12 potential metabolites were identified, with the majority of them being related to amino acid and energy metabolism. These metabolites are involved in various metabolic pathways, are interrelated, and may play a function in brain development. Our study highlights changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways in the brain hippocampus of offspring rats with different iodine intakes compared to controls, revealing new insights into hippocampal metabolism in offspring rats and new relevant targets.

AB  - Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The evolutionarily conserved Hippo-Yap signaling pathway regulates cardiac responses to stress and progression to heart failure. Mst1 and Mst2 are the core Hippo pathway kinases, yet their role within chronically stressed cardiomyocytes remains largely unknown. Genetic mouse models revealed that the extent of Mst1/2 inhibition elicits opposing effects on stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. Yap-TEAD1 activation, cell cycling, and hallmarks of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, which can impair contractile function during sustained stress, were enhanced in Mst1/2 double knockout hearts. These findings implicate a physiological function of Mst1/2 to promote cardiomyocyte maturity in the adult heart.

AB  - S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) plays a critical role in the development of neural tube defects (NTDs). Studies have shown that the paired box 3 (Pax3) gene is involved in neural tube closure. However, the exact mechanism between Pax3 and NTDs induced by SAM deficiency remains unclear. Here, The NTD mouse model was induced using cycloleucine (CL), an inhibitor of SAM biosynthesis, to determine the effect of Pax3 on NTDs. The effect of CL on NTD occurrence was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blot in NTD embryonic brain tissues and immortalized hippocampal neuron cells (HT-22). A high incidence of NTDs was observed when CL was administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. The levels of SAM and Pax3 were significantly reduced in NTD embryonic brain tissues and HT-22 cells after CL exposure. Decreased proliferation and excessive apoptosis were observed in neuroepithelial cells of NTD embryos and HT-22 cells under SAM deficiency, but these effects were reversed by overexpression of Pax3. These results suggest that decreased expression of Pax3 impairs the dynamic balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to NTDs induced by SAM deficiency, which would provide new insights for clarifying the underlying mechanism of NTDs.

AB  - Ferroptosis and oxytosis are iron- and oxidative stress-dependent cell death pathways strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and metabolic disorders. Therefore, specific inhibitors may have broad clinical applications. We previously reported that 3-[4-(dimethylamino)benzyl]-2oxindole (GIF-0726-r) and derivatives protected the mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 against oxytosis/ferroptosis by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In this study, we evaluated the biological activities of GIF-0726-r derivatives with modifications at the oxindole skeleton and other positions. The addition of a methyl, nitro, or bromo group to C-5 of the oxindole skeleton enhanced antiferroptotic efficacy on HT22 cells during membrane cystine-glutamate antiporter inhibition and ensued intracellular glutathione depletion. In contrast, the substitution of the dimethylamino group on the side chain phenyl ring with a methyl, nitro, or amine group dramatically suppressed antiferroptotic activity regardless of other modifications. Compounds with antiferroptotic activity also directly scavenged ROS and decreased free ferrous ions in both HT22 cells and cellfree reactions while those compounds without antiferroptotic activity had little effect on either ROS or ferrous-ion concentration. Unlike oxindole compounds, which we have previously reported, the antiferroptotic compounds had little effect on the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element pathway. Oxindole GIF-0726-r derivatives with a 4-(dimethylamino)benzyl moiety at C-3 and some types of bulky group at C-5 (whether electron-donating or electron-withdrawing) can suppress ferroptosis, warranting safety and efficacy evaluations in animal models of disease.

AB  - BackgroundEnvironmental stressors and neurotoxicants during prenatal development are known to be risk factors for psychiatric disorders. However, their combined molecular effects remain elusive. Thus, this study aimed to investigate synergistic effects of prenatal stress and lead (Pb) exposure on hippocampal proteome alterations and behavioral outcomes in a rat model.MethodsPregnant Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to repeated variable stress during gestational days 14-21 and were administered 0.2% lead acetate via drinking water throughout gestation and lactation. In addition, a repeated variable stress paradigm was applied to the pregnant rats during the last week of gestation. Male offspring underwent behavioral assessments, including pre-pulse inhibition, social interaction, and open-field tests. Hippocampal protein expression was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and validated by western blot analysis.ResultsCombined exposure significantly altered anxiety-like behavior, reduced social interactions, and impaired sensorimotor gating in the offspring. Proteomic analysis revealed 16 proteins that were differentially expressed in the hippocampus. Notably, western blot validation confirmed the significant downregulation of phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (Pebp1) and peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that concurrent prenatal stress and Pb exposure can induce specific molecular signatures in the hippocampal proteome alongside behavioral deficits characteristic of psychiatric disorders. The identification of Pebp1 and Prdx2 as key molecular targets provides new insights into potential therapeutic interventions for environmental exposure-related psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The development of new biocompatible and eco-friendly materials is essential for the future of dental practice, especially for the management of dental caries. In this study, a novel and simple method was applied for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from the aqueous extract of Camellia sinensis (WT) and functionalized with chitosan (CHS) and NaF. The effects of WT_AgNPs application on demineralized dentin were evaluated for potential dental applications. The WT_AgNPs showed molecular groups related to organic compounds, potentially acting as reducing and capping agents. All AgNPs presented spherical shapes with crystal sizes of approximately 20 nm. Forty human molars were assigned to control: sound (SD) and demineralised dentine (DD), and experimental groups: WT_AgNPs, WT_AgNPs_NaF, and WT_AgNPs_CHS. Then, the NPs were applied to DD to evaluate the chemical, crystallographic, and microstructural characteristics of treated-dentine. In addition, a three-point bending test was employed to assess mechanical response. The application of WT_AgNPs indicated a higher mineralisation degree and crystallites sizes of hydroxyapatite than the DD group. SEM images showed that WT_AgNPs presented different degrees of aggregation and distribution patterns. The dentine flexural strength was significantly increased in all WT_AgNPs. The application of WT_AgNPs demonstrated remineralising and strengthening potential on demineralised dentine.

AB  - The role of hypoxia in terms of affecting mammary epithelial cells (MECs) proliferation is closely associated with the milk synthesis of lactating mammals. Primary bovine MECs were cultured at 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21% O2 for 24 h. The results showed that cell proliferation decreased linearly, and hypoxic inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha expression increased linearly along with the declining O2. The linear increase in oxidative stress resulted in the accumulation of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities following the reduced O2. Concerning mitochondria, the dynamin-related protein 1 showed improved expression, and optin atrophy protein 1 decreased along with the decreasing O2 gradient, which led to decreased mitochondrial mass and mitophagy emerging under 1% O2. Oxygen concentration-trend RNA-seq analysis was conducted. Specifically, HIF-1-MAPK (1% O2), PI3K-Akt-MAPK (6% O2), and p53-Hippo (11 and 16% O2) were found to primarily regulate cell proliferation in response to hypoxia compared with normoxia (21%), respectively. In conclusion, our study suggests that bMEC proliferation is suppressed in low-oxygen conditions, and is exacerbated following the reduced oxygen supply. The cross-oxygen gradient comparisons suggest that MAPK and Hippo, which are core pathways of mammary cell proliferation, are repressed by hypoxia via oxidative-stress-dependent signals.

AB  - This study investigated the structure of acid Alhagi camelorum Fischa polysaccharide (aAP) and its impact on intestinal activity in mice. The results showed that aAP comprised of the fucose, arabinose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, xylose, mannose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid with the molar ratio of 0.81:14.97:10.84:11.14:3.26:0.80:0.80:54.92:2.47 with the molecular weight (Mw) of 22.734 kDa. Additionally, the composition of aAP was assessed via FT-IR, methylation, and NMR analyses, indicating that the backbone of the aAP was consisted of -> 4)- alpha-D-Gal p A-6-OMe-(1 -> 4)- alpha-Gal p A-(1 -> and -> 4)- alpha-D-Gal p A-6-OMe-(1 -> 2)- alpha-L- Rha p-(1 ->, as well as -> 4)- beta-D-Gal p- and -> 5)- alpha-L-Ara f- for the branched chain. Furthermore, ICR mice underwent intragastric administration of different concentrations of aAP for 7 consecutive days. The results showed that aAP enhanced the murine spleen and thymus indices, promoted the secretion of serum lgG antibody, intestinal lgA antibody and intestinal cytokines, improved the morphology of intestinal villi and crypts, enhanced quantity of intestinal IELs and IgA + cells, and activated T lymphocytes and DC cells in MLNs. In summary, these findings suggest that the utilization of aAP could enhance the immune response of the murine intestinal mucosa.

AB  - Hippo pathway with its main molecule YAP is a crucial pathway for development, tissue homeostasis, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cancer. In this review, we discuss the multiple effects of the YAP/Hippo pathway in the immune system and cancer. We analyzed a series of effects: extracellular vesicles enhanced immunity through inhibition of LATS1/2, ways of modulation of the tumor microenvironment, YAP- and TAZ-mediated upregulation of PDL1, high expression of YAP and PDL1 in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells, enhanced YAP activity in inflammation, and the effect of the Hippo pathway on T cells, B cells, Tregs, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These pleiotropic effects render the YAP and Hippo pathway a key pathway for exploitation in the future, in order to enhance our immunotherapy treatment strategies in oncology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological disorder characterized by insidious onset. Identifying potential markers in its emergence and progression is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Imaging genetics typically merges genetic variables with multiple imaging parameters, employing various association analysis algorithms to investigate the links between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations, and to unearth molecular-level insights from brain images. However, most existing imaging genetics algorithms based on sparse learning assume a linear relationship between genetic factors and brain functions, limiting their ability to discern complex nonlinear correlation patterns and resulting in reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel nonlinear imaging genetic association analysis method, Deep Self-Reconstruction-based Adaptive Sparse Multi-view Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DSR-AdaSMDGCCA). This approach facilitates joint learning of the nonlinear relationships between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations by integrating three different types of data: structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and gene expression data. By incorporating nonlinear transformations in DGCCA, our model effectively uncovers nonlinear associations across multiple data types. Additionally, the DSR algorithm clusters samples with identical labels, incorporating label information into the nonlinear feature extraction process and thus enhancing the performance of association analysis. The application of the DSR-AdaSMDGCCA algorithm on real data sets identified several AD risk regions (such as the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform gyrus) and risk genes (including VSIG4, NEDD4L, and PINK1), achieving maximum classification accuracy with the fewest selected features compared to baseline algorithms. Molecular biology enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways enriched by these top genes are intimately linked to AD progression, affirming that our algorithm not only improves correlation analysis performance but also identifies biologically significant markers.

AB  - Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling is an animal model for studying human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is characterized by alterations of hippocampal neurons and memory. Although the intranasal (IN) administration of oxytocin (OT) has limited efficiency, nanoparticles (NPs) are a promising candidate to deliver OT to the brain. However, there are very limited data on epilepsy research about oxytocin-loaded nanoparticles (NP-OTs). The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of IN administration of chronic NP-OTs on the hippocampus of PTZinduced male epileptic rats in terms of seizure severity, memory, neurogenesis, and neuronal damage. Saline/OT/NP-OTs were administrated to both control (Ctrl) and PTZ groups intranasally. Consequently, saline and PTZ were injected, respectively, 25 times every 48 h. Then, seizure severity (score and latency) was calculated for the PTZ groups. A spatial working memory evaluation test (SWMET) was performed after the last injection. Hippocampus histopathology, neurogenesis, and apoptosis were demonstrated. Serum total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels and the oxidative stress index (OSI) were measured. We showed that OTs and NP-OTs prevented the kindling development and had positive effects on seizure severity. SWMET-related behaviors were also recovered in the PTZ + NP-OT group. A significant increase of neurogenesis and decrease of apoptosis in the hippocampus of the PTZ + NP-OT group were observed, while OTs and NP-OTs had protective effects against PTZ-induced damage to hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that the chronic administration of NP-OTs may have positive effects on hippocampal damage via increasing neurogenesis and decreasing apoptosis and seizure severity.

AB  - The Motin family proteins (Motins) are a class of scaffolding proteins consisting of Angiomotin (AMOT), AMOT-like protein 1 (AMOTL1), and AMOT-like protein 2 (AMOTL2). Motins play a pivotal role in angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and neurogenesis by modulating multiple cellular signaling pathways. Recent findings indicate that Motins are components of the Hippo pathway, a signaling cascade involved in development and cancer. This review discusses how Motins are integrated into the Hippo signaling network, as either upstream regulators or downstream effectors, to modulate cell proliferation and migration. The repression of YAP/TAZ by Motins contributes to growth inhibition, whereas subcellular localization of Motins and their interactions with actin fibers are critical in regulating cell migration. The net effect of Motins on cell proliferation and migration may contribute to their diverse biological functions.

AB  - Saikosaponin-a (SSa) exhibits antiepileptic effects. However, its poor water solubility and inability to pass through the blood-brain barrier greatly limit its clinical development and application. In this study, SSa-loaded Methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(& epsilon;-caprolactone) (MePEG-SSa-PCL) NPs were successfully prepared and characterized. Our objective was to further investigate the effect of this composite on acute seizure in mice. First, we confirmed the particle size and surface potential of the composite (51.00 & PLUSMN; 0.25 nm and - 33.77 & PLUSMN; 2.04 mV, respectively). Further, we compared the effects of various MePEG-SSa-PCL doses (low, medium, and high) with those of free SSa, valproic acid (VPA - positive control), and saline only (model group) on acute seizure using three different acute epilepsy mouse models. We observed that compared with the model group, the three MePEG-SSa-PCL treatments showed significantly lowered seizure frequency in mice belonging to the maximum electroconvulsive model group. In the pentylenetetrazol and kainic acid (KA) acute epilepsy models, MePEG-SSa-PCL increased both clonic and convulsion latency periods and shortened convulsion duration more effectively than equivalent SSa-only doses. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining revealed considerably less neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA3 area of KA mice in the SSa, VPA, and three MePEG-SSa-PCL groups relative to mice in the model group. Hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptor and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels in KA mice were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the three MePEG-SSa-PCL treatment groups than in the model group. Thus, MePEG-SSa-PCL exhibited a more potent antiepileptic effect than SSa in acute mouse epilepsy models and could alleviate neuronal damage in the hippocampus following epileptic seizures, possibly via GABA-A receptor expression upregulation.

AB  - Individuals with psychosocial stress often experience an exaggerated response to air pollutants. Ozone (O-3) exposure has been associated with the activation of the neuroendocrine stress-response system. We hypothesized that preexistent mild chronic stress plus social isolation (CS), or social isolation (SI) alone, would exacerbate the acute effects of O-3 exposure on the circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones, and the expression of the genes regulating glucocorticoid stress signaling via an altered stress adaptation in a brain-region-specific manner. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (5 weeks old) were socially isolated, plus were subjected to either CS (noise, confinement, fear, uncomfortable living, hectic activity, and single housing), SI (single housing only, restricted handling and no enrichment) or no stress (NS; double housing, frequent handling and enrichment provided) for 8 weeks. The rats were then exposed to either air or O-3 (0.8 ppm for 4 h), and the samples were collected immediately after. The indicators of sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) activation (i.e., epinephrine, corticosterone, and lymphopenia) increased with O-3 exposure, but there were no effects from CS or SI, except for the depletion of serum BDNF. CS and SI revealed small changes in brain-region-specific glucocorticoid-signaling-associated markers of gene expression in the air-exposed rats (hypothalamic Nr3c1, Nr3c2 Hsp90aa1, Hspa4 and Cnr1 inhibition in SI; hippocampal HSP90aa1 increase in SI; and inhibition of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) Cnr1 in CS). Gene expression across all brain regions was altered by O-3, reflective of glucocorticoid signaling effects, such as Fkbp5 in NS, CS and SI. The SI effects on Fkbp5 were greatest for SI in BNST. O-3 increased Cnr2 expression in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulbs of the NS and SI groups. O-3, in all stress conditions, generally inhibited the expression of Nr3c1 in all brain regions, Nr3c2 in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and Bdnf in the hippocampus. SI, in general, showed slightly greater O-3-induced changes when compared to NS and CS. Serum metabolomics revealed increased sphingomyelins in the air-exposed SI and O-3-exposed NS, with underlying SI dampening some of the O-3-induced changes. These results suggest a potential link between preexistent SI and acute O-3-induced increases in the circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones and brain-region-specific gene expression changes in glucocorticoid signaling, which may partly underlie the stress dynamic in those with long-term SI.

AB  - Oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is widely known to repair the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-initiated DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), and more recently was shown to act as an epigenetic modifier. We have previously shown that saline-exposed Ogg1 -/- knockout progeny exhibited learning and memory deficits, which were enhanced by in utero exposure to a single low dose of ethanol (EtOH) in both Ogg1 +/+ and -/- progeny, but more so in Ogg1 -/- progeny. Herein, OGG1-deficient progeny exposed in utero to a single low dose of EtOH or its saline vehicle exhibited OGG1- and/or EtOH-dependent alterations in global histone methylation and acetylation, DNA methylation and gene expression (Tet1 (Tet Methylcytosine Dioxygenase 1), Nlgn3 (Neuroligin 3), Hdac2 (Histone Deacetylase 2), Reln (Reelin) and Esr1 (Estrogen Receptor 1)) in fetal brains, and behavioural changes in open field activity, social interaction and ultrasonic vocalization, but not prepulse inhibition. OGG1- and EtOH-dependent changes in Esr1 and Esr2 mRNA and protein levels were sex-dependent, as was the association of Esr1 gene expression with gene activation mark histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and gene repression mark histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) measured via ChIP-qPCR. The OGG1-dependent changes in global epigenetic marks and gene/protein expression in fetal brains, and postnatal behavioural changes, observed in both saline- and EtOH-exposed progeny, suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in developmental disorders mediated by 8-oxoG and/or OGG1. Epigenetic effects of OGG1 may be involved in ESR1-mediated gene regulation, which may be altered by physiological and EtOH-enhanced levels of ROS formation, possibly contributing to sex-dependent developmental disorders observed in Ogg1 knockout mice. The OGG1- and EtOH-dependent associations provide a basis for more comprehensive mechanistic studies to determine the causal involvement of oxidative DNA damage and epigenetic changes in ROS-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is the main kind of anthocyanins that has been reported to possess neuroprotective potentials. In this study, the protection effects of C3G on Pb-induced neurotoxicity and underlying mechanisms were demonstrated. Integrated biomarker responses (IBR) were employed to comprehensively evaluate the neuroprotection of C3G. Results showed that C3G apparently ameliorated the behavioral impairments of Pbinduced rats, and decreased Pb concentrations in the brains and blood. C3G suppressed Pb-induced oxidative damage by increasing Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and decreasing Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in brains. C3G may exhibit its neuroprotection via upregulating neurotransmitters levels, protecting the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor function, promoting Ca2+ influx and modifying the Ca2+ dependent processes like protein kinases, signaling molecules, transcription factors and immediate early genes (IEGs). IBR revealed that C3G could dose-dependently improve Pb-induced cognitive impairment and nerve injury. Collectively, this report indicated that C3G could improve Pb-induced cognitive functional impairment by improving oxidative stress and mediating the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - In the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus, neurogenesis from neural stem cells (NSCs) is regulated by Wnt signals from the local micro- environment. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is active in NSCs, where it regulates proliferation and fate commitment, and subsequently its activity is strongly attenuated. The mechanisms controlling Wnt activity are poorly understood. In stem cells from adult peripheral tissues, secreted R-spondin proteins (RSPO1-4) interact with LGR4-6 receptors and control Wnt signaling strength. Here, we found that RSPO1-3 and LGR4-6 are expressed in the adult dentate gyrus and in cultured NSCs isolated from the adult mouse hippocampus. LGR4-5 expression decreased in cultured NSCs upon differentiation, concomitantly with the reported decrease in Wnt activity. Treatment with RSPO1-3 increased NSC proliferation and the expression of Cyclin D1 but did not induce the expression of Axin2 or RNF43, 2 well-described Wnt target genes. However, RSPOs enhanced the effect of Wnt3a on Axin2 and RNF43 expression as well as on Wnt/beta-catenin reporter activity, indicating that they can potentiate Wnt activity in NSCs. Moreover, RSPO1-3 was found to be expressed by cultured dentate gyrus astrocytes, a crucial component of the neurogenic niche. In co-culture experiments, the astrocyte-induced proliferation of NSCs was prevented by RSPO2 knockdown in astrocytes and LGR5 knockdown in hippocampal NSCs. Additionally, RSPO2 knockdown in the adult mouse dentate gyrus reduced proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells in vivo. Altogether, our results indicate that RSPO/LGR signaling is present in the dentate gyrus and plays a crucial role in regulating neural precursor cell proliferation.

AB  - The faithful production of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in vitro opens a wide range of novel applications in reproductive biology and medicine. However, the reproducibility of PGCs culture conditions across different laboratories or breeds remains a challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to research the molecular dynamics that lead to the gradual establishment of cultured PGCs lines network. Here, the results of single-cell RNA-seq indicated that the cell cycle drove cellular heterogeneity. The active populations engaged in PGC self-renewal and the characteristics of the aging cell fate have been identified. The active self-renewal populations presented a rising expression of DNA repair genes, couple with a high proportion of cells in G1/S phase and a low frequency of cells in G2 phase. Notably, Hippo, FoxO, AMPK and MAPK pathways are active within these populations. The combination of six activator or inhibitors, targeting these active pathways, resulted in a significantly higher proliferation rate of PGCs and an increased number of cells entering the G1 and S phases. Importantly, they greatly reduced the establishment time to a minimum of 26 days and increased the efficiency of male PGC line establishment to 59 % in FS medium. Our results provided several new insights into the PGCs.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Neuroinflammation is associated with the progression of various brain diseases, and the management of neuroinflammation-induced neural damage is a crucial aspect of treating neurological disorders. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory efficacy of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) using 660 nm phototherapy in a rat model with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Methods: We induced inflammation in rat brains via intraperitoneal injection of LPS and subjected the treatment group to 660 nm phototherapy to examine its protective effect against hippocampal damage based on pathological, histological, and immunohistochemical tissue analyses. Results: The 660 nm treated rats showed a significant decrease in hippocampal structural damage and cell death compared to the LPS-treated group. We observed reduced expression of the inflammation markers GFAP, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in the hippocampus of the treatment group, and an increase in SIRT1 expression across all hippocampal regions. Conclusions: This study presents a promising method for controlling neuroinflammation and providing neuroprotection and inflammation relief. PBMT represents a non-invasive therapeutic approach with minimal side effects ensured through the proper control of light irradiation.

AB  - BackgroundAutophagic defects are involved in Methamphetamine (Meth)-induced neurotoxicity. Syntaxin 17 (Stx17), a member of the SNARE protein family, participating in several stages of autophagy, including autophagosome-late endosome/lysosome fusion. However, the role of Stx17 and potential mechanisms in autophagic defects induced by Meth remain poorly understood.MethodsTo address the mechanism of Meth-induced cognitive impairment, the adenovirus (AV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) were injected into the hippocampus for stereotaxis to overexpress Stx17 in vivo to examine the cognitive ability via morris water maze and novel object recognition. In molecular level, the synaptic injury and autophagic defects were evaluated. To address the Meth induced neuronal damage, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation assay was performed to evaluate the degradability of the "cargos" mediated by Meth, and mechanistically, the maturation of the vesicles, including autophagosomes and endosomes, were validated by the Co-IP and the GTP-agarose affinity isolation assays.ResultsOverexpression of Stx17 in the hippocampus markedly rescued the Meth-induced cognitive impairment and synaptic loss. For endosomes, Meth exposure upregulated Rab5 expression and its guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (immature endosome), with a commensurate decreased active form of Rab7 (Rab7-GTP) and impeded the binding of Rab7 to CCZ1 (mature endosome); for autophagosomes, Meth treatment elicited a dramatic reduction in the overlap between Stx17 and autophagosomes but increased the colocalization of ATG5 and autophagosomes (immature autophagosomes). After Stx17 overexpression, the Rab7-GTP levels in purified late endosomes were substantially increased in parallel with the elevated mature autophagosomes, facilitating cargo (A beta 42, p-tau, and EGFR) degradation in the vesicles, which finally ameliorated Meth-induced synaptic loss and memory deficits in mice.ConclusionStx17 decrease mediated by Meth contributes to vesicle fusion defects which may ascribe to the immature autophagosomes and endosomes, leading to autophagic dysfunction and finalizes neuronal damage and cognitive impairments. Therefore, targeting Stx17 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for Meth-induced neuronal injury.

AB  - beta-glucosidases (BGLUs) are abundant enzymes in plants that play pivotal roles in cell wall modification, hormone signal transduction, secondary metabolism, defense against herbivores, and volatile compound release. Bletilla striata, a perennial herb revered for its therapeutic properties, lacks a comprehensive analysis of its BGLU gene family despite the critical role these genes play in plant secondary metabolism. This study aims to perform a genome-wide analysis of the BGLU gene family in B. striata (BsBGLU) to elucidate their functions and regulatory mechanisms in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. We conducted a genome-wide screening to identify BsBGLU, followed by phylogenetic analysis to classify these genes into groups. Sequence characteristics were analyzed to predict functional roles. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were examined to assess conservation and polymorphism among different landraces. Expression profiles of BsBGLUs were evaluated under sodium acetate and salicylic acid elicitor treatments and across different tissues. The accumulation of phylogenetic metabolites in different treatments and tissues was also analyzed by HPLC and LCMS detection to explore the correlation between gene expression and metabolite accumulation. A total of 23 BsBGLU genes were identified and classified into eight distinct groups. Sequence analysis suggested diverse functions related to hormone responses, secondary metabolism, and stress resistance. BsBGLUs with SSR sequences were conserved yet showed polymorphism among different B. striata landraces. Under elicitor treatments, expression profiling revealed that BsBGLUs significantly modulate the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as dactylorhin A and militarine. Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that BsBGLU15 and BsBGLU28 were highly expressed in tubers compared to other tissues, suggesting their central role and a potential negative regulatory effect in metabolite accumulation. The elicitor NaAc can regulate metabolite synthesis by modulating the expression of BsBGLUs. The BsBGLU gene family in B. striata is integral to the modulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and accumulation and can respond to elicitors to promote the synthesis of militarine. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the further exploration of BsBGLU gene functions and their regulatory mechanisms, advancing the production of medicinally active compounds in B. striata.

AB  - To investigate curcumin (CUR) as the protector against the harmful effects of low-frequency electromagnetic field(LF- EMF, 50 Hz) during pregnancy period, 5 males and 15 females of Wistar rat mated and vaginal plaques were observed. Then, the pregnant rats were divided into six groups. During pregnancy(21 days), the EMF group was exposed to EMF for 30 min/day, the CUR group received a single dose of 50 mg/kg/daily CUR intraperitoneal, the EMF+CUR group was injected CUR and exposed to EMF daily. The DMSO(dimethyl sulfoxide) group was injected solvent of CUR (DMSO) intraperitoneal with the same volume of CUR solvent, the sham group was placed through the solenoid in the same conditions as the first group without exposure and the control group was kept in their cage in normal condition. After four weeks, babies born were divided according to the mother groups and sacrificed. Then, the three tissues injuries were investigated. EMF exposure led to an increase in outstanding necrotic areas in hippocampal tissue, an increase in the amount of hyperemia(p = 0.017) and necrotic(p = 0.005) in kidneys, and degeneration in liver tissue(p = 0.007) in the EMF group compared with EMF+CUR groups. A single dose of CUR daily during pregnancy can protect these tissues from injuries caused by LF-EMF exposure in rat fetuses.
   Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are able to penetrate and be absorbed by the body. The researchers showed that these radiations might be harmful and lead to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, and fetal abnormalities. Curcumin as an active component in turmeric has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-hyperlipidemia properties. It can protect the body against diseases such as arthritis, anxiety, and metabolic syndrome. This study examined the effects of curcumin as the protector against the harmful effects of EMF (50Hz) during pregnancy period. So the pregnant rats were divided into six groups. During pregnancy, a group was exposed to EMF for 30 min/day, the second group was injected a dose of curcumin 50mg/kg/daily, the third group was injected curcumin and exposed to EMF daily. The fourth group was injected a curcumin solvent dose, the sham group was placed through the field generator in the same conditions as the first group without exposure and the control group was kept in their cage in normal condition. After four weeks, babies born were divided according to the mother groups and sacrificed. Then, the liver, kidney, and hippocampal tissues were investigated. EMF exposure led to an outstanding increase in necrotic areas in hippocampal tissue, a notable increase in the amount of hyperemia and necrosis in kidneys, and degeneration in liver tissue(p=0.007) in the EMF group compared with the third group that was exposed to EMF and received curcumin. A single dose of curcumin daily during pregnancy can protect these tissues from injuries caused by EMF(50Hz) exposure in rat fetuses.

AB  - Activation of mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) by phosphorylation at Thr277/Ser281 stimulates downstream apoptotic pathways and ultimately leads to cell injury. MLK3 is reported to localize to both the cytoplasm and nucleus in human ovarian cancer cells and immortalized ovarian epithelial cells (T80 and T90 cells), and phosphorylation at Thr477 is required for the cytoplasmic retention of MLK3 in T80 cells. However, the subcellular distribution of MLK3 in other cell types has rarely been reported, and whether phosphorylation of MLK3 at Thr277/Ser281 affects its subcellular distribution is unknown. Here, our bioinformatics analysis predicted that MLK3 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the human HEK293T embryonic kidney cell line and murine HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line, endogenous MLK3 was more abundant in the cytoplasm and less abundant in the nucleus. In addition, overexpressed Myc-tagged MLK3 and EGFP-tagged MLK3 were also observed to localize mainly to the cytoplasm. MLK3 that was activated by phosphorylation at Thr277/Ser281 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, and phosphorylation deficient (T277A/S281A) and mimic (T277E/S281E) mutants both showed distributions similar to that of wild type (wt) MLK3, further proving that phosphorylation at Thr277/Ser281 was not involved in regulating MLK3 subcellular localization. In HEK293T cells, H2O2 stimulation accelerated MLK3 phosphorylation (activation), and this phosphorylation was reduced by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpressing wt MLK3 promoted the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and increased cell apoptosis, both of which were enhanced by the phosphorylation-mimic (T277E/S281E) MLK3 variant but not by the phosphorylation-deficient (T277A/S281A) MLK3 variant. These findings provided additional evidence for the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of MLK3 in HEK293T cells or HT22 cells and revealed the pivotal role of MLK3 in the positive feedback loop of oxidative stress injury.

AB  - Individuals diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a markedly elevated prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of these psychiatric conditions in IBD patients remain poorly understood, and no effective therapeutic strategy has been definitively established. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based interventions offer promising potential for restoring gut homeostasis, which may mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress associated with IBD. Herein, we first synthesized hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB)/polydopamine (HMPB/PDA) nanoparticles (NPs), followed by physical loading with olsalazine (Olsa) (Olsa@HMPB/PDA NPs) to reshape intestinal homeostasis and relieve accompanying anxiety/depression-like behavior in colitis mice. The Olsa@HMPB/PDA NPs displayed a macroporous structure with high biocompatibility and reactive oxygen species scavenging activity and released the drug gradually in the inflammatory environment. It could enhance intestinal retention after oral gavage administration following IBD in mice. Mechanistically, the composite demonstrated efficacy in significantly reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, regulated the polarization of macrophages, and attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction via its dual anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, ultimately leading to substantial mitigation of colitis symptoms in IBD mice. Furthermore, we found that dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced microglia activation and decreased neuronal activation in the CA1 hippocampus of mice, associated with anxiety/depression-like behavior. As the observed modulation of the dysfunction of neuroinflammation and neuronal activation of CA1 hippocampus, Olsa@HMPB/PDA NPs treatment alleviated anxiety/depression-like behavior in DSS mice. Overall, this nanozyme established a paradigm in combined IBD therapy with psychological comorbidities.

AB  - Background: The interleukin-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (encoded by the IL1RN gene) is a potent competitive antagonist to interleukin-1 (IL1) and thereby is mainly involved in the regulation of inflammation. Previous data indicated a role of IL1RA in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) as well as an IL1-dependent decrease in tissue barrier function, potentially contributing to cancer cell invasion. Objective: Based on these observations, here we investigated the potential roles of IL1RA, IL1A, and IL1B in bladder cancer cell invasion in vitro. Methods: Cell culture, real-time impedance sensing, invasion assays (Boyden chamber, pig bladder model), qPCR, Western blot, ELISA, gene overexpression. Results: We observed a loss of IL1RA expression in invasive, high-grade bladder cancer cell lines T24, UMUC-3, and HT1197 while IL1RA expression was readily detectable in the immortalized UROtsa cells, the non-invasive bladder cancer cell line RT4, and in benign patient urothelium. Thus, we modified the invasive human bladder cancer cell line T24 to ectopically express IL1RA, and measured changes in cell migration/invasion using the xCELLigence Real-Time-Cell-Analysis (RTCA) system and the Boyden chamber assay. The real-time observation data showed a significant decrease of cell migration and invasion in T24 cells overexpressing IL1RA (T24-IL1RA), compared to cells harboring an empty vector (T24-EV). Concurrently, tumor cytokines, e.g., IL1B, attenuated the vascular endothelial barrier, which resulted in a reduction of the Cell Index (CI), an impedance-based dimensionless unit. This reduction could be reverted by the simultaneous incubation with IL1RA. Moreover, we used an ex vivo porcine organ culture system to evaluate cell invasion capacity and showed that T24-IL1RA cells showed significantly less invasive capacity compared to parental T24 cells or T24-EV. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate an inverse correlation between IL1RA expression and tumor cell invasive capacity and migration, suggesting that IL1RA plays a role in bladder carcinogenesis, while the exact mechanisms by which IL1RA influences tumor cells migration/invasion remain to be clarified in future studies. Furthermore, we confirmed that real-time impedance sensing and the porcine ex vivo organ culture methods are powerful tools to discover differences in cancer cell migration and invasion.

AB  - Diabetes is usually accompanied by increased production of free radicals or impaired antioxidant defenses. The brain is a target tissue of the oxidative attacks caused by diabetes, and there are observed changes in the biochemical parameters of this tissue in the hyperglycemic state. In this study, we aimed to show the effect of N(1)-2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene-N(4)-2-hydroxybenzylidene-S-methyl-thiosemicarbazidato-oxovanadium (IV) (VOL) compound on diabetic damaged brain tissue, induced by streptozotocin (STZ) on 3.0-3.5-month-old male rats. Single dose of STZ at 65 mg/kg was used to make rats diabetic. Four groups were created randomly. Group (i): control (intact) animals; Group (ii): VOL given control animals; Group (iii): STZ-induced diabetic animals; and Group (iv): orally VOL administered STZ-induced diabetic rats. VOL (0.2 mM/kg/day) administration to control and diabetic animals was performed for a period of 12 days. At the end of day 12, the brain tissues were taken and homogenized. The clear supernatants were used for the determination of glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG), and protein levels. Alanine and aspartate transaminases and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and oxidative stress marker enzymes activities were also estimated from the homogenates. According to the obtained results, there is found significant elevation of MDA and NEG levels and activities of transaminases, MPO and XO; whereas the GSH content and the activities of AChE and antioxidant enzymes were strongly decreased in the STZ-induced diabetic brain tissues in comparison to control group animals. Twelve days of administration of VOL complex to the diabetic animals reversed all biochemical parameters significantly in diabetic brain tissues. Our findings suggest that the VOL complex may be an ideal candidate to be used as an anti diabetic agent to improve oxidative injury and protect the brain tissue against damage caused by diabetes. This healing effect of the VOL complex may be due to its antioxidant activity and the insulin-mimetic effects of vanadium.

AB  - Background: Ceftriaxone upregulates GLT1 glutamate transporter in the brain and may have anti-CFC and anti-OCD effects. Methods: Twenty WZ-5HT rats were used to investigate the effects of ceftriaxone on obsessive-compulsive (OCD)-like behaviour in the marble-burying (MB) test, freezing behaviour in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and expression of GLT1 protein in the hippocampus or amygdala using immunoblots. Fifteen DBA/2J mice were used in the MB test. We also compared diazepam with ceftriaxone in open-field, beam-walking, and wire-hanging tests on 47 DBA/2J mice. Ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg) and saline were applied intraperitoneally, once daily for 7 (rats) or 5 (mice) consecutive days. A single dose of diazepam (1.5-3.0 mg/kg) or saline was injected 30 min before the behavioural tests. Results: Ceftriaxone significantly diminished OCD-like behaviour (down arrow number of marbles buried) and freezing behaviour in CFC context session (up arrow latencies, down arrow total duration, down arrow duration over four 2 min periods of the session) but increased GLT1 protein expression in the amygdala and hippocampus of rats. Diazepam induced sedation, ataxia and myorelaxation in mice. Ceftriaxone did not have these side effects. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the anti-CFC and anti-OCD effects of ceftriaxone, which did not produce the unwanted effects typical of diazepam.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the number and maturity of the recovered oocytes after two intervals of in-vivo maturation. In addition to evaluating the effect of the developmental stage, as well as the number of cloned transferred blastocysts on the pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss (EPL) in dromedary camel. The donor animals (n 1/4 52) were super-stimulated using a single injection of 3000 IU of eCG followed by GnRH administration for oocyte maturation. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration (OPU) either 24-26 h or 18-20 h after GnRH administration. A fewer number of COCs with a lower percentage of oocyte maturity was observed at 24-26 h in comparison to 18-20 h. The effect of the cloned blastocysts' transferred number and developmental stage on the pregnancy rate and EPL was investigated. The total pregnancy rates at 10 days post-ET, 1 and 2 months were 21.9, 12.4, and 8.6%, respectively. Transfer of two or 3-4 embryos per surrogate was accompanied with a higher pregnancy rate at 1 and 2 months than a single embryo transfer. Rates of EPL were 43.5 and 60.1% at 1 and 2 months of pregnancy, respectively. The transfer of two embryos per surrogate was associated with a lower rate of EPL than ET of a single embryo at 1 and 2 months of pregnancy. Also, the ET of 3-4 embryos per surrogate showed a higher rate of EPL than the ET of two embryos at 2 months of pregnancy. ET of hatching (HG) blastocysts showed higher pregnancy rates and fewer EPL than ET of unhatched (UH) or fully hatched (HD) cloned blastocysts at 1 and 2 months of pregnancy. In conclusion, a high number of in-vivo matured oocytes can be recovered by ultrasound-guided transvaginal OPU from super-stimulated females using 3000 IU eCG and an interval of 18-20 h after GnRH administration. The transfer of two hatching cloned blastocytes per surrogate in-creases the pregnancy rate and decreases EPL in dromedary camels. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - VPS35 is a key subunit of the retromer complex responsible for recognising cytosolic retrieval signals in cargo and is involved in neurodegenerative disease and tumour progression. However, the function and molecular mechanism of VPS35 in gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that VPS35 was significantly upregulated in GC, which was associated with poor survival. VPS35 promoted GC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, VPS35 activated FAK-SRC kinases through integrin-mediated outside-in signalling, leading to the activation of YAP and subsequent IL-6 expression induction in tumour cells. What's more, combined mass spectrometry analysis of MGC-803 cell and bioinformatic analysis, we found that phosphorylation of VPS35 was enhanced in GC cells, and phosphorylated VPS35 has enhanced interaction with ITGB3. VPS35 interacted with ITGB3 and affected the recycling of ITGB3 in GC cells. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that VPS35 promoted tumour proliferation and metastasis via the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Interestingly, we also found that STAT3 directly bound to the VPS35 promoter and increased VPS35 transcription, thereby establishing a positive regulatory feedback loop. In addition, we demonstrated that VPS35 knockdown sensitised GC cells to 5-FU and cisplatin. These findings provide evidence that VPS35 promotes tumour proliferation and metastasis, and highlight the potential of targeting VPS35- and IL-6/STAT3-mediated tumour interactions as promising therapeutic strategies for GC.

AB  - Neurons project long axons that contact other distant neurons. Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex project into the limbic system to regulate responses to reward or threat. Diminished neural activity in prefrontal cortex is associated with loss of executive function leading to drug use, yet the specific circuitry that mediate these effects is unknown. Different regions within the medial prefrontal cortex may project to differing limbic system nuclei. Here, we exploited the cell biology of intracellular membrane trafficking, fast axonal transport, to map projections from two adjacent medial prefrontal cortical regions. We used Mn(II), a calcium analog, to trace medial prefrontal cortical projections in the living animal by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mn(II), a contrast agent for MRI, enters neurons through voltage-activated calcium channels and relies on kinesin-1 and amyloid-precursor protein to transport out axons to distal destinations. Aqueous MnCl2 together with fluorescent dextran (3--5 nL) was stereotactically injected precisely into two adjacent regions of the medial prefrontal cortex: anterior cingulate area (ACA) or infralimbic/prelimbic (IL/PL) region. Projections were traced, first live by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) at four time points in 3D, and then after fixation by microscopy. Data-driven unbiased voxel-wise statistical maps of aligned normalized MR images after either ACA or IL/PL injections revealed statistically significant progression of Mn(II) over time into deeper brain regions: dorsal striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus. Quantitative comparisons of these distal accumulations at 24 h revealed dramatic differences between ACA and IL/PL injection groups throughout the limbic system, and most particularly in subdomains of the hypothalamus. ACA projections targeted dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, posterior part of the periventricular region and mammillary body nuclei as well as periaqueductal gray, while IL/PL projections accumulated in anterior hypothalamic areas and lateral hypothalamic nuclei as well as amygdala. As hypothalamic subsegments relay CNS activity to the body, our results suggest new concepts about mind-body relationships and specific roles of distinct yet adjacent medial prefrontal cortical segments. Our MR imaging strategy, when applied to follow other cell biological processes in the living organism, will undoubtedly lead to an expanded perspective on how minute details of cellular processes influence whole body health and wellbeing.
   Tract tracing after MnCl2 stereotactic intracerebral injection is performed by time-lapse MRI in living mice, based on harnessing the intracellular axonal transport machinery, kinesin and microtubules. Volumes of statistically significant, Mn(II)-dependent, image enhancements report on distal accumulations brain wide that can be measured segment-wise for statistical comparisons of the relative strength of the projection contacts. Targets of neuronal projections from the medial prefrontal cortex differ between anterior cingulate (ACA, red) and infralimbic-prelimbic (IL/PL, blue) areas. While neurons in ACA project to central amygdala, posterior hypothalamic regions, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, and locus coeruleus; those in IL/PL project to basolateral amygdala, anterior hypothalamic subsegments, central superior raphe and pons.

AB  - Soman is an organophosphorus compound that induces neurotoxicity. In addition to its direct toxic effects resulting from acetylcholine accumulation, neurotoxicity may also be exacerbated by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In light of the current scarcity of appropriate in vitro assessment models, in the present study, we used cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells, a new tool for investigating the mechanisms of neurotoxicity, to investigate soman-induced ER stress. The results demonstrated that soman significantly suppressed acetylcholinesterase activity and activated the GRP78-ATF6-CHOP (i.e. glucose-regulated protein 78-activating transcription factor 6-C/EBP homologous protein) ER stress cascade, driving apoptosis in cerebral organoids. Pharmacological inhibition of ER stress by pre-treating cerebral organoids with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid prior to soman exposure attenuated apoptotic signaling and downregulated GRP78, ATF6 and CHOP expression. Parallel in vivo validation utilized a rat model with subcutaneous soman exposure, focusing on hippocampal and striatal ER stress markers. Consistent with the in vitro findings, soman-exposed rats exhibited marked ER stress activation in brain regions critical for neurotoxicity. This study establishes ER stress as a key contributor to soman-induced neurotoxicity and highlights cerebral organoids as a physiologically relevant model for organophosphorus compound research. We propose ER stress modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate neurotoxic outcomes.

AB  - This study is aimed at exploring the potential of isorhamnetin in protection against diabetes-exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and elucidating its action mechanism. After establishment of the model of high glucose (HG)-aggravated oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), HT22 cell viability was detected by CCK-8. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, casapase-3 activity, and oxidative stress-related markers in HT22 cells were detected by corresponding commercial kits. The apoptosis of HG-treated HT22 cells following OGD/R was observed with TUNEL staining. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was examined by ELISA. The expression of Akt/SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling-related proteins was assayed by Western blot. The results showed that HG noticeably worsened the OGD/R-induced apoptosis of HT22 cells. Isorhamnetin relieved the HG-aggravated OGD/R-induced apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress of HT22 cells. Isorhamnetin alleviated the HG-aggravated OGD/R injury in HT22 cells through Akt/SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, treatment with Akt inhibitor LY294002 reversed the protective effects of isorhamnetin against HG-aggravated OGD/R injury in HT22 cells. In a conclusion, Isorhamnetin alleviates HG-aggravated OGD/R in HT22 hippocampal neurons through Akt/SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a progressive X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with no cure. RTT patients show disease-associated symptoms within 18 months of age that include developmental regression, progressive loss of useful hand movements, and breathing difficulties, along with neurological impairments, seizures, tremor, and mental disability. Rett Syndrome is also associated with metabolic abnormalities, and the anti-diabetic drug metformin is suggested to be a potential drug of choice with low or no side-effects. Previously, we showed that in vitro exposure of metformin in a human brain cell line induces MECP2E1 transcripts, the dominant isoform of the MECP2 gene in the brain, mutations in which causes RTT. Here, we report the molecular impact of metformin in mice. Protein analysis of specific brain regions in the male and female mice by immunoblotting indicated that metformin induces MeCP2 in the hippocampus, in a sex-dependent manner. Additional experiments confirm that the regulatory role of metformin on the MeCP2 target "BDNF" is brain region-dependent and sex-specific. Measurement of the ribosomal protein S6 (in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms) confirms the sex-dependent role of metformin in the liver. Our results can help foster a better understanding of the molecular impact of metformin in different brain regions of male and female adult mice, while providing some insight towards its potential in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Rett Syndrome.

AB  - Klotho (KL) is a glycosyl hydrolase and aging-suppressor gene. Stress is a risk factor for depression and anxiety, which are highly comorbid with each other. The aim of this study is to determine whether KL is regulated by estrogen and plays an important role in sex differences in stress resilience. Our results showed that KL is regulated by estrogen in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro and is essential for the estrogen-mediated increase in the number of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1)-positive clusters on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. The role of KL in sex differences in stress response was examined in rats using 3-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). CUMS produced a deficit in spatial learning and memory, anhedonic-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors in male but not female rats, which was accompanied by a reduction in KL protein levels in the hippocampus of male but not female rats. This demonstrated the resilience of female rats to CUMS. Interestingly, the knockdown of KL protein levels in the rat hippocampus of both sexes caused a decrease in stress resilience in both sexes, especially in female rats. These results suggest that the regulation of KL by estrogen plays an important role in estrogen-mediated synapse formation and that KL plays a critical role in the sex differences in cognitive deficit, anhedonic-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors induced by chronic stress in rats, highlighting an important role of KL in sex differences in stress resilience.

AB  - Adenosine A(2A) receptors have been studied extensively in the context of motor function and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In addition to these roles, A(2A) receptors have also been increasingly implicated in cognitive function and cognitive impairments in diverse conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, acute brain injury, and stress. We review the roles of A(2A) receptors in cognitive processes in health and disease, focusing primarily on the effects of reducing or enhancing A(2A) expression levels or activities in animal models. Studies reveal that A(2A) receptors in neurons and astrocytes modulate multiple aspects of cognitive function, including memory and motivation. Converging evidence also indicates that A(2A) receptor levels and activities are aberrantly increased in aging, acute brain injury, and chronic disorders, and these increases contribute to neurocognitive impairments. Therapeutically targeting A(2A) receptors with selective modulators may alleviate cognitive deficits in diverse neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Further research on the exact neural mechanisms of these effects as well as the efficacy of selective A(2A) modulators on cognitive alterations in humans are important areas for future investigation.

AB  - Intracellular Ca2+ signals are key for the regulation of cellular processes ranging from myocyte contraction, hormonal secretion, neural transmission, cellular metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation. Measurement of cellular Ca2+ is routinely performed using fluorescence microscopy with biological indicators. Analysis of deterministic signals is reasonably straightforward as relevant data can be discriminated based on the timing of cellular responses. However, analysis of stochastic, slower oscillatory events, as well as rapid subcellular Ca2+ responses, takes considerable time and effort which often includes visual analysis by trained investigators, especially when studying signals arising from cells embedded in complex tissues. The purpose of the current study was to determine if full-frame time-series and line-scan image analysis workflow of Fluo-4 generated Ca2+ fluorescence data from vascular myocytes could be automated without introducing errors. This evaluation was addressed by re-analyzing a published "gold standard" full-frame time-series dataset through visual analysis of Ca2+ signals from recordings made in pulmonary arterial myocytes of en face arterial preparations. We applied a combination of data driven and statistical approaches with comparisons to our published data to assess the fidelity of the various approaches. Regions of interest with Ca2+ oscillations were detected automatically post hoc using the LCPro plug-in for ImageJ. Oscillatory signals were separated based on event durations between 4 and 40 s. These data were filtered based on cutoffs obtained from multiple methods and compared to the published manually curated "gold standard" dataset. Subcellular focal and rapid Ca2+ "spark" events from line-scan recordings were examined using SparkLab 5.8, which is a custom automated detection and analysis program. After filtering, the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives were calculated through comparisons to visually derived "gold standard" datasets. Positive predictive value, sensitivity, and false discovery rates were calculated. There were very few significant differences between the automated and manually curated results with respect to quality of the oscillatory and Ca2+ spark events, and there were no systematic biases in the data curation or filtering techniques. The lack of statistical difference in event quality between manual data curation and statistically derived critical cutoff techniques leads us to believe that automated analysis techniques can be reliably used to analyze spatial and temporal aspects to Ca2+ imaging data, which will improve experiment workflow.

AB  - Mitophagy plays a key role in epileptic neuronal injury, and recent studies have shown that FUNDC1 plays an important role in regulating mitophagy. However, the specific effect of FUNDC1 on neuronal damage in epilepsy is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of FUNDC1 in mitophagy and neuronal apoptosis using a hippocampal neuronal culture model of acquired epilepsy (AE) in vitro. We found that mitophagy levels were significantly increased in this model, as indicated by elevated LC3A/B ratios. FUNDC1 overexpression using lentiviral vectors enhanced mitophagy, whereas FUNDC1 down-regulation using lentiviral vectors impaired this process. Overexpression of FUNDC1 significantly decreased AE-induced superoxide anion, enhanced cell viability, reduced oxidative stress, and reduced neuronal apoptosis in epileptic hippocampus, while FUNDC1 down-regulation caused the opposite effect. In conclusion, we demonstrated that FUNDC1 is an important modulator of AE-induced neuronal apoptosis by controlling mitophagy function.

AB  - Aging is a process associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and the reduction in neurogenesis, and is the greatest known risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effects of Fe3O4 nanozymes on neurogenesis have rarely been studied. This study examined the effects of Fe3O4 nanozymes on neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG) and BBB integrity of D-galactose-induced aged mice. Long-term treatment with Fe3O4 nanozymes (10 mu g/mL diluted in ddH(2)O daily) markedly increased the doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactivity and decreased BBB injury induced by D-galactose treatment. In addition, the decreases in the levels of antioxidant proteins including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase as well as autophagy-related proteins such as Becin-1, LC3II/I, and Atg7 induced by D-galactose treatment were significantly ameliorated by Fe3O4 nanozymes in the DG of the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, Fe3O4 nanozyme treatment showed an inhibitory effect against apoptosis in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Fe3O4 nanozymes can relieve neuroblast damage and promote neuroblast differentiation in the hippocampal DG by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy.

AB  - Background: The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45) gene has been implicated in various central nervous system (CNS) functions, both normal and pathological, including aging, memory, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined whether Gadd45A deletion triggers pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Utilizing transcriptome data from AD-associated hippocampus samples, we identified Gadd45A as a pivotal regulator of autophagy. Comprehensive analyses, including Gene Ontology enrichment and proteinprotein interaction network assessments, highlighted Cdkn1A as a significant downstream target of Gadd45A. Experimental validation confirmed Gadd45A's role in modulating Cdkn1A expression and autophagy levels in hippocampal cells. We also examined the effects of autophagy on hippocampal functions and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Additionally, a murine model was employed to validate the importance of Gadd45A in neuroinflammation and AD pathology. Results: Our study identified 20 autophagy regulatory factors associated with AD, with Gadd45A emerging as a critical regulator. Experimental findings demonstrated that Gadd45A influences hippocampal cell fate by reducing Cdkn1A expression and suppressing autophagic activity. Comparisons between wild-type (WT) and Gadd45A knockout (Gadd45A- /- ) mice revealed that Gadd45A- /- mice exhibited significant cognitive impairments, including deficits in working and spatial memory, increased Tau hyperphosphorylation, and elevated levels of kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Additionally, Gadd45A- /- mice showed significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreases autophagy markers in the brain. Neurotrophin levels and dendritic spine length were also reduced in Gadd45A- /- mice, likely contributing to the observed cognitive deficits. Conclusions: These findings support the direct involvement of the Gadd45A gene in AD pathogenesis, and enhancing the expression of Gadd45A may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Legionella pneumophila utilizes the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system to deliver hundreds of effector proteins inside eukaryotic cells to ensure intracellular replication. Our understanding of the molecular functions of the largest pathogenic arsenal known to the bacterial world remains incomplete. By leveraging advancements in 3D protein structure prediction, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis of 368 L. pneumophila effectors, representing a global atlas of predicted functional domains summarized in a database (https://pathogens3d.org/legionella-pneumophila). Our analysis identified 157 types of diverse functional domains in 287 effectors, including 159 effectors with no prior functional annotations. Furthermore, we identified 35 cryptic domains in 30 effector models that have no similarity with experimentally structurally characterized proteins, thus, hinting at novel functionalities. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the activity of thirteen functional domains, including three cryptic domains, predicted in L. pneumophila effectors to cause growth defects in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system. This illustrates an emerging strategy of exploring synergies between predictions and targeted experimental approaches in elucidating novel effector activities involved in infection.
   Legionella pneumophila encodes the largest arsenal of eukaryotic host-manipulating proteins, called effectors. Leveraging high-throughput structural prediction tools, coupled with in cellulo assays, revealed previously unrecognized functional and cryptic domains in L. pneumophila effectors.Analysis revealed over 150 structurally diverse domains in 287 effectors, reflective of the diverse mechanisms required to modulate 's eukaryotic hosts ranging from protozoa to human alveolar macrophages.Over half of the predicted functional domains are present in only one effector, while cysteine proteases and kinases are the most prominent domain categories.An even larger presence of so-called tandem repeat structural motifs in effector proteins is suggested to facilitate protein-protein interactions.Over 30 identified domains, some of which are present in other pathogens, showed no structural similarity with characterized proteins, suggestive of novel biochemical activities.

AB  - Aloe emodin is a natural anthraquinone derived from aloe or rhubarb, showing anti-renal fibrosis, anti-atherosclerosis and anti-cancer effects. Aloe emodin also shows neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke rats. Naturally, anthraquinone derivatives generally have the effect of inhibiting the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) pathway. There is an increase in the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TGF-beta 1 levels in both Huntington's disease (HD) patients' brains and HD transgenic mice. Thus, we hypothesized that aloe emodin may inhibit the phosphorylation of CaMKII (p-CaMKII) and TGF-beta 1/sma- and mad-related protein (Smad) signaling in the brain, further preventing motor and cognitive dysfunction. Aloe emodin was orally administered to 10- to 20-week-old HD R6/1 transgenic mice. Aloe emodin improved the motor coordination of R6/1 transgenic mice in the rotarod test and attenuated visual recognition impairment in the novel object recognition test. Aloe emodin downregulated levels of the mutant huntingtin protein, p-CaMKII and TGF-beta 1, but not the TGF-beta 2 or TGF-beta 3 levels, in the brains of R6/1 mice. Aloe emodin could also inhibit neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of R6/1 mice. Altogether, these results indicated that aloe emodin prevents several HD-like symptoms through the inhibition of CaMKII/Smad and TGF-beta 1/Smad signaling in mice.

AB  - This study evaluated the antidepressant effects of arecoline, a bioactive alkaloid derived from areca nuts, using a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress. Arecoline treatment significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors, including anxiety, anhedonia, and despair, as evidenced by behavioral tests. Mechanistically, arecoline restored serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain and serum, reduced pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1 beta and LPS in both serum and colon, and enhanced hippocampal neuroplasticity through increased BDNF and PSD-95 expression. Moreover, arecoline modulated gut microbiota composition, particularly enriching beneficial species like Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Ligilactobacillus murinus, and regulated serum metabolites associated with tryptophan metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and oxidative stress. These findings demonstrate that arecoline exerts its antidepressant effects via a multitargeted approach involving the gut-brain axis, neurotransmitter modulation, and neuroplasticity enhancement. This study highlights arecoline as a promising therapeutic candidate for depression, emphasizing its potential to address both central and peripheral mechanisms.

AB  - Nature uses efficient strategies to produce complex structures for hydration-induced reversible deformation. One such example is camel hair, a keratinous fiber with remarkable water-triggered shape memory. Herein, we unravel the effect of non-uniform structures on the shape memory of camel hair. By extraction and quantitative analysis of the deformation of camel hair, we describe that the shape memory of camel hair is a bending mode instead of shrinking along the long fiber axis. The shape memory process is based on anisotropic swelling, caused by the non-uniform distribution of disulfide bonds and the non-uniform thickness of the cortex layer along the cross-section. This natural actuation structure inspires the design of complex shape-memory materials with simple simulation strategies and has better biocompatibility to meet the requirements of biological applications.

AB  - Camellia oleifera leaves were byproduct of the C. oleifera industry which was rich in polysaccharides. Deep eutectic solvent-dual enzyme system (DES-dEAE) was established to achieve the simultaneous hydrolysis reaction of dual enzymes and DES extraction. Currently, there was a lack of research methods that simultaneously deal with the relationship between DES and enzymes and the effect of DES on the polysaccharide extraction rate. In the study, artificial neural network (ANN) and conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) were used to screen the most suitable DES by predicting the pH and activity coefficient of DESs. Choline chloride and sorbitol constituted the best DES and were used to optimize the process conditions of DES-dEAE by response surface method (RSM). The polysaccharide yield was verified to be 21.46 mg/g with the optimal process conditions: liquid-solid ratio of 33:1, enzyme ratio of 3:1, extraction time of 15 min and water content of 40 %. The C. oleifera polysaccharides obtained by water, DES, and DES-dEAE extractions were observed by scanning electron microscopy and cell wall damage effect of DES-dEAE was confirmed microscopically. The study optimized the complex polysaccharide extraction system using bioinformatics methods, contributing new ideas to the development of simulated extraction.

AB  - This study identifies promising potential of a novel and safer nanocombination of bovine milk lactoperoxidase (LPO) and lactoferrin (LF) to target breast cancer in vitro and in adult female albino rat model. Favorable selective anticancer effects of the prepared nanocombination were observed, in a dose-dependent manner, against both MCF-7 and MDA cell lines, sparing normal HFB-4 cells. The administration of LPO + LFNPs markedly improved the induced-breast cancer disorders, prolonged survival and reduced the values of serum TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, CD4(+), ALAT, ASAT, urea, creatinine, cholesterol and triglycerides with remarkable elevation in mammary SOD and GPx activity and GSH level. Moreover, the histopathological findings showed that LPO + LFNPs succeeded in prevention of mammary gland tumorigenesis. Superior efficacy of LPO + LFNPs was observed against pro-inflammatory cytokines through their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The treatment of LPO + LFNPs more significantly modulated the apoptosis and enhanced the expression of cell cycle regulator genes, which demonstrates a successful tumor therapy in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study provided evidence that the chemo-preventive feature of LPO + LFNPs may offer a novel alternative therapy for the treatment of breast cancer through enhances apoptosis pathway, improvement of immune response, reduction of inflammation and restoration of the impaired oxidative stress.

AB  - The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases related to cognitive decline and memory loss is on the rise as the global elderly population increases. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the sea cucumber-derived peptide Phe-Tyr-Asp-Trp-ProLys (FYDWPK) on scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity in an animal model. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance apparatus, and shuttle box test were used to assess learning and memory abilities. In behavioral tests, FYDWPK effectively alleviated learning and memory impairment. FYDWPK also alleviated cholinergic dysfunction in mice with dementia. Furthermore, FYDWPK significantly improved oxidative imbalance by increasing superoxide dismutase activity and decreasing malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05). The pathological results showed that FYDWPK alleviated neuronal loss, blurred caryotheca, and pyknotic nuclei in the hippocampus, and a high dose of FYDWPK had the best effect. In conclusion, FYDWPK alleviated cognitive and memory impairments by regulating oxidative imbalance, reducing cholinergic dysfunction, and relieving pathological alterations.

TI  - Red yeast rice dietary intervention reduces oxidative stress-related inflammation and improves intestinal microbiota
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
KW  - PRODUCTS
AB  - Inflammation and oxidative stress play key roles in the aging process, while red yeast rice (RYR), a traditional Chinese fermented food, has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. To understand the anti-aging function of RYR in vivo, this study established a d-galactose-induced aging mouse model to verify the positive effects of RYR dietary intervention on aging and explore the related underlying mechanism. Eight weeks of RYR dietary intervention was shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on cognitive decline and hippocampal damage. The molecular mechanistic studies showed that the anti-aging effects of RYR were achieved by (i) improving the oxidative stress-related damage (increasing SOD, CAT, and GSH, and reducing MDA), (ii) regulating the NF-kappa B inflammation pathway induced by oxidative stress (decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, iNOs, and IL-1 beta, increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and decreasing the expression of the NF-kappa B protein), (iii) slowing down apoptosis caused by oxidative stress (reducing the expression of P21 and P53), (iv) restoring the abundance of Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae downregulated by d-galactose, and (v) reducing the abundance of Akkermansia and Helicobacter enriched by d-galactose. Mass spectrometry revealed orange pigments (rubropunctatin and monascorubrin) as the main antioxidant components in RYR, which might play key roles in aging inhibition. This study provides theoretical support for the wide application of orange pigments as an antioxidant dietary supplement.

AB  - Owing to excellent decorative properties and protective effects, two-component polyurethane has had extensive application in various paints. In this work, the advantages of moisture-cured polyurethane resins over twocomponent polyurethane are discussed from the two characteristics of coating: decorative properties and protective properties. The results showed that moisture-cured resins were superior to two-component polyurethane paints in chemical resistance and mechanical properties like flexibility and scratch resistance. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra showed that moisture-cured resins were carbamide formed by the reaction between free NCO and water, which is different from that of two-component polyurethane. As to the contact angle, it was found that the contact angle of moisture-cured resins was smaller than that of two-component polyurethane. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a denser coating was formed on the surface of moisture-cured resins. The results of the salt spray test (28 d) revealed that moisturecured resins from different monomers were superior to their respective two-component paints, and among different monomers, the toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was superior to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), but hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) underperformed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results uncovered that the crystallinity of moisture-cured resins was lower than that of two-component polyurethane paints, signifying that moisture-cured resins have better flexibility and tensile strength. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that moisture-cured resins had better thermal stability. In the electrochemical corrosion test, moisturecured resins also performed obviously better than two-component polyurethane.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy and mechanism of Polygala tenuifolia glycoprotein (ZPG) in alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD) for clinical application. ZPG's effects were tested in scopolamine hydrobromide-induced AD mice using behavioral, histological, and biomarker investigations. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing and lipidomics revealed ZPG's impact on gut microbiota and lipid metabolism, supported by pathway enrichment and correlation analyses. JNK pathway modulation was studied in vitro with purified and characterized ZPG-2. Results showed ZPG significantly improved cognitive deficits, reduced hippocampal pathology, and normalized APP, p-JNK, bax, and bcl-2 levels in AD mice. It also modulated gut microbiota and lipid metabolism, particularly glycerophospholipid pathways. ZPG-2 exhibited neuroprotective effects in A beta 25-35-induced PC12 cells by reducing apoptosis, inhibiting LDH release, and regulating oxidative stress and JNK activity. Structural analysis identified ZPG-2 as a 26 kDa glycoprotein with an O-linked glycopeptide bond and random coil conformation. Correlation analysis showed significant gut microbiota-AD biomarker relationships. These findings suggest ZPG may alleviate AD by reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, modulating gut microbiota, enhancing lipid metabolism, and suppressing the JNK signaling pathway. ZPG may be medicinal, however, more research is needed to validate its efficacy and mechanisms. This study lays the foundation for ZPG as an AD therapy for the future.

AB  - Lycopene (LYC) exerts a strong neuroprotective and antipyroptotic effects. This study explored the effects and mechanisms of LYC on chronic stress-induced hippocampal microglial damage and depression-like behaviors. The caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 attenuated chronic restrain stress (CRS)-induced hippocampal microglial pyroptosis and depression-like behaviors. Moreover, the alleviation of CRS-induced hippocampal microglial pyroptosis and depression-like behaviors by LYC was associated with the cathepsin B/NLRP3 pathway. In vitro, the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK alleviated pyroptosis in highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) cells. Additionally, the alleviation of corticosterone-induced HAPI cell damage and pyroptosis by LYC was associated with the cathepsin B/NLRP3 pathway. Furthermore, the cathepsin B agonist pazopanib promoted HAPI cell pyroptosis, whereas LYC inhibited pazopanib-induced pyroptosis via the cathepsin B/NLRP3 pathway. Similarly, Z-YVAD-FMK inhibited pazopanib-induced HAPI cell pyroptosis. These results suggest that LYC alleviates chronic stress-induced hippocampal microglial pyroptosis via the cathepsin B/NLRP3 pathway inhibition. This study provides a new strategy for treating chronic stress encephalopathy.

AB  - A healthy aging process is a requirement for good life quality. A relationship between physical activity, the consumption of antioxidants and brain health has been stablished via the activation of pathways that reduce the harmful effects of oxidative stress, by inducing enzymes such as SIRT1, which is a protector of brain function. We analyzed the cognitive and neurochemical effects of applying physical exercise in elderly rats, alone or in combination with the antioxidant catechin. Several tests of spatial and episodic memory and motor coordination were evaluated. In addition, brain monoaminergic neurotransmitters and SIRT1 protein levels were assessed in the brains of the same rats. The results show that physical activity by itself improved age-related memory and learning deficits, correlating with the restoration of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitters and SIRT1 protein levels in the hippocampus. The administration of the antioxidant catechin along with the exercise program enhanced further the monoaminergic pathways, but not the other parameters studied. These results agree with previous reports revealing a neuroprotective effect of physical activity, probably based on its ability to improve the redox status of the brain, demonstrating that exercise at an advanced age, combined with the consumption of antioxidants, could produce favorable effects in terms of brain health.

AB  - Human hippocampal volume has been separately associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA methylation and gene expression, but their causal relationships remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed at identifying the causal relationships of SNPs, DNA methylation, and gene expression that are associated with hippocampal volume by integrating cross-omics analyses with genome editing, overexpression and causality inference. Based on structural neuroimaging data and blood-derived genome, transcriptome and methylome data, we prioritized a possibly causal association across multiple molecular phenotypes: rs1053218 mutation leads to cg26741686 hypermethylation, thus leads to overactivation of the associated ANKRD37 gene expression in blood, a gene involving hypoxia, which may result in the reduction of human hippocampal volume. The possibly causal relationships from rs1053218 to cg26741686 methylation to ANKRD37 expression obtained from peripheral blood were replicated in human hippocampal tissue. To confirm causality, we performed CRISPR-based genome and epigenome-editing of rs1053218 homologous alleles and cg26741686 methylation in mouse neural stem cell differentiation models, and overexpressed ANKRD37 in mouse hippocampus. These in-vitro and in-vivo experiments confirmed that rs1053218 mutation caused cg26741686 hypermethylation and ANKRD37 overexpression, and cg26741686 hypermethylation favored ANKRD37 overexpression, and ANKRD37 overexpression reduced hippocampal volume. The pairwise relationships of rs1053218 with hippocampal volume, rs1053218 with cg26741686 methylation, cg26741686 methylation with ANKRD37 expression, and ANKRD37 expression with hippocampal volume could be replicated in an independent healthy young (n = 443) dataset and observed in elderly people (n = 194), and were more significant in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (n = 76). This study revealed a novel causal molecular association mechanism of ANKRD37 with human hippocampal volume, which may facilitate the design of prevention and treatment strategies for hippocampal impairment.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for stroke and exacerbates white-matter damage in focal cerebral ischemia. Our previous study showed that the sigma-1 receptor agonist PRE084 ameliorates bilateral common-carotid-artery occlusion-induced brain damage in mice. However, whether this protective effect can extend to white matter remains unclear. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were treated with high-fat diets (HFDs) combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection to mimic type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Focal cerebral ischemia in T2DM mice was established via injection of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) into the hippocampus. Three different treatment plans were used in this study. In one plan, 1 mg/kg of PRE084 (intraperitoneally) was administered for 7 d before ET-1 injection; the mice were sacrificed 24 h after ET-1 injection. In another plan, PRE084 treatment was initiated 24 h after ET-1 injection and lasted for 7 d. In the third plan, PRE084 treatment was initiated 24 h after ET-1 injection and lasted for 21 d. The Y-maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests were used to assess neurobehavioral outcomes. We found no cognitive dysfunction or white-matter damage 24 h after ET-1 injection. However, 7 and 21 d after ET-1 injection, the mice showed significant cognitive impairment and white-matter damage. Only PRE084 treatment for 21 d could improve this white-matter injury; increase axon and myelin density; decrease demyelination; and increase the expressions of myelin regulator 2'-3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNpase) and myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) (which was expressed by mature oligodendrocytes), the number of nerve/glial-antigen 2 (NG2)-positive cells, and the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR alpha), all of which were expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in mice with diabetes and focal cerebral ischemia. These results indicate that maybe there was more severe white-matter damage in the focal cerebral ischemia of the diabetic mice than in the mice with normal blood glucose levels. Long-term sigma-1 receptor activation may promote oligodendrogenesis and white-matter functional recovery in patients with stroke and with diabetes.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-necked animals like giraffes face the challenge of adequately supplying blood to the brain. The heart of such tall animals must work harder to pump blood over a 2 m head-to-heart distance against the force of gravity compared to a short-necked animal. Does a mechanism exist to assist tall animals in overcoming this challenge? We found that there is a possibility of a mechanism that can enhance blood flow to the brain and a subsequent increase in oxygen supply, which will reduce the heart's workload to pump blood over a 2 m distance in a Giraffe. In short-necked animals, the workload on the heart is less to supply blood to the brain adequately; therefore, no additional mechanism is necessary. We, however, suggest that a similar mechanism might have been functional in dinosaurs with extremely long necks to help with adequate blood supply to the brain by comparing relevant giraffe physiology and anatomy with existing data on paleontology. Adult giraffes reach heights of 4.5 m with a heart-to-head distance of over 2 m, making cranial blood supply challenging. Ultrasound confirmed that the giraffe jugular vein collapses during head movement from ground level to fully erect, negating the possibility of a siphon mechanism in the neck. We showed that a short-length siphon structure over a simulated head-to-heart distance for a giraffe significantly influences flow in a collapsible tube. The siphon structure is determined according to brain case measurements. The short-length siphon structure in a shorter-necked ostrich showed no significant increase in flow. The shorter head-to-heart distance might be the reason for the lack of effect in ostriches. A siphon mechanism situated in the cranium is certainly possible, with a significant effect exerted on the amount of pressure the heart must generate to allow adequate cranial blood perfusion in a long-necked giraffe. The study validated that a cranial-bound siphon structure can operate and will be of significant value for adequate cranial blood perfusion in long-necked species such as giraffes and might also have existed in extinct species of long-necked dinosaurs.

AB  - High-salt (HS) diet is an established risk factor for cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that HS diet reduces SHANK1, a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein, via downregulation of the PKA/CREB pathway, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in rats. RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Simple Summary Nematode infections can pose a health risk to mammals housed in zoos and faunistic parks, where they live in environmental conditions far away from those of conspecifics in nature. To manage nematode infections, it is often necessary to adopt group prophylactic strategies by anthelmintic drugs. With the present study, it was possible to observe the effects of two prophylactic treatments with ivermectin adopted in a faunistic park in northern Italy and highlight the differences according to the different taxonomic groups of hosts and parasites.
   Nematode infections of mammals can spread in zoos and faunistic parks and lead to disease in humans and animals. Group treatment strategies with anthelminthic drugs are common. Still, their effectiveness should be verified by sensitive and specific copromicroscopic analyses. This study assessed longitudinal parasitological monitoring, by FLOTAC (R) dual technique, in mammals housed in an Italian faunistic park, in order to verify the effectiveness of the two adopted ivermectin prophylactic treatments. Twenty-one species of herbivorous mammals from ten families were treated twice per year with ivermectin in an in-feed formulation (medicated feed containing 1.7 g/ton ivermectin daily, for 30 days in March and November), while 13 species of carnivores and primates from five families were treated once a month with oral or subcutaneous administrations of ivermectin (200 mu g/kg body weight (b.w.), from March to November). Fecal samples were collected in June-July and October 2019 (late spring-early summer and autumn sampling groups, respectively). All nematode infections, sustained by Nematodirus spp., Capillaria spp., Trichuris spp., Parascaris spp. and Strongylida, were detected in samples collected from herbivores, presenting prevalence rates of infection of 17.3% (9/52), 15.4% (8/52), 15.4% (8/52), 5.8% (3/52), and 3.8% (2/52), respectively. All carnivores and primates tested negative. The general linear mixed model showed that nematode eggs' excretion in herbivores were influenced by sampling and sampling-host family interaction. Results showed that frequency and dose of prophylactic treatments in herbivores should be improved according to host and parasite taxonomic groups. The treatment adopted in carnivores and primates, together with hygienic management, was effective in nematode control.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been suggested to increase the risk of memory decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of dementia in the elderly. However, direct evidence about whether COVID-19 induces AD-like neuropathological changes in the brain, especially post recovery from acute infection, is still lacking. Here, using postmortem human brain samples, we found abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex within 4-13 months post clinically recovery from acute COVID-19, together with prolonged activation of glia cells and increases in inflammatory factors, even though no SARS-COV-2 invasion was detected in these regions. By contrast, COVID-19 did not change beta-amyloid deposition and hippocampal neuron number, and had limited effects on AD-related pathological phenotypes in olfactory circuits including olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex and lateral entorhinal cortex. These results provide neuropathological evidences linking COVID-19 with prognostic increase of risk for AD.

AB  - When standard methods of human-elephant conflict mitigation are not successful, free-ranging wild elephants may continue to come into close contact with people. This results in more frequent and severe conflict, with consequences ranging from crop raiding to loss of human and elephant lives. Understandably, in such situations, local communities may want to be rid of entire herds of elephants. Historically, one of the strategies the Myanmar Government practiced to resolve human-elephant conflict was the capture of whole herds using the Kheddah system. This involved trapping the herd in a stockade, immediately followed by on-site post-capture taming. After taming, the captured elephants were utilized as logging elephants. Elephants worked in timber extraction, retired at age 55 years and were then cared for by the Government until they died. The capture of wild elephants by the Kheddah system was formally banned in Myanmar in 1985 but occasional, small-scale, captures were allowed until 2013 under the strict control of the Myanmar Government. These operations were aimed primarily at capturing elephants involved in human-elephant conflict, rather than to supplement the working elephant population. One of the last Kheddah operations, organized and managed by the author, was conducted in 1996 at the Taikkyi township of the Yangon Region, as a last resort to end human-elephant conflict in an emergency. While chemical immobilization was being used at this time, it was not logistically possible with the high numbers of elephants engaged in the conflict. This review aims to record the history of an activity that was an important element of Myanmar's timber industry more than three decades ago. In this paper, the author presents a description of Kheddah not to endorse it, but to document (1) the Myanmar elephant population management strategy in the past, before it is forgotten, and (2) the practicality of the Kheddha operation when the singly selected commonly- used immobilization or noosing method of elephant capture is unfeasible. The author attempts to shed light on the modern veterinary procedures that may significantly reduce the notorious historical outcome of Kheddha, especially the resulting mortality of captured elephants, should the Kheddha system of capture ever be used as an emergency solution for ongoing problems of human-elephant conflict in the range states of Asia.

AB  - Hypoglycemia is a common adverse reaction to glucose-lowering treatment. Diabetes mellitus (DM) combined with recurrent nonsevere hypoglycemia (RH) can accelerate cognitive decline. Currently, the metabolic pattern changes in cognition-related brain regions caused by this combined effect of DM and RH (DR) remain unclear. In this study, we first characterized the metabolic profiles of the hippocampus in mice exposed to DR using nontargeted metabolomic platforms. Our results showed that DR induced a unique metabolic pattern in the hippocampus, and several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to the histidine metabolism pathway were discovered. Based on these findings, in the follow-up experiment, we found that histidine treatment could attenuate the cognitive impairment and rescue the neuronal and synaptic damage induced by DR in the hippocampus, which are closely related to ameliorated mitochondrial injury. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic mechanisms of the hippocampus in the progression of DR, and L-histidine supplementation may be a potential metabolic therapy in the future.

AB  - Cinnamic acid is a plant metabolite with antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. Its synthetic derivatives are often more effective in vitro than parent compounds due to stronger biological activities. In our study, we synthesized ten new N-(4-chloro-2-mercapto-5-methylphenylsulfonyl)cinnamamide derivatives, containing two pharmacophore groups: cinnamic acid moiety and benzenesulfonamide. The antimicrobial activity of the obtained compounds was estimated using different types of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungus species of Candida albicans, as well as clinical strains. The compounds were evaluated on biofilm formation and biofilm formed by Staphylococcus clinical strains (methicillin-resistance S. aureus MRSA and methicillin-resistance coagulase-negative Staphylococcus MRCNS). Furthermore, blood bacteriostatic activity test was performed using S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In cytotoxic study, we performed in vitro hemolysis assay on domestic sheep peripheral blood and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay on human cervical HeLa, ovarian SKOV-3, and breast MCF-7 cancer cell lines. We also estimated antioxidant activity of ten compounds with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays. Our results showed a significant antimicrobial activity of the compounds. All of them were active on Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species (MIC was 1-4 mu g/mL). The compounds 16d and 16e were the most active on staphylococci clinical strains and efficiently inhibited the biofilm formation and biofilm already formed by the clinical staphylococci. Moreover, the hemolytic properties of the tested compounds occurred in higher quantities (>32.5 mu g/mL) than the concentrations that inhibited both the growth of bacteria in the blood and the formation and growth of biofilm. The results of MTT assay showed that compounds 16c, 16d, 17a, and 17d demonstrated the best activity on the cancer cells (the IC50 values were below 10 mu g/mL). Compound 16f was the least active on the cancer cells (IC50 was > 60 mu g/mL). Antiradical tests revealed that compounds 16f and 17d had the strongest antioxidant properties within the tested group (IC50 was 310.50 +/- 0.73 and 574.41 +/- 1.34 mu g/mL in DPPH, respectively, and 597.53 +/- 1.3 and 419.18 +/- 2.72 mu g/mL in ABTS assay, respectively). Our study showed that the obtained cinnamamide derivatives can be used as potential antimicrobial therapeutic agents.

AB  - Using natural enemies provides a sustainable method to control major agricultural pests. Hoverflies are significant natural enemies of aphids and efficient pollinators. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), including (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF) and methyl salicylate (MeSA), are key olfactory cues mediating hoverflies behavior. Our previous work identified compound 3e, an EBF analog containing a MeSA moiety, exhibited aphid-repelling and ladybug-attracting activities. However, whether 3e can attract hoverflies remains unknown. Therefore, this study explored the attractant property and potential mechanism of 3e toward hoverflies. Laboratory bioassays and field trials indicated 3e has an obvious hoverfly attracting property. The attraction mechanism studies demonstrate that, similar to EBF, 3e can interact with EcorOBP15 and EcorOR3, with its greater chemical softness, larger hydrophobic and charge regions enhancing these interactions. Furthermore, 3e exhibited low toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera) and hoverflies (Eupeodes corollae). Consequently, 3e could be a promising eco-friendly behavioral regulator for integrated aphid management in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Plants perceive and orchestrate defense responses when herbivorous insects are ovipositing. Fruits, as a crucial reproductive organ in plants, have rarely been researched on the responses to insect eggs. Here, we found that oviposition by the specialist insect Bactrocera minax in navel oranges activated the lignin synthesis pathway and cell division, causing mechanical pressure that crushed the eggs. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed an enrichment of oviposition-induced genes and metabolites within the lignin synthesis pathway, which was confirmed by histochemical staining. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation was observed at the oviposition sites. Plant defense-related hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) exhibited rapid induction after oviposition, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) activation occurred in the later stages of oviposition. Additionally, secondary metabolites induced by prior egg deposition were found to influence larval performance. Our studies provide molecular evidence that host fruits have evolved defense mechanisms against insect eggs and pave the way for future development of insect-resistant citrus varieties.

AB  - Identifying the components of Camellia oleifera honey and pollen and conducting corresponding toxicological tests are essential to revealing the mechanism of Camellia oleifera toxicity to honey bees. In this research, we investigated the saccharides and alkaloids in honey, nectar, and pollen from Camellia oleifera, which were compared with honey, nectar, and pollen from Brassica napus, a widely planted flowering plant. The result showed that melibiose, manninotriose, raffinose, stachyose, and lower amounts of santonin and caffeine were found in Camellia oleifera nectar, pollen, and honey but not in B. napus nectar, pollen, and honey. Toxicological experiments indicated that manninotriose, raffinose, and stachyose in Camellia oleifera honey are toxic to bees, while alkaloids in Camellia oleifera pollen are not toxic to honey bees. The toxicity mechanism of oligosaccharides revealed by temporal metabolic profiling is that oligosaccharides cannot be further digested by honey bees and thus get accumulated in honey bees, disturbing the synthesis and metabolism of trehalose, ultimately causing honey bee mortality.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds are important for herbivorous insects in locating their host plants. The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee), is a devastating migratory insect pest of rice in Asian countries. Although C. medinalis can develop even better on corn than on rice plants in insectaries, it rarely occurs on corn plants in the field. We hypothesized that plant volatile-mediated oviposition preference for rice over corn in adult females may be the reason for the observed rare field occurrence of the pest on corn plants. The present study was conducted to identify the olfactory active volatile compounds (OAVCs) that enable C. medinalis females to discriminate rice from corn plants. In cage tests, rice plants were highly preferred for oviposition over corn plants by C. medinalis females. From headspace, chemical analyses identified 15 rice unique, 8 corn unique, and 28 common volatile compounds. Fourteen OAVCs, including seven common, five rice unique, and two corn unique, were determined. In electroantennogram tests, the rice unique and common OAVCs activated the antennal responses in C. medinalis. In Y-tube olfactometer tests, (E)-2-hexenal and 3-hexanol(common OAVCs) and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (rice unique OAVCs) attracted more C. medinalis females than the control, and only blends with both rice unique and common OAVCs were highly preferred over the control. Our results provide insights into the chemical cues used by C. medinalis adult females in host location, which may aid the development of novel crop protection strategies based on the manipulation of host-finding behaviors of C. medinalis.

AB  - Adaptation to phytochemicals in herbivorous insects can influence tolerance to insecticides. However, it is unclear how insects use phytochemicals as cues to activate their metabolic detoxification systems. In this study, we found that dietary exposure to xanthotoxin enhanced tolerance of Spodoptera litura larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin. Xanthotoxin ingestion significantly elevated the mRNA levels of 35 detoxification genes as well as the transcription factors Cap 'n' collar isoform-C (CncC) and its binding factor small muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis isoform-K (MafK). Additionally, xanthotoxin exposure increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment blocked xanthotoxin-induced expression of CncC, MafK, and detoxification genes and also prevented xanthotoxin-enhanced larval tolerance to lambda-cyhalothrin. The 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signaling pathway was effectively activated by xanthotoxin, while blocking of 20E signaling transduction prevented xanthotoxin-enhanced larval tolerance to lambda-cyhalothrin. Application of 20E induced the expression of multiple xanthotoxin-induced detoxification genes and enhanced lambda-cyhalothrin tolerance in S. litura. NAC treatment blocked xanthotoxin-induced 20E synthesis, while the CncC agonist curcumin activated the 20E signaling pathway. These results indicate that the ROS/CncC pathway controls the induction of metabolic detoxification upon exposure to xanthotoxin, at least in part, through its regulation of the 20E signaling pathway.

AB  - Olfaction plays an instrumental role in host plant selection by phytophagous insects. Helicoverpa assulta and Helicoverpa armigera are two closely related moth species with different host plant ranges. In this study, we first comparatively analyzed the function of 11 female-biased odorant receptors (ORs) and their orthologs in the two species by the Drosophila T1 neuron expression system and then examined the electroantennography responses of the two species to the most effective OR ligands. Behavioral assays using a Y-tube olfactometer indicate that guaiene, the primary ligand of HassOR21-2 and HarmOR21-2, only attracts the females, while benzyl acetone, the main ligand of HassOR35 and HarmOR35, attracts both sexes of the two species. Oviposition preference experiments further confirm that guaiene and benzyl acetone are potent oviposition attractants for the mated females of both species. These findings deepen our understanding of the olfactory coding mechanisms of host plant selection in herbivorous insects and provide valuable attractants for managing pest populations.

AB  - Allelochemicals, chemical cues that, among other things, mediate insect-plant interactions, such as host plant recognition, have attracted notable interest as tools for ecological control of pest insects. Advances have recently been made in methods for sampling and analyzing volatile compounds and technology for tracking insects in their natural habitat. However, progress in odor-mediated behavioral bioassays of insects has been relatively slow. This perspective highlights this odor-mediated insect behavior, particularly in a natural setting and considering the whole behavioral sequence involved in the host location, which is the key to understanding the mechanisms underlying host plant recognition. There is thus a need to focus on elaborate behavioral bioassays in future studies, particularly if the goal is to use allelochemicals in pest control. Future directions for research are discussed.

AB  - The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most serious pestcausing yieldlosses in rice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulatorsof plant-pest interactions. In the study, we found that osa-miR162ais induced in response to BPH attack in the seedling stage and tunesrice resistance to the BPH via the & alpha;-linolenic acid metabolismpathway as indicated by gas chromatography/liquid chromatography-massspectrometry analysis. Overexpression of osa-miR162a inhibited thedevelopment and growth of the BPH and simultaneously reduced the releaseof 3-hexenal and 3-hexen-1-ol to block host recognition in the BPH.Moreover, knockdown of OsDCL1, which is targetedby osa-miR162a, inhibited & alpha;-linolenic acid metabolism to enhancethe resistance to the BPH, which was similar to that in miR162a-overexpressingplants. Our study revealed a novel defense mechanism mediated by plantmiRNAs developed during the long-term evolution of plant-hostinteraction, provided new ideas for the identification of rice resistanceresources, and promoted a better understanding of pest control.

AB  - We develop a route to prepare two types of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs, CNC1 and CNC2) from a unique biomass resource, the fruit shell of Camellia oleifera Abel (SCOA), by integrating sulfuric acid hydrolysis and high-pressure homogenization and examine the effects of hydrolysis time on characteristics of the CNCs during the process. The CNCs exhibit different evolutions in size, morphology, surface charge, and crystallinity with increasing hydrolysis time. While both the CNCs have high crystallinity, CNC1 is of rod-like character with a relatively low aspect ratio, and CNC2 exhibits a hairy appearance with a high aspect ratio. We highlight that controlled acid hydrolysis contributes to the formation of weak spots with an increased susceptibility for homogenizing cellulosic solid residues into hairy CNCs. This is a good step toward tailoring CNC properties in a conventional and scalable approach to maximize their potential applications.

AB  - Frankliniella occidentalis has caused serious damage to horticultural plants and vegetables. However, the role of its salivary proteins remains unclear. Transcriptome sequencing identified 510 differentially expressed genes in F. occidentalis fed on jasmonic acid (JA)-treated versus water-treated kidney bean plants, primarily involved in carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolite pathways. The genes Fomyr6, Fo alpha glu1, Fosp3, and Fotryp1 were highly expressed in the salivary glands and during voracious feeding stages. Silencing these genes resulted in significant reductions in survival, fecundity, and feeding capacity. Feeding by F. occidentalis enhanced defensive enzyme activities of plants, especially when Fomyr6 and Fo alpha glu1 were silenced, and promoted the production of secondary substances such as lignin, tannins, and flavonoids. Additionally, both JA and salicylic acid levels were activated. Furthermore, nearly all these responses were more pronounced in JA-treated kidney bean plants. These findings lay the groundwork for further research into the functions and molecular mechanisms of salivary proteins in F. occidentalis.

AB  - Geosmin, a ubiquitous volatile sesquiterpenoid of microbiological origin, is causative for deteriorating the quality of many foods, beverages, and drinking water, by eliciting an undesirable "earthy/musty" off-flavor. Moreover, and across species from worm to human, geosmin is a volatile, chemosensory trigger of both avoidance and attraction behaviors, suggesting its role as semiochemical. Volatiles typically are detected by chemosensory receptors of the nose, which have evolved to best detect ecologically relevant food-related odorants and semiochemicals. An insect receptor for geosmin was recently identified in flies. A human geosmin-selective receptor, however, has been elusive. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a human odorant receptor for geosmin, with its function being conserved in orthologs across six mammalian species. Notably, the receptor from the desert-dwelling kangaroo rat showed a more than 100-fold higher sensitivity compared to its human ortholog and detected geosmin at low nmol/L concentrations in extracts from geosmin-producing actinomycetes.

AB  - The Hippo pathway controls organ size and homeostasis and is linked to numerous diseases, including cancer. The transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors acts as a receptor for downstream effectors, namely yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which binds to various transcription factors and is essential for stimulated gene transcription. YAP/TAZ-TEAD facilitates the upregulation of multiple genes involved in evolutionary cell proliferation and survival. TEAD1-4 overexpression has been observed in different cancers in various tissues, making TEAD an attractive target for drug development. The central drug-accessible pocket of TEAD is crucial because it undergoes a post-translational modification called auto-palmitoylation. Crystal structures of the C-terminal TEAD complex with small molecules are available in the Protein Data Bank, aiding structure-based drug design. In this study, we utilized the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, shape-based screening, and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations for virtual screening, and we identified a novel non-covalent inhibitor-BC-001-with IC50 = 3.7 mu M in a reporter assay. Subsequently, we optimized several analogs of BC-001 and found that the optimized compound BC-011 exhibited an IC50 of 72.43 nM. These findings can be used to design effective TEAD modulators with anticancer therapeutic implications.

AB  - Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) caused by bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1) can lead to enormous economic losses in the cattle industry. Vaccine immunization is preferentially used to decrease its transmission speed and resultant clinical signs, rather than to completely stop viral infection. Therefore, a drug effective in treating IBR is urgently needed. Our previous work demonstrated that ivermectin significantly inhibited viral replication in a cell infection model. This study aimed to investigate its antiviral effects in vivo by using a rabbit infection model. The viral inhibition assay was first used to confirm that ivermectin at low concentrations (6-25 nM) could reduce viral titers (TCID50) significantly (p < 0.001) at 24 h post-infection. In rabbits, ivermectin was administrated with one to three doses, based on the recommended anti-parasite treatment dosage (0.2 mg/kg bodyweight) through subcutaneous injection at different days post-infection in the treated IBRV infection groups, while non-treated infection group was used as the control. The infected rabbits showed hyperthermia and other clinical signs, but the number of high-fever rabbits in the ivermectin treatment groups was significantly lower than that in the non-treated infection group. Furthermore, in ivermectin treatment groups, the cumulative clinical scores correlated negatively with drug doses and positively with delay of administration time post-infection. The overall nasal shedding time in ivermectin-treated groups was two days shorter than the non-treated challenge group. At the same time point, the titer of neutralizing antibodies in the treatment group with triple doses was higher than the other two-dose groups, but the difference between the treatment groups decreased with the delay of drug administration. Correspondingly, the serious extent of lung lesions was negatively related to the dosage, but positively related to the delay of drug administration. The qPCR with tissue homogenates showed that the virus was present in both the lung tissues and trigeminals of the infected rabbits. In conclusion, ivermectin treatment had therapeutic effect by decreasing clinical signs and viral shedding, but could not stop virus proliferation in lung tissues and trigeminals.

AB  - Alcohol misuse during adolescence (AAM) has been associated with disruptive development of adolescent brains. In this longitudinal machine learning (ML) study, we could predict AAM significantly from brain structure (T1-weighted imaging and DTI) with accuracies of 73 -78% in the IMAGEN dataset (n & SIM;1182). Our results not only show that structural differences in brain can predict AAM, but also suggests that such differences might precede AAM behavior in the data. We predicted 10 phenotypes of AAM at age 22 using brain MRI features at ages 14, 19, and 22. Binge drinking was found to be the most predictable phenotype. The most informative brain features were located in the ventricular CSF, and in white matter tracts of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and brain stem. In the cortex, they were spread across the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes and in the cingulate cortex. We also experimented with four different ML models and several confound control techniques. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with rbf kernel and Gradient Boosting consistently performed better than the linear models, linear SVM and Logistic Regression. Our study also demonstrates how the choice of the predicted phenotype, ML model, and confound correction technique are all crucial decisions in an explorative ML study analyzing psychiatric disorders with small effect sizes such as AAM.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOX) is a representative compound found in most insect saliva that can suppress plant-defensive responses. However, little is known about the origin and role of GOX in the crucifer-specialized pest Plutella xylostella. In this study, we showed obvious regurgitation from the larval gut of P. xylostella and identified abundant peptides highly similar to known GOX. Three PxGOX genes were verified with PxGOX2 preferentially expressed in the gut. The heterologously expressed PxGOX2 confirmed its function to be a GOX, and it was detected in plant wounds together with the gut regurgitant. Further experiments revealed that PxGOX2 functioned as an effector and may suppress defensive responses in plant through the production of H2O2, which modulates levels of antagonistic salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. However, excessive H2O2 in the host plant may be neutralized by peroxidase, thus forming defensive feedback. Our findings provided new insights into understanding the GOX-mediated insect-plant interactions.

AB  - Plants perceive proteins from insect-derived oral secretion (OS) and regulate the classical endogenous hormone jasmonic acid to resist insects, but the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in this process is poorly understood. In this study, we used the specialist herbivorous caterpillar Plutella xylostella and cruciferous plants as a model to investigate how the ABA hormone responds to the OS and its core peptide from the insect. Through proteomics and Western blotting analysis, glucosinolate sulfatase 1 (GSS1) was identified in OS. Yeast library screening revealed that GSS1 and its 28-amino-acid core peptide (GSS1-P1) interact with ABA biosynthetic enzyme ABA1. Arabidopsis overexpressing GSS1 and plants treated with synthetic GSS1-P1 showed elevated ABA levels. Transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed that GSS1-P1 upregulates WRKY18 and ABA1 expression, modulating ABA production. Both GSS1-P1 application and optimal ABA concentrations enhanced plant resistance to herbivory. Our study shows that GSS1 and its peptide stimulate ABA production, boosting plant-insect resistance and highlighting ABA's potential role in pest-stress response.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with steatotic liver disease may show mild cognitive impairment. Rats with mild liver damage reproduce this cognitive impairment, which is mediated by neuroinflammation that alters glutamate neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Treatment with extracellular vesicles (EV) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive impairment in different animal models of neurological diseases. TGF beta in these EVs seems to be involved in its beneficial effects. The aim of this work was to assess if MSCs-EVs may improve cognitive impairment in rats with mild liver damage and to analyze the underlying mechanisms, assessing the effects on hippocampal neuroinflammation and neurotransmission. We also aimed to analyze the role of TGF beta in the in vivo effects of MSCs-EVs.MethodsMale Wistar rats with CCl4-induced mild liver damage were treated with EVs from unmodified MSC or with EVs derived from TGF beta-silenced MSCs and its effects on cognitive function and on neuroinflammation and altered neurotransmission in the hippocampus were analysed.ResultsUnmodified MSC-EVs reversed microglia activation and TNF alpha content, restoring membrane expression of NR2 subunit of NMDA receptor and improved object location memory. In contrast, EVs derived from TGF beta-silenced MSCs did not induce these effects but reversed astrocyte activation, IL-1 beta content and altered GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit membrane expression leading to improvement of learning and working memory in the radial maze.ConclusionsEVs from MSCs with TGF beta silenced induce different effects on behavior, neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter receptors alterations than unmodified MSC-EVs, indicating that the modification of TGF beta in the MSC-EVs has a notable effect on the consequences of the treatment. This work shows that treatment with MSC-EVs improves learning and memory in a model of mild liver damage and MHE in rats, suggesting that MSC-EVs may be a good therapeutic option to reverse cognitive impairment in patients with steatotic liver disease.

AB  - An Mg-based alloy device manufactured via a superplastic forming process (Mg-AZ31+SPF) and coated using a hydrothermal method (Mg AZ31+SPF+HT) was investigated as a method to increase mechanical and osteointegration capability. The cell viability and osteointegrative properties of alloy-derived Mg AZ31+SPF and Mg AZ31+SPF+HT extracts were investigated regarding their effect on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (maintained in basal (BM) and osteogenic medium (OM)) after 7 and 14 days of treatment. The viability was analyzed through metabolic activity and double-strand DNA quantification, while the osteoinductive effects were evaluated through qRT-PCR, osteoimage, and BioPlex investigations. Finally, a preliminary liquid mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on the secretome of hMSCs. Biocompatibility analysis revealed no toxic effect on cells' viability or proliferation during the experimental period. A modulation effect was observed on the osteoblast pre-commitment genes of hMSCs treated with Mg-AZ31+SPF+HT in OM, which was supported by mineralization nodule analysis. A preliminary mass spectrometry investigation highlighted the modulation of protein clusters involved in extracellular exosomes, Hippo, and the lipid metabolism process. In conclusion, our results revealed that the Mg AZ31+SPF+HT extracts can modulate the canonical and non-canonical osteogenic process in vitro, suggesting their possible application in bone tissue engineering.

AB  - BackgroundThe established association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compromised neural regeneration is well-documented. In addition to the mitigation of apoptosis in neural stem cells (NSCs), the induction of neurogenesis has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Our previous research has demonstrated the effective inhibition of NSC injury induced by microglial activation through the repression of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Nonetheless, the precise role of SIRT3 in neurogenesis remains incompletely understood.MethodsIn vivo, SIRT3 overexpression adenovirus was firstly injected by brain stereotaxic localization to affect the hippocampal SIRT3 expression in APP/PS1 mice, and then behavioral experiments were performed to investigate the cognitive improvement of SIRT3 in APP/PS1 mice, as well as neurogenic changes in hippocampal region by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. In vitro, under the transwell co-culture condition of microglia and neural stem cells, the mechanism of SIRT3 improving neurogenesis of neural stem cells through DVL/GSK3/ISL1 axis was investigated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and other experimental methods.ResultsOur findings indicate that the overexpression of SIRT3 in APP/PS1 mice led to enhanced cognitive function and increased neurogenesis. Additionally, SIRT3 was observed to promote the differentiation of NSCs into neurons during retinoic acid (RA)-induced NSC differentiation in vitro, suggesting a potential role in neurogenesis. Furthermore, we observed the activation of the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway during this process, with Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3a (GSK3a) primarily governing NSC proliferation and GSK3 ss predominantly regulating NSC differentiation. Moreover, the outcomes of our study demonstrate that SIRT3 exerts a protective effect against microglia-induced apoptosis in neural stem cells through its interaction with DVLs.ConclusionsOur results show that SIRT3 overexpressing APP/PS1 mice have improved cognition and neurogenesis, as well as improved neurogenesis of NSC in microglia and NSC transwell co-culture conditions through the DVL/GSK3/ISL1 axis.

AB  - Plants activate direct and indirect defense mechanisms in response to perceived herbivore invasion, which results in negative consequences for herbivores. Tetranychus cinnabarinus is a polyphagous generalist herbivore that inflicts substantial agricultural and horticultural damage. Our study revealed that mite feeding significantly increased jasmonic acid (JA) in the eggplant. The damage inflicted by the mites decreased considerably following the artificial application of JA, thereby indicating that JA initiated the defense response of the eggplant against mites. The transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated the activation of the JA-coumarin pathway in response to mite feeding. This pathway protects the eggplant by suppressing the reproductive capacity and population size of the mites. The JA and coumarin treatments suppressed the vitellogenin gene (TcVg6) expression level. Additionally, RNA interference with TcVg6 significantly reduced the egg production and hatching rate of mites. In conclusion, the JA-coumarin pathway in the eggplant decreases the egg-hatching rate of mites through suppression of TcVg6.

AB  - In this work, we have used Camellia sinensis leaves extract in the synthesis of SnO2 NPs. The biologically syn-thesised SnO2 NPs were combined with reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) to produce SnO2/r-GO under ultrasonic conditions. The extract-based synthetic method was found to be environmentally safe, less time-consuming, and efficient. According to phyto-chemical screening, the biologically active components such as terpenoids, phyto-sterols, carbohydrates, amino acids, alkaloids, tannins, and flavonoids, respectively, were present in Camellia sinensis leaves extract. Various analytical techniques have been used to investigate the SnO2/r-GO. FTIR analysis indicated the presence of O-H, C--C, Sn-O, Sn-C, etc. bonds on the surface of green and ultrasonically based SnO2/r-GO. The crystalline nature of SnOv/r-GO has been confirmed by XRD pattern. Further, the freshly synthesised SnO2/r-GO has been utilised as a supercapacitor material. The specific capacitances of the cost-effective SnO2/r-GO were found to be 310.7 F g-1 at an initial scan rate (10 mV s(-1)) and 267.8 F g(-1) at an initial current density (1 A g-1), respectively. The specific energy and specific power were evaluated as 13.3 Wh kg(-1) and 160.6 W kg(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and 4.6 Wh kg(-1) and 1606.2 W kg(-1) at 10 A g(-1), respectively.

AB  - Iron deposits in the brain are a natural consequence of aging. Iron accumulation, especially in the form of labile iron, can trigger a cascade of adverse effects, eventually leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Aging also increases the dysfunction of cellular proteostasis. The question of whether iron alters proteostasis is now being pondered. Herein, we investigated the effect of ferric citrate, considered as labile iron, on various aspects of proteostasis of neuronal cell lines, and also established an animal model having a labile iron diet in order to evaluate proteostasis alteration in the brain along with behavioral effects. According to an in vitro study, labile iron was found to activate lysosome formation but inhibits lysosomal clearance function. Furthermore, the presence of labile iron can alter autophagic flux and can also induce the accumulation of protein aggregates. RNA-sequencing analysis further reveals the upregulation of various terms related to proteostasis along with neurodegenerative disease-related terms. According to an in vivo study, a labile iron-rich diet does not induce iron overload conditions and was not detrimental to the behavior of male Wistar rats. However, an iron-rich diet can promote iron accumulation in a region-dependent manner. By staining for autophagic markers and misfolding proteins in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, an iron-rich diet was actually found to alter autophagy and induce an accumulation of misfolding proteins. These findings emphasize the importance of labile iron on brain cell proteostasis, which could be implicated in developing of neurological diseases.

AB  - After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to replenish with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this site-clearance mechanism. However, the physiological significance of this mechanism at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this in a physiologically optimized condition using action potential evoked EPSCs at fast calyx synapse and relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapse, in post-hearing mice brain slices at 37 degrees C and in 1.3 mM [Ca2+]. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the fast calyx synapse, block of endocytosis or scaffold protein activity significantly enhanced synaptic depression as early as 10 ms after the stimulation onset. Unlike previous reports, neither endocytic blockers nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that the release-site clearance by endocytosis can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment at both fast and slow synapses, whereas the presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.

AB  - In the present study, we validated the neuroprotective effects of sulfiredoxin 1 (Srxn1) against oxidative damage in HT22 cells and ischemic damage in gerbil hippocampus. To efficiently deliver Srxn1 protein into cells or the hippocampus, a PEP-1-Srxn1 fusion protein was synthesized, and efficient delivery was visualized in HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. PEP-1-Srxn1 was delivered to HT22 cells in a concentration- and incubation timedependent manner and showed significantly higher levels at 36 h after incubation for 1 h. Morphologically, the delivered protein was localized in the cytoplasm of HT22 cells. In addition, PEP-1-Srxn1 treatment significantly ameliorated formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA fragmentation, and cell death in HT22 cells induced by treatment with 100 mu M H2O2. In gerbils, PEP-1-Srxn1 treatment significantly alleviated transient ischemiainduced forebrain hyperactivity 1 d after ischemia and memory deficits 4 d after ischemia. Neuroprotective effects were confirmed by morphological analysis of the hippocampal CA1 region 4 or 10 d after ischemia. Treatment with PEP-1-Srxn1 significantly ameliorated the formation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus during the early stages (3-12 h) of ischemia. In addition, treatment with PEP-1Srxn1 alleviated the ischemia-induced reduction of glutathione levels in the hippocampus. PEP-1-Srxn1 also decreased ischemia-induced microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the hippocampus. These results suggest that PEP-1-Srxn1 is a potential therapeutic agent for reducing neuronal damage induced by oxidative or ischemic damage.

AB  - In this study, the effects of different doses of sulfite on learning, memory, and long term potentiation as well as the relationship of these effects with acetylcholine pathways, Arc and synapsin 1 levels were investigated. Sixty male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups as control, S100, and S260. Sodiummetabisulfite (S100;100 mg/kg/day, S260;260 mg/kg/day) was given by oral administration. Behavioral changes were evaluated. After long term potentiation recordings from the perforant pathway-dentate gyrus synapses, animals were sacrificed. Acetylcholinesterase activity, choline acetyltransferase activity, acetylcholine level as well as Arc and Synapsin 1 expressions were analyzed on the hippocampi. The total distance and average velocity values in the open field and Morris water maze tests increased in the sulfite groups, while the discrimination index in the novel object recognition test decreased compared to controls. Acetylcholine levels and choline acetyltransferase activity were also increased in the sulfite groups, while acetylcholinesterase activity was decreased compared to controls. Sulfite intake attenuated long term potentiation in the hippocampus. It has been observed that the excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and population spike amplitude of the field potentials obtained in sulfite groups decreased. This impairment was accompanied by a decrease in Arc and synapsin 1 expressions. In conclusion, it has been shown that sulfite intake in adults impairs learning and memory, possibly mediated by the cholinergic pathway. It is considered that the decrement in Arc and synapsin expressions may play a role in the mechanism underlying the impairment in long term potentiation caused by toxicity.

Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of modified (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG)-enriched green tea extract (HTP-GTE) in ameliorating the cognitive dysfunctions in late middle-aged murine model. We developed a novel HTP-GTE that was enriched with GCG via epimerization that involved heating. We compared the effects of oral administrations of conventional green tea and HTP-GTE in young and aged male C57/BL6 mice, and examined the changes in the hippocampal functions related to aging process. The functional outcome was assessed by the electrophysiological experiments to measure the long-term potentiation (LTP). HTP-GTE improved the age-related cognitive impairments via restoring long-term synaptic plasticity. We also identified that GCG was the main active component responsible for the HTP-GTE effect. The main molecular pathway in ameliorating the age-related cognitive dysfunctions involved protein kinase A (PKA) which was shown to be modulated by HTP-GTE. Thus, HTP-GTE has a therapeutic potential as a dietary supplement which may aid to rescue the impaired cognitive functions at the early phase of aging process through the modulation of LTP threshold.

AB  - Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a class of devastating neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures and exacerbated by disruptions to excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, are commonly caused by mutations in ion channels. Disruption of, or variants in, FGF13 were implicated as causal for a set of DEEs, but the underlying mechanisms were clouded because FGF13 is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, FGF13 undergoes extensive alternative splicing producing multiple isoforms with distinct functions, and the overall roles of FGF13 in neurons are incompletely cataloged. To overcome these challenges, we generated a set of novel cell-type-specific conditional knockout mice. Interneuron-targeted deletion of Fgf13 led to perinatal mortality associated with extensive seizures and impaired the hippocampal inhibitory/excitatory balance while excitatory neuron-targeted deletion of Fgf13 caused no detectable seizures and no survival deficits. While best studied as a voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) regulator, we observed no effect of Fgf13 ablation in interneurons on Navs but rather a marked reduction in K+ channel currents. Re-expressing different Fgf13 splice isoforms could partially rescue deficits in interneuron excitability and restore K+ channel current amplitude. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of Fgf13-related seizures and expand our understanding of FGF13 functions in different neuron subsets.

AB  - Simple Summary HASPIN plays important roles in chromosome segregation during cell division by phosphorylating histone H3 at threonine. We showed that HASPIN was expressed in the hippocampus and phosphorylated the tau protein, acting as a phosphorylation substrate. Oral administration of soybean sprouts grown for increased coumestrol (a HASPIN inhibitor) decreased the phosphorylated tau protein level in the hippocampus and suppressed short-term memory loss in the Alzheimer's disease model mice (5xFAD). Functional analysis of HASPIN may help treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The MATP/tau protein is hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's patients. Therefore, research into the regulation of tau protein phosphorylation is important for understanding Alzheimer's disease. HASPIN is a serine/threonine kinase that is expressed in various cells. To examine whether HASPIN is involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease through tau protein phosphorylation, we investigated the effects of a diet including soybean sprouts rich in the HASPIN inhibitor coumestrol in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD). The results showed that HASPIN was expressed in the hippocampus and phosphorylated tau protein, while the ingestion of soybean sprouts containing coumestrol suppressed the development of spatial cognitive dysfunction in 5xFAD. These results indicate that HASPIN may be one of the target molecules for the repression of tau phosphorylation in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Bone is the most favored site for metastasis for each major subtype of breast cancer. Therapeutic modalities for alleviation of clinical symptoms associated with bone metastasis include surgical resection, radiation, and bone-targeted therapies, including bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid; ZA) and a humanized antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (denosumab). However, the bone-targeted therapies are expensive, and have poor pharmacokinetic attributes and/or serious adverse effects. Therefore, novel strategies are needed for treatment of bone metastasis or to increase effectiveness of existing bone-targeted therapies. We have shown previously that benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is a novel inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo. The present study shows that BITC + ZA combination synergistically inhibits osteoclast differentiation induced by addition of conditioned media from breast cancer cells. These effects were associated with a significant increase in levels of several antiosteoclastogenic cytokines, including interferons, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, and IL-27. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of RNA-seq data from BITC and/or ZA-treated cells revealed downregulation of genes of many pathways (e.g., actin cytoskeleton, Hippo signaling, etc.) by treatment with BITC + ZA combination, but not by BITC alone or ZA alone. Confocal microscopy confirmed severe disruption of actin cytoskeleton upon treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with the BITC + ZA combination. This combination also decreased the nuclear level of yes-associated protein, a core component of Hippo signaling. In conclusion, the present study offers a novel combination for prevention or treatment of bone metastasis of breast cancer.

AB  - The concept of episodic memory (EM) faces significant challenges by two claims: EM might not be a distinct memory system, and EM might be an epiphenomenon of a more general capacity for mental time travel (MTT). Nevertheless, the observations leading to these arguments do not preclude the existence of a mechanically and functionally distinct EM system. First, modular systems, like cognition, can have distinct subsystems that may not be distinguishable in the system's final output. EM could be such a subsystem, even though its effects may be difficult to distinguish from those of other subsystems. Second, EM could have a distinct and consistent low-level function, which is used in diverse high-level functions such as MTT. This article introduces the scenario construction framework, proposing that EM crucially rests on memory traces containing the gist of an episodic experience. During retrieval, EM traces trigger the reconstruction of semantic representations, which were active during the remembered episode, and are further enriched with semantic information, to generate a scenario of the past experience. This conceptualization of EM is consistent with studies on the neural basis of EM and resolves the two challenges while retaining the key properties associated with EM. This article is part of the theme issue 'Elements of episodic memory: lessons from 40 years of research'.

AB  - Activity-dependent self-organization plays an important role in the formation of specific and stereotyped connectivity patterns in neural circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, and tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of spike trains recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of modules. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.

AB  - Physical exercise plays a role on the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exercise mode and the mechanism for these positive effects is still ambiguous. Here, we investigated the effect of an aerobic interval exercise, running in combination with swimming, on behavioral dysfunction and associated adult neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that 4 weeks of the exercise could ameliorate A beta(42) oligomer-induced cognitive impairment in mice utilizing Morris water maze tests. Additionally, the exercised A beta(42) oligomer-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction of anxiety-and depression-like behaviors compared to the sedentary A beta(42) oligomer-induced mice utilizing an Elevated zero maze and a Tail suspension test. Moreover, by utilizing 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as an exogenous cell tracer, we found that the exercised A beta(42) oligomer-induced mice displayed a significant increase in newborn cells (BrdU(+) cells), which differentiated into a majority of neurons (BrdU(+) DCX+ cells or BrdU(+)NeuN(+) cells) and a few of astrocytes (BrdU(+)GFAP(+) cells). Likewise, the exercised A beta(42) oligomer-induced mice also displayed the higher levels of NeuN, PSD95, synaptophysin, Bcl-2 and lower level of GFAP protein. Furthermore, alteration of serum metabolites in transgenic AD mice between the exercised and sedentary group were significantly associated with lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters. These findings suggest that combined aerobic interval exercise-mediated metabolites and proteins contributed to improving adult neurogenesis and behavioral performance after AD pathology, which might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Background: Growing experimental evidence indicates that cognitive impairment is linked to neuroinflammation. Minocycline (MINO), an antibiotic known for its anti-inflammatory, has shown promise in alleviating cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism through which MINO improves cognitive impairment is not yet understood. Methods: A neuroinflammatory model was establish by utilizing lipopolysaccharide. The assessment of mice's cognitive and learning abilities was conducted through the MWM and Y-maze tests. The evaluation of hippocampal neuronal injury and microglial activation were achieved by performing HE staining and IHC, respectively. To evaluate BV2 cell viability and apoptosis, the CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342/PI staining assays were employed. In order to assess the protein and RNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1I3, IL-18, Iba-1, and Bcl2/Bax, WB and RT-qPCR were utilized. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of MINO on apoptosis by targeting the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway was investigated using Nigericin. Results: MINO was effective in reducing the time it took for mice to escape from the test, increasing the number of platforms they crossed, and mitigating damage to the hippocampus while also suppressing microglial activation and the expression of Iba-1 in a neuroinflammatory model caused by LPS. Furthermore, MINO improved the viability of BV2 cell and reduced apoptosis. It also had the effect of reducing the expression levels of NLRP3/caspase-1, IL-1I3, IL-18, and BAX, while upregulating the expression of Bcl2. Additionally, MINO was found to downregulate the NLRP3 expression, which is specifically activated by nigericin. Conclusion: The protective effect of MINO relies on the crucial involvement of the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway.

AB  - The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has a role in neuronal migration and process elongation in the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of chronic glutamate hyperactivity on vesicular and protein transport within CNS neurons, that is, processes necessary for neurite growth, have not been examined previously. In this study, we measured the effects of lifelong hyperactivity of glutamate neurotransmission on axoplasmic transport in CNS neurons. We compared wild-type (wt) to transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing the glutamate dehydrogenase gene Glud1 in CNS neurons and exhibiting increases in glutamate transmitter formation, release, and synaptic activation in brain throughout the lifespan. We found that Glud1 Tg as compared with wt mice exhibited increases in the rate of anterograde axoplasmic transport in neurons of the hippocampus measured in brain slices ex vivo, and in olfactory neurons measured in vivo. We also showed that the in vitro pharmacologic activation of glutamate synapses in wt mice led to moderate increases in axoplasmic transport, while exposure to selective inhibitors of ion channel forming glutamate receptors very significantly suppressed anterograde transport, suggesting a link between synaptic glutamate receptor activation and axoplasmic transport. Finally, axoplasmic transport in olfactory neurons of Tg mice in vivo was partially inhibited following 14-day intake of ethanol, a known suppressor of axoplasmic transport and of glutamate neurotransmission. The same was true for transport in hippocampal neurons in slices from Glud1 Tg mice exposed to ethanol for 2 h ex vivo. In conclusion, endogenous activity at glutamate synapses regulates and glutamate synaptic hyperactivity increases intraneuronal transport rates in CNS neurons.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the effects of crocin on depression induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) in mice. Methods: Depression model was established induced by CRS. All mice were divided into 4 groups randomly: normal group, model group, sertraline group and crocin group. From the 28th day after treatment, serials behaviors were conducted to evaluate the effects of crocin, including sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), open field test (OFT), novel objective recognition test (NORT), social interaction test (SIT), and dominance tube test (DTT). Contents of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), BDNF, CREB, pCREB and SIRT1 in prefrontal cortex (PFC) were detected by WB. The levels of CORT, DA, 5-HT, NE and NAD+ in PFC were also detected by ELISA. Results: The results showed that crocin ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors, which manifested by increased sucrose consumption ratio and decreased immobility time in FST and TST. Crocin also increased the exploration time and exploration number in T2 phase in NORT, social preference index and social novelty index in SIT, reduced the defensive behavior in DTT. The results of WB showed crocin reversed the decreased contents of NAMPT, SIRT1, BDNF and pCREB/CREB in PFC induced by CRS. Additionally, crocin decreased the expression of cortisol (CORT) and increased the contents of DA, 5-HT, NAD+, but had no effects on NE between groups in PFC. Conclusion: In view of the findings, crocin ameliorates depression in mice, which may be associated with regulating NAMPT-NAD+-SIRT1 pathway.

AB  - Exposure to heat stress (HS) has adverse effects on brain function, leading to anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment. Sericin is a silk derived protein with various neurobiological activities. The present study has investigated the effects of sericin on anxiety and cognitive impairments, in HS-received mice. The adult male mice were exposed to HS (43 oC, 15 min once a day for 14 days) and simultaneously treated with 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day of sericin through oral gavage. Elevated plus-maze and Lashley III Maze tests were used to evaluate anxiety and learning and memory, respectively. The hippocampal BAX, BCL-2, caspase3, caspase9 and heat-shock protein-70 (HSP-70) were evaluated by western blotting and oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), super oxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were evaluated by spectroscopy method. The serum was collected for the analysis of the corticosterone levels. Treatment with sericin in higher doses reversed anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficit induced by HS. Moreover, heat exposure increased serum corticosterone, hippocampal MDA, apoptotic proteins and HSP-70 levels. Sericin administration decreased serum corticosterone and enhanced hippocampal antioxidant defense and attenuated apoptosis and HSP-70 levels. The results show that the protective effects of sericin against HS-mediated cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior is possibly through suppressing HSP-70, oxidative stress and apoptosis.

AB  - We previously found that monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic brain injury during the acute phase of stroke. Therefore, we modified the structure of an anti-inflammatory monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor peptide to construct an active cyclic peptide-Cyclo (MQCNS) (LZ-3)-and investigated its effects on ischemic stroke. In this study, we established a rat model of ischemic stroke by occluding the middle cerebral artery and then administered LZ-3 (2 or 4 mg/kg) via the tail vein for 7 consecutive days. Our results showed that LZ-3 (2 or 4 mg/kg) substantially decreased infarct volume, reduced cortical nerve cell death, improved neurological function, reduced cortical and hippocampal injury, and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors in the blood and brain tissues. In a well-differentiated, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced BV2 cell model of post-stroke, LZ-3 (100 mu M) inhibited the JAK1-STAT6 signaling pathway. LZ-3 regulated microglia/macrophage polarization from the M1 to the M2 type and inhibited microglia/macrophage phagocytosis and migration via the JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway. To conclude, LZ-3 regulates microglial activation by inhibiting the JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway and improves functional recovery post-stroke.

AB  - The effects of prenatal opioid exposure in adult animals has been widely studied, but little is known about the effects of prenatal opioid on adolescents. Most of the risk behaviors associated with drug abuse are initiated during adolescence. The developmental state of the adolescent brain makes it vulnerable to initiate drug use and susceptible to drug-induced brain changes. In this study, pregnant rats were subcutaneously injected with an increasing dose of morphine (5 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) for 9 days since the gestation day 11. The effects of prenatal morphine (PNM) on learning and memory, anxiety- and depressive- like behavior, morphine induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as well as locomotor sensitization were tested in both adolescent and adult rats. The results showed that: (1) PNM decreased anxiety-like behavior in both adolescent and adult female rats, but not males; (2) PNM decreased depressive-like behavior in adolescent but increased depressive -like behavior in adult females; (3) PNM increased low dose morphine induced locomotor sensitization in females; (4) PNM decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the prefrontal cortex but decreased dopamine D1 receptor expression in the nucleus-accumbens (NAc) in female rats. These results suggested that PNM altered the emotional and addictive behavior mainly in female rats, with female rats being less anxiety and depressive during adolescence, but more depressive in adult, and more sensitive to low dose morphine induced locomotor activity sensitization, which might be mediated in part by the differential expression of the TH, dopamine D1 receptors in the female brain.

AB  - Overstimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is the leading cause of brain excitotoxicity and often contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. This study aimed to evaluate a new NMDA receptor antagonist (UB-ALT-EV) and memantine in 6-month-old female 5XFAD mice that were exposed orally to a chronic low-dose treatment. Behavioral and cognitive tests confirmed better cognitive performance in both treated groups. Calcium-dependent protein calpain-1 reduction was found after UB-ALT-EV treatment but not after memantine. Changes in spectrin breakdown products (SBDP) and the p25/p35 ratio confirmed diminished calpain-1 activity. Amyloid beta (A beta) production and deposition was evaluated in 5XFAD mice and demonstrated a robust effect of NMDAR antagonists on reducing A beta deposition and the number and size of Thioflavin-S positive plaques. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) active form and phosphorylated tau (AT8) levels were diminished after UB-ALT-EV treatment, revealing tau pathology improvement. Because calpain-1 is involved in autophagy activation, autophagic proteins were studied. Strikingly, results showed changes in the protein levels of unc-51-like kinase (ULK-1), beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3(LC3B-II)/LC3B-I ratio, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) after NMDAR antagonist treatments, suggesting an accumulation of autophagolysosomes in 5XFAD mice, reversed by UB-ALT-EV. Likewise, treatment with UB-ALT-EV recovered a WT mice profile in apoptosis markers Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3. In conclusion, our results revealed the potential neuroprotective effect of UB-ALT-EV by attenuating NMDA-mediated apoptosis and reducing A beta deposition and deposition jointly with the autophagy rescue to finally reduce cognitive alterations in a mice model of familial AD.

AB  - Background The outcome of Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remain dismal despite the development of treatment. Targeted therapy is gaining more and more attention in improving prognosis.Methods Expression of BRAF was analyzed by RT-qPCR in AML and MDS patients. Cells viability treated by drugs was measured by CCK-8 assay. Network pharmacology and RNA-sequence were used to analyze the mechanism of drugs and verified in vitro and xenograft tumor model.Results Here we showed that BRAF was overexpressed in AML and MDS patients, and correlated with poor prognosis. The BRAF inhibitor-Vemurafenib (VEM) could significantly induce senescence, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in AML cells, which can be enhanced by Bortezomib (BOR). This inhibitory effect was also verified in CD34 + cells derived from AML patients. Mechanistically, we showed that VEM combined with BOR could turn on HIPPO signaling pathway, thereby inducing cellular senescence in AML cells and xenograft mouse.Conclusions Taken together, our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of BRAF expression in AML and MDS patients, which is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. We also discovered that the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib induces cellular senescence through activation of the HIPPO signaling pathway. Analysis of BRAF expression holds promise as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target for individuals with AML and MDS.

AB  - Point mutations in the alpha-synuclein coding gene may lead to the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is often accompanied by other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and drug use disorders, which typically emerge in adulthood. Some of these point mutations, such as SNCA and A30T, have been linked to behavioral effects that are not commonly associated with PD, especially regarding alcohol consumption patterns. In this study, we investigated whether the familial PD point mutation A53T is associated with changes in alcohol consumption behavior and emotional states at ages not yet characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation. The affective and alcohol-drinking phenotypes remained unaltered in female PDGF-hA53T-synuclein-transgenic (A53T) mice during both early and late adulthood. Brain region-specific activation of ceramide-producing enzymes, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), and neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM), known for their neuroprotective properties, was observed during early adulthood but not in late adulthood. In males, the A53T mutation was linked to a reduction in alcohol consumption in both early and late adulthood. However, male A53T mice displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors during both early and late adulthood. Enhanced ASM activity in the dorsal mesencephalon and ventral hippocampus may potentially contribute to these adverse behavioral effects of the mutation in males during late adulthood. In summary, the A53T gene mutation was associated with diverse changes in emotional states and alcohol consumption behavior long before the onset of PD, and these effects varied by sex. These alterations in behavior may be linked to changes in brain ceramide metabolism.

AB  - Objectives: Minocycline hydrochloride is a semi-synthetic, second-generation tetracycline with neuroprotective, neurorestorative, anti-amyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The present study was designed to investigate the potential protective effects of minocycline against beta-amyloid (A beta)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD), recognition memory decline, and the possible involved anti-apoptotic mechanisms.Methods: The rats were treated with minocycline (50 and 100 mg/kg/day; P.O.) after AD induction for 30 days. Behavioral functions were assessed by employing standard behavioral tests, including novel object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tasks. Then, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured in blood serum using ELISA kits. Apoptosis and the number of A beta plaques were examined by the TUNEL and Congo red staining, respectively.Results: Treatment of A beta rats with minocycline improved memory deficit in the PAL task and a decline in recognition memory in the NOR test. Minocycline at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the TOS levels and increased the TAC levels (P < 0.0001). Also, minocycline at 50 and 100 mg/kg reduced the apoptotic index in the hippocampus of A beta rats. After Congo red staining, the minocycline group showed improved cell morphology and markedly fewer A beta plaques.Conclusions: Minocycline reduced memory and learning deficit in behavioral experiments after A beta injection, which may be due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.

AB  - Obesity contributes to cognitive disorders, particularly memory impairment. Physical exercise is a non-pharmacological approach for enhancing weight management and promoting brain health. Especially, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) yields results comparable to or even exceeding those of traditional aerobic exercises. However, its nootropic effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the cognitive-enhancing effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in the context of neurotoxicity induced by a high-calorie diet, with particular emphasis on the role of osteocalcin (OCN)/GPR158 signaling in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 12 weeks. They then participated in an 8-week HIIT program, with the training intensity determined based on their pre-assessed maximal running capacity (MRC). HIIT efficiently regulated body weight and feeding behavior while improving MRC. It also ameliorated HFHSD-induced memory deficits, as demonstrated by the modified Y-maze test, by promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which was primarily localized to the dorsal hippocampus. Moreover, HIIT markedly increased astrocytic OCN/GPR158 signaling and significantly elevated BDNF expression in astrocytes within the dentate gyrus. Activation of the AKT/GSK3 beta pathway was also detected in OCN-positive astrocytes. This study collectively suggests a HIIT-specific mechanism, indicating that astrocytic OCN/GPR158 may contribute significantly to memory improvement in HFHSD-fed mice through its proneurogenic effects. Therefore, HIIT could serve as an effective strategy for combating the cognitive decline associated with metabolic disorders.

AB  - Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A1 (KATNA1) is a microtubule-cleaving enzyme that regulates the development of neural protrusions through cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, the mechanism underlying the linkage of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein to KATNA1 and how this modification regulates the development of neural pro-trusions is unclear. Here we discovered, using mass spectrometry analysis, that SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, an enzyme necessary for the SUMOylation process, was present in the KATNA1 interactome. Moreover, GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that KATNA1 and SUMO interact. We further demonstrated using immunofluo-rescence experiments that KATNA1 and the SUMO2 isoform colocalized in hippocampal neurites. We also performed a bioinformatics analysis of KATNA1 protein sequences to identify three potentially conserved SUMOylation sites (K77, K157, and K330) among vertebrates. Mutation of K330, but not K77 or K157, abolished KATNA1-induced microtubule severing and decreased the level of binding observed for KATNA1 and SUMO2. Cotransfection of SUMO2 and wildtype KATNA1 in COS7 cells increased microtubule severing, whereas no effect was observed after cotransfection with the K330R KATNA1 mutant. Furthermore, in cultured hippo-campal neurons, overexpression of wildtype KATNA1 significantly promoted neurite outgrowth, whereas the K330R mutant eliminated this effect. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the K330 site in KATNA1 is modified by SUMOylation and SUMOylation of KATNA1 promotes microtubule dynamics and hippocampal neurite outgrowth.

AB  - Scopolamine-induced memory impairment is a well-established model for studying the therapeutic potential of novel compounds in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of anethole against scopolamine-induced memory and cognitive disorders. Rats were treated with scopolamine (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 consecutive days. Anethole (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg, i.g.) was administered one hour prior to scopolamine injection. Memory and cognitive performance were assessed using the Passive Avoidance Test (PAT) and the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT). In addition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water content (BWC), and hippocampal levels of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, acetylcholine (ACh), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated following the behavioral tests. Histological changes in the hippocampus were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Anethole treatment significantly improved scopolamine-induced memory deficits in both NORT and PAT. Furthermore, anethole reduced BBB permeability and BWC in the AD rat model. Hippocampal levels of oxidative stress and inflammation were also attenuated following anethole administration. Additionally, anethole exerted cholinergic effects by inhibiting AChE and increasing ACh levels in the scopolamine-induced AD model. The neuroprotective effects of anethole were further confirmed by H&E staining. Our findings demonstrate that anethole effectively reverses scopolamine-induced memory and cognitive impairments through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticholinesterase mechanisms in rats. Therefore, anethole may be considered a promising therapeutic candidate for alleviating symptoms of AD and warrants further investigation in future studies.

AB  - Chemoresistance is one of the major hindrances to many cancer therapies, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Ferroptosis, a new programmed cell death, plays an essential role in chemoresistance. IQdomain GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein and functions as an oncogene in various human malignancies. However, the underlying effect and molecular mechanisms of IQGAP1 on paclitaxel (PTX) resistance and ferroptosis in ESCC remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that IQGAP1 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues and could as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of ESCC. Functional studies revealed that IQGAP1 overexpression reduced the sensitivity of ESCC cells to PTX by enhancing ESCC cell viability and proliferation and inhibiting cell death, and protected ESCC cells from ferroptosis, whereas IQGAP1 knockdown exhibited contrary effects. Importantly, reductions of chemosensitivity and ferroptosis caused by IQGAP1 overexpression were reversed with ferroptosis inducer RSL3, while the increases of chemosensitivity and ferroptosis caused by IQGAP1 knockdown were reversed with ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) in ESCC cells, indicating that IQGAP1 played a key role in resistance to PTX through regulating ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that IQGAP1 overexpression upregulated the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP), the central mediator of the Hippo pathway. YAP inhibitor Verteporfin (VP) could reverse the effects of IQGAP1 overexpression on ESCC chemoresistance and ferroptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that IQGAP1 promotes chemoresistance by blocking ferroptosis through targeting YAP. IQGAP1 may be a novel therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in ESCC.

AB  - Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural polyphenolic antioxidant in green tea leaves with well-known health-promoting properties. However, the influence of EGCG on a chronic animal model of depression remains to be fully investigated, and the details of the molecular and cellular changes are still unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of EGCG in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). After eight consecutive weeks of CUMS, the mice were treated with EGCG (200 mg/kg b.w.) by oral gavage for two weeks. A forced swimming test (FST) was used to assess depressive symptoms. EGCG administration significantly alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice. EGCG also effectively decreased serum interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and increased the mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampal CA3 region of CUMS mice. Furthermore, electron microscopic examination of CA3 neurons in CUMS mice showed morphological features of apoptosis, loss or disruption of the myelin sheath, and degenerating synapses. These neuronal injuries were diminished with the administration of EGCG. The treatment effect of EGCG in CUMS-induced behavioral alterations was comparable with that of clomipramine hydrochloride (Anafranil), a tricyclic antidepressant drug. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the antidepressive action of EGCG involves downregulation of serum IL-1 beta, upregulation of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus, and reduction of CA3 neuronal lesions.

AB  - In the adult mammalian brain, new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ)-olfactory bulb (OB) pathway. YAP, a transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway, promotes cell proliferation and inhibits differentiation in embryonic neural progenitors. However, the role of YAP in postnatal NSCs remains unclear. Here, we showed that YAP was present in NSCs of the postnatal mouse SVZ. Forced expression of Yap promoted NSC maintenance and inhibited differentiation, whereas depletion of Yap by RNA interference or conditional knockout led to the decline of NSC maintenance, premature neuronal differentiation, and collapse of neurogenesis. For the molecular mechanism, thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) recruited protein phosphatase PP1A to dephosphorylate LATS1/2, therefore inducing YAP nuclear localization and activation. Moreover, TRIP6 promoted NSC maintenance, cell proliferation, and inhibited differentiation through YAP. In addition, YAP regulated the expression of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway effector Gli2 and Gli1/2 mediated the effect of YAP on NSC maintenance. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel TRIP6-YAP-SHH axis, which is critical for regulating postnatal neurogenesis in the SVZ-OB pathway.

AB  - As a commonly used physical intervention, electrical stimulation (ES) has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of central nervous system disorders. Currently, researchers are studying the effects of electrical stimulation on individual neurons and neural networks, which are dependent on factors such as stimulation intensity, duration, location, and neuronal properties. However, the exact mechanism of action of electrical stimulation remains unclear. In some cases, repeated or prolonged electrical stimulation can lead to changes in the morphology or function of the neuron. In this study, immunofluorescence staining and Sholl analysis are used to assess changes in the neurite number and axon length to determine the optimal pattern and stimulation parameters of ES for neurons. Neuronal death and plasticity are detected by TUNEL staining and microelectrode array assays, respectively. mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis are applied to predict the key targets of the action of ES on neurons, and the identified targets are validated by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. The effects of alternating current stimulation (ACS) on neurons are more significant than those of direct current stimulation (DCS), and the optimal parameters are 3 mu A and 20 min. ACS stimulation significantly increases the number of neurites, the length of axons and the spontaneous electrical activity of neurons, significantly elevates the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) without significant changes in the expression of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, application of PI3K/AKT-specific inhibitors significantly abolishes the beneficial effects of ACS on neurons, confirming that the PI3K/AKT pathway is an important potential signaling pathway in the action of ACS.

AB  - The limited availability of antiviral therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spurred the search for novel antiviral drugs. Here, we investigated the potential antiviral properties of plants adapted to high-salt environments collected in the north of France. Twenty-five crude methanolic extracts obtained from twenty-two plant species were evaluated for their cytotoxicity and antiviral effectiveness against coronaviruses HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2. Then, a bioguided fractionation approach was employed. The most active crude methanolic extracts were partitioned into three different sub-extracts. Notably, the dichloromethane sub-extract of the whole plant Hippophae rhamnoides L. demonstrated the highest antiviral activity against both viruses. Its chemical composition was evaluated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and then it was fractionated by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). Six cinnamoyl triterpenoid compounds were isolated from the three most active fractions by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified by high resolution MS (HR-MS) and mono- and bi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Specifically, these compounds were identified as 2-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-maslinic acid, 3 beta-hydroxy-2 alpha-trans-p-coumaryloxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, 3 beta-hydroxy-2 alpha-cis-p-coumaryloxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, 3-O-trans-caffeoyl oleanolic acid, a mixture of 3-O-trans-caffeoyl oleanolic acid/3-O-cis-caffeoyl oleanolic acid (70/30), and 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl oleanolic acid. Infection tests demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of these triterpenes against HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, cinnamoyl oleanolic acids displayed activity against both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E. Our findings suggest that Hippophae rhamnoides could represent a source of potential antiviral agents against coronaviruses.

AB  - Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common neurological complication caused by diabetes mellitus (DM). Axonal degeneration is generally accepted to be the major pathological change in peripheral DN. Taurine has been evidenced to be neuroprotective in various aspects, but its effect on spinal cord axon injury (SCAI) in DN remains barely reported. This study showed that taurine significantly ameliorated axonal damage of spinal cord (SC), based on morphological and functional analyses, in a rat model of DN induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Taurine was also found to induce neurite outgrowth in cultured cerebral cortex neurons with high glucose exposure. Moreover, taurine up-regulated the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurite outgrowth relative protein GAP-43 in rat DN model and cultured cortical neurons/VSC4.1 cells. Besides, taurine increased the activating phosphorylation signals of TrkA, Akt, and mTOR. Mechanistically, the neuroprotection by taurine was related to the NGF-pAKT-mTOR axis, because either NGF-neutralizing antibody or Akt or mTOR inhibitors was found to attenuate its beneficial effects. Together, our results demonstrated that taurine promotes spinal cord axon repair in a model of SCAI in STZ-induced diabetic rats, mechanistically associating with the NGF-dependent activation of Akt/mTOR pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions among elder people. Nowadays, natural antioxidants have been used to recover the quality of life for those with AD. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the combined effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Ginkgo bilobastandardized extract (EGb761) on AD mice. AD was induced in adult male albino mice with AlCl3 (20 mg/kg b.w, i.g.) and D-galactose (D-gal; 120 mg/kg, i.p.) for 90 days. 30 days after induction, mice were treated with DHA (200 mg/kg b.w., i.g.) and EGb761 (200 mg/kg b.w., i.g.) for two months. Our data revealed that the dual treatment of DHA and EGb761 significantly improved cognitive memory and spatial learning abilities in AD-induced mice. The drug treatments preserved the hippocampal CA3 architecture and restored neuronal ultrastructural alterations. Expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the most implicated protein phosphatase in AD neurodegeneration, was highly upregulated in the CA3 hippocampus of AD mice treated with DHA and EGb761. Intriguingly, TNF-alpha expression was significantly reduced in the same group. In conclusion, our findings proved that the combined effect of DHA and EGb761 tended to be potent against the neurodegenerative effect of AlCl3 and D-gal. The applied treatment enhanced neuronal survival and cognitive functions via upregulation of PP2A and restoration of TNF-alpha expression.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a neurological complication of surgery especially common in elderly patients. In this study, we investigated the role of NONMMUT055714 in POCD via regulation of miR7684-5p. In a POCD mouse model, we induced overexpression of NONMUTT055714 via transfection of lentivirus into the hippocampus, and used the Morris water maze for assessment of cognitive function. Silencing of NONMUTT055714 and miR-7684-5p was induced in primary hippocampal neurons to observe the effects of these regulatory RNAs on cellular processes. Bioinformatics analysis and a double luciferase reporter experiment were performed to further explore the relationship between NONMMUT055714, miR-7684-5p, and SORLA. Cell and animal rescue experiments were performed to verify the ability of miR-7684-5p to reverse the protective effects of NONMMUT055714 overexpression in POCD. We observed that NONMMUT055714 has decreased expression in the POCD mouse model. Overexpression of NONMMUT055714 protected against cognitive impairment of the POCD mouse model in vivo. We identified miR-7684-5p as a NONMMUT055714-related miRNA and in turn as an upstream regulator of SORLA. We found that NONMMUT055714 downregulation is associated with decreased SORLA, increased A beta and p-tau expression, increased inflammatory biomarkers, increased markers of oxidative stress, and increased neuronal apoptosis in vitro. The effects of NONMMUT055714 downregulation were reversed by silencing miR-7684-5p in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that NONMMUT055714 is protective against the development of POCD via its function as a ceRNA (or miRNA sponge) in the regulation of miR-7684-5p and SORLA. We therefore propose NONMMUT055714 as a novel target for the investigation and prevention of POCD.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) is common during spaceflight. SD is known to cause cognitive deficits and depression, requiring treatment and prevention. Hemerocallis citrina Baroni (Liliaceae) is a perennial herb with antidepressant, antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects.The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of H. citrina extract (HCE) on SD-induced cognitive decline and depression-like behavior and possible neuroinflammation-related mechanisms. HCE (2 g/kg/day, i.g.) or vortioxetine (10 mg/kg/day, i.g.) were given to mice by oral gavage for a total of 28 days during the SD process. HCE treatment was found to ameliorate SD-induced impairment of short- and long-term spatial and nonspatial memory, measured using Ymaze, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests, as well as mitigating SD-induced depression-like behaviors, measured by tail suspension and forced swimming tests. HCE also reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-18, and IL-6) in the serum and hippocampus. Furthermore, HCE suppressed SD-induced microglial activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus. HCE also inhibited the expression of phosphorylated NF-kappa B and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In summary, our findings indicated that HCE attenuated SD-induced cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior and that this effect may be mediated by the inhibition of inflammatory progression and microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as the down-regulation of NF-kappa B and NLRP3 signaling. The findings of these studies showingTthese results indicate that HCE exerts neuroprotective effects and are consistent with the findings of previous studies, suggesting that HCE is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and depression in SD.

AB  - It has been recently demonstrated that rosmarinic acid (RA) through modulation in the amyloidogenic pathway exhibit neuroprotective potential in Alzheimer's disease. However, its effects on non-amyloidogenic pathways such as neuroinflammation (NI) and oxidative stress have not been elucidated carefully. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of RA on cognitive function, cortical and hippocampal oxidant-antioxidant balance, and proinflammatory cytokines production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NI in rats. NI was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of LPS (50 mu g/20 mu L; 10 mu L into each ventricle) in Wistar rats. RA (25 and 50 mg/kg.) was intraperitoneally administrated to the experimental groups 30 min before the LPS injection and continued once per day for seven days. Cognitive function was investigated by the Y-maze test, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were evaluated in their hippocampi (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, neuronal damage was evaluated in the HIP subfields histologically. The RA administration could alleviate cognitive impairments caused by NI in LPS-treated rats as evidenced by improved working memory and attenuated neuronal injury in the HIP subfields. RA treatment in a dose-dependent manner prevented the overproduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6 in both the HIP and PFC. RA significantly alleviated the HIP and PFC levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NOx) and enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. These findings demonstrated that RA could also exert its neuroprotective effects by modulating non-amyloidogenic pathways such as inflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Objective: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to involve in pathological processes of ischemic stroke (IS), including autophagy. This study was designed to explore the effect of circR-ZC3HC1 on neuronal autophagy in IS and the related mechanisms. Methods: Expression of circR-ZC3HC1 in blood samples of IS patients and healthy controls was detected. Hippocampal neurons were treated with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) to establish IS in vitro model. The expression of LC3 and p62 and the number of autophagosomes were examined to evaluate the autophagy level of OGD induced neurons using western blotting and transmission electron microscope. Cell apoptosis rate and the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were assessed by flow cytometry and western blotting. The binding relationships among circR-ZC3HC1, miR-384-5p, and SIRT1 were predicted and verified. Results: Low expression of circR-ZC3HC1 was found in blood samples of IS patients and OGD-treated neurons. Overexpressed circR-ZC3HC1 or inhibited miR-384-5p expression promoted autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of OGD-treated neurons, which could be reversed by further 3-MA treatment. Mechanistically, circR-ZC3HC1 targeted miR-384-5p to mediate SIRT1 expression. miR-384-5p overexpression or SIRT1 knockdown in the presence of circR-ZC3HC1 overexpression in OGD-treated neurons lead to reduced autophagy and enhanced apoptosis. Conclusion: Collectively, circR-ZC3HC1 promoted neuronal autophagy to attenuate IS via miR-384-5p/SIRT1 axis.

AB  - KDM4C is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance in various stem cell types. However, its function in neural stem cells (NSCs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of KDM4C in NSCs. Primary hippocampal NSCs were isolated from neonatal mice, and both in vivo and in vitro lentivirusmediated overexpression of KDM4C were induced in these hippocampal NSCs. Staining results revealed a significant increase in BrdU- and Ki- 67- positive cells, along with an elevated number of cells in S phases due to KDM4C overexpression. Subsequently, RNA- seq was employed to analyze gene expression changes following KDM4C upregulation. GO enrichment analysis, KEGG analysis, and GSEA highlighted KDM4C- regulated genes associated with development, cell cycle, and neurogenesis. Protein- protein interaction analysis uncovered that ApoE protein interacts with several genes (top 10 upregulated and downregulated) regulated by KDM4C. Notably, knocking down ApoE mitigated the proliferative effect induced by KDM4C overexpression in NSCs. Our study demonstrates that KDM4C overexpression significantly upregulates ApoE expression, ultimately promoting proliferation in mouse hippocampal NSCs. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing neurodevelopment, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in neurological disorders.

AB  - Background: Aluminium (Al) overload has toxic effects on multiple organ systems, especially the nervous system. Al accumulation in the brain, especially the hippocampus, is an important factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deferiprone (DFP), a metal chelator, is used as a potential treatment for AD. In this study, we investigated the combined effect of taurine and DFP on Al chelation and hippocampal apoptosis in Al-exposed rats, as well as the underlying mechanisms of these effects to explore a possible therapy for AD.Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups: negative control group (administered saline), Al-exposure group (administered AlCl3 and saline), and five experimental groups (administered AlCl3 and taurine, varying doses of DFP, or taurine with varying doses of DFP). After 8 weeks of treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TDT)-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect hippocampal apoptotic cells. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to assess the expression of the Bcl2 and Bax genes, and a western blotting assay was used to evaluate BCL2, BAX, and cleaved caspase-3 levels.Results: Compared to the negative control group, the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus increased, Bcl2 expression significantly decreased, and BAX and cleaved caspase-3 levels increased in the Al-exposure group. The combination of taurine and DFP exerted a protective effect by inhibiting hippocampal cell apoptosis through the BCL2, BAX, and caspase-3 signalling pathways. Compared with the taurine-administered group, the group administered taurine with DFP showed a significantly increased Bcl2 and decreased Bax expression.Conclusion: The combination of taurine and DFP is a potential candidate for the treatment of AD induced by Al exposure.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the protective effect of Juglans regia (walnut, Gimcheon 1ho cultivar, GC) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive dysfunction in C57BL/6 mice. The main physiological compounds of GC were identified as pedunculagin/casuariin isomer, strictinin, tellimagrandin I, ellagic acid-O-pentoside, and ellagic acid were identified using UPLC Q-TOF/MS analysis. To evaluate the neuro-protective effect of GC, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate (DCF-DA) analysis were conducted in H2O2 and high glucose-induced neuronal PC12 cells and hippocampal HT22 cells. GC presented significant cell viability and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. GC ameliorated behavioral and memory dysfunction through Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. In addition, GC reduced white adipose tissue (WAT), liver fat mass, and serum dyslipidemia. To assess the inhibitory effect of antioxidant system deficit, lipid peroxidation, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were conducted. Administration of GC protected the antioxidant damage against HFD-induced diabetic oxidative stress. To estimate the ameliorating effect of GC, acetylcholine (ACh) level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and expression of AChE and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were conducted, and the supplements of GC suppressed the cholinergic system impairment. Furthermore, GC restored mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating the mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels in cerebral tissues. Finally, GC ameliorated cerebral damage by synergically regulating the protein expression of the JNK signaling and apoptosis pathway. These findings suggest that GC could provide a potential functional food source to improve diabetic cognitive deficits and neuronal impairments.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3) have been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but their mechanism has not been fully understood. This research aimed to confirm the role and regulatory mechanism of hsa_circ_0049396 interacting with EIF4A3 in NPC tumorigenesis. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was executed to detect the levels of hsa_circ_0049396 and EIF4A3. Cell function experiments and nude mice xenograft assay were used to confirm the role of hsa_circ_0049396 in NPC. The regulatory effect of EIA4A3 on hsa_circ_0049396 was determined by circInteractome prediction, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, and qRT-PCR. In addition, the Hippo-YAP pathway-related proteins and EIF4A3 protein were detected by western blotting. hsa_circ_0049396 was proved to be downregulated in NPC samples, and its low expression indicated the poor prognosis of NPC. After upregulating hsa_circ_0049396 in NPC cells, the proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo were suppressed by inhibiting the Hippo-YAP pathway. Moreover, EIF4A3 bound to the flanking regions of the hsa_circ_0049396 to enhance hsa_circ_0049396 expression in NPC cells. hsa_circ_0049396 mediated by EIF4A3 in NPC can attenuate NPC tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Hippo-YAP pathway. This finding may provide a potential early diagnostic biomarker or drug target to improve the precision medicine approaches of NPC.

AB  - Ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1, also known as GPR68) is a member of proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors, involved in cardiovascular physiology, tumor biology, and asthma, and exerts a neuroprotective effect against brain ischemia. The effects of GPR68 on anesthesia-induced nerve damage and myelination were investigated in this study. First, 2-day old postnatal rats were exposed to 4.9% sevoflurane for 2 h. Data from hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining showed that sevoflurane induced pathological changes in the hippocampus with a reduced number of neurons. GPR68 was downregulated in the hippocampus of sevoflurane-induced rats. Second, sevoflurane-induced rats were injected with adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of GPR68, and overexpression of GPR68 ameliorated sevoflurane-induced pathological changes, enhanced the number of neurons, and improved the learning and memory function. Moreover, overexpression of GPR68 increased the number of BrdU-positive and Olig2-positive cells and enhanced protein expression of Olig2 in sevoflurane-induced rats. Third, the number of myelin basic protein (MBP) positive cells and protein expression of MBP in sevoflurane-induced rats were also enhanced by injection with AAV-GPR68. Overexpression of GPR68 attenuated sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats. Lastly, overexpression of GPR68 upregulated protein expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by increasing cAMP and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In conclusion, GPR68 alleviated sevoflurane-induced nerve damage and myelination through BDNF-mediated activation of the cAMP/CREB pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, including beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques, Tau tangles, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal iron (Fe) metabolism plays a role in AD pathogenesis, but the precise spatial distribution of the Fe and its transporters, such as ferroportin (FPN), within affected brain regions remains poorly understood. This study investigates the distribution of Fe and FPN in the CA1 region of the human hippocampus in AD patients with a micrometer lateral resolution using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). For this purpose, we visualized and quantified Fe and FPN in three separated CA1 layers: stratum molecular-radial (SMR), stratum pyramidal (SP) and stratum oriens (SO). Additionally, chromogenic immunohistochemistry was used to examine the distribution and colocalization with Tau and A beta proteins. The results show that Fe accumulation was significantly higher in AD brains, particularly in SMR and SO. However, FPN did not present significantly changes in AD, although it showed a non-uniform distribution across CA1 layers, with elevated levels in SP and SO. Interestingly, minimal overlap was observed between Fe and FPN signals, and none between Fe and areas rich in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or neuritic plaques (NP). In conclusion, the lack of correlation between Fe and FPN signals suggests complex regulatory mechanisms in AD Fe metabolism and deposition. These findings highlight the complexity of Fe dysregulation in AD and its potential role in disease progression.

AB  - Memory deficits and loss are the earliest and most prominent features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was aimed to clarify the mechanistic basis of an active fraction of Polyrhachis vicina Roger (AFPR) on the memory abilities of AD rat models, which involves early growth response 1 (EGR1) expression and P-secretase 1 (BACE1)mediated deposition of amyloid P peptide (AP). An AD rat model was developed by AP25-35, which was further treated with AFPR alone or in combination with lentiviral EGR1. The Morris water maze test and HE and Fluoro-Jade C staining were adopted to observe the memory behaviors, hippocampus neuron morphology, and AP deposition. AP2535-induced SK-N-SH and HT22 neurons were subjected to AFPR for in vitro experiments on neuronal viability and apoptosis. AFPR improved the impaired memory function, preserved the neuron structure, and suppressed AP deposition in AD rat models. Further, the expression of APP pathway-related proteins was downregulated by AFPR in both rat and cellular models. Moreover, AFPR inhibited the AP25-35induced neuronal apoptosis. AFPR suppressed the expression of EGR1, downregulated the BACE1 expression via impeding the binding of EGR1 to the BACE1 promoter, and thus blocked the activation of the APP signaling, ultimately protecting neurons. Notably, the aforementioned effects of AFPR were in a concentration-dependent manner; among three doses, 3.65, 15.6, and 30 mg/ (kgmiddotd), high-dose AFPR exhibited the most appreciable effects. In conclusion, AFPR inhibited the BACE1 expression by repressing the binding of EGR1 to the promoter of BACE1, thereby suppressing the AP deposition and improving the memory function of AD rats.

AB  - The Vps10p domain receptor SorCS2 is crucial for the development and function of the nervous system and essential for brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced changes in neuronal morphology and plasticity. SorCS2 regulates the subcellular trafficking of the BDNF signaling receptor TrkB as well as selected neurotransmitter receptors in a manner that is dependent on the SorCS2 intracellular domain (ICD). However, the cellular machinery and adaptor protein (AP) interactions that regulate receptor trafficking via the SorCS2 ICD are unknown. We here identify four splice variants of human SorCS2 differing in the insertion of an acidic cluster motif and/or a serine residue within the ICD. We show that each variant undergoes posttranslational proteolytic processing into a one- or two -chain receptor, giving rise to eight protein isoforms, the expression of which differs between neuronal and nonneuronal tissues and is affected by cellular stressors. We found that the only variants without the serine were able to rescue BDNFinduced branching of SorCS2 knockout hippocampal neurons, while variants without the acidic cluster showed increased interactions with clathrin-associated APs AP -1, AP2, and AP -3. Using yeast two -hybrid screens, we further discovered that all variants bound dynein light chain Tctextype 3; however, only variants with an acidic cluster motif bound kinesin light chain 1. Accordingly, splice variants showed markedly different trafficking properties and localized to different subcellular compartments. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the existence of eight functional SorCS2 isoforms with differential capacity for interactions with cytosolic ligands dynein light chain Tctex-type 3 and kinesin light chain 1, which potentially allows cell -type specific SorCS2 trafficking and BDNF signaling.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ligand-gated ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate a calcium-permeable component to fast excitatory neurotransmission. NMDARs are heterotetrameric assemblies of two obligate GluN1 subunits (GRIN1) and two GluN2 subunits (GRIN2A-GRIN2D). Sequencing data shows that 43% (297/679) of all currently known NMDAR disease-associated genetic variants are within the GRIN2A gene, which encodes the GluN2A subunit. Here, we show that unlike missense GRIN2A variants, individuals affected with disease-associated null GRIN2A variants demonstrate a transient period of seizure susceptibility that begins during infancy and diminishes near adolescence. We show increased circuit excitability and CA1 pyramidal cell output in juvenile mice of both Grin2a(+/-) and Grin2a(-/-) mice. These alterations in somatic spiking are not due to global upregulation of most Grin genes (including Grin2b). Deeper evaluation of the developing CA1 circuit led us to uncover age- and Grin2a gene dosing-dependent transient delays in the electrophysiological maturation programs of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. We report that Grin2a(+/+) mice reach PV cell electrophysiological maturation between the neonatal and juvenile neurodevelopmental timepoints, with Grin2a(+/-) mice not reaching PV cell electrophysiological maturation until preadolescence, and Grin2a(-/-) mice not reaching PV cell electrophysiological maturation until adulthood. Overall, these data may represent a molecular mechanism describing the transient nature of seizure susceptibility in disease-associated null GRIN2A patients. Null GRIN2A human patients display a largely transient seizure burden that resolves with age, which may be attributable to a transient delay in the developmental maturation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in CA1 as is observed in Grin2a(+/-) and Grin2a(-/-) mice.

AB  - Aim Aging involves progressive physiological changes, including thyroid dysfunction; thus, changes in plasma thyroid hormone (TH) level may affect neuronal function such as synaptic plasticity and Tau phosphorylation. However, how Tau protein is modulated in hyperthyroidism with aging is not clear. To clarify this issue, long-term potentiation (LTP) and accompanying phosphorylation of Tau protein in different residues were investigated in the hippocampus of young and old rats with experimentally induced hyperthyroidism. Materials and methods The study was performed in vivo under urethane anesthesia on 2- and 12-month-old Wistar albino male rats. Field potentials, composed of a field of excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and a population spike (PS), occurring in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region, were recorded by applying high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to the perforant pathway (100 Hz, four times at 5-min intervals) to induce LTP. Total-Tau and phosphorylated-Tau were measured in HFS-induced hippocampus by using western blotting. Results The TH suppressed hippocampal somatic LTP (PS) was suppressed with aging, and treatment improved this suppression in aged rats without any changes in synaptic LTP (fEPSP). The phosphorylation of Tau at Ser202/Thr205 and Thr231 residues was increased in aged control rats. Treatment of aged rats with l-thyroxine reduced the phosphorylation of Tau at these residues to the young control condition. Conclusion Impaired LTP that occurs with aging may be among the underlying causes of dementia in relatively older ages, and l-thyroxine treatment restores this impaired LTP. In addition, the phosphorylation level of Tau epitopes known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease may support a critical role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity in hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Oxidative stress with a depletion of glutathione is a key factor in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD). N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, provides neuroprotective effects in AD animal models. Its amide form, N-Acetylcysteine amide (NACA), has an extended bioavailability compared to NAC. This study evaluates the neuroprotective effects of NACA against A beta 1-42 peptide-induced AD-like pathology in rats. Male Wistar rats (2.5 months old) were divided into five groups: Normal Control (NC), Sham (SH), A beta, A beta + NACA and NACA + A beta+ NACA (n = 8 in all groups). AD-like pathology was induced by the intracerebroventricular infusion of A beta 1-42 peptide into the lateral ventricle. NACA (75 mg/kg) was administered either as a restorative (i.e., injection of NACA for 7 consecutive days after inducing AD-like pathology (A beta + N group)), or as prophylactic (for 7 days before and 7 days after inducing the pathology (N + A beta + N group)). Learning and memory, neurogenesis, expression of AD pathology markers, antioxidant parameters, neuroprotection, astrogliosis and microgliosis were studied in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. All data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni ' s multiple comparison test. NACA treatment reversed the cognitive deficits and reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Western blot analysis for Tau, Synaptophysin and A beta, as well as a histopathological evaluation through immunostaining for neurogenesis, the expression of neurofibrillary tangles, beta-amyloid peptide, synaptophysin, neuronal morphology and gliosis, showed a neuroprotective effect of NACA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of NACA against fi-amyloid induced AD-like pathology.

AB  - Melatonin can attenuate cardiac microvascular ischemia/reperfusion injury, but it remains unclear whether melatonin can also ameliorate cerebral microvascular abnormalities. Rat models of Alzheimer's disease were established by six intracerebroventricular injections of amyloid-beta 1-42, administered once every other day. Melatonin (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered for 13 successive days, with the first dose given 24 hours prior to the first administration of amyloid-beta 1-42. Melatonin ameliorated learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test, improved the morphology of microvessels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, increased microvessel density, alleviated pathological injuries of cerebral neurons, and decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2. These findings suggest that melatonin can improve microvessel abnormalities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by lowering the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, thereby improving the cognitive function of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive dementia. Research suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Reduced levels of miR-137 have been observed in the brains of AD patients, but its specific role and downstream mechanisms remain unclear. This study sought to examine the therapeutic potential of miR-137-5p agomir in alleviating cognitive dysfunction induced in AD models and explore its potential mechanisms.Methods: This study utilized bioinformatic analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay to investigate the relationship between miR-137-5p and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 (USP30). In vitro experiments were conducted using SH-SY5Y cells to assess the impact of miR-137-5p on A beta 1-42 neurotoxicity. In vivo experiments on AD mice evaluated the effects of miR-137-5p on cognition, A beta 1-42 deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal apoptosis, as well as its influence on USP30 levels.Results: It was discovered that miR-137-5p mimics efficiently counteract A beta 1-42 neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a protective effect that is negated by USP30 overexpression. In vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-137-5p enhances the cognition and mobility of AD mice, significantly reducing A beta 1-42 deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal apoptosis within the hippocampus and cortex regions. Mechanistically, miR-137-5p significantly suppresses USP30 levels in mice, though USP30 overexpression partially buffers against miR-137-5p-induced AD symptom improvement.Conclusion: Our study proposes that miR-137-5p, by instigating the downregulation of USP30, has the potential to act as a novel and promising therapeutic target for AD.

AB  - IntroductionHeroin use disorder (HUD) is a seriously increasing health issue, accounting for most deaths among drug abusers. Studying non-coding ribonucleic acid gene expression among drug abusers is a promising approach, as it may be used in diagnosis and therapeutics.Participants and methodsA total of 49 male heroin-dependent patients and 49 male control participants were recruited from Kasr Al Ainy Psychiatry and Addiction outpatient clinics, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Sera were gathered. qRT-PCR was utilized for the detection of gene expression of non-coding RNAs such as "HOX transcript antisense RNA" (HOTAIR), micro-RNA (miRNA-206), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Activity Regulated Cytoskeleton Associated Protein (Arc). Sera Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were assessed using ELISA. Using a western blot made it possible to determine the protein expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR.ResultsThe study demonstrated that gene expressions of HOTAIR, AKT, PI3K, and Arc were considerably lowered between cases and controls, while gene expressions of miR-206 and mTOR1 were significantly raised. PI3K and AKT protein expressions were downregulated, while mTOR expressions were upregulated. BDNF levels were significantly decreased in some cases.ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that decreased HOTAIR in HUD relieves miR-206 inhibition, which thus increases and affects downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ARC, and BDNF expression. This may be shared in addictive and relapsing behaviors.

AB  - Hemorrhagic stroke, specifically intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), has been implicated in the development of persistent cognitive impairment, significantly compromising the quality of life for affected individuals. Nevertheless, the precise underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report for the first time that the accumulation of iron within the hippocampus, distal to the site of ICH in the striatum, is causally linked to the observed cognitive impairment with both clinical patient data and animal model. Both susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) demonstrated significant iron accumulation in the hippocampus of ICH patients, which is far from the actual hematoma. Logistical regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis identified iron level as an independent risk factor with a negative correlation with postICH cognitive impairment. Using a mouse model of ICH, we demonstrated that iron accumulation triggers an excessive activation of neural stem cells (NSCs). This overactivation subsequently leads to the depletion of the NSC pool, diminished neurogenesis, and the onset of progressive cognitive dysfunction. Mechanistically, iron accumulation elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which downregulated the expression of Itga3. Notably, pharmacological chelation of iron accumulation or scavenger of aberrant ROS levels, as well as conditionally overexpressed Itga3 in NSCs, remarkably attenuated the exhaustion of NSC pool, abnormal neurogenesis and cognitive decline in the mouse model of ICH. Together, these results provide molecular insights into ICH-induced cognitive impairment, shedding light on the value of maintaining NSC pool in preventing cognitive dysfunction in patients with hemorrhagic stroke or related conditions.

AB  - Depression is a high-incidence mental illness that seriously affects human health. AQP4 has been reported to be closely associated with depression, while the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This work aimed to inves-tigate the functional role of AQP4 in depression. Depression mouse model was constructed by administration of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). We found that AQP4 was highly expressed in the hippocampal tissues of CSDS mice. AQP4 knockdown alleviated depression and enhanced the expression of NR2B and PSD95 in CSDS mice. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons were treated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) to induce neuron injury. AQP4 overexpression repressed cell viability and promoted apoptosis of NMDA-treated primary hippo-campal neurons. AQP4 up-regulation repressed the expression of NR2B (surface), and enhanced the expression of NR2B (intracellular), P-NR2B, CaMK II and CK2 in the NMDA-treated primary hippocampal neurons. The in-fluence conferred by AQP4 up-regulation was abolished by KN-93 (CaMK II inhibitor) or TBB (CK2 inhibitor) treatment. Rapamycin treatment enhanced the expression of NR2B (surface), and repressed the expression of AQP4, NR2B (intracellular) and P-NR2B in the primary hippocampal neurons by activating autophagy. The activated autophagy alleviated depression in CSDS mice by repressing AQP4 expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that autophagy ameliorated depression by repressing AQP4 expression in mice, and AQP4 knockdown promoted membrane trafficking of NR2B and inhibited phosphorylation of NR2B via CaMK II/CK2 pathway. Thus, our work suggests that AQP4 may be a promising molecular target for the development of an-tidepressant drugs.

AB  - Background Venlafaxine has been demonstrated to treat diseases such as social anxiety disorder and depression. Most of antidepressants including venlafaxine have a certain effect, but significant side effects. Therefore, it is necessary for us to research the development of novel antidepressants for effective treatment in practice. MicroRNA-204 (miR-204) is highly expressed in brain tissue, and plays a critical role in the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons in rats. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-204 remains unclear to date, this study aims to offer unique insights into depression and provide a theoretical basis for clinical physicians.Methods A chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) was initially adopted for establishing a mice model of depression in this research and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by a series of behavioral experiments including the sucrose preference test (SPT), the tail suspension test (TST), the forced swim test (FST) and the social interaction test (SIT). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was also conducted to test the expression levels of miR-204 and BDNF in the hippocampus of mice. Finally, gene interference of miR-204-5p was further adopted to test whether miR-204-5p played an effective role in the antidepressant effects of venlafaxine in mice.Results Our data implicated that CSDS significantly increased the miR-204-5p but not miR-204-3p levels in the hippocampus of mice. The treatment of venlafaxine obviously relieved depression-like behaviors of CSDS-induced mice. The usage of venlafaxine abolished the increasing effects on the expression of miR-204-5p but up-regulated the BDNF expression level in CSDS-exposured mice. More importantly, we found that genetic overexpression of miR-204-5p decreased the reverse effects of venlafaxine on depressive-like behaviors and genetic knockdown of hippocampal miR-204-5p relieved the depressive-like behaviors and neurogenesis in CSDS-induced mice.Conclusion miR-204-5p played an effective role in the antidepressant effects of venlafaxine in CSDS-induced mice.

AB  - Vascular disease contributes to neurodegeneration, which is associated with decreased blood pressure in older humans. Plasmalogens, ether phospholipids produced by peroxisomes, are decreased in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanistic links between ether phospholipids, blood pressure, and neurodegeneration are not fully understood. Here, we show that endothelium-derived ether phospholipids affect blood pressure, behavior, and neurodegeneration in mice. In young adult mice, inducible endothelial-specific disruption of PexRAP, a peroxisomal enzyme required for ether lipid synthesis, unexpectedly decreased circulating plasmalogens. PexRAP endothelial knockout (PEKO) mice responded normally to hindlimb ischemia but had lower blood pressure and increased plasma renin activity. In PEKO as compared with control mice, tyrosine hydroxylase was decreased in the locus coeruleus, which maintains blood pressure and arousal. PEKO mice moved less, slept more, and had impaired attention to and recall of environmental events as well as mild spatial memory deficits. In PEKO hippocampus, gliosis was increased, and a plasmalogen associated with memory was decreased. Despite lower blood pressure, PEKO mice had generally normal homotopic functional connectivity by optical neuroimaging of the cerebral cortex. Decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation, a marker of neurodegeneration, was detected in PEKO cerebral cortex. In a co-culture system, PexRAP knockdown in brain endothelial cells decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation in co-cultured astrocytes that was rescued by incubation with the ether lipid alkylglycerol. Taken together, our findings suggest that endothelium-derived ether lipids mediate several biological processes and may also confer neuroprotection in mice.

AB  - The highly complex structure of the brain requires an approach that can unravel its connectivity. Using volume electron microscopy and a dedicated software we can trace and measure all nerve fibers present within different samples of brain tissue. With this software tool, individual dendrites and axons are traced, obtaining a simplified "skeleton" of each fiber, which is linked to its corresponding synaptic contacts. The result is an intricate meshwork of axons and dendrites interconnected by a cloud of synaptic junctions. To test this methodology, we apply it to the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus and layers 1 and 3 of the somatosensory cortex of the mouse. We find that nerve fibers are densely packed in the neuropil, reaching up to 9 kilometers per cubic mm. We obtain the number of synapses, the number and lengths of dendrites and axons, the linear densities of synapses established by dendrites and axons, and their location on dendritic spines and shafts. The quantitative data obtained through this method enable us to identify subtle traits and differences in the synaptic organization of the samples, which might have been overlooked in a qualitative analysis.

AB  - Hydroxytyrosol (HT), the main phenolic compound in olives and olive products, has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and other physiological functions. The effects of HT on depression are unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of HT on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depressive-like behaviors. Mice were exposed to CUMS for 9 weeks and then treated with HT beginning in the second week and continuing for 7 weeks. Behavioral, biochemical, and molecular tests were conducted at the end of the experiment. The sucrose preference was significantly decreased in the CUMS group versus the healthy control group. Also, immobility times in forced swimming and tail suspension tests were increased in CUMS-induced mice, but treatment with HT significantly reversed this change. HT ameliorated oxidative stress in CUMS-exposed mice by enhancing superoxide dismutase activity and reducing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels in the hippocampus. HT administration significantly suppressed microglia activation and inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 beta in the hippocampus versus the untreated group. The expression level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the number of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the hippocampus were significantly augmented by HT. Furthermore, HT treatment increased the expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (p-TrkB), and phosphorylated c-AMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) compared with the untreated CUMS group. Overall, HT improved CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice by alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and by enhancing the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - BackgroundThe louse flies in the genus Ornithomya Latreille are avian ectoparasites. The patterns of alar microtrichia on the wings of the Ornithomyae are commonly used to help distinguish the various species, with the patterns in most species found to be constant between individuals. The Finch Louse Fly Ornithomya fringillina (Curtis) in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Isle of Man, is unusual in that the several patterns have been described. Consequently it has a complicated taxonomic history and there is some confusion about species identification.MethodsLouse flies were collected by licensed bird ringers and an analysis of the simple morphological features, phenology and geographical distribution of these traits was performed.ResultsNo significant differences were found between the three main types, and it was concluded that the differences were not due to sexual dimorphism and did not provide evidence that the different forms were separate species. Analysis of COX1 DNA sequences confirmed this result and proved that these are indeed morphotypes and not distinct species. There was no geographical separation between COX1 sequences from the United Kingdom and those from flies sampled in other parts of the world. The molecular analysis also suggested that Ornithomya bequaerti (Maa) and Ornithomya candida (Maa) may not be valid species, but represent morphotypes of O. fringillina.ConclusionsThe three patterns of alar microtrichia are morphotypes of a single species, Ornithomya fringillina. Further research is necessary to determine the status of some other species in the genus Ornithomya.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone that has been reported to play a significant role in neuroprotection against neuronal excitotoxicity produced by glutamate (Glu) or kainic acid (KA) in both, in vitro and in vivo models. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in PRL's neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus have not been completely elucidated. The aim of the present study was to assess the signaling pathways involved in PRL neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. Primary rat hippocampal neuronal cell cultures were used to assess PRL-induced signaling pathway activation. The effects of PRL on neuronal viability, as well as its effects on activation of key regulatory pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 & beta; / nuclear factor kappa B (GSK3 & beta;/NF-& kappa;B), were evaluated under conditions of Glutamateinduced excitotoxicity. Additionally, the effect on downstream regulated genes such as Bcl-2 and Nrf2, was assessed. Here, we show that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is activated by PRL treatment during excitotoxicity, promoting neuronal survival through upregulation of active AKT and GSK3 & beta;/NF-& kappa;B, resulting in induction of Bcl-2 and Nrf2 gene expression. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway abrogated the protective effect of PRL against Glu-induced neuronal death. Overall, results indicate that the neuroprotective actions of PRL are mediated in part, by the activation of the AKT pathway and survival genes. Our data support the idea that PRL could be useful as a potential neuroprotective agent in different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background Protein aggregates are pathological hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases, however the physiopathological role of these aggregates is not fully understood. Protein quality control has a pivotal role for protein homeostasis and depends on specific chaperones. The co-chaperone BAG2 can target phosphorylated Tau for degradation by an ubiquitin-independent pathway, although its possible role in autophagy was not yet elucidated. In view of this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association among protein aggregation, autophagy and BAG2 levels in cultured cells from hippocampus and locus coeruleus as well as in SH-SY5Y cell line upon different protein aggregation scenarios induced by rotenone, which is a flavonoid used as pesticide and triggers neurodegeneration. Methods and results The present study showed that rotenone exposure at 0.3 nM for 48 h impaired autophagy prior to Tau phosphorylation at Ser199/202 in hippocampus but not in locus coeruleus cells, suggesting that distinct neuron cells respond differently to rotenone toxicity. Rotenone induced Tau phosphorylation at Ser199/202, together with a decrease in the endogenous BAG2 protein levels in SH-SY5Y and hippocampus cell culture, which indicates that rotenone and Tau hyperphosphorylation can affect this co-chaperone. Finally, it has been shown that BAG2 overexpression, increased p62/SQSTM1 levels in cells from hippocampus and locus coeruleus, stimulated LC3II recycling as well as prevented the raise of phosphorylated Tau at Ser199/202 in hippocampus. Conclusions Results demonstrate a possible role for BAG2 in degradation pathways of specific substrates and its importance for the study of cellular aspects of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) is a potential carcinogen known to cause liver tumors and chronic inflammation, diabetes, cognitive problems, and signs like Alzheimer's disease (AD) in animals. This compound is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. Usual sources of exposure include food, beer, tobacco, personal care products, water, and medications. AD is characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid-beta (A beta) deposit, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cell loss. This is accompanied by neuroinflammation, which involves release of microglial cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) upregulation; each are linked to AD progression. Weak PI3K/Akt insulin-signaling inhibits IRS-1 phosphorylation, activates GSK3 beta and promotes tau hyperphosphorylation. Metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent, has potent anti-inflammatory efficacy. It reduces proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha via NF-kappa B inhibition. Metformin also reduces reactive oxidative species (ROS) and modulates cognitive disorders reported due to brain insulin resistance links. Our study examined how NDEA affects spatial memory in Wistar rats. We found that all NDEA doses tested impaired memory. The 80 mu g/kg dose of NDEA increased levels of A beta 1-42, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the hippocampus, which correlated with memory loss. Nonetheless, treatment with 100 mg/kg of metformin attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and A beta 1-42, and enhanced memory. It suggests that metformin may protect against NDEA-triggered memory issues and brain inflammation.

AB  - Headings ethnopharmacological relevance: Pushen capsule is a traditional Chinese medicine compound functioning as 'stimulating blood circulation to remove blood stasis', which widely used to treat hyperlipidemia. Recent clinical research showed that Pushen capsule ameliorated cognitive function in patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment.
   Aim of the study: Explore the potential mechanism of Pushen capsule in vascular dementia (VaD) using network pharmacology analysis and experimental verification.
   Materials and methods: Active ingredients and their related targets of Pushen capsule, and VaD-related targets were searched in public databases. Core targets, potential functions and mechanisms of Pushen capsule on VaD were predicted by protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. In vivo experiments were conducted to demonstrate the potential mechanisms of Pushen capsule in the treatment of VaD.
   Results: In total, 155 active ingredients, 273 related targets of Pushen capsule, and 1035 VaD-related targets were selected from the public databases. 147 common targets of Pushen capsule against VaD were obtained. The PPI network, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that some core targets and signaling pathways are related to inflammation. The experimental results showed that Pushen capsule treatment largely alleviated hippocampal glial activation, accelerated the polarization of activated microglia from the M1 to the M2 phenotype and reduced associated inflammatory factor expression to protect against VaD-induced neuronal loss, synaptic protein reduction and cognitive defects in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Pushen capsule reduced the mRNA expression of NF-kappa B p65; and STAT1.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that Pushen capsule alleviates hippocampal neuroinflammation to protect against VaD-induced cognitive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. The neuroprotective effect of Pushen capsule on VaD might be regulated by the NF-kappa B; and JAK-STAT pathway.

The latter is one of the most common complications in patients with HF. However, there is no study on treating HF-related cognitive dysfunction by QSYQ. Aims of the study: The study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of QSYQ on treating post-HF cognitive dysfunction based on network pharmacology and experimental validation. Materials and methods: Network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking was used to explore endogenous targets of QSYQ in treating cognitive impairment. Ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery and sleep deprivation (SD) were used to induce HF-related cognitive dysfunction in rats. The efficacy and potential signal targets of QSYQ were then verified by functional evaluation, pathological staining, and molecular biology experiments. Results: 384 common targets were identified by intersecting QSYQ 'compound targets' and 'cognitive dysfunction' disease targets. KEGG analysis showed these targets were enriched to the cAMP signal, and four marks responsible for regulating the cAMP signal were successfully docked with core compounds of QSYQ. Animal experiments demonstrated that QSYQ significantly ameliorated cardiac function and cognitive function in rats suffering from HF and SD, inhibited the reduction of cAMP and BDNF content, reversed the upregulation of PDE4 and downregulation of CREB, suppressed the loss of neurons, and restored the expression of synaptic protein PSD95 in the hippocampus. Conclusion: This study clarified that QSYQ could improve HF-related cognitive dysfunction by modulating cAMPCREB-BDNF signals. It provides a rich basis for the potential mechanism of QSYQ in the treatment of heart failure with cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported neuroprotective and procognitive effects of estrogens. The estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E2) activates both the classical nuclear estrogen receptors ERa and ER beta as well as the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). The differential effects of targeting the classical estrogen receptors over GPER are not well-understood. A limited number of selective GPER compounds have been described. In this study, 10 novel compounds were synthesized and exhibited half-maximal effective concentration values greater than the known GPER agonist G-1 in calcium mobilization assays performed in nonadherent HL-60 cells. Of these compounds, 2-cyclohexyl-4-isopropyl-N-((5-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran2-yl)furan-2-yl)methyl)aniline, referred to as CITFA, significantly increased axonal and dendritic growth in neurons extracted from embryonic day 18 (E18) fetal rat hippocampal neurons. Confirmation of the results was performed by treating E18 hippocampal neurons with known GPER-selective antagonist G-36 and challenging with either E2, G-1, or CITFA. Results from these studies revealed an indistinguishable difference in neurite outgrowth between the treatment and control groups, exhibiting that neurite outgrowth in response to G-1 and CITFA originates from GPER activation and can be abolished with pretreatment of an antagonist. Subsequent docking studies using a homology model of GPER showed unique docking poses between G-1 and CIFTA. While docking poses differed between the ligands, CIFTA exhibited more favorable distance, bond angle, and strain for hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kaixin San (KXS) is one of the most famous traditional Chinese formulas prescribed by Sun Simiao in 652 Christian era. It is composed of Panax ginseng C.A.Mey, Polygala tenuifolia, Poria cocos and Acorus calamus var. angustatus Besser. KXS is widely used for the treatment of emotion-thought disease, such as settling fright, quieting the spirit and nourishing the heart. However, whether KXS benefits hippocampal neurons and myocardial cells of mice impaired by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) and its mechanism remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study was aimed to investigate the effect of KXS on hippocampal neuron and cardiac ferroptosis in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep deprived mice and clarify its potential mechanism. Materials and methods: PSD was induced by a modified multi-platform method. Morris water maze (MWM) was used to detect the ability of learning and memory. Cardiac morphological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Heart rate was detected by a PowerLab multichannel physiological recorder. Serum levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured with biochemical kits. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescent, and Western blotting analysis were used to observe the process and pathway of ferrotosis in hippocampus tissue and heart tissue of PSD mice. Results: KXS administration improved the impaired learning and memory of PSD mice. It prevented the damage of mitochondria in the hippocampus and heart of PSD mice. KXS also alleviated the myocardial injury, such as morphological damage, abnormal heart rate, serum ANP, and serum LDH induced by PSD. Further study disclosed that KXS reversed the expressions of proteins involved in ferroptosis such as TFRC, SLC7A11/xCT, GPX-4, ACSL4, and FTH1 in hippocampus and heart tissues. Conclusions: KXS improved learning and memory of mice with REM sleep deprivation, which was closely associated with suppressed ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons and myocardiocytes.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Moutan cortex (MC), the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa Anderws (Paeoniaceae), has been historically employed in traditional herbal medicine for addressing women 's ailments by replenishing kidney Yin. Aim of the study: We aimed to explore if paeonol, an active constituent of MC, could ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairments, associated with post -menopausal syndrome (PMS) in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model. Materials and methods: The experimental design comprised 6 groups, including a sham group, OVX group, paeonol administration groups (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.), and an estradiol (E2) -treated positive control group. Behavioral tests including the open field, novel object recognition, Y -maze, elevated plus -maze, splash, and forced swimming tests were conducted. In addition, we investigated the effets of paeonol on the phosphorylated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as on the expression levels of G protein -coupled receptor (GPR30) and brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Results: Paeonol treatment (10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) effectively reversed the cognitive decline in OVX mice, measured by the novel object recognition and Y -maze tests, similar to that in the positive control group. Additionally, it alleviated anxiety- and depressive -like behaviors, as evaluated by the elevated plus -maze test, splash test, and forced swimming test. Paeonol restored GPR30 expression levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, mirroring the effects of E2 administration. Furthermore, it reversed the reduced expression levels of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and increased BDNF expression in the hippocampus of OVX mice. Conclusion: This research suggests that paeonol would be beneficial for alleviating PMS-associated cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression.

AB  - Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Folic acid has a protective effect on diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte damage. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of folic acid on cardiomyocytes cultured under high glucose and fat (HGF) conditions and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the potential drugs through the Drug-Gene Interaction database. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were cultured with 30 mM glucose and 500 nM palmitic acid in the presence or absence of folic acid or YAP1 inhibitor (verteporfin) or YAP1 siRNA. The cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured using specific assay kits. Pyroptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. The NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR and that the proteins expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1 (p10), caspase-1, YAP1, p-YAP1, LATS1 and P-LATS1 were detected by Western blotting. C57BL/6 mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneally to establish a T2DM model, folic acid or PBS treatment for 8 weeks by oral gavage, blood glucose and body weight were measured every 4 weeks, mouse heart tissue was used to detect pyroptosis and hippo signaling pathway related protein expression. We identified 427 differentially expressed genes in the cardiac tissues of high fat diet + streptozotocin mice, among the 30 most significantly DEGs, folic acid was predicted to be the most likely therapeutic drug. Folic acid alleviated HGF-induced cell damage in vitro and in vivo by decreasing activation of the Hippo pathway, as indicated by lower LDH release and increased cell viability, and decreased expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1 beta, IL-18, p-YAP and p-LATS. Verteporfin or YAP1 siRNA neutralized the protective effect of folic acid by reversing YAP1-induced pyroptosis. Folic acid reduced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis by down-regulating the Hippo signaling pathway, thereby effectively reducing T2DM-induced damage in H9C2 cells and animals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Processed Nux vomica seed extracts and homeopathic medicinal preparations (HMPs) are widely used in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine for respiratory, digestive, neurological and behavioral disorders. Antioxidant property of Nux vomica is well known and recent investigation has highlighted the anticonvulsant potential of its homeopathic formulation.
   Aim of the study: To explore the anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic potential of Nux vomica HMPs (6CH, 12CH and 30CH potency) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced acute and chronic experimental seizure models in mice and investigate their effects on cognition, memory, motor activity and oxidative stress markers in kindled animals.
   Materials and methods: Acute seizures were induced in the animals through 70 mg/kg (i.p.) administration of PTZ followed by the evaluation of latency and duration of Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Subconvulsive PTZ doses (35 mg/kg, i.p.) induced kindling in 29 days, which was followed by assessment of cognition, memory and motor impairment through validated behavioral techniques. The status of oxidative stress was estimated through measurement of MDA, GSH and SOD.
   Results: HMPs delayed the latency and reduced the duration of GTCS in acute model signifying possible regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission. Kindling was significantly hindered by the HMPs that justified the ameliorated cognition, memory and motor activity impairment. The HMPs attenuated lipid peroxidation by reducing MDA level and strengthened the antioxidant mechanism by enhancing the GSH and SOD levels in the kindled animals.
   Conclusions: Nux vomica HMPs showed anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic potency in acute and chronic models of epilepsy. The test drugs attenuated behavioral impairment and reduced the oxidative stress against PTZ induced kindling owing to which they can be further explored for their cellular and molecular mechanism(s).

AB  - Background: Apolipoprotein E deficiency (ApoE-/-) increases progressively iron in the liver, spleen and aortic tissues with age in mice. However, it is unknown whether ApoE affects brain iron.Methods: We investigated iron contents, expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), ferroportin 1 (Fpn1), iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), aconitase, hepcidin, A & beta;42, MAP2, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines and glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) in the brain of ApoE-/- mice.Results: We demonstrated that ApoE-/- induced a significant increase in iron, TfR1 and IRPs and a reduction in Fpn1, aconitase and hepcidin in the hippocampus and basal ganglia. We also showed that replenishment of ApoE absent partly reversed the iron-related phenotype in ApoE-/- mice at 24-months old. In addition, ApoE-/induced a significant increase in A & beta;42, MDA, 8-isoprostane, IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, and TNF & alpha; and a reduction in MAP2 and Gpx4 in hippocampus, basal ganglia and/or cortex of mice at 24-months old.Conclusions: Our findings implied that ApoE is required for brain iron homeostasis and ApoE-/--induced increase in brain iron is due to the increased IRP/TfR1-mediated cell-iron uptake as well as the reduced IRP/Fpn1 associated cell-iron export and suggested that ApoE-/- induced neuronal injury resulted mainly from the increased iron and subsequently ROS, inflammation and ferroptosis.

AB  - Objective. A large amount of evidence shows that the abnormal expression of miRNA plays an important role in the development of depression. Therefore, we investigated the effect of miR-124-3p on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of depression rats. Methods. The target genes of miR-124-3p were predicted by the database; the depression model was prepared by subcutaneous injection of corticosterone (CORT), and LV-miR-124-3p asponge lentiviral suspension was given to determine the weight of rats and open-field test, sugar preference experiment, Serum CORT, 5-HT, DA, and NE were measured, observe and record the behavior of rats, including behavior, diet, and hair. The expression of miR-124-3p, STAT3, Bcl-2, and Bax in rat hippocampus was measured. The rat hippocampal neuron cells were extracted and transfected with miR-124-3p inhibitor; the cells were cultured with CORT, and the cell survival rate was evaluated by MTT experiment, and the expressions of miR-124-3p, STAT3, Bcl-2, and Bax in the cells were detected. Luciferase reporter gene verifies the targeted regulation of miR-124-3p on STAT3. Results. Compared with depression rats, silencing miR-124-3p increased the weight of the rats, increased the number of open-field activities, and significantly improved the general state and pathological state of the rats. The sugar water preference rate was significantly increased, the CORT content in the serum of rats decreased significantly, and the levels of 5-HT, DA, and NE increased significantly. After the treatment of silencing miR-124-3p, the expression level of miR-124-3p was decreased, while the STAT3 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased. And the protein and mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 were increased, and the Bax protein and mRNA expression were decreased. Cell experiments verified that silencing miR-124-3p increased cell survival, the expression level of miR-124-3p decreased remarkably, while the expression levels of STAT3 mRNA and protein increased significantly. Silencing miR-124-3p reversed the effects of CORT treatment on miR-124-3p and STAT3 in neuronal cells. The luciferase reporter gene experiment confirmed that miR-124-3p targets and regulates STAT3 expression. Conclusion. Silencing miR-124-3p may protect hippocampal neurons from damage in depression rats by upregulating STAT3 gene.

AB  - Background: The liver is renowned for its remarkable regenerative capacity to restore its structure, size and function after various types of liver injury. However, in patients with end-stage liver disease, the regenerative capacity is inhibited and liver transplantation is the only option. Considering the limitations of liver transplantation, promoting liver regeneration is suggested as a new therapeutic strategy for liver disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of preventing and treating various liver diseases, and some of them have been proven to be effective in promoting liver regeneration, suggesting the therapeutic potential in liver diseases.
   Purpose: This review aims to summarize the molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration and the pro-regenerative activity and mechanism of TCM formulas, extracts and active ingredients.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases using "TCM", "liver regeneration" or their synonyms as keywords, and classified and summarized the retrieved literature. The PRISMA guidelines were followed.
   Results: Forty-one research articles met the themes of this review and previous critical studies were also reviewed to provide essential background information. Current evidences indicate that various TCM formulas, extracts and active ingredients have the effect on stimulating liver regeneration through modulating JAK/STAT, Hippo, PI3K/Akt and other signaling pathways. Besides, the mechanisms of liver regeneration, the limitation of existing studies and the application prospect of TCM to promote liver regeneration are also outlined and discussed in this review.
   Conclusion: This review supports TCM as new potential therapeutic options for promoting liver regeneration and repair of the failing liver, although extensive pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies, as well as elaborate clinical trials, are still needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

AB  - Background: Various brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and major depressive disorders, threaten an increasing number of patients. Seabuckthorn, a fruit from Hippophae rhamnoides L., is an example of "medicine food homology". The fruit has enriched flavonoids that reported to have benefits in treating cognitive disorders. However, the studies on potential functions of Seabuckthorn and/or its flavonoid-enriched fraction in treating neurodegenerative disorders are limited.
   Purpose: This study aimed to determine the ability and mechanism of the flavonoid-enriched fraction of Sea-buckthorn (named as SBF) in mimicking the neurotrophic functions in inducing neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons.
   Methods: Cultured PC12 cell line, SH-SY5Y cell line and primary neurons (cortical and hippocampal neurons isolated from E17-19 SD rat embryos) were the employed models to evaluate SBF in inducing neurite outgrowth by comparing to the effects of NGF and BDNF. Immuno-fluorescence staining was applied to identify the morphological change during the neuronal differentiation. Luciferase assay was utilized for analyzing the transcriptional regulation of neurofilaments and cAMP/CREB-mediated gene. Western blot assay was conducted to demonstrate the expressions of neurofilaments and phosphorylated proteins.
   Results: The application of SBF induced neuronal cell differentiation, and this differentiating activation was blocked by the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways. Additionally, SBF showed synergy with neurotrophic factors in stimulating the neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons. Moreover, the major flavonoids within SBF, i.e., isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol, could account for the neurotrophic activities of SBF.
   Conclusion: Seabuckthorn flavonoids mimicked neurotrophic functions in inducing neuronal cell differentiation via activating PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways. The results suggest the beneficial functions of Seabuckthorn as a potential health food supplement in treating various brain disorders, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The classic surfactant proteins (SPs) A, B, C, and D were discovered in the lungs, where they contribute to host defense and regulate the alveolar surface tension during breathing. Their additional importance for brain physiology was discovered decades later. SP-G, a novel amphiphilic SP, was then identified in the lungs and is mostly linked to inflammation. In the brain, it is also present and significantly elevated after hemorrhage in premature infants and in distinct conditions affecting the cerebrospinal fluid circulation of adults. However, current knowledge on SP-G-expression is limited to ependymal cells and some neurons in the subventricular and superficial cortex. Therefore, we primarily focused on the distribution of SP-G-immunoreactivity (ir) and its spatial relationships with components of the neurovascular unit in murine forebrains. Triple fluorescence labeling elucidated SP-G-co-expressing neurons in the habenula, infundibulum, and hypothalamus. Exploring whether SP-G might play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3xTg-AD mice were investigated and displayed age-dependent hippocampal deposits of beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau separately from clustered, SP-G-containing dots with additional Reelin-ir-which was used as established marker for disease progression in this specific context. Semi-quantification of those dots, together with immunoassay-based quantification of intra- and extracellular SP-G, revealed a significant elevation in old 3xTg mice when compared to age-matched wildtype animals. This suggests a role of SP-G for the pathophysiology of AD, but a confirmation with human samples is required.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevancy Zexieyin formula (ZXYF) has been identified to have therapeutic actions of atherosclerosis (AS). It's unknown that whether ZXYF has therapeutic potential of atherosclerosis (AS) with cognitive impairment (CI) and its underlying mechanisms. Aim of the study To elucidate therapeutic effect of ZXYF for AS with CI as well as its underlying mechanisms in AS with CI mice model. Methods and materials To establish AS with CI model, we fed ApoE(-/-) mice with high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Oil red O staining (ORO) and Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) were used to detect aortic plaque area. Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze were used to measure cognitive function and cognitive improvement after administration of ZXYF and atorvastatin (ATO). Network pharmacology was used to screen for potential mechanisms for improving cognitive function. Western blot was used to detect expressions of MAPK, A beta and synaptic proteins in hippocampus. Results HFD caused and accelerated the AS in ApoE(-/-) mice, while it was easier able to produce CI than normal mice. Administration of ZXYF or ATO for 8 weeks significantly reduced aortic plaque area in ORO and HE tests, and improved cognitive abilities in MWM and Y-maze tests. Network pharmacology results showed that MAPK or synaptic proteins were highly associated with CI. HFD contributed to abnormal expressions of MAPK (pERK, pP38, pJNK), NF-kB, synaptic proteins (PSD95, synapsin1) and beta-amyloid (A beta) in hippocampus, which were all reversed by ZXYF. However, ERK and PSD95 expressions were not reversed by ATO in hippocampus. Conclusions ZXYF mitigated AS, further alleviating CI by modulating MAPK signaling, relating to synaptic proteins enhancing and A beta protein decreasing in the hippocampus. This study firstly lit up the new clinical application of ZXYF, which might promote the use of ZXYF in AS and CI patients.

AB  - Background: Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu pills was originally recorded in the Tibetan medical book Si Bu Yi Dian in the 8th century AD and is now included in the Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China (2020) . The pills can calm the nerves and open the mind as well as treat cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, stroke, hemiplegia. However, its quality standards have not yet been established, and the therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemia by regulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway has not been elucidated. Study design and methods: LC -MS was used to establish quality standards for Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu pills. Metabonomics, molecular docking, neuroethology, cerebral infarction ratio, pathological detection of diencephalon, cortex, and hippocampus, and molecular biology techniques were used to reveal the mechanism of the pills in regulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway to treat cerebral ischemia. Results: The contents of 20 chemical components in Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu pills from 12 batches and 8 manufacturers was determined for the first time. Eleven differential metabolites and three metabolic pathways, namely, fructose and mannose metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and purine metabolism, were identified by metabonomics. The pills improved the neuroethology abnormalities of MCAO rats and the pathological damage in the diencephalon and decreased the ratio of cerebral infarction. It also significantly reduced the mRNA expression of AIF, Apaf-1, cleared caspase8, CytC, and P53 mRNA in the brain tissue and the protein expression of Apaf-1 and CYTC and increased the protein expression of NDRG4. Conclusion: In vitro quantitative analysis of the in vitro chemical components of Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu pills has laid the foundation for improving its quality control. The potential mechanism of the pills in treating cerebral ischemia may be related to the Apaf-1/CYTC/NDRG4 apoptosis pathway. This work provides guidance for clinical drug use for patients.

AB  - Benzodiazepine (BZD) abuse is a global problem, including pregnant women. For this population, the drug of choice is usually alprazolam, which acts as a GABAergic agonist and may compromise the development of integrative areas of the nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. In this context, we studied the changes in the DG of the offspring of rats treated with alprazolam during gestation: control, treatment 1 (T1: 1.25 mg/animal), and an overdose group (T2: 30 mg/animal). Alprazolam was administered orally ten days before mating and during the gestational period. After birth, newborns were counted, sexed, and the body mass of each pup was measured. The newborns' brains were extracted and processed for morphological study of the DG or for total protein extraction of the hippocampus. The results showed that alprazolam can affect the cell number and area, and increased euchromatin in both granular and molecular layers of the DG, especially in the overdose group. Also, alprazolam upregulated the NF-kappa B and reduced GFAP and caspase-3. Based on our find-ings, we conclude that the DG is a plausible region of influence by BZDs during embryogenesis. An overdose during gestation may cause structural changes in the DG.

AB  - Purpose This study was carried out to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in naturally diseased Dromedary camels in Dammam, Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. The detection of Trypanosoma evansi was performed using the parasitological, serological, and molecular diagnosis and a comparison between such methods were analyzed. In addition, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of selected antitrypanosomal drugs, cymelarsan and quinapyrmine (aquin-1.5), was trialed for treatment of diagnosed infected cases.Methods A total 350 randomly selected camels were evaluated using thin blood smear (TBS), RoTat1.2 PCR and CATT/T. evansi techniques.Results The total prevalence was 6.9%, 7.7%, and 32.8% by TBS, RoTat1.2 PCR and CATT/T. evansi techniques, respectively. Although PCR detect T. evansi in more samples than TBS, the agreement was good (K = 0.9). Among the CATT/T. evansi results, PCR detect T. evansi in 12 and 15 CATT positive and negative camels, respectively, with low agreement (Kappa = 0.1). The use of cymelarsan and quinapyramine sulfate in the treatment of naturally infected cases demonstrated a very efficient therapeutic response.Conclusion It was found that1. Comparing the CATT/T. evansi and PCR results, the positivity of CATT was higher than PCR detection, while the agreement was poor (K = 0.1).2. Cymelarsan and aquin-1.5 proved to be effective in the treatment of naturally infected camels, but cymelarsan presented with higher effectiveness (100%) than aquin-treated camels (83.3%). a3. The use of cymelarsan and CATT is recommended for disease treatment and control.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) induces a variable phenotype including intellectual disabilities and early development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, individuals with DS display accelerated aging that affects diverse organs, among them the brain. The Ts65Dn mouse is the most widely used model to study DS. Progressive loss of cholinergic neurons is one of the hallmarks of AD present in DS and in the Ts65Dn model. In this study, we quantify the number of cholinergic neurons in control and Ts65Dn mice, observing a general reduction in their number with age but in particular, a greater loss in old Ts65Dn mice. Increased expression of the m1 muscarinic receptor in the hippocampus counteracts this loss. Cholinergic neurons in the Ts65Dn mice display overexpression of the early expression gene c-fos and an increase in the expression of beta-galactosidase, a marker of senescence. A possible mechanism for senescence induction could be phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1 and its retention in the cytoplasm, which we are able to confirm in the Ts65Dn model. In our study, using Ts65Dn mice, we observe increased cholinergic activity, which induces a process of early senescence that culminates in the loss of these neurons.

AB  - Neurons are the largest known cells, with complex and highly polarized morphologies and consist of a cell body (soma), several dendrites, and a single axon. The establishment of polarity necessitates initial axonal outgrowth in concomitance with the addition of new membrane to the axon's plasmalemma. Axolemmal expansion occurs by exocytosis of plasmalemmal precursor vesicles primarily at the neuronal growth cone membrane. The multiprotein exocyst complex drives spatial location and specificity of vesicle fusion at plasma membrane. However, the specific participation of its different proteins on neuronal differentiation has not been fully established. In the present work we analyzed the role of Sec3, a prominent exocyst complex protein on neuronal differentiation. Using mice hippocampal primary cultures, we determined that Sec3 is expressed in neurons at early stages prior to neuronal polarization. Furthermore, we determined that silencing of Sec3 in mice hippocampal neurons in culture precluded polarization. Moreover, using in utero electroporation experiments, we determined that Sec3 knockdown affected cortical neurons migration and morphology during neocortex formation. Our results demonstrate that the exocyst complex protein Sec3 plays an important role in axon formation in neuronal differentiation and the migration of neuronal progenitors during cortex development.

AB  - Tea flower polysaccharides (TFPS) have prominent anti-aging effect. In this study, we used an animal model of aging induced by d-galactose in mice to investigate the effect of TFPS on reducing inflammatory factors, lowering oxidative stress levels, and inhibiting oxidative damage to microglia from the perspective of regulating gut microbiota. The results showed that TFPS could improve the homeostasis of gut microbiota in aging mice, reduce the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota, and significantly increase the abundance of Lactobacillus. At the same time, TFPS reduced the excessive activation of hippocampal microglia in aging mice, significantly down-regulated the levels of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and POD, and reduced the content of MDA. Our research results indicate that TFPS can improve the disorder of gut microbiota, alleviate oxidative damage to glial cells, alleviate neuroinflammation, and play a role in delaying aging.

AB  - Background: The caffeine content of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) can counteract the anti-anxiety effects of L-theanine. This study aims to find out the extraction method of L-theanine and caffeine from tea leaves to obtain the highest L-theanine and the lowest caffeine content. For this purpose, L-theanine and caffeine contents from three tea types (white, black and green) were extracted under different time and temperature conditions and their levels were determined in a single high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Also, this study is the first to attempt to optimize the tea extraction conditions by maximizing the ratio of L-theanine to caffeine concentration. Results: The results show that white tea extracted for 5 min at high temperatures (90-100 degrees C) had the highest L-theanine level (21.52 mg/mL). Whereas, white tea, extracted for 5 min at low temperatures (10-11 degrees C), had negligible caffeine (0.006 mg/mL). The caffeine content was relatively high in the extracts prepared from all types of tea under high temperatures (90-100 degrees C). Whereas, caffeine level was low in tea extracted at low temperatures. The L-theanine-to-caffeine ratio was largest for white tea extracted at 10-11 degrees C for 5 min (L-theanine/caffeine ratio > 200), and this ratio was lowest (0.96) for black tea extracted at 90-100 degrees C for 30 min. Conclusion: According to these data, the temperature and time of extraction have significant effects on the amount of L-theanine and caffeine extracted from Camellia sinensis (tea). In addition, white tea drinks prepared for 5 min at 10-11 degrees C, could be recommended to people intolerant of caffeine side effects.

AB  - Aging is associated with a general decline of cognitive functions, and it is widely accepted that this decline results from changes in the expression of proteins involved in regulation of synaptic plasticity. However, several lines of evidence have accumulated that suggest that the impaired function of the aged brain may be related to significant alterations in the energy metabolism. In the current study, we employed the label-free "Total protein approach" (TPA) method to focus on the similarities and differences in energy metabolism proteomes of young (1-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) murine brains. We quantified over 7000 proteins in each of the following three analyzed brain structures: the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive quantitative proteomic description of energy metabolism pathways during the physiological aging of mice. The analysis demonstrates that aging does not significantly affect the abundance of total proteins in the studied brain structures, however, the levels of proteins constituting energy metabolism pathways differ significantly between young and aged mice.

AB  - Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in implementation of public health measures worldwide to mitigate disease spread, including; travel restrictions, lockdowns, messaging on handwashing, use of face coverings and physical distancing. As the pandemic progresses, exceptional decreases in seasonal respiratory viruses are increasingly reported. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on laboratory confirmed detection of seasonal non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses in Canada.
   Methods: Epidemiologic data were obtained from the Canadian Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System. Weekly data from the week ending 30th August 2014 until the week ending the 13(th) March 2021 were analysed. We compared trends in laboratory detection and test volumes during the 2020/2021 season with pre-pandemic seasons from 2014 to 2019.
   Findings: We observed a dramatically lower percentage of tests positive for all seasonal respiratory viruses during 2020-2021 compared to pre-pandemic seasons. For influenza A and B the percent positive decreased to 0 center dot 0 015 and 0 center dot 0028 times that of pre-pandemic levels respectively and for RSV, the percent positive dropped to 0 center dot 0169 times that of pre-pandemic levels. Ongoing detection of enterovirus/rhinovirus occurred, with regional variation in the epidemic patterns and intensity.
   Interpretation: We report an effective absence of the annual seasonal epidemic of most seasonal respiratory viruses in 2020/2021. This dramatic decrease is likely related to implementation of multi-layered public health measures during the pandemic. The impact of such measures may have relevance for public health practice in mitigating seasonal respiratory virus epidemics and for informing responses to future respiratory virus pandemics.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a general framework to select tuning parameters for the nonparametric derivative estimation. The new framework broadens the scope of the previously proposed generalized Cp$C_p$ criterion by replacing the empirical derivative with any other linear nonparametric smoother. We provide the theoretical support of the proposed derivative estimation in a random design and justify it through simulation studies. The practical application of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the study of the age effect on hippocampal gray matter volume in healthy adults from the IXI dataset and the study of the effect of age and body mass index on blood pressure from the Pima Indians dataset.

AB  - BackgroundIn our previous research, it was found that the cerebrospinal fluid had higher levels of glutamate, astrocytes were stimulated and released pro-inflammatory factors in a subarachnoid hemorrhage model. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter produced in abundance by excitatory neurons in the central nervous system, residual glutamate can cause neurotoxicity. Recent studies indicate that most glutamate is absorbed by astrocytes, to optimize neurological functions and prevent excitotoxicity. However, it is still unclear if astrocytes could be stimulated by glutamate, and the concentration range of glutamate transportable by astrocytes. Thus, further research is necessary.Methods and resultsThis study aimed to clarify these scientific questions by stimulating primary astrocytes at different glutamate concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 & mu;M) for 24 h. The results showed that glutamate induced an increased response in astrocytes, the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-& alpha; (TNF-& alpha;) and interleukin-1 & beta; (IL-1 & beta;) were upregulated in treatment groups with 50 and 100 & mu;M. Additionally, the protein expression of complement component 3 (C3) significantly increased following glutamate stimulation (50 and 100 & mu;M) for 24 h. Furthermore, the supernatant of the 100 & mu;M treatment group significantly decreased the viability of HT-22 (an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line).ConclusionsIn summary, our results indicate that increased extracellular glutamate levels can activate astrocytes and promote pro-inflammatory factor production. Moreover, the concentration range of glutamate transported by astrocytes is approximately less than 50-100 & mu;M. Therefore, our study suggests that experimental antagonization of glutamate excitotoxicity is feasible.

AB  - Purpose This study examined the metazoan ectoparasites of the Critically Endangered giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus, in the eastern Indian Ocean. Methods We screened 186 G. typus for ectoparasites in four coastal regions of Western Australia between 2020 and 2022: the Pilbara Region, Exmouth Gulf, Ningaloo Coast and Shark Bay. Results Five parasite taxa were encountered on 186 G. typus: Caligus furcisetifer (Copepoda: Caligidae), Dermopristis cairae (Monopisthocotyla: Microbothriidae), Branchellion plicobranchus and Stibarobdella macrothela (Hirudinida: Piscicolidae), and praniza larvae of unidentified gnathiid isopod/s (Isopoda: Gnathiidae). Two of these species, B. plicobranchus and S. macrothela, are reported for the first time on G. typus. Only C. furcisetifer and S. macrothela were relatively common, encountered on 31% and 40% of G. typus, respectively. Gnathiids were observed infrequently, encountered on 13% of G. typus, and D. cairae and B. plicobranchus were scarce, encountered on 1% and 2% of G. typus, respectively. Intensity of infection for C. furcisetifer and gnathiids increased with host length. Likelihood of infection varied seasonally for C. furcisetifer, being considerably lower in summer, and regionally for gnathiids, being greatest at Shark Bay. Intensity and likelihood of infection for S. macrothela increased with host length and varied regionally, being greatest at Shark Bay. Conclusion These findings improve our understanding of the downstream impacts for dependent parasites that might arise should populations of G. typus continue to decline.

AB  - The intracerebral spread of tau is a critical mechanism associated with functional decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recently, a hypothesis has emerged suggesting that tau propagation is linked to functional neuronal connections, specifically driven by neuronal hyperactivity. However, experimental validation of this hypothesis remains limited. In this study, we investigated how tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, the neuronal circuit most susceptible to tau pathology in AD, is affected by the selective stimulation of neuronal activity along this circuit. Using a mouse model of seed-induced propagation combined with optogenetics, we found that the chronic stimulation of this neuronal connection over a 4-week period resulted in a significant increase in insoluble tau accumulation in both the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, the ratio of tau accumulation in the hippocampus relative to that in the entorhinal cortex, serving as an indicator of transcellular spreading, was significantly higher in mice subjected to chronic stimulation. These results support the notion that abnormal neuronal activity promotes tau propagation, thereby implicating it in the progression of tauopathy.

AB  - Background Echinococcosis is a common health problem in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and manifests without any symptoms, even in the advanced stages. Objective The present study aimed to investigate the cell mediated-immunoregulatory milieu in rats' echinococcosis induced by three different viability status of Echinococcus granulosus especially in the semi-calcareous stage, which can be used as novel biomarkers to monitor disease progression and open the door to a deeper understanding of the pathways that could contribute to complementary echinococcosis therapies. Materials and Methods Rat infection with echinococcosis was induced by three different viable statuses of Echinococcus granulosus (G6) camel strain. During the different stages of parasitic infection, blood serum was harvested from rats containing low-, high-, and not viable (not completely transformed to the calcareous status) protoscoleces fluid. The host Th1/Th2 cytokines-mediated immune cell activation, as well as CD3/TCRE immunoregulation, and proliferation responses were investigated; especially in the semi-calcareous stage as this is the first report characterizing this stage. Results Both IFN-gamma and IL-6 levels significantly increased in the infected groups (P < 0.05), in addition, increased positive immunoreactions in splenic tissue for both CD3/TCRE and Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies. Conclusion E. granuloses infection-induced immune tolerance is involved in disease progression, and modulates the activation and regulation of host immune response, even in the early stages of infection, rather than the last stages of viability (semi-calcareous) is not neglected stage. This study is the first to report that the semi-calcareous stage causes a severe immunological response.

KW  - DYSFUNCTION
AB  - Neuroinflammation plays a dominant role in the progression of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Vitamin D has been known to have important regulatory functions in inflammation and immune response. The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is an essential inflammasome in the inflammatory response and could be activated by anesthesia and surgery. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice aged 14-16 months were given VD3 for 14 days straight before having an open tibial fracture surgery. The animals were either sacrificed to obtain the hippocampus or tested in a Morris water maze test. Western blot was employed to estimate the levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, immunohistochemistry was used to identify microglial activation, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression of IL-18 and IL-1 beta, while using the corresponding assay kits to assess ROS and MDA levels to reflect the oxidative stress status. We showed that VD3 pretreatment significantly improved surgery-induced memory and cognitive dysfunctions in aged mice, which was linked to the inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the inhibition of neuroinflammation. This finding provided a novel preventative strategy for clinically reducing postoperative cognitive impairment in elderly surgical patients. This study has some limitations. Gender differences in the effects of VD3 were not considered, and only male mice were used. Additionally, VD3 was given as a preventative measure; however, it is unknown whether it has any therapeutic benefits for POCD mice. This trial is registered with .

AB  - Learning, memory, and cognition are thought to require synaptic plasticity, specifically including hippocampal longterm potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). LTP versus LTD is induced by high-frequency stimulation versus low- frequency, but stimulating (3-adrenergic receptors ((3ARs) enables LTP induction also by low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz) or theta frequencies (similar to 5 Hz) that do not cause plasticity by themselves. In contrast to high-frequency stimulation-LTP, such (3AR-LTP requires Ca2+-flux through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, not N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors. Surprisingly, we found that (3AR-LTP still required a nonionotropic scaffolding function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor: the stimulus-induced binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMIII) to its GluN2B subunit that mediates CaMIII movement to excitatory synapses. In hippocampal neurons, (3-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (Iso) transformed LTD-type CaMIII movement to LTP-type movement, resulting in CaMIII movement to excitatory instead of inhibitory synapses. Additionally, Iso enabled induction of a major cell-biological feature of LTP in response to LTD stimuli: increased surface expression of GluA1 fused with super-ecliptic pHluorein. Like for (3AR-LTP in hippocampal slices, the Iso effects on CaMIII movement and surface expression of GluA1 fused with super- ecliptic pHluorein involved L-type Ca2+-channels and specifically required (32-ARs. Taken together, these results indicate that Iso transforms LTD stimuli to LTP signals by switching CaMIII movement and GluN2B binding to LTP mode.

AB  - Epilepsy refers to a diverse group of neurological pathologies, coupled with a significant worldwide impact. Azilsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, is broadly applied as an antihypertensive medication. Considering that the neuroprotective potential of Azilsartan has been newly documented, our work was committed to characterizing the association of Azilsartan with epilepsy and its possible mechanism. First, mice hippocampal neuron (HT-22) cells were exposed to kainic acid (KA) with or without Azilsartan treatment. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) method assessed the viability of KA-treated HT-22 cells. Flow cytometry assay was employed to detect cellular apoptotic capacity. DCF-DA fluorescent staining, JC-1 probe, and related assay kits were used to estimate mitochondrial oxidative stress. Western blotting examined the expression of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), and apoptosis-related proteins. Additionally, Sirt3 was silenced to analyze whether the protective effect of Azilsartan on KA-induced damage of HT-22 cell damage was achieved by regulating Sirt3. Results indicated that KA intervention concentration-dependently triggered the viability loss, apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage in HT-22 cells. Azilsartan treatment protected against KA-induced HT-22 cell injury by elevating the viability, reducing the apoptosis, and attenuating mitochondrial damage. Besides, Azilsartan administration activated Sirt3 and Sod2 expression in KA-stimulated HT-22 cells, and Sirt3 depletion partially blocked the impacts of Azilsartan on Sirt3/Sod2 pathway, mitochondrial damage, viability, and apoptosis in HT-22 cells exposed to KA. Collectively, Azilsartan might act as a neuroprotective agent in treating epilepsy through the activation of Sirt3/Sod2 pathway.

AB  - Dexamethasone has been widely used after various neurosurgical procedures due to its anti-inflammatory property and the abilities to restore vascular permeability, inhibit free radicals, and reduce cerebrospinal fluid production. According to the latest guidelines for the treatment of traumatic brain injury in the United States, high-dose glucocorticoids cause neurological damage. To investigate the reason why high-dose glucocorticoids after traumatic brain injury exhibit harmful effect, rat controlled cortical impact models of traumatic brain injury were established. At 1 hour and 2 days after surgery, rat models were intraperitoneally administered dexamethasone 10 mg/kg. The results revealed that 31 proteins were significantly upregulated and 12 proteins were significantly downregulated in rat models of traumatic brain injury after dexamethasone treatment. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis results showed that differentially expressed proteins were enriched in the mitochondrial dysfunction pathway and synaptogenesis signaling pathway. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry results showed that Ndufv2, Maob and Gria3 expression and positive cell count in the dexamethasone-treated group were significantly greater than those in the model group. These findings suggest that dexamethasone may promote a compensatory increase in complex I subunits (Ndufs2 and Ndufv2), increase the expression of mitochondrial enzyme Maob, and upregulate synaptic-transmission-related protein Gria3. These changes may be caused by nerve injury after traumatic brain injury treatment by dexamethasone. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee of Beijing Neurosurgical Institute (approval No. 201802001) on June 6, 2018.

AB  - Several motor, sensory, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunctions are associated with neural lesions occurring after a hypoxic injury (HI) in preterm infants. Growth hormone (GH) expression is upregulated in several brain areas when exposed to HI conditions, suggesting actions as a local neurotrophic factor. It is known that GH, either exogenous and/or locally expressed, exerts neuroprotective and regenerative actions in cerebellar neurons in response to HI. However, it is still controversial whether GH can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and if its effects are exerted directly or if they are mediated by other neurotrophic factors. Here, we found that in ovo microinjection of Cy3-labeled chicken GH resulted in a wide distribution of fluorescence within several brain areas in the chicken embryo (choroid plexus, cortex, hypothalamus, periventricular areas, hippocampus, and cerebellum) in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In the cerebellum, Cy3-GH and GH receptor (GHR) co-localized in the granular and Purkinje layers and in deep cerebellar nuclei under hypoxic conditions, suggesting direct actions. Histological analysis showed that hypoxia provoked a significant modification in the size and organization of cerebellar layers; however, GH administration restored the width of external granular layer (EGL) and molecular layer (ML) and improved the Purkinje and granular neurons survival. Additionally, GH treatment provoked a significant reduction in apoptosis and lipoperoxidation; decreased the mRNA expression of the inflammatory mediators (TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and iNOS); and upregulated the expression of several neurotrophic factors (IGF-1, VEGF, and BDNF). Interestingly, we also found an upregulation of cerebellar GH and GHR mRNA expression, which suggests the existence of an endogenous protective mechanism in response to hypoxia. Overall, the results demonstrate that, in the chicken embryo exposed to hypoxia, GH crosses the BBB and reaches the cerebellum, where it exerts antiapoptotic, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and neuroregenerative actions.

AB  - SMAD3 protein transduces signals from TGF-beta and activins. In vitro studies have shown that SMAD3 plays an important role in regulating of micoglia and astrocytic function. However, there is little information on the association between SMAD3 signaling and the pathophysiology of the glial cells in the post-ischemic hippo -campus. In this study, we examined the time-course changes in the expression and phosphorylation of SMAD3 in the rat hippocampus using a rat model of global cerebral ischemia. Most pyramidal neuronal cells in the CA1 region died within 7 days after ischemia. The number of SMAD3-or phosphorylated SMAD3 (p-SMAD3)-immunopositive microglia or astrocytes increased in the CA1 region 7 days after ischemia. Real-time PCR analysis showed an increase in the level of TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the hippocampus after ischemia. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of SB525334, a selective inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase (ALK5), reduced the ischemia-induced p-SMAD3 immunoreactivity in the microglia and astrocytes. By contrast, intra-cerebroventricular injection of SB525334 did not affect the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death. These results suggest that ischemia-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation in the microglia and astrocytes of post-ischemic hippo-campi is associated with tissue repair and not neuroprotection.

AB  - Sammy Alhassen, Siwei Chen, et al. use mouse models to examine the effects of prenatal and postnatal stress on metabolomic and transcriptomic pathways in the brain. Their results suggest that altered mitochondrial metabolism may underlie trauma-induced behavioral deficits, and that correcting metabolism with ALCAR supplementation may protect against intergenerational transmission of traumatic stress.
   Intergenerational trauma increases lifetime susceptibility to depression and other psychiatric disorders. Whether intergenerational trauma transmission is a consequence of in-utero neurodevelopmental disruptions versus early-life mother-infant interaction is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that trauma exposure during pregnancy induces in mouse offspring social deficits and depressive-like behavior. Normal pups raised by traumatized mothers exhibited similar behavioral deficits to those induced in pups raised by their biological traumatized mothers. Good caregiving by normal mothers did not reverse prenatal trauma-induced behaviors, indicating a two-hit stress mechanism comprising both in-utero abnormalities and early-life poor parenting. The behavioral deficits were associated with profound changes in the brain metabotranscriptome. Striking increases in the mitochondrial hypoxia marker and epigenetic modifier 2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the brains of neonates and adults exposed prenatally to trauma indicated mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses revealed stress- and hypoxia-response metabolic pathways in the neonates, which produced long-lasting alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism and epigenetic processes (DNA and chromatin modifications). Most strikingly, early pharmacological interventions with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) supplementation produced long-lasting protection against intergenerational trauma-induced depression.

AB  - Transient Receptor Potential Canonical 6 (TRPC6) has been suggested to be involved in synapse function and contribute to hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes. Gene silencing of TRPC6 was performed by injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing TRPC6-specific shRNA (shRNA-TRPC6) into the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Spatial learning, working memory and social recognition memory were impaired in the shRNA-TRPC6 treated mice compared to control mice after 4 weeks. In addition, gene ontology (GO) analysis of RNA-sequencing revealed that viral intervention of TRPC6 expression in DG resulted in the enrichment of the process of synaptic transmission and cellular compartment of synaptic structure. KEGG analysis showed PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, the shRNA-TRPC6 treatment reduced dendritic spines of DG granule neurons, in terms of spine loss, the thin and mushroom types predominated. Accompanying the spine loss, the levels of PSD95, pAkt and CREB in the hippocampus were decreased in the shRNA-TRPC6 treated animals. Taken together, our results suggest that knocking down TRPC6 in the DG have a disadvantageous effect on cognitive processes.

AB  - Micro-/nanotopographical cues have emerged as a practical and promising strategy for controlling cell fate and reprogramming, which play a key role as biophysical regulators in diverse cellular processes and behaviors. Extracellular biophysical factors can trigger intracellular physiological signaling via mechanotransduction and promote cellular responses such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, gene/protein expression, and differentiation. Here, we engineered a highly ordered nanowrinkled graphene oxide (GO) surface via the mechanical deformation of an ultrathin GO film on an elastomeric substrate to observe specific cellular responses based on surface-mediated topographical cues. The ultrathin GO film on the uniaxially prestrained elastomeric substrate through self-assembly and subsequent compressive force produced GO nanowrinkles with periodic amplitude. To examine the acute cellular behaviors on the GO-based cell interface with nanostructured arrays of wrinkles, we cultured L929 fibroblasts and HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. As a result, our developed cell-culture substrate obviously provided a directional guidance effect. In addition, based on the observed results, we adapted a deep learning (DL)-based data processing technique to precisely interpret the cell behaviors on the nanowrinkled GO surfaces. According to the learning/transfer learning protocol of the DL network, we detected cell boundaries, elongation, and orientation and quantitatively evaluated cell velocity, traveling distance, displacement, and orientation. The presented experimental results have intriguing implications such that the nanotopographical microenvironment could engineer the living cells' morphological polarization to assemble them into useful tissue chips consisting of multiple cell types.

AB  - Diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear and no effective therapeutic interventions exist. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that mitochondrial defects are a key feature of diabetes contributing to neurodegenerative events. It has also been demonstrated that the putative tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase 1 (WWOX) can interact with mitochondria in several pathological conditions. However, its role in diabetes-associated neurodegeneration remains unknown. So, this study aimed to evaluate the role of WWOX activation in high glucose-induced neuronal damage and death. Our experiments were mainly performed in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to high glucose and treated (or not) with Zfra1-31, the specific inhibitor of WWOX. Several parameters were analyzed namely cell viability, WWOX activation (tyrosine 33 residue phosphorylation), mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, biogenesis, and dynamics, autophagy and oxidative stress/damage. The levels of the neurotoxic proteins amyloid beta (A beta) and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) and of synaptic integrity markers were also evaluated. We observed that high glucose increased the levels of activated WWOX. Interestingly, brain cortical and hippocampal homogenates from young (6-month old) diabetic GK rats showed increased levels of activated WWOX compared to older GK rats (12-month old) suggesting that WWOX plays an early role in the diabetic brain. In neuronal cells, high glucose impaired mitochondrial respiration, dynamics and biogenesis, increased mitochondrial ROS production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. More, high glucose augmented oxidative stress/damage and the levels of A beta and pTau proteins and affected autophagy, contributing to the loss of synaptic integrity and cell death. Of note, the activation of WWOX preceded mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Importantly, the inhibition of WWOX with Zfra1-31 reversed, totally or partially, the alterations promoted by high glucose. Altogether our observations demonstrate that under high glucose conditions WWOX activation contributes to mitochondrial anomalies and neuronal damage and death, which suggests that WWOX is a potential therapeutic target for early interventions. Our findings also support the efficacy of Zfra1-31 in treating hyperglycemia/diabetes-associated neurodegeneration.

AB  - Dietary advanced glycation end-products (dAGEs) contained in high-sugar/fat and ultra-processed foods of the "Western diet" (WD) pattern predispose to several diseases by altering protein function or increasing oxidative stress and inflammation via RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products). Although elevated endogenous AGEs are associated with loss of muscle mass and functionality (i.e., muscle wasting; MW), the impact of dAGEs on MW has not been elucidated. Here, we show that the most common dAGEs or their precursor, methylglyoxal (MGO), induce C2C12 myotube atrophy as endogenous AGE-derived BSA. ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome activation, and inhibition of myogenic potential are common atrophying mechanisms used by MGO and AGE-BSA. Although of different origins, ROS are mainly responsible for AGE-induced myotube atrophy. However, while AGE-BSA activates the RAGE-myogenin axis, reduces anabolic mTOR, and causes mitochondrial damage, MGO induces glycolytic stress and STAT3 activation without affecting RAGE expression. Among thirty selected natural compounds, Vaccinium macrocarpon (VM), Camellia sinensis, and chlorophyll showed a surprising ability in counteracting in vitro AGE formation. However, only the standardized VM, containing anti-glycative metabolites as revealed by UHPLC-HRMS analysis, abrogates AGE-induced myotube atrophy. Collectively, our data suggest that WD-linked dAGE consumption predisposes to MW, which might be restricted by VM food supplements.

AB  - Oviductus ranae (OR) is an animal-based traditional Chinese medicine. In this work, its underlying mechanism of action in mice model of perimenopausal depression (PMD) was investigated. Network pharmacology and molecule docking analysis were conducted to idetify potential targets and chemical components of OR in IP: 217.163.118.10 On: Tue, 18 Apr 2023 14:03:20 PMD. Subsequently, 60 female mice were ovariectomized ad subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress Copyright: American Sc entif c Publishers to establish the PMD model. After 14 days of OR administration on PMD mice, the depression-like behavioral Delivered by Ingenta were evaluated using sucrose preference, forced swimming, tail suspension, open field and morris water maze tests. Hippocampal tissues were collected to observe pathological changes via haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect the expression of the protein kinase B (AKT), phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and oestrogen receptor (3 (ER(3). Western blot (WB) analysis was Conducted to detect the expression of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. In the results, 18 potential targets and two chemical components of OR in PMD were identified. KEGG suggested that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was frequently involved in treatment of PMD with OR. Molecular docking showed that (3-sitosterol in OR had the best docking effect with the target. OR treatment improved depression-like behaviour of PMD mice, significantly improved pPI3K/PI3K, pAKT/AKT, and pCREB/CREB ratios and brain derived neurotrophic factor. These findings suggested that OR may alleviate PMD and increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and has a certain therapeutic effect on PMD by up-regulating the expression of ER(3 and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Overall, our study highlights OR as a promising therapeutic candidate for PMD.

AB  - Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play an important role in the development, maintenance, and function of the brain. Dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs in neurological diseases has been a subject of particular interest in preventing cognitive deficits, and particularly in age-related neurodegeneration. Developing strategies for the efficient delivery of these lipids to the brain has presented a challenge in recent years. We recently reported the preparation of n-3 PUFA-rich nanoliposomes (NLs) from salmon lecithin, and demonstrated their neurotrophic effects in rat embryo cortical neurons. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of these NLs to deliver PUFAs in cellulo and in vivo (in mice). NLs were prepared using salmon lecithin rich in n-3 PUFAs (29.13%), and characterized with an average size of 107.90 & PLUSMN; 0.35 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.25 & PLUSMN; 0.01, and a negative particle-surface electrical charge (-50.4 & PLUSMN; 0.2 mV). Incubation of rat embryo cortical neurons with NLs led to a significant increase in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (51.5%, p < 0.01), as well as palmitic acid, and a small decrease in oleic acid after 72 h (12.2%, p < 0.05). Twenty mice on a standard diet received oral administration of NLs (12 mg/mouse/day; 5 days per week) for 8 weeks. Fatty acid profiles obtained via gas chromatography revealed significant increases in cortical levels of saturated, monounsaturated, and n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid,) and n-6 (docosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid) PUFAs. This was not the case for the hippocampus or in the liver. There were no effects on plasma lipid levels, and daily monitoring confirmed NL biocompatibility. These results demonstrate that NLs can be used for delivery of PUFAs to the brain. This study opens new research possibilities in the development of preventive as well as therapeutic strategies for age-related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Sucrose consumption impairs behavioral and cognitive functions that correlate with decreased neurogenesis in animal models. When consumed during early adolescence, this disaccharide promotes anxious and depressive behaviors, along with a reduction in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Data concerning sucrose consumption during late adolescence are lacking, and the effect of sucrose intake on the ventral dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (which modulates anxiety and depression) remains elusive. Here, we tested whether sucrose intake during late adolescence causes anxiety or impaired neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus. Rats did not display anxiety-like behaviors neither at the light-dark box test nor at the open field exploration. However, there was a significant increase in proliferative cells in the subgranular zone of the ventral dentate gyrus in rats exposed to sucrose (p < 0.05). This increased proliferation corresponded to neural stem cells (Radial Type 1 cells) in the group exposed to sucrose until adulthood but was not present in rats exposed to sucrose only during late adolescence. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases was increased in the hippocampi of rats exposed to sucrose only during late adolescence, suggesting that the increased proliferation in this group could be mediated by the MAPK pathway. On the other hand, although no differences were found in the number of immature granular neurons, we observed more immature granular neurons with impaired dendritic orientation in both groups exposed to sucrose. Finally, GAD65/67 and BCL2 levels did not change between groups, suggesting an unaltered hippocampal GABAergic system and similar apoptosis, respectively. This information provides the first piece of evidence of how sucrose intake, starting in late adolescence, impacts ventral dentate gyrus neurogenesis and contributes to a better understanding of the effects of this carbohydrate on the brain at postnatal stages.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorderthataffects a large portion of the population, with dysregulation of theserotonergic system, which is deeply involved in both the pathophysiologyof MDD and mechanism of action of many antidepressants. Current pharmacologicaltherapies do not meet the neurobiological needs of all depressed individuals,making the development of new antidepressants necessary. In recentdecades, compounds containing triazoles have become promising dueto their range of biological activities, including antidepressantactivity. In this study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effectof a hybrid containing triazole and acetophenone, 1-(2-(4-(4-ethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)ethan-1-one (ETAP) (0.5-5mg/kg), in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test(TST) in mice, as well as the involvement of the serotonergic systemin this effect. Our findings demonstrated that ETAP exhibited an antidepressant-likeeffect from the dose of 1 mg/kg and that this effect is modulatedby 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT4 receptors. We also demonstratedthat this effect may be related to inhibition of monoamine oxidaseA activity in the hippocampus. Additionally, we evaluated the in silico pharmacokinetic profile of ETAP, which predictedits penetration into the central nervous system. ETAP exhibited alow potential for toxicity at a high dose, making this molecule interestingfor the development of a new therapeutic strategy for MDD.

AB  - Loss of function in transport protein particles (TRAPP) links a new set of emerging genetic disorders called "TRAPPopathies". One such disorder is NIBP syndrome, characterized by microcephaly and intellectual disability, and caused by mutations of NIBP/TRAPPC9, a crucial and unique member of TRAPPII. To investigate the neural cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying microcephaly, we developed Nibp/Trappc9-deficient animal models using different techniques, including morpholino knockdown and CRISPR/Cas mutation in zebrafish and Cre/LoxP-mediated gene targeting in mice. Nibp/Trappc9 deficiency impaired the stability of the TRAPPII complex at actin filaments and microtubules of neurites and growth cones. This deficiency also impaired elongation and branching of neuronal dendrites and axons, without significant effects on neurite initiation or neural cell number/types in embryonic and adult brains. The positive correlation of TRAPPII stability and neurite elongation/branching suggests a potential role for TRAPPII in regulating neurite morphology. These results provide novel genetic/molecular evidence to define patients with a type of non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability and highlight the importance of developing therapeutic approaches targeting the TRAPPII complex to cure TRAPPopathies.

AB  - Simple Summary Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is one of the diseases caused by bovine herpesvirus type 1; it affects cattle and can heavily damage the livestock industry. Several countries have adopted different prevention measures, and some of them have been declared free from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Our work is focused on data collected in the autonomous province of Bolzano (Italy). This province underwent an eradication program between 1991 and 2000. In 2000, the territory was declared IBR-free. Since 2001, a post-eradication program has been conducted, which includes annual milk testing. If a positive result is found, additional blood tests are performed. During the several years of the post-eradication program, positive results were detected in bulk milk and serum samples; our hypothesis is that these positive results are potentially caused by bovine herpesvirus type 2 cross-reactivity.Abstract Bovine alphaherpesviruses, BoAHV, can cause respiratory, genital and neurological disorders. In particular, bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1 (BoAHV1) is one of the most significant ruminant pathogens worldwide and it can heavily damage the livestock industry. BoAHV1 can cause infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) along with fertility disorders. Bovine alphaherpesvirus type 2 (BoAHV2) can cause two different conditions as well: pseudo-lumpy skin disease (PSLD) and bovine herpetic mammillitis (BHM). The autonomous province of Bolzano (Italy) has adopted several strategies to control and eradicate IBR, and it was declared in 2000 to be IBR-free by the European Commission. Since 2001, a post-eradication monitoring program has overseen the serological analysis of bulk milk and, in the presence of a positive result, a follow-up examination is performed on the individual blood serum of all bovines older than 24 months that belong to bulk milk-positive herds. Despite the detection of positives in both bulk milk and serum samples, South Tyrol has been declared IBR-free, as these positives have never been confirmed through seroneutralization. Between 2014 and 2022, approximately 41,000 bulk milk (averaging 4300 samples/year) and 3229 serum samples were tested for BoAHV1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-eradication program for IBR with a particular focus on the potential cross-reactivity with BoAHV2; for this reason, serum samples were also tested for BoAHV2 antibodies. This study could be of great importance for those countries that submit herds to an IBR monitoring and eradication program; performing further analyses to confirm and explain false positive outcomes would increase the reliability of the obtained results.

AB  - Simple Summary Given the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), there is a high chance that some of these patients can develop acute life-threatening events such as stroke. Our aim was to understand if the use of Cerebrolysin could be an option for stroke patients with altered liver enzymes levels. We also wanted to evaluate whether the treatment could reverse the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice receiving methionine/clonidine deficiency (MCD) food. Cerebrolysin proved safe for clinical use in stroke patients with liver damage, although it could not reverse the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis to mice fed MCD. The treatment of acute life-threatening events in patients suffering from chronic pathologies is problematic, as physicians need to consider multisystemic drug effects. Regarding Cerebrolysin, a Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway amplifier and one of the few approved neurotrophic treatments for stroke patients, concerns of excessive Hedgehog pathway activation that could accelerate NAFLD progression to cirrhosis seem valid. We investigated stroke patients treated with Cerebrolysin that presented elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT). We also investigated the efficiency of Cerebrolysin in reversing the neurogenesis inhibition within the hippocampus in a mouse model of NAFLD by evaluating behavior and histological outcomes. NeuN, BrdU and Iba1 positive signals in the cortex and hippocampus of the animals were also observed. Clinically, Cerebrolysin improved AST levels in a majority of stroke patients with hepatic damage. The same treatment in an experimental setup was able to reverse anxiety-like behavior in MCD mice, reducing their freezing time from 333.61 +/- 21.81 s in MCD animals to 229.17 +/- 26.28 in treated ones. The use of Cerebrolysin did not improve short-term memory nor rescued cell multiplication in the hippocampus after MCD food intake. Understanding the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects that drugs have on NAFLD patients can significantly contribute to a suitable therapeutic approach.

AB  - ObjectivesThis study aimed to elucidate the effects of Gentiopicroside (Gent) on epileptogenesis and underlying mechanisms. MethodsThe status epilepticus (SE) model was established by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lithium chloride (127 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (50 mg/kg) in immature rats. HAPI microglial cellular inflammation model was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mu g/ml) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 5 mM). The differential concentrations of Gent were used to pretreat animal (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) and model cells (50, 100, and 200 mu M). Epileptic discharges were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and Racine scale. Changes in spatial memory function were measured using the Morris water maze task test. Nissl and FJB staining were employed to assess the damage to hippocampus tissues. ELISA was used to detect the production of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha. The expressions of P2X7R and NLRP3 were detected by q-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot, and cell viability was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). ResultsLithium chloride and pilocarpine (LICL-PILO) induced abnormal EEG activities, behavioral alterations, brain damage, and inflammatory responses in immature rats. However, Gent pretreatment significantly reduced the neuronal damage and spatial memory dysfunction induced by LICL-PILO. Additionally, Gent suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the expression of P2X7R, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 in LPS/ATP-induced HAPI microglial cells. DiscussionGent intervention could improve epileptogenesis in immature rats partially due to suppressing P2X7R and NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive impairment characterized by memory loss and cognitive inflexi-bility. Recent studies have revealed that ChemR23 is implicated in both diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's dis-ease. However, the impact of ChemR23 on diabetes-associated cognitive impairment remains elusive. In this study, we explored the longitudinal changes of ChemR23 expression and cognitive function in STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice and leptin receptor knockout type 2 diabetic mice at different ages. We also treated diabetic mice with ChemR23 agonists RvE1 or chemerin-9 to explore whether ChemR23 activation could alleviate diabetes -associated cognitive impairment. The underlying mechanism was further investigated in diabetic mice with genetic deletion of ChemR23. The results showed that ChemR23 expression was decreased along with aging and the progression of diabetes, suggesting that abnormal ChemR23 signaling may be involved in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Administration of RvE1 or chemerin-9 ameliorated oxidative stress and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation through Nrf2/TXNIP pathway, and ultimately alleviated cognitive impairment in diabetic mice. Depletion of ChemR23 in diabetic mice abolished the beneficial effects of RvE1 and chemerin-9, and exacerbated cognitive impairment via increasing oxidative stress and activating NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our data highlight the crucial role of ChemR23 signaling in diabetes-associated cognitive impair-ment via regulating oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, and targeting ChemR23 may serve as a promising novel strategy for the treatment of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Alcohol-use-disorders are chronic relapsing illnesses, often co-morbid with anxiety. We have previously shown using the "drinking-in-the-dark" model in mice that the stimulation of the serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) reduces ethanol binge-drinking behaviour and withdrawal-induced anxiety. The 5-HT1A receptor is located either on Raphe neurons as autoreceptors, or on target neurons as heteroreceptors. By combining a pharmacological approach with biased agonists targeting the 5-HT1A auto- or heteroreceptor and a chemogenetic approach (DREADDs), here we identified that ethanol-binge drinking behaviour is dependent on 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT neuronal function, with a transition from DRN-dependent regulation of short-term (6 weeks) ethanol intake, to MRN-dependent regulation after longer ethanol exposure (12 weeks). We further identified a serotonergic microcircuit (5-HTMRN -> DG) originating from the MRN and projecting to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, that is specifically affected by, and modulates long-term ethanol consumption. The present study indicates that targeting Raphe nuclei 5-HT1A autoreceptors with agonists might represent an innovative pharmacotherapeutic strategy to combat alcohol abuse.

AB  - Simple Summary A significant percentage of Dutch partridge dogs suffers from epileptic seizures. Previous studies indicated that this is likely the result of genetic idiopathic epilepsy, but to date, little to no knowledge exists on the genetic cause. This study aimed to identify (a) causal variant(s) and/or risk loci associated with the disease. A risk locus for idiopathic epilepsy was described for the first time on chromosome 12. Furthermore, a variant in the CCDC85A gene was found to increase the risk of disease in homozygous variant dogs. Further research should be conducted to determine whether the chromosome 12 risk locus and CCDC85A variant can be used in breeding decisions. (1) Idiopathic epilepsy (IE) is thought to have a genetic cause in several dog breeds. However, only two causal variants have been identified to date, and few risk loci are known. No genetic studies have been conducted on IE in the Dutch partridge dog (DPD), and little has been reported on the epileptic phenotype in this breed. (2) Owner-filled questionnaires and diagnostic investigations were used to characterize IE in the DPD. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 16 cases and 43 controls was performed, followed by sequencing of the coding sequence and splice site regions of a candidate gene within the associated region. Subsequent whole-exome sequencing (WES) of one family (including one IE-affected dog, both parents, and an IE-free sibling) was performed. (3) IE in the DPD has a broad range in terms of age at onset, frequency, and duration of epileptic seizures. Most dogs showed focal epileptic seizures evolving into generalized seizures. A new risk locus on chromosome 12 (BICF2G630119560; p(raw) = 4.4 x 10(-7); p(adj) = 0.043) was identified through GWAS. Sequencing of the GRIK2 candidate gene revealed no variants of interest. No WES variants were located within the associated GWAS region. However, a variant in CCDC85A (chromosome 10; XM_038680630.1: c.689C > T) was discovered, and dogs homozygous for the variant (T/T) had an increased risk of developing IE (OR: 6.0; 95% CI: 1.6-22.6). This variant was identified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. (4) Further research is necessary before the risk locus or CCDC85A variant can be used for breeding decisions.

AB  - Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal-hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in . We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.

AB  - In this study, we examine the plant-herbivore discrete model of apple twig borer and grape vine interaction, with a particular emphasis on the extended weak-predator response to Holling type-II response. We explore the dynamical and qualitative analysis of this model and investigate the conditions for stability and bifurcation. Our study demonstrates the presence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at the interior equilibrium and the transcritical bifurcation at the trivial equilibrium, both of which have biological feasibility. To avoid unpredictable outcomes due to bifurcation, we employ chaos control methods. Furthermore, to support our theoretical and mathematical findings, we develop numerical simulation techniques with examples. In summary, our research enhances the comprehension of the dynamics pertaining to interactions between plants and herbivores in the context of discrete-time population models.

AB  - After the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December, the cases of Covid-19 have spiralled out around the globe. Due to the clinical similarity of Covid-19 with other flulike syndromes, patients are assayed for other pathogens of influenza like illness. There have been reported cases of co -infection amongst patients with Covid-19. Bacteria for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila etc and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus etc are identified as co-pathogens. In our current effort, we develop and analysed a compartmental based Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) type mathematical model to understand the co-infection dynamics of Covid-19 and other influenza type illness. In this work we have incorporated the saturated treatment rate to take account of the impact of limited treatment resources to control the possible Covid-19 cases. As results, we formulate the basic reproduction number of the model system. Finally, we have performed numerical simulations of the co-infection model to examine the solutions in different zones of parameter space.

AB  - The segregation of trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass in early embryos is driven primarily by the transcription factor CDX2. The signals that trigger CDX2 activation are, however, less clear. In mouse embryos, the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is important for the activation of CDX2 expression; it is less clear whether this relationship is conserved in other mammals. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been reported to increase YAP levels by inhibiting its degradation. In this study, we cultured bovine embryos in the presence of LPA and examined changes in gene and protein expression. LPA was found to accelerate the onset of blastocyst formation on days 5 and 6, without changing the TE/inner cell mass ratio. We further observed that the expression of TAZ and TEAD4 was up-regulated, and YAP was overexpressed, in LPA-treated day 6 embryos. However, LPA-induced up-regulation of CDX2 expression was only evident in day 8 embryos. Overall, our data suggest that the Hippo signaling pathway is involved in the initiation of bovine blastocyst formation, but does not affect the cell lineage constitution of blastocysts.

AB  - We present models of bat motion derived from radio-tracking data collected over 14 nights. The data presents an initial dispersal period and a return to roost period. Although a simple diffusion model fits the initial dispersal motion we show that simple convection cannot provide a description of the bats returning to their roost. By extending our model to include non-autonomous parameters, or a leap frogging form of motion, where bats on the exterior move back first, we find we are able to accurately capture the bat's motion. We discuss ways of distinguishing between the two movement descriptions and, finally, consider how the different motion descriptions would impact a bat's hunting strategy.

AB  - This study evaluates the API 650 design procedure for steel storage tanks, incorporating nonlinear dynamic analysis with large deformation effects. Focusing on seismic vulnerability, the case study examines storage tanks proposed for construction in Naples, Italy, assessing their performance under site-specific seismic conditions. A target spectrum and 20 earthquake records were selected to reflect regional seismic characteristics. Initial tank thicknesses were calculated using API 650 guidelines and subsequently analyzed through nonlinear time-history simulations in SAP2000. Results reveal that thicknesses derived from API 650s linear average spectrum equations are insufficient for real seismic demands. Through a trial-and-error methodology, optimal thicknesses were determined to ensure satisfactory performance across all seismic records. Key findings highlight significant variations in mode participation, the frequent occurrence of elephant-foot buckling in tanks with lower H/R ratios, and the limitations of linear spectral analysis for realistic earthquake scenarios. Given the vital role of storage tanks in the oil and gas industry, this study emphasizes the need to integrate nonlinear time history analysis into design processes to enhance seismic resilience, particularly in high-risk regions.

AB  - Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment regulate the immune landscape and tumor progression. Yet, the ontogeny and heterogeneity of reactive stromal cells within tumors is not well understood. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts exhibiting an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) have been identified within multiple cancers; however, mechanisms that lead to their recruitment and differentiation also remain undefined. Targeting these mechanisms therapeutically may be important in managing cancer progression. Here, we identify the ELF3 transcription factor as the canonical mediator of IL-1 alpha-induced differentiation of prostate mesenchymal stem cells to an iCAF phenotype, typical of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, IL-1 alpha-induced iCAFs were subsequently refractive to TGF-beta 1 induced trans-differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype (myCAF), another key carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtype typical of reactive stroma in cancer. Restricted trans-differentiation was associated with phosphorylation of the YAP protein, indicating that interplay between ELF3 action and activation of the Hippo pathway are critical for restricting trans-differentiation of iCAFs. Together, these data show that the IL-1 alpha/ELF3/YAP pathways are coordinate for regulating inflammatory carcinoma-associated fibroblast differentiation.

AB  - Synapse loss in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients correlates with cognitive dysfunctions. Drugs that limit synaptic loss are promising pharmacological agents. The transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6) regulates the formation of an excitatory synapse. Positive regulation of TRPC6 results in increased synapse formation and enhances learning and memory in animal models. The novel selective TRPC6 agonist, 3-(3-,4-Dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-3,3-dimethyl-1-isoquinolinyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, has recently been identified. Here we present in silico, in vitro, ex vivo, pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies of this compound. We demonstrate that it binds to the extracellular agonist binding site of the human TRPC6, protects hippocampal mushroom spines from amyloid toxicity in vitro, efficiently recovers synaptic plasticity in 5xFAD brain slices, penetrates the blood-brain barrier and recovers cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. We suggest that C20 might be recognized as the novel TRPC6-selective drug suitable to treat synaptic deficiency in Alzheimer's disease-affected hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Shortly after the mixing of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), a viscoplastic layer forms on the surface, which is often colloquially called elephant skin. This layer can hinder the venting, through which air bubbles accumulate below the concrete surface, causing poor surface quality and aesthetics after finishing or resulting in an inferior composite in the case of multi-layer structural components. This paper aims to improve the surface performance of UHPC by reducing the effect of elephant skin. In the present work, the influence of various factors on the "elephant skin" formation on UHPC surface is firstly investigated using a newly developed test method that measures the development of the surface resistance of "elephant skin" on UHPC with time, based on the Vicat apparatus for testing the setting time of cement. Then, the formation mechanism of "elephant skin" on the surface of UHPC is discussed. Finally, some measures to minimize the effect of "elephant skin" on the UHPC surface are proposed. The results reveal that next to controlling the ambient relative humidity (RH) and temperature, an optimization of the concrete mix composition and manufacturing process, such as an increase of superplasticizer (SP) dosage, paste content and water-to-binder (W/B) ratio can help to slow down the "elephant skin" formation on UHPC surface, minimizing its negative effect while without significantly compromising the concrete compressive strength.

AB  - Long transient dynamics in ecological models are characterized by extended periods in one state or regime before an eventual, and often abrupt, transition. One mechanism leading to long transient dynamics is the presence of ghost attractors, states where system dynamics slow down and the system lingers before eventually transitioning to the true attractor. This transition results solely from system dynamics rather than external factors. This paper investigates the dynamics of a classical herbivore-grazer model with the potential for ghost attractors or alternative stable states. We propose an intuitive threshold for first passage time analysis applicable to both bistable and ghost attractor regimes. By formulating the first passage time problem as a backward Kolmogorov equation, we examine how the mean first passage time changes as parameters are varied from the ghost attractor regime to the bistable one, through a saddle-node bifurcation. Our results reveal that the mean and variance of first passage times vary smoothly across the bifurcation threshold, eliminating the deterministic distinction between ghost attractors and bistable regimes. This work suggests that first passage time analysis can be an informative way to classify the length of a long transient. A better understanding of the duration of long transients may contribute to greater ecological understanding and more effective environmental management.

AB  - The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), is one of the most damaging pests to coconut palms causing severe economic harm. Its expansion from Asia to the Pacific in the early 20th century has been stopped by virus control. However, a new haplotype CRB-Guam has recently escaped this control and invaded Guam, other Pacific islands, and has even established itself in the Western Hemisphere. In this paper, we present a compartmental ODE model of CRB population and control. We carefully consider CRB life stages and its interplay with coconut palms as well as "the green waste", the organic matters used by CRB for breeding sites. We calibrate and validate the model based on data count of CRBs trapped in Guam between 2008 and 2014. We derive the basic reproduction number determining the CRB population growth without any control measures. We also identify control levels required to eliminate CRBs. We show that, in the absence of viable virus control, the sanitation, i.e., the removal of the green waste is the most efficient way to control the population. Our model predicts that the sanitation efforts need to roughly double from the current levels to eliminate CRB from Guam. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rare event like Typhoon Dolphin that hit Guam in 2015 can lead to a quick rise of the CRB population.

AB  - Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a pleiotropic polypeptide that can activate G protein-coupled PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2 receptors, and has been implicated in stress signaling. PACAP and its receptors are widely distributed throughout the nervous system and other tissues and can have a multitude of effects. Human and animal studies suggest that PACAP plays a role responding to a variety of threats and stressors. Here we review the roles of PACAP in several regions of the central nervous system (CNS) as they relate to several behavioral functions. For example, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), PACAP is upregulated following chronic stress and may drive anxiety-like behavior. PACAP can also influence both the consolidation and expression of fear memories, as demonstrated by studies in several fear-related areas, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. PACAP can also mediate the emotional component of pain, as PACAP in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is able to decrease pain sensitivity thresholds. Outside of the central nervous system, PACAP may drive glucocorticoid release via enhanced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and may participate in infection-induced stress responses. Together, this suggests that PACAP exerts effects on many stress-related systems and may be an important driver of emotional behavior.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway and its downstream effector YAP play a central role in cell proliferation. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway triggers YAP hyperactivation, thereby inducing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, we reported that EGFR promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of MOB1 and subsequent LATS1/2 inactivation, which are core components of the Hippo pathway, resulting in YAP activation. However, EGFR-targeted monotherapy has shown a low response rate in HNSCC patients. Given that YAP is activated in patient samples refractory to EGFR-targeted therapy, EGFR inhibitors may temporarily inactivate YAP, but intrinsic hyperactivation or acquired reactivation of YAP may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC cells. The mechanism by which YAP is activated in HNSCC resistant to EGFR inhibitors remains unclear. Comprehensive transcriptional analysis revealed that AXL activates YAP through a novel mechanism: AXL heterodimerizes with EGFR, thereby activating YAP via the EGFR-LATS1/2 axis. The combination of AXL and EGFR inhibitors synergistically inactivates YAP and suppresses the viability of HNSCC and lung adenocarcinoma cells. In turn, LATS1/2 knockout and YAP hyperactivation confer resistance to the synergistic effects of these inhibitors. Our findings suggest that co-targeting both AXL and EGFR represent a promising therapeutic approach in patients with EGFR-altered cancers.

AB  - Longitudinal studies of the effects of adversity on human brain development are complicated by the association of stressful events with confounding variables. To counter this bias, we apply a propensity-weighted analysis of the first two years of The Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study (R) data, employing a machine learning analysis weighted by individuals' propensity to experience adversity. Data included 338 resting-state functional connections from 7190 youth (46% female), divided into a training group (80%) and an independent testing group (20%). Propensity scores were computed using 390 variables to balance across two-year adverse life event exposures. Using elastic net regularization with and without inverse propensity weighting, we developed linear models in which changes in functional connectivity of brain connections during the two-year period served as predictors of the number of adverse events experienced during that same period. Haufe's method was applied to forward-transform the backward prediction models. We also tested whether brain changes associated with adverse events correlated with concomitant changes in internalizing or externalizing behaviors or to academic achievement. In the propensity-weighted analysis, brain development significantly predicted the number of adverse events experienced during that period in both the training group (rho = 0.14, p < 0.001) and the independent testing group (rho = 0.10, p < 0.001). The predictor indicated a general pattern of decreased functional connectivity between large-scale networks and subcortical brain regions, particularly for cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks. These network-to-subcortical functional connectivity decreases inversely associated with the development of internalizing symptoms, suggesting adverse events promoted adaptive brain changes that may buffer against stress-related psychopathology. However, these same functional connections were also associated with poorer grades at the two-year follow-up. Although cortical-subcortical brain developmental responses to adversity potentially shield against stress-induced mood and anxiety disorders, they may be detrimental to other domains such as academic success.

AB  - Lung cancer has high morbidity and mortality. This study demonstrated that Bufalin inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vivo / in vitro by suppressing Hippo-YAP pathway. Here, we found that Bufalin promoted the binding of LATS and YAP to elevate the level of YAP phosphorylation. Phosphorylated YAP could not successfully enter the nucleus to activate the expression of downstream proliferation-related target genes Cyr61 and CTGF, whereas the YAP retained in the cytoplasm further bound to & beta;-TrCP and underwent ubiquitination and degra-dation. This study verified the key role of YAP in stimulating the proliferation of lung cancer and revealed the anticancer target of Bufalin. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical basis for the anticancer effect of Bufalin, and suggests that Bufalin can be a potential anticancer drug.

AB  - Large tumour suppressor (LATS) 1/2, the core kinases of Hippo signalling, are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of SUMOylation in the regulation of LATS activation. High cell density induces the expression of components of the SUMOylation machinery and enhances the SUMOylation and activation of Lats1 but not Lats2, whereas genetic deletion of the SUMOylation E2 ligase, Ubc9, abolishes this Lats1 activation. Moreover, SUMOylation occurs at the K830 (mouse K829) residue to activate LATS1 and depends on the PIAS1/2 E3 ligase. Whereas the K830 deSUMOylation mutation of LATS1 found in the human metastatic prostate cancers eliminates the kinase activity by attenuating the formation of the phospho-MOB1/phospho-LATS1 complex. As a result, the LATS1(K830R) transgene phenocopies Yap transgene to cause the oversized livers in mice, whereas Lats1(K829R) knock-in phenocopies the deletion of Lats1 in causing the reproductive and endocrine defects and ovary tumours in mice. Thus, SUMOylation-mediated LATS1 activation is an integral component of Hippo signalling in the regulation of tissues homeostasis.

AB  - With the improvement of the survival rate of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children, some children ALL survivors reveal inferior intellectual and cognition outcome. Methotrexate (MTX), while serving as an essential component in ALL treatment, has been reported to be related to various neurologic sequelae. Using combined intrathecal (IT) and intraperitoneal (IP) MTX model, we had demonstrated impaired spatial memory function in developing rats, which can be rescued by melatonin treatment. To elucidate the impact of MTX treatment on the epigenetic modifications of the myelination process, we examined the change of neurotrophin and myelination-related transcriptomes in the present study and found combined IT and IP MTX treatment resulted in altered epigenetic modification on the myelination process, mainly in the hippocampus. Further, melatonin can restore the MTX effect through alterations of the epigenetic pathways.

AB  - Hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury that occurs during neonatal period has been correlated with severe neuronal damage, behavioral deficits and infant mortality. Previous evidence indicates that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a compound with antioxidant action, exerts a potential neuroprotective effect in various neurological disorders including injury induced by brain ischemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NAC as a potential therapeutic agent in a rat model of neonatal HI brain injury and explore its long-term behavioral effects. To this end, NAC (50 mg/kg/dose, i.p.) was administered prior to and instantly after HI, in order to evaluate hippocampal and cerebral cortex damage as well as long-term functional outcome. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. The results revealed that NAC significantly alleviated sensorimotor deficits and this effect was maintained up to adulthood. These improvements in functional outcome were associated with a significant decrease in the severity of brain damage. Moreover, NAC decreased the short-term expression of iNOS, a finding implying that iNOS activity may be suppressed and that through this action NAC may exert its therapeutic action against neonatal HI brain injury.

AB  - Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main reason behind extrinsic skin aging. Changes due to chronic UV exposure are called photoaging. Natural products are effective ingredients against UV-mediated skin damage. Present study investigated the anti-photoaging properties of Camellia japonica flowers which possess various bioactivities. To enrich the extracts of C. japonica flowers, pectinase and beta-glucosidase treatment was employed. Anti-photoaging effect was screened using the changes in MMP-1 and collagen levels in UVA-irradiated human HaCaT keratinocytes. The crude extract of C. japonica flowers (CE) was shown to decrease the UVA-induced MMP-1 secretion while attenuating the collagen levels. Pectinase and beta-glucosidase treated CE (ECE) showed increased anti-photoaging effects against UVA-induced changes in MMP-1 and collagen production. Camellenodiol (CMD), a known triterpenoid from C. japonica, isolated as the active ingredient of ECE and its anti-photoaging effect was screened. Results showed that CMD ameliorated the UVA-induced deterioration in collagen levels by suppressing MMP-1 production in transcriptional level. CMD treatment downregulated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK MAPKs along their downstream effectors, c-Fos, and c-Jun. In conclusion, enzyme-assisted extraction of C. japonica flowers was suggested to enhance the anti-photoaging properties suggestively through high bioactive content such as CMD.

AB  - Cognitive decline in dementia is associated with deficiency of the cholinergic system. In this study, five mono-carbonyl curcumin analogs were synthesized, and on the basis of their promising in vitro anticholinesterase activities, they were further investigated for in vivo neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects in scopolamine-induced amnesia using elevated plus maze (EPM) and novel object recognition (NOR) behavioral mice models. The effects of the synthesized compounds on the cholinergic system involvement in the brain hippocampus and their binding mode in the active site of cholinesterases were also determined. Compound h2 (p < 0.001) and h3 (p < 0.001) significantly inhibited the cholinesterases and reversed the effects of scopolamine by significantly reducing TLT (p < 0.001) in EPM, while (p < 0.001) increased the time exploring the novel object. The % discrimination index (DI) was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the novel object recognition test. The mechanism of cholinesterase inhibition was further validated through molecular docking study using MOE software. The results obtained from the in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies showed that the synthesized curcumin analogs exhibited significantly higher memory-enhancing potential, and h3 could be an effective neuroprotective agent. However, more study is suggested to explore its exact mechanism of action.

KW  - INHIBITION
AB  - Capacitance of biological membranes is determined by the properties of the lipid portion of the membrane as well as the morphological features of a cell. In neurons, membrane capacitance is a determining factor of synaptic integration, action potential propagation speed, and firing frequency due to its direct effect on the membrane time constant. Besides slow changes associated with increased morphological complexity during postnatal maturation, neuronal membrane capacitance is considered a stable, non-regulated, and constant magnitude. Here we report that, in two excitatory neuronal cell types, pyramidal cells of the mouse primary visual cortex and granule cells of the hippocampus, the membrane capacitance significantly changes between the start and the end of a daily light-dark cycle. The changes are large, nearly 2-fold in magnitude in pyramidal cells, but are not observed in cortical parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons. Consistent with daily capacitance fluctuations, the time window for synaptic integration also changes in pyramidal cells.

AB  - The goal of the present study is to investigate the role of intraamygdaloid oxytocin in learning-related mechanisms. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide which is involved in social bonding, trust, emotional responses and various social behaviors. By conducting passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests on male Wistar rats, the role of intraamygdaloid oxytocin in memory performance and learning was investigated. Oxytocin doses of 10 ng and 100 ng were injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala. Our results showed that 10 ng oxytocin significantly reduced the time required to locate the platform during the Morris water maze test while significantly increasing the latency time in the passive avoidance test. However, the 100 ng oxytocin experiment failed to produce a significant effect in either of the tests. Wistar rats pretreated with 20 ng oxytocin receptor antagonist (L-2540) were administered 10 ng of oxytocin into the central nucleus of the amygdala and were also subjected to the aforementioned tests to highlight the role of oxytocin receptors in spatial- and avoidance learning. Results suggest that oxytocin supports memory processing during both the passive avoidance and the Morris water maze tests. Oxytocin antagonists can however block the effects of oxytocin in both tests. The results substantiate that oxytocin uses oxytocin receptors to enhance memory and learning performance.

AB  - Imperatorin, a naturally derived furanocoumarin, exerts promising neuropharmacological properties. Therefore, it might be applicable in the treatment of brain diseases such as depression. In the present project, we aimed to investigate the sex-dependent effects of imperatorin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) on behavior and neurochemistry associated with antidepressant effects. The depressive-like behaviors of male and female Swiss mice were investigated in a forced swim test (FST). Subsequently, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to evaluate the level of serotonin, its metabolite, 5-HIAA, and noradrenaline, in mouse brains. The study revealed that only males responded to imperatorin (1 and 5 mg/kg) treatment and caused an antidepressant effect, such as with respect to depressive-like behaviors, lowering immobility time and increasing immobility latency. The HPLC analysis demonstrated that serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex of females decreased with the middle dose of imperatorin (5 mg/kg), while in the male prefrontal cortex, the lower dose (1 mg/kg) boosted serotonin levels. There were no evident changes observed with respect to noradrenaline and serotonin metabolite levels in the male hippocampus. To conclude, we propose that imperatorin has antidepressant potential, seemingly only in males, influencing brain serotonin level, but the direct mechanism of action requires further investigation.

AB  - As a neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) seriously affects the health of older people. Changes in synapses occur first over the course of the disease, perhaps even before the formation of A beta plaques. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) mediates the damage of A beta oligomers to dendritic spines. Therefore, we examined the relationship between HDAC activity and synaptic defects using an HDAC inhibitor (HDACI), BG45, in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line with stable overexpression of Swedish mutant APP (APPsw) and in APP/PS1 transgenic mice during this study. The cells were treated with 15 mu M BG45 and the APP/PS1 mice were treated with 30 mg/kg BG45. We detected the levels of synapse-related proteins, HDACs, tau phosphorylation, and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We also measured the expression of cytoskeletal proteins in the cell model. The mRNA levels of the glutamate ion receptor alginate subunit 2 (GRIK2), sodium voltagegated channel beta subunit (SCN3B), synaptophysin (SYP), Grm2 (the gene encoding glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2)), Grid2IP, glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), and GRIP2 were detected to explore the effects of the HDACI on regulating the expression of synaptic proteins and AMPA receptors. According to our studies, the expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 were increased, which were accompanied by the downregulation of the synapse-related proteins SYP, postsynaptic dendritic protein (PSD-95), and spinophilin as early as 24 h after transfection with the APPsw gene. BG45 upregulated the expression of synapse-related proteins and repaired cytoskeletal damage. In vivo, BG45 alleviated the apoptosis-mediated loss of hippocampal neurons, upregulated synapse-related proteins, reduced A beta deposition and phosphorylation of tau, and increased the levels of the synapse-related genes GRIK2, SCN3B, SYP, Grm2, and Grid2IP. BG45 increased the expression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 on APPsw-transfected cells and increased GRIP1 and GRIP2 expression and AMPA receptor phosphorylation in vivo. Based on these results, HDACs are involved in the early process of synaptic defects in AD models, and BG45 may rescue synaptic damage and the loss of hippocampal neurons by specifically inhibiting HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, thereby modulating AMPA receptor transduction, increasing synapse-related gene expression, and finally enhancing the function of excitatory synapses. BG45 may be considered a potential drug for the treatment of early AD in further studies.

AB  - Two closely related glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) isoforms have been identified in mammals: GSK-3 alpha and GSK-3 beta. GSK-3 beta is the most prominent in the central nervous system and was previously shown to control neuronal excitability. We previously demonstrated that indirubin and its structural analogue and the nonselective GSK-3 inhibitor BIO-acetoxime exerted anticonvulsant effects in acute seizure models in zebrafish, mice, and rats. We here examined for the first time the anticonvulsant effect of TCS2002, a specific and potent inhibitor of GSK-3 beta, in two models for limbic seizures: the pilocarpine rat model for focal seizures and the acute 6 Hz corneal mouse model for refractory seizures. Next, we additionally used the 6 Hz kindling model to establish differences in seizure susceptibility and seizure progression in mice that either overexpress human GSK-3 beta (GSK-3 beta OE) or lack GSK-3 beta (GSK-3 beta(-/-)) in neurons. We demonstrate that TCS2002 exerts anticonvulsant actions against pilocarpine-and 6 Hz-evoked seizures. Compared to wild-type littermates, GSK-3 beta OE mice are less susceptible to seizures but are more rapidly kindled. Interestingly, compared to GSK-3 beta(+/+) mice, neuronal GSK-3 beta(-/-) mice show increased susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures. These contrasting observations suggest compensatory neurodevelopmental mechanisms that alter seizure susceptibility in GSK-3 beta OE and GSK-3 beta(-/-) mice. Although the pronounced anticonvulsant effects of selective and acute GSK-3 beta inhibition in the 6 Hz model identify GSK-3 beta as a potential drug target for pharmacoresistant seizures, our data on the sustained disruption of GSK-3 beta activity in the transgenic mice suggest a role for GSK-3 in kindling and warrants further research into the long-term effects of selective pharmacological GSK3 beta inhibition.

AB  - Platelet factors regulate wound healing and can signal from the blood to the brain(1,2). However, whether platelet factors modulate cognition, a highly valued and central manifestation of brain function, is unknown. Here we show that systemic platelet factor 4 (PF4) permeates the brain and enhances cognition. We found that, in mice, peripheral administration of klotho, a longevity and cognition-enhancing protein(3-7), increased the levels of multiple platelet factors in plasma, including PF4. A pharmacologic intervention that inhibits platelet activation blocked klotho-mediated cognitive enhancement, indicating that klotho may require platelets to enhance cognition. To directly test the effects of platelet factors on the brain, we treated mice with vehicle or systemic PF4. In young mice, PF4 enhanced synaptic plasticity and cognition. In old mice, PF4 decreased cognitive deficits and restored aging-induced increases of select factors associated with cognitive performance in the hippocampus. The effects of klotho on cognition were still present in mice lacking PF4, suggesting this platelet factor is sufficient to enhance cognition but not necessary for the effects of klotho-and that other unidentified factors probably contribute. Augmenting platelet factors, possible messengers of klotho, may enhance cognition in the young brain and decrease cognitive deficits in the aging brain.

AB  - Probiotics exert various effects on the body and provide different health benefits. Previous reports have demonstrated that the P8 protein (P8), isolated from Lactobacillus rhamnosus , has anticancer properties. However, its efficacy in stem cells and normal cells has not been reported. In this study, the effect of P8 on cell proliferation and wound healing was evaluated, investigating its underlying mechanism. Based on scratch assay results, we demonstrated that P8 treatment significantly increases wound healing by activating the cell cycle and promoting stem cell stemness. Cellular mechanisms were further investigated by culturing stem cells in a medium containing Lactobacillus-derived P8 protein, revealing its promotion of cell proliferation and migration. Also, it is found that P8 enhances the expression of stemness markers, such as OCT4 and SOX2 , along with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and Hippo pathways. These results indicate that P8 can promote cell growth by increasing stem cell proliferation, migration, and stemness in a manner associated with MAPK and Hippo signaling, which could contribute to the increased wound healing after P8 treatment. Furthermore, P8 could promote wound healing in keratinocytes by activating the MAPK signaling pathways. These results suggest that P8 might be a promising candidate to enhance stem cell culture efficiency by activating cell proliferation, and enhance therapeutic effects in skin diseases.

AB  - Current design software lacks high precision and effective control in handling complex shell opening designs. This study develops a new workflow for generating shell openings based on the exceptional modeling advantages of Grasshopper, a visual programming language integrated with the Rhino software. The process contains two critical subroutines developed in Python for data processing and transformation. One is a selection tool based on the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm for processing principal stress line data. The classification result is the guideline for shell meshing, which substantially improves the structural rationality of mesh shells generated based on dynamic equilibrium methods and particle spring systems. Another tool developed in this study based on the computer vision library OpenCV provides the functionality to read and process stress image data. In addition, this subroutine allows multi-level control of shell opening dimensions according to stress contours. In contrast with the conventional method, the new method efficiently brings shell form under the dual control of principal stress lines and stress contours for the first time. The obtained shell-opening results indicate increased freedom in layout, shape, and smoothness. The method is applied to a free-form shell, and three typical practical examples are presented to demonstrate its structural efficiency and visual effect.

AB  - During general anesthesia, alterations in neuronal metabolism may induce neurotoxicity and/or neuroprotection depending on the dose and type of the applied anesthetic. In this study, we investigate the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane (2% and 4%, i.e., 1 and 2 MAC) on different activity states in hippocampal slices of young Wistar rats. We combine electrophysiological recordings, partial tissue oxygen (p(ti)O(2)) measurements, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) imaging with computational modeling. Sevoflurane minimally decreased the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) while decreasing synaptic transmission in naive slices. During pharmacologically induced gamma oscillations, sevoflurane impaired network activity, thereby decreasing CMRO2. During stimulus-induced neuronal activation, sevoflurane decreased CMRO2 and excitability while basal metabolism remained constant. In this line, stimulus-induced FAD transients decreased without changes in basal mitochondrial redox state. Integration of experimental data and computer modeling revealed no evidence for a direct effect of sevoflurane on key enzymes of the citric acid cycle or oxidative phosphorylation. Clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane generated a decent decrease in energy metabolism, which was proportional to the present neuronal activity. Mitochondrial function remained intact under sevoflurane, suggesting a better metabolic profile than isoflurane or propofol.

AB  - The scarab beetle is an herbivorous pest that causes considerable damage to various agricultural crops. The characteristics of the hind wings have rarely been utilized as indicators for species identification, particularly within the genus Holotrichia. To evaluate the potential of hind wing traits in species identification and gender differentiation, we extracted 25 landmarks from 125 samples of three beetle species (Holotrichia diomphalia, H. titanis, and H. oblita) using TPSDig2 v2.31, with each hind wing image analyzed three times. These landmarks were employed to analyze variations in wing size and shape among species and sexes, and a cross-validation test was conducted in MorphoJ v1.06 to assess classification accuracy. The results demonstrate that both female and male samples exhibit significant differences in wing size and shape variations across species, but not between sexes. Allometry accounts for 16.92% and 25.35% of total shape variation in females and males, separately. After correcting for allometric effects, classification accuracy improves for these beetles. From further analysis, it can be observed that female wings exhibit a wider and shorter morphology in comparison to the more slender and elongated wings of males. In terms of interspecific differences, H. oblita females displayed narrow and elongated wings, whereas H. diomphalia females had a more rectangular wing shape. Among males, the degree of wing narrowness decreased in the order of H. oblita, H. titanis, and H. diomphalia.

AB  - Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

AB  - Preservation of the brain is important to reducing recurrent seizures and other neurological sequelae after status epilepticus (SE). Medical ozone (MedO(3)) shows antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in the human body. In this study, it was aimed to understand the neuroprotective potential of MedO(3) in the acute period after SE. Mature rats of Wistar Albino were used for the study. Group design O-3 + SE: SE induced after MedO(3), O-3: MedO(3) alone was given, SE: SE only induced, SE + O-3; MedO(3) given after SE, C: control and S: sham control group. SE was induced with lithium-pilocarpine experimental model and evaluated on the Racine scale. Peripheral blood samples and brain tissue samples were taken before decapitation. Histopathological evaluation of the hippocampus of the rats given medical O-3 before and after SE were studied. The highest peripheral blood oxidative stress index (OSI) was found in SE group. The OSI level in O-3 + SE and SE + O-3 was significantly higher than SE/C/S. Gene expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA were significantly higher in SE compared to other groups. Histopathologically; eosinophilia, cellular shrinkage and interstitial oedema were detected in the most severe SE and to a lesser extent in O-3 + SE/ SE + O-3. MedO(3) reduced SE-induced oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and neuronal injury and contributed positively to neuroprotection.

AB  - The development of mazes for animal experiments has allowed for the investigation of cognitive maps and place cells, spatial working memory, naturalistic navigation, perseverance, exploration, and choice and motivated behavior. However, many mazes, such as the T maze, currently developed to test learning and memory, do not distinguish temporally and spatially between the encoding and recall periods, which makes it difficult to study these stages separately when analyzing animal behavior and electrophysiology.Other mazes, such as the radial maze, rely on single visits to portions of the maze, making maze coverage sparse for place cell and electrophysiology experiments. In this protocol, we present instructions for building and training an animal on a spatial appetitive choice task on a low-cost double-sided T (or I-I) maze.This maze has several advantages over the traditional T maze and radial mazes. This maze is unique in that it temporally and directionally dissociates the memory encoding and retrieval periods, while requiring the same behaviors of the animal during both periods.This design allows for independent investigation of brain mechanisms, such as cross-region theta coordination, during memory encoding and retrieval, while at least partially dissociating these stages from behavior. This maze has been previously used in our laboratory to investigate cell firing, single-region local field potential (LFP) patterns, and cross region LFP coherence in the hippocampus, lateral septum, prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area, as well as to investigate the effects of hippocampal theta perturbations on task performance.

AB  - N-(2-hydroxyethyl) nicotinamide nitrate (nicorandil), a nitrate that activates adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels, is generally used in the treatment of angina and offers long-term cardioprotective effects. It has been reported that several K-ATP channel openers can effectively alleviate the symptoms of seizure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement in seizures induced by nicorandil. In this study, seizure tests were used to evaluate the effect of different doses of nicorandil by analysing seizure incidence, including minimal clonic seizure and generalised tonic-clonic seizure. We used a maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a metrazol maximal seizure (MMS) model and a chronic pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model to evaluate the effect of nicorandil in improving seizures. Each mouse in the MES model was given an electric shock, while those in the nicorandil group received 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 6 mg/kg of nicorandil by intraperitoneal injection, respectively. In the MMS model, the mice in the PTZ group and the nicorandil group were injected subcutaneously with PTZ (90 mg/kg), and the mice in the nicorandil group were injected intraperitoneally with 1, 3 and 5 mg/kg nicorandil, respectively. In the chronic PTZ-induced seizure model, the mice in the PTZ group and the nicorandil group were injected intraperitoneally with PTZ (40 mg/kg), and the mice in the nicorandil group were each given 1 and 3 mg/kg of PTZ at a volume of 200 nL. Brain slices containing the hippocampus were prepared, and cell-attached recording was used to record the spontaneous firing of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. Nicorandil (i.p.) significantly increased both the maximum electroconvulsive protection rate in the MES model and the seizure latency in the MMS model. Nicorandil infused directly onto the hippocampal CA1 region via an implanted cannula relieved symptoms in chronic PTZ-induced seizures. The excitability of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of the mice was significantly increased after both the acute and chronic administration of PTZ. To a certain extent, nicorandil reversed the increase in both firing frequency and proportion of burst spikes caused by PTZ (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that nicorandil functions by downregulating the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice and is a potential candidate for the treatment of seizures.

AB  - In the current study, fennel essential oil was used as an antibiotic alternative compared to gentamycin for enhancing the expression of apoptosis genes and antioxidant enzymes in weaned rabbits as well as meat quality and growth performance. The gene expression of the cell lymphoma 2 (BAX and BCL2), caspase3 (CASP3), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) were estimated in the liver tissue using qRT-PCR. A total of 45 Moshtohor weaned male rabbits aged four weeks were randomly allocated to control, T1, and T2 treatment groups; each consisted of 15 weaned male rabbits with five replicates. Rabbits in the T1 and T2 groups were orally supplied with 1 mL fennel oil and 1 mL gentamycin, respectively. Weaned rabbits under different treatments showed increased body weight (BW) at 8 and 12 weeks of age and average daily gain (ADG) at 4-8 and 4-12 weeks of age compared to the control group. Compared to the controls, the weaned rabbits supplemented with fennel oil and gentamycin had lower total cholesterol, triglyceride, and MDA. In addition, villus length, mRNA of BAX, BCL2, Casp3, and GPX were increased in the different treatments compared to the control. Furthermore, the meat of these rabbits was less tender, had a lower aerobic plate count (APC), pH, and was brighter and redder in color than the control. Under the conditions of the present study, the supplementation of weaned Moshtohor rabbits with fennel oil as a natural alternative for gentamycin enhanced feed conversion and daily gain through enhancing villus length and mucus thickness. Additionally, fennel essential oil reduces oxidative stress by increasing the antioxidant enzymes.

AB  - Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely used as a viral vector across mammalian biology and has been shown to be safe and effective in human gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) within the adult murine hippocampus are particularly sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death. Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent, with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hr post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression, consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentategyrus (DG)- without ablating adult neurogenesis- can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact. These findings expand on recent reports implicating rAAV-linked toxicity in stem cells and other cell types and suggest that future work using rAAV as an experimental tool in the DG and as a gene therapy for diseases of the central nervous system should be carefully evaluated.

AB  - This study aims to explore the effects of zinc water on autism-like behavior, convulsion threshold, and neurogenesis in ASD model animals. This study used the young BTBR ASD mouse model to explore the effect of a 6-week zinc water supplementation on ASD-like behaviors such as repetitive behavior and social communication disorder, seizure threshold, and the correlation with excitability regulation. The mice were divided into four groups of normal controls (B6) and models (BTBR) who did and did not receive zinc supplementation in water (B6, B6 + zinc, BTBR, and BTBR + zinc). For morphological changes in the hippocampus, we selected two indicators: hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting and neurogenesis. ASD-like behavior testing, seizure threshold determination, Timm staining, and neurogenesis-related assays-represented by Ki67 and DCX-were performed after 6 weeks of zinc supplementation. Our results show that zinc water can prevent autism-like behavior, reduce susceptibility to convulsions, and increase the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells in BTBR mice but has less effect on mossy fiber sprouting and neural progenitor cell differentiation. Zinc water reduces autism-like behavior in a partially inherited autism model mice-BTBR-which may be associated with hippocampal neural precursor cell proliferation and reversed hyperexcitability.

AB  - Variable domains of camelid antibodies (so-called nanobodies or VHH) are the smallest antibody fragments that retain complete functionality and therapeutic potential. Understanding of the nanobody-binding interface has become a pre-requisite for rational antibody design and engineering. The nanobody-binding interface consists of up to three hypervariable loops, known as the CDR loops. Here, we structurally and dynamically characterize the conformational diversity of an anti-GFP-binding nanobody by using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with experimentally derived data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR data contain both structural and dynamic information resolved at various timescales, which allows an assessment of the quality of protein MD simulations. Thus, in this study, we compared the ensembles for the anti-GFP-binding nanobody obtained from MD simulations with results from NMR. We find excellent agreement of the NOE-derived distance maps obtained from NMR and MD simulations and observe similar conformational spaces for the simulations with and without NOE time-averaged restraints. We also compare the measured and calculated order parameters and find generally good agreement for the motions observed in the ps-ns timescale, in particular for the CDR3 loop. Understanding of the CDR3 loop dynamics is especially critical for nanobodies, as this loop is typically critical for antigen recognition.

AB  - Background: Isoflurane is a commonly used general anesthetic widely employed in clinical surgeries. Recent studies have indicated that isoflurane might induce negative impacts on the nervous system, notably by triggering neuronal apoptosis. This process is pivotal to the development and emergence of neurological disorders; its misregulation could result in functional deficits and the initiation of diseases within nervous system. However, the potential molecular mechanism of isoflurane on the neuronal apoptosis remains fully unexplored. This study aims to investigate the regulatory role of the sirtuin 1-mechanistic target of rapamycin (SIRT1-mTOR) signaling pathway in autophagy during isoflurane-induced apoptosis of fetal rat brain neuronal cells.Methods: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot were utilized to evaluate the apoptotic status of hippocampal tissue cells in fetal mice after sevoflurane exposure. Our further investigation was commenced with flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, qPCR, and Western blot to determine the impact of autophagy on sevoflurane-induced apoptosis in these neurons. On the other hand, we conducted an additional set of analyses, including flow cytometric analysis, qPCR, and Western blot, to further elucidate the neuroprotective potential of autophagy in neural cells of fetal mice subjected to sevoflurane-induced apoptosis.Results: Our findings indicated that a 3% sevoflurane treatment led to a significant rise in apoptosis among fetal rat hippocampal tissue cells and neurons. Levels of apoptosis-associated proteins, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), were found to be markedly higher, coinciding with an enhancement in autophagy as evidenced by increased microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and decreased p62 expression. Concurrently, there was a notable up-regulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and a down-regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression. In conclusion, our research elucidated the pivotal function of cellular autophagy in an apoptosis induced by sevoflurane in fetal rat nerve cells. Through experimental manipulation, we observed that interference with SIRT1 resulted in a reduction of both cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax levels. This intervention also beget a diminished expression of the autophagy-associated factor LC3 and an up-regulation of p62. Furthermore, inhibition against mTOR reversed the effects induced by SIRT1 interference, suggesting a complex interplay amid these regulatory pathways.Conclusions: SIRT1 possesses a capacity to modulate apoptosis in the hippocampal neurons of fetal rats triggered by sevoflurane, with mTOR functioning as an inhibitory factor within this signaling pathway.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been proved to be a promising technology for swine manure (SM) treatment. Currently, there is a lack of systematic understanding of the transformation characteristics of nutrient speciation in the HTC of SM. In this study, the speciation of the main nutrients (N/P/K) in SM-derived hydrochar produced at different reaction temperatures (200-280 degrees C) was investigated. The recovery of P (61.0-67.1%) in hydrochars was significantly higher than that of N (23.0-39.8%) and K (25.5-30.0%), and the increase in reaction temperature promoted the recovery of P and reduced the recovery of N. After the HTC treatment, the percentage of soluble/available P was reduced from 61.6% in raw SM to 4.0-23.9% in hydrochars, while that of moderately labile/slow-release P was improved from 29.2% in raw SM feedstock to 65.5-82.7%. An obvious reduction was also found in the amounts of available N (from 51.3% in raw SM feedstock to 33.0-40.5% in hydrochars). The percentages of slow-release N and residual N in hydrochars produced at 240 degrees C reached the maximum and minimum values (46.4% and 18.9%), respectively. A total of 49.5-58.3% of K retained in hydrochars was residual (invalid) potassium. From the perspective of the mobility and availability of N, P and K only, it was suggested that the HTC of SM should be carried out at 220-240 degrees C. Compared with the original SM, it is safer and more effective to use the SM-derived hydrochar as an organic fertilizer.

AB  - Cellular cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables the capture of detailed structural information within a biologically relevant environment. However, information in more complex samples, such as multicellular specimens and tissues, is lacking. Importantly, these observations need to be set in the context of populations. Currently, imaging on the molecular scale is limited to a few observations in situ that struggle to be generalized. This is due to limitations in throughput and versatility employed by current instrumentation. Here, we utilize plasma focused ion beam milling to examine the molecular landscape of mouse hippocampus by cryo-ET. We reveal the complex organization of macromolecules in targeted regions across CA1 stratum pyramidale (sp) to radiatum (sr), representing a molecular atlas of hippocampal architecture in adult mice. The combination of instrumentation and application of technical advancements provides a framework to explore specific structural questions within other tissues in a targeted manner.

AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease, which is a main concern in tropical and subtropical countries. LF is the second major cause of chronic and irreversible disabilities worldwide, which include lymphoedema, hydrocele, and elephantiasis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 882 million individuals across 44 countries were reported to be at risk of acquiring LF. The nematode Wuchereria bancrofti is the predominant pathogen which causes LF, accounting for approximately 90% of filarial infections. The drugs albendazole (ALB), ivermectin (IVM), and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) are currently used to treat LF, but they are not effective against microfilariae and are known to have an inability to reverse chronic conditions, produce adverse reactions, and have developed drug resistance due to prolonged use. Further scientific studies are necessary to discover and characterize potential drug targets in the genome of W. bancrofti, which would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches. This study employs a subtractive genomics approach to identify potential anti-filarial drug targets from the genome of W. bancrofti. Our analysis revealed 12 targets of W. bancrofti, which were found to be involved in important metabolic pathways such as combating oxidative stress, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and DNA repair. This article highlights the proposed drug targets and their potential role in the development of effective drugs against W. bancrofti. We also propose beta-1,4-mannosyltransferase (WbEGH), one among the 12 identified targets, as a priority target based on its sequence similarity with human proteins. Further, structure-based virtual screening identified five potent phytochemicals (IMPPAT ID: 9,896,047, 49,777,225, 13,888,122, 89,483-03-4, and 14,605,093) having a better affinity with WbEGH. Furthermore, experimental validation of these identified phytochemicals would lead towards an effective method for controlling Lymphatic Filariasis.

AB  - Sprouting of stored oilseeds due to improper storage can lead to quality defects of cold-pressed oils obtained from them. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of seed sprouting on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aroma-active compounds, and the content of nonvolatile metabolites in cold-pressed false flax oil obtained from sprouted seeds. In this study, 88 unique VOCs were detected in sprouted oils, whereas only 42 were found in the control oils. The control oils were characterized by a higher abundance of alcohols, while all other groups of compounds were associated with sprouted seeds. The formation of many VOCs was reflected in changes in the nonvolatile precursors. Fifteen aroma-active compounds were identified in sprouted oil, with five compounds playing a significant role (FD >= 128) in aroma formation. The presented approach allowed identification of differences caused by seed sprouting, resulting in oils with a much stronger aroma and a richer profile of VOCs due to intensive metabolic changes. The origin of many VOCs can be explained by alterations in the content of nonvolatile metabolites.

AB  - Ischemic strokes are caused by a reduction in cerebral blood flow and both the ischemic period and subsequent reperfusion induce brain injury, with different tissue damage depending on the severity of the ischemic insult, its duration, and the particular areas of the brain affected. In those areas vulnerable to cerebral ischemia, the inhibition of protein translation is an essential process of the cellular response leading to delayed neuronal death. In particular, translation initiation is rate-limiting for protein synthesis and the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex is indispensable for cap-dependent protein translation. In the eIF4F complex, eIF4G is a scaffolding protein that provides docking sites for the assembly of eIF4A and eIF4E, binding to the cap structure of the mRNA and stabilizing all proteins of the complex. The eIF4F complex constituents, eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G, participate in translation regulation by their phosphorylation at specific sites under cellular stress conditions, modulating the activity of the cap-binding complex and protein translation. This work investigates the phosphorylation of eIF4G1 involved in the eIF4E/eIF4G1 association complex, and their regulation in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) as a stress-inducing condition. IR was induced in an animal model of transient cerebral ischemia and the results were studied in the resistant cortical region and in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. The presented data demonstrate the phosphorylation of eIF4G1 at Ser(1147), Ser(1185), and Ser(1231) in both brain regions and in control and ischemic conditions, being the phosphorylation of eIF4G1 at Ser(1147) the only one found in the eIF4E/eIF4G association complex from the cap-containing matrix (m(7)GTP-Sepharose). In addition, our work reveals the specific modulation of the phosphorylation of eIF4G1 at Ser(1147) in the vulnerable region, with increased levels and colocalization with eIF4E in response to IR. These findings contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanism of protein translation regulation that underlies in the balance of cell survival/death during pathophysiological stress, such as cerebral ischemia.

AB  - This study evaluates some of the neuromodulatory mechanisms of the memory loss preventive effect of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) in a scopolamine (Sco)-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) type dementia. Our results confirmed that Sco administration induces significant memory impairment, worsens exploratory behaviour and habituation, increases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and induces pathological monoamine content changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. ALA administration largely prevented Sco-induced memory impairment. It also improved exploratory behaviour and preserved habituation, and it decreased AChE activity, reversing it to control group levels, and corrected aberrant monoamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. According to the data available, this is the first time that ALA-induced changes in AChE and monoamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (brain structures related to learning and memory) have been demonstrated in a Sco-induced rat model of AD type dementia.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Although the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases SIRT1 and SIRT2 play pivotal roles in age-related diseases, their cooperative effects in AD have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that the SIRT2:SIRT1 ratio is elevated in the brains of aging mice and in the AD mouse models. In HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells, A beta challenge correlates with decreased SIRT1 expression, while SIRT2 expression is increased. Overexpression of SIRT1 prevents A beta-induced neurotoxicity. We find that SIRT1 impedes SIRT2-mediated APP deacetylation by inhibiting the binding of SIRT2 to APP. Deletion of SIRT1 reduces APP recycling back to the cell surface and promotes APP transiting toward the endosome, thus contributing to the amyloidogenic processing of APP. Our findings define a mechanism for neuroprotection by SIRT1 through suppression of SIRT2 deacetylation, and provide a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention of AD.

AB  - Autophagy disorders in AD patients and animal models were well known, however, the effect of P301S-tau on autophagy is not clear. Here, we found that autophagy related protein Tectonin Beta-Propeller Repeat-Containing Protein 1 (TECPR1) decreased in the hippocampus of P301S-tau transgenic mice by proteomics, which was proved in vivo and in vitro, and P301S-tau induced autophagic deficits in early and late process. TECPR1 overexpression attenuated P301S-tau induced autophagy defects via promoting autophagosome generation and autophagosome and lysosomes fusion. We also found that TECPR1 overexpression ameliorated the behavior disorders of P301S-tau mice with promoting tau degradation, improving synaptic plasticity and neuron loss. Lastly, CQ or 3-MA treatment reversed TECPR1 induced improvement effects on autophagic and cognitive disorders, further proved that, TECPR1 activated the early and late process of autophagy to ameliorate the cognition of P301S-tau mice. Our data suggest that TECPR1 is a potential therapy target for AD.

AB  - Reducing the use of antibiotics in livestock in order to contain antibiotic resistance and studying natural substance additives are key to sustainability. Among the various biological activities of plant extracts, antioxidant activity plays an important role. The present study assesses the total antioxidant activity and antioxidant reserves using the Kit Radicaux Libres test (KRL (TM) Kirial International, Couternon, France). One hundred and sixty piglets (Topics x Tempo) weaned at 28 days of age were divided into four dietary treatment groups that were fed a commercial diet (the control group, C); 500 mg/kg Boswellia extract (BOS); 200 and 50 mg/kg Uncaria and Tanacetum extracts (UT) respectively; and 225 mg/kg of an antioxidant plant extract mixture (AOX). The blood antioxidant activity of the piglets was measured using the KRL test and the reserves were analyzed on whole blood samples after hydrolysis with glucosidase, sulfatase and glucuronidase. No significant differences were observed in growth performance. The delta KRL values of the whole blood showed a significantly higher total antioxidant status of the piglets from the BOS and AOX groups than the UT and C groups (+30.7 BOS; +27.7 AOX vs. +17.81 UT +13.30 C; p = 0.002) between 18 and 28 days post-weaning. The delta KRL values of red blood cells (RBCs) showed a significantly higher total antioxidant status of the piglets from the AOX groups than the UT and BOS groups (+22.2 AOX; vs. +9.90 UT +9.4 BOS; p = 0.016) between the two sampling times. Reserves of UT and AOX were higher than C and BOS for all enzymes, glucosides, sulphates, and glucuronides. The biological KRL test proved to be an extremely sensitive tool to evaluate the piglets' antioxidant status. Determining the antioxidant reserve also provides a better understanding of the real antioxidant status of pigs.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a main public health concern during the past decade, attracting considerable interest because of its rising prevalence, wide-ranging risk factors and lifelong familial and societal influence. SUMO2 can conjugate to substrates upon various cellular stresses. Nevertheless, whether and how SUMO2-specific proteases partake in TBI is less understood. The aim of this study is to dissect the effects of SUMO-specific peptidase 5 (SENP5) on accentuating TBI in rats in an effort to unveil its underlying mechanism. SENP5 is overexpressed in hippocampal tissues of TBI rats, and inhibition of SENP5 reduces neurological function scores, decreases brain water content, inhibits apoptosis in hippocampal tissues, and attenuates brain injury caused in rats. Moreover, SENP5 inhibits the SUMOylation level of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and increases the protein expression of E2F1. Silencing of E2F1 blocks the p53 signaling pathway. Overexpression of E2F1 partially reverses the protective effect of sh-SENP5 on TBI in rats. These findings reveal an essential role of SENP5 and the SUMOylation status of E2F1 in the TBI development.

AB  - Akkermansia muciniphila is a symbiotic intestinal bacterium with a high medicinal value. Amuc_1100 is the outer membrane protein of A. muciniphila and plays an important role in the interaction between A. muciniphila and its host. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant activity of Amuc_1100 in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. Amuc_1100 intervention ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behavior and CUMS-induced down-regulation of serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine, or simply, 5-HT) in the serum and colon of mice. Microbial analysis of mouse feces showed that Amuc_1100 could improve the gut microbiota dysregulation induced by CUMS. In addition, Amuc_1100 intervention could also improve the down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammation in the hippocampus induced by CUMS. These results suggest that Amuc_1100 has a good antidepressant effect, and the mechanism may be related to the improvement of gut microbiota, the up-regulation of the BDNF level, and the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response.

AB  - Background and purpose: The field of hydrogen medicine has garnered extensive attention since Professor Ohsawa established that low concentrations of hydrogen (2%-4%) exert antioxidant effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of molecular hydrogen in a CUMS rat model. Methods: A total of 40 SD rats were randomly divided into a control group, a model group, a hydrogen group, and a positive drug group. Four weeks post-modeling, hydrogen inhalation and other treatments were administered. Behavioral, biochemical, and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed after treatment. Results: Hydrogen inhalation alleviated depressive behavior and hippocampal neuronal damage in CUMS rats, as well as restored the levels of neurotransmitters, inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress. Moreover, it maintained mitochondrial homeostasis and up-regulated the expression of PGC-1 alpha, PINK1, and Parkin. Conclusions: The results collectively indicated that hydrogen significantly attenuated CUMS-induced depressivelike behavior and monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency, as well as protected the brain from oxidative stress and inflammatory damage and effectively preserved mitochondrial homeostasis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the role of the stress effect of septoplasty modeling on p53 protein expression in the hippocampus of rats under conditions of sensory olfactory deprivation. Simulation of septoplasty was carried out on 30 sexually mature male rats. A quantitative assessment of the apoptosis of neurons in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus in the subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) on days 2, 4, and 6 after surgery was carried out. Histological sections were stained by the immunohistochemical method with antibodies to the p53 protein. An increase in the number of p53-positive neurons was noted in all subfields; the maximum increase in the number of apoptotic neurons was noted on day 4 after surgery. The stress effect of modeling septoplasty in rats, accompanied by sensory deprivation of the peripheral part of the olfactory analyzer, provoked the expression of p53 and the initiation of apoptosis mechanisms in various subfields of the hippocampus.

AB  - Melatonin has been well documented for its neuroprotective role through inhibiting oxidative stress against traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the specific role of melatonin and the exact effects on cell responses (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in different brain regions are unclear. Here, we subjected mice to closed head injury, to establish a repeated mild TBI model and detect neuronal activity and glial responses in cognition-related brain regions after melatonin administration. Melatonin only showed cognitive enhancement if administered during early pathological stages, but not in late (chronic) stages. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in neuronal activity and inhibition of astrocyte reactivation in medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, but not in other cognitive deficit related brain regions. Furthermore, by activating astrocytes in these brain regions, we found neuronal activity upregulation and cognitive improvement following melatonin treatment. Therefore, we concluded that melatonin administration during the early stages of TBI is necessary to inhibit astrocyte reactivation and to promote cognitive function. Our results provide evidence for use of melatonin for cognitive improvement after TBIs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methamphetamine addiction is a brain disorder characterized by persistent drug-seeking behavior, which has been linked with aberrant synaptic plasticity. An increasing body of evidence suggests that aberrant synaptic plasticity is associated with the activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. 3 '-Deoxyadenosin, an active component of the Chinese fungus Cordyceps militaris, has strong anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether 3 '-deoxyadenosin attenuates methamphetamine-induced aberrant synaptic plasticity via an NLRP3-mediated inflammatory mechanism remains unclear. We first observed that 3 '-deoxyadenosin attenuated conditioned place preference scores in methamphetamine-treated mice and decreased the expression of c-fos in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we found that 3 '-deoxyadenosin reduced the aberrant potentiation of glutamatergic transmission and restored the methamphetamine-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity. We also found that 3 '-deoxyadenosin decreased the expression of NLRP3 and neuronal injury. Importantly, a direct NLRP3 deficiency reduced methamphetamine-induced seeking behavior, attenuated the impaired synaptic plasticity, and prevented neuronal damage. Finally, NLRP3 activation reversed the effect of 3 '-deoxyadenosin on behavior and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of 3 '-deoxyadenosin on aberrant synaptic plasticity reduces methamphetamine-induced seeking behavior. Taken together, 3 '-deoxyadenosin alleviates methamphetamine-induced aberrant synaptic plasticity and seeking behavior by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Acute stress causes depressive-like reactions in the tail suspension (TST) and forced swim tests (FST) of mice. Similarly, inescapable foot shock is able to promote the development of anhedonia as indicated by decreased sucrose consumption of treated mice in the sucrose preference test (SPT). The astrocyte-specific deletion of the P2X7R by a conditional knockout strategy or its knockdown by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing P2X7R-specific shRNA in astrocytes significantly prolonged the immobility time in TST and FST. In contrast, the shRNA-induced downregulation of the P2X7R in neurons, oligodendrocytes, or microglia had no detectable effect on the behavior of treated mice in these tests. Moreover, sucrose consumption in the SPT was not altered following inescapable foot shock treatment in any of these cell type-specific approaches. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the administered astrocyte-specific AAV efficiently conveyed expression of shRNA by hippocampal CA1 astrocytes, but not by neurons. In conclusion, P2X7R in astrocytes of this area of the brain appears to be involved in depressive-like reactions to acute stressors.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a severe postoperative complication in older patients. Epigenetic changes are hallmarks of senescence and are closely associated with cognitive impairment. However, the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the aging brain's epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and its impact on cognitive impairment remain unclear. Using a laparotomy PND model, we report significant reduction in DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) in hippocampal neurons of aged mice, which causes global DNA methylation decrease. Knockdown of DNMT3a leads to synaptic disorder and memory impairment in aged mice. Mechanistically, bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNMT3a deficiency reduces methylation in the LRG1 promoter region and promotes its transcription. We also show that activation of TGF-beta signaling by the increase in LRG1 level, ultimately impacts the synaptic function. In contrast, both overexpressing DNMT3a or knockdown LRG1 in hippocampus can attenuate the synaptic disorders and rescue postoperative cognitive deficits in aged mice. Our results reveal that DNMT3a is a previously undefined mediator in the pathogenesis of PND, which couples epigenetic regulations with anesthesia/surgery-induced synaptic dysfunction and represents a therapeutic target to tackle PND.

AB  - Adverse experiences and family income in childhood have been associated with altered brain development. While there is a large body of research examining these associations, it has primarily used cross-sectional data sources and studied adverse experiences and family income in isolation. However, it is possible that low family income and adverse experiences represent dissociable and potentially interacting profiles of risk. To address this gap in the literature, we examined brain structure as a function of adverse experiences in childhood and family income in 158 youths with up to five waves of MRI data. Specifically, we assessed the interactive effect of these two risk factors on six regions of interest: hippocampus, putamen, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, and thalamus. Adverse experiences and family income interacted to predict putamen volume (B = 0.086, p = 0.011) but only in participants with family income one standard deviation below the mean (slope estimate = -0.11, p = 0.03). These results suggest that adverse experiences in childhood result in distinct patterns of brain development across the socioeconomic gradient. Given previous findings implicating the role of the putamen in psychopathology-related behaviors, these results emphasize the importance of considering life events and socioeconomic context when evaluating markers of risk. Future research should include interactive effects of environmental exposures and family income to better characterize risk for psychopathology in diverse samples.

AB  - Short-lived turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) have become a popular model organism for neuroscience. In the present paper we study for the first time their behavior in the novel tank diving test and the levels of mRNA of various 5-HT-related genes in brains of 2-, 4- and 6-month-old males and females of N. furzeri. The marked effect of age on body mass, locomotor activity and the mRNA level of Tph1b, Tph2, Slc6a4b, Mao, Htr1aa, Htr2a, Htr3a, Htr3b, Htr4, Htr6 genes in the brains of N. furzeri males was shown. Locomotor activity and expression of the Mao gene increased, while expression of Tph1b, Tph2, Slc6a4b, Htr1aa, Htr2a, Htr3a, Htr3b, Htr4, Htr6 genes decreased in 6-month-old killifish. Significant effects of sex on body mass as well as on mRNA level of Tph1a, Tph1b, Tph2, Slc6a4b, Htr1aa, 5-HT2a, Htr3a, Htr3b, Htr4, and Htr6 genes were revealed: in general both the body mass and the expression of these genes were higher in males. N. furzeri is a suitable model with which to study the fundamental problems of age-related alterations in various mRNA levels related with the brains 5-HT system.

AB  - GABAergic inhibitory neurons fundamentally shape the activity and plasticity of cortical circuits. A major subset of these neurons contains somatostatin (SOM); these cells play crucial roles in neuroplasticity, learning, and memory in many brain areas including the hippocampus, and are implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main types of SOM-containing cells in area CA1 of the hippocampus are oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells and hippocampo-septal (HS) cells. These cell types show many similarities in their soma-dendritic architecture, but they have different axonal targets, display different activity patterns in vivo, and are thought to have distinct network functions. However, a complete understanding of the functional roles of these interneurons requires a precise description of their intrinsic computational properties and their synaptic interactions. In the current study we generated, analyzed, and make available several key data sets that enable a quantitative comparison of various anatomical and physiological properties of OLM and HS cells in mouse. The data set includes detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based 3D reconstructions of OLM and HS cells along with their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Combining this core data set with other anatomical data, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and compartmental modeling, we examined the precise morphological structure, inputs, outputs, and basic physiological properties of these cells. Our results highlight key differences between OLM and HS cells, particularly regarding the density and distribution of their synaptic inputs and mitochondria. For example, we estimated that an OLM cell receives about 8,400, whereas an HS cell about 15,600 synaptic inputs, about 16% of which are GABAergic. Our data and models provide insight into the possible basis of the different functionality of OLM and HS cell types and supply essential information for more detailed functional models of these neurons and the hippocampal network.
   Somatostatin GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have important roles in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, but the functional roles of some subtypes are not well understood. Here, the authors compare the anatomical and physiological properties of two subtypes of somatostatin interneurons, finding key differences that could underlie their functionalities and providing essential information to model the hippocampal network.

AB  - NLRP1 inflammasome has been reported to participate in many neurological disorders. Our previous study has demonstrated that NLRP1 inflammasome is implicated in chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. Age has been reported to be related to depression. Here we examine whether NLRP1 inflammasome is involved in the effect of age on depressive disorder. Two chronic stress stimuli, chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and repeat social defeat stress (RSDS), were used to establish a depression model in mice of different ages. We found that aged mice exhibited worse depressive-like behaviors and locomotor activity compared to young mice. Interestingly, the expression of hippocampal NLRP1 inflammasome complexes and the levels of the inflammatory cytokines were increased in an age-dependent manner. Also, chronic stress-induced increase in the expression of the hippocampal chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), and its cognate receptor, CXC-motif receptor 2 (CXCR2), was more remarkable in aged mice than that in young mice. Moreover, aged mice exhibited lower hippocampal BDNF levels compared to young mice. Hippocampal Nlrp1a knockdown reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of CXCL1/CXCR2, restored BDNF levels, and alleviated chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in aged mice. Our results suggest that NLRP1 inflammasome-CXCL1/CXCR2-BDNF signaling contributes to the effect of age on chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice.

AB  - Enteroviruses have been a historical concern since the identification of polioviruses in humans. Wild polioviruses have almost been eliminated, while multiple species of non-polio enteroviruses and their variants co-circulate annually. To date, at least 116 types have been found in humans and are grouped into the species Enterovirus A-D and Rhinovirus A-C. However, there are few available antiviral drugs, especially with a universal pharmaceutical effect. Here, we demonstrate that peptide P25 from EV-D68 has broad antiviral activity against EV A-D enteroviruses in vitro. P25, derived from the HI loop and beta-I sheet of VP1, operates through a conserved hydrophilic motif -R---K-K--K- and the hydrophobic F near the N-terminus. It could prevent viral infection of EV-A71 by competing for the heparan sulfate (HS) receptor, binding and stabilizing virions by suppressing the release of the viral genome. P25 also inhibited the generation of infectious viral particles by reducing viral protein synthesis. The molecular docking revealed that P25 might bind to the pocket opening area, a potential target for broad-spectrum antivirals. Our findings implicate the multiple antiviral effects of peptide P25, including blocking viral binding to the HS receptor, impeding viral genome release, and reducing progeny particles, which could be a novel universal anti-enterovirus drug candidate.

AB  - Background Doxorubicin (DOX) may cause various neurological side effects in the brain. Lercanidipine (LRD) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of. Methods and results Lercanidipine in reducing doxorubicin-induced neuroinflammation and maintaining the expressions of choline acetyltransferase. Thirty-two adult Wistar albino female rats were divided into four groups as Control, DOX (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally), DOX + LRD 0.5 (0.5 mg/kg orally), and DOX + LRD2(2 mg/kg orally). Twenty-four hours after the last drug administration (9th day), brain tissues were taken for histopathological, immunohistochemical (choline acetyltransferase [CHAT], interleukin-10 [IL-10], and caspase-3 [Cas-3] staining), biochemical (total antioxidant status [TAS], total oxidant status [TOS], and oxidative stress index [OSI]), and genetic analyzes (PI3K/AKT/HIF1-alpha and IL-6 gene expressions). Histopathological analyses revealed hyperemia, slight hemorrhage, degeneration, neuronal loss, gliosis in the cerebellum, and neuronal loss in the brain cortex and hippocampus in the DOX group. According to other analyzes, decreased CHAT, PI3K, AKT, HIF1-alpha and increased IL-6, IL-10, Cas-3 expression were observed in the DOX group. Conclusions Both LRD doses reversed all these findings, but LRD2 was observed to be more effective. In conclusion, we determined that LRD has potential therapeutic effect by reducing DOX-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in brain tissues.

AB  - The hormone leptin is produced in adipocytes of white adipose tissue and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Leptin receptors are present in the brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions. In particular, leptin directly influences the glutamate receptor trafficking in CA3 -> CA1 synapses to increase the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) level, which is controlled by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It is well recognized that glutamate receptor trafficking involves at least some components of the insulin signaling cascade. However, the effects of leptin and insulin hormones differ at the cell and behavioral levels and often oppose each other. The domain organization of synaptic proteins was analyzed for CA1 field neurons. A molecular mechanism of leptin effects in the hippocampus was assumed to involve a cross-talk of the molecular pathways of the leptin receptors and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Non-receptor protein kinases of the Src subfamily and, in particular, kinase Fyn are part of glutamate receptor macrocomplexes and are involved in regulating the efficiency of synaptic transmission. Fyn was assumed to utilize its SH2 domain to interact with leptin receptors directly or through other proteins and contribute to leptin signaling through the PI3K signaling pathway. The hypothesis explains experimental findings and sheds further light on the fine tuning of hormone-dependent modulation of hippocampal synaptic processes.

AB  - Ovariectomy (OVX) conducted before the onset of natural menopause is considered to bringing forward and accelerate the process of ageing-associated neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying memory decline and other cognitive dysfunctions following OVX are unclear. Given that iron accumulates during ageing and after OVX, we hypothesized that excess iron accumulation in the hippocampus would cause ferroptosisinduced increased neuronal degeneration and death associated with memory decline. In the current study, female rats that underwent OVX showed decreased dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) expression and reduced performance in the Morris water maze (MWM). We used primary cultured hippocampal cells to explore the ferroptosis resistance-inducing effect of 17 beta-oestradiol (E-2). The data supported a vital role of DHODH in neuronal ferroptosis. Specifically, E2 alleviated ferroptosis induced by erastin and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), which can be blocked by brequinar (BQR). Further in vitro studies showed that E2 reduced lipid peroxidation levels and improved the behavioural performance of OVX rats. Our research interprets OVX-related neurodegeneration with respect to ferroptosis, and both our in vivo and in vitro data show that E2 supplementation exerts beneficial antiferroptotic effects by upregulating DHODH. Our data demonstrate the utility of E2 supplementation after OVX and provide a potential target, DHODH, for which hormone therapy has not been available.

Glycan expression in lion and cat placentae was very similar apart from the occurrence of terminal a-galactose in the lion trophoblast. The dog differed in several respects, particularly in the trophoblast, consistent with species-specific glycotypes differing according to the degree of their evolutionary divergence. The data suggest that evolutionary effects on the glycotype are most readily observed in trophoblast.

AB  - Forgetting is a normal process in healthy brains, and evidence suggests that the mammalian brain forgets more than is required based on limitations of mnemonic capacity. Episodic memories, in particular, are liable to be forgotten over time. Researchers have hypothesized that it may be beneficial for decision making to forget episodic memories over time. Reinforcement learning offers a normative framework in which to test such hypotheses. Here, we show that a reinforcement learning agent that uses an episodic memory cache to find rewards in maze environments can forget a large percentage of older memories without any performance impairments, if they utilize mnemonic representations that contain structural information about space. Moreover, we show that some forgetting can actually provide a benefit in performance compared to agents with unbounded memories. Our analyses of the agents show that forgetting reduces the influence of outdated information and states which are not frequently visited on the policies produced by the episodic control system. These results support the hypothesis that some degree of forgetting can be beneficial for decision making, which can help to explain why the brain forgets more than is required by capacity limitations.

AB  - Age is the main risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In the aged brain, axonal degeneration is an early pathological event, preceding neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive disabilities in humans, primates, rodents, and invertebrates. Necroptosis mediates degeneration of injured axons, but whether necroptosis triggers neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment along aging is unknown. Here, we show that the loss of the necroptotic effector Mlkl was sufficient to delay age-associated axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation, protecting against decreased synaptic transmission and memory decline in aged mice. Moreover, short-term pharmacologic inhibition of necroptosis targeting RIPK3 in aged mice, reverted structural and functional hippocampal impairment, both at the electrophysiological and behavioral level. Finally, a quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that necroptosis inhibition leads to an overall improvement of the aged hippocampal proteome, including a subclass of molecular biofunctions associated with brain rejuvenation, such as long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity. Our results demonstrate that necroptosis contributes to age-dependent brain degeneration, disturbing hippocampal neuronal connectivity, and cognitive function. Therefore, necroptosis inhibition constitutes a potential geroprotective strategy to treat age-related disabilities associated with memory impairment and cognitive decline.

AB  - Innate immune activation is critical for initiating hepatic inflammation during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression. However, the mechanisms by which immunoregulatory molecules recognize lipogenic, fibrotic, and inflammatory signals remain unclear. Here, we show that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced oxidative stress activates Foxo1, YAP, and Notch1 signaling in hepatic macrophages. Macrophage Foxo1 deficiency (Foxo1M-KO) ameliorated hepatic inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis, with reduced STING, TBK1, and NF-kappa B activation in HFD-challenged livers. However, Foxo1 and YAP double knockout (Foxo1/YAPM-DKO) or Foxo1 and Notch1 double knockout (Foxo1/Notch1M-DKO) promoted STING function and exacerbated HFD-induced liver injury. Interestingly, Foxo1M-KO strongly reduced TGF-beta 1 release from palmitic acid (PA)- and oleic acid (OA)-stimulated Kupffer cells and decreased Col1 alpha 1, CCL2, and Timp1 expression but increased MMP1 expression in primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) after coculture with Kupffer cells. Notably, PA and OA challenge in Kupffer cells augmented LIMD1 and LATS1 colocalization and interaction, which induced YAP nuclear translocation. Foxo1M-KO activated PGC-1 alpha and increased nuclear YAP activity, modulating mitochondrial biogenesis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and in situ RNA hybridization, we found that NICD colocalizes with YAP and targets Mb21d1 (cGAS), while YAP functions as a novel coactivator of the NICD, which is crucial for reprogramming STING function in NASH progression. These findings highlight the importance of the macrophage Foxo1-YAP-Notch1 axis as a key molecular regulator that controls lipid metabolism, inflammation, and innate immunity in NASH.
   In the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, it's vital to understand how our immune system contributes to liver harm. Researchers found that a protein named STING is crucial in liver inflammation and damage as it identifies damaged DNA. They investigate how certain proteins and processes in immune cells affect STING's function and NASH's progression. Researchers discovered that decreasing the activity of a protein named Foxo1 in macrophagesresults in less liver damage and inflammation in mice on a high-fat diet. They also examined how other signaling processes, like the Hippo-YAP and Notch1 processes, interact with STING and contribute to the disease. Their findings indicate that adjusting these processes can reduce liver damage, steatosis, and inflammation, suggesting new potential treatment targets for NASH, potentially improving the lives of those affected by this condition.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates many neurological functions and plays a vital role during the recovery from central nervous system injuries. However, the changes in BDNF expression and associated factors following hypoxia-ischemia induced neonatal brain damage, and the significance of these changes are not fully understood. In the present study, a rat model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was established through the occlusion of the right common carotid artery, followed by 2 hours in a hypoxic-ischemic environment. Rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage presented deficits in both sensory and motor functions, and obvious pathological changes could be detected in brain tissues. The mRNA expression levels of BDNF and its processing enzymes and receptors (Furin, matrix metallopeptidase 9, tissue-type plasminogen activator, tyrosine Kinase receptor B, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and Sortilin) were upregulated in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cerebral cortex 6 hours after injury; however, the expression levels of these mRNAs were found to be downregulated in the contralateral hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These findings suggest that BDNF and its processing enzymes and receptors may play important roles in the pathogenesis and recovery from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia (approval No. U12-18) on July 30, 2018.

AB  - Background Neurogenesis is the ability to generate new neurons from resident stem/progenitor populations. Although often understood as a homeostatic process, several species of teleost fish, salamanders, and lacertid lizards are also capable of reactive neurogenesis, spontaneously replacing lost or damaged neurons. Here, we demonstrate that reactive neurogenesis also occurs in a distantly related lizard species, Eublepharis macularius, the leopard gecko. Results To initiate reactive neurogenesis, the antimetabolite 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) was administered. Four days following 3-AP administration there is a surge in neuronal cell death within a region of the forebrain known as the medial cortex (homolog of the mammalian hippocampal formation). Neuronal cell death is accompanied by a shift in resident microglial morphology and an increase neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation. By 30 days following 3-AP administration, the medial cortex was entirely repopulated by NeuN+ neurons. At the same time, local microglia have reverted to a resting state and cell proliferation by neural stem/progenitors has returned to levels comparable with uninjured controls. Conclusions Together, these data provide compelling evidence of reactive neurogenesis in leopard geckos, and indicate that the ability of lizards to spontaneously replace lost or damaged forebrain neurons is more taxonomically widespread and evolutionarily conserved than previously considered.

AB  - Ibuprofen (IBU) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been found in recent years to cause ovarian damage. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanisms of IBU damage to the ovary and drugs to combat it. We established in vivo (IBU doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg-day) and in vitro (IBU concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mu M in culture medium) models of ovarian damage in mice simulating clinical doses and found that IBU not only caused ovarian damage in mice in a dose-response relationship, but also decreased estradiol (E2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in serum/media with increasing IBU doses. In damaged ovaries, the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)-PGE2 pathway is inhibited, the Hippo pathway is activated, circPVT1 is decreased, and miR-149 is elevated. TT-10 is an activator of YES-associated protein (YAP)-transcriptional enhancer factor domain activity. Then, 100 mu M IBU-induced ovarian damage model was selected for YAP activation (Hippo pathway inhibition) experiment, and TT-10 was found to interfere with IBU-induced ovarian damage and in-crease E2 level in the medium, and 10 mu M of TT-10 had the best protective effect. TT-10 also inhibited the Hippo pathway, activated the COX2-PGE2 pathway, elevated circPVT1 expression, and decreased miR-149 expression in the ovary. It has been hypothesized that clinical doses of IBU damage mouse ovaries by inhibiting COX2-PGE2 and activating the Hippo pathway, whereas TT-10 protects the ovaries through the inverse regulation of these two pathways.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the mechanotransduction and pharmacomanipulation of A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13) altered Hippo signaling pathway transcription and growth factors in granulosa cells. Primary ovarian insufficiency is the depletion or dysfunction of primordial ovarian follicles. In vitro activation of ovarian tissue in patients with primary ovarian insufficiency alters the Hippo and phosphatase and tensin homolog/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/forkhead box O3 pathways. A-kinase anchoring protein 13 is found in granulosa cells and may regulate the Hippo pathway via F-actin polymerization resulting in altered nuclear yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif coactivators and Tea domain family (TEAD) transcription factors. Design: Laboratory studies. Setting: Translational science laboratory. Patient(s): None. Intervention(s): COV434 cells, derived from a primary human granulosa tumor cell line, were studied under different cell density and well stiffness conditions. Cells were transfected with a TEAD-luciferase (TEAD-luc) reporter as well as expression constructs for AKAP13 or AKAP13 mutants and then treated with AKAP13 activators, inhibitors, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Main Outcome Measure(s): TEAD gene activation or inhibition was measured by TEAD-luciferase assays. The messenger ribonucleic acid levels of Hippo pathway signaling molecules, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), baculoviral inhibitors of apoptosis repeat-containing 5, Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1, YAP1, and TEAD1, were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expressions for AKAP13, CTGF, YAP1, and TEAD1 were measured using Western blot. Result(s): Increased TEAD-luciferase activity and expression of markers for cellular growth were associated with decreased cell density, increased well stiffness, and AKAP13 activator (A02) treatment. Additionally, decreased TEAD-luc activity and expression of markers for cellular growth were associated with AKAP13 inhibitor (A13) treatment, including a reduced expression of the BIRC5 and ANKRD1 (YAP-responsive genes) transcript levels and CTGF protein levels. There were no changes in TEAD-luc with follicle- stimulating hormone treatment, supporting Hippo pathway involvement in the gonadotropin-independent portion of folliculogenesis. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that AKAP13 mediates Hippo-regulated changes in granulosa cell growth via mechanotransduction and pharmacomanipulation. The AKAP13 regulation of the Hippo pathway may represent a potential target for regulation of follicle activation. (Fertil Steril Sci (R) 2022;3:118-29.

AB  - Despite aggressive, multimodal therapies, the prognosis of patients with refractory or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has not improved in four decades. Because RMS resembles skeletal muscle precursor cells, differentiation-inducing therapy has been proposed for patients with advanced disease. In RAS-mutant PAX fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) preclinical models, MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi) induces differentiation, slows tumor growth, and extends survival. However, the response is short-lived. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating FN-RMS differentiation could improve differentiation therapy. In this study, we identified a role in FN-RMS differentiation for ASAP1, an ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with both proinvasive and tumor-suppressor functions. We found that ASAP1 knockdown inhibited differentiation in FN-RMS cells. Interestingly, knockdown of the GTPases ARF1 or ARF5, targets of ASAP1 GAP activity, also blocked differentiation of FN-RMS. We discovered that loss of ARF pathway components blocked myogenic transcription factor expression. Therefore, we examined the effects on transcriptional regulators. MEKi led to the phosphorylation and inactivation of WW domain-containing transcriptional regulator 1 (WWTR1; TAZ), a homolog of the pro-proliferative transcriptional co-activator YAP1, regulated by the Hippo pathway. However, loss of ASAP1 or ARF1 blocked this inactivation, which inhibits MEKi-induced differentiation. Finally, MEKi-induced differentiation was rescued by dual knockdown of ASAP1 and WWTR1. This study shows that ASAP1 and ARF1 are necessary for myogenic differentiation, providing a deeper understanding of differentiation in FN-RMS and illuminating an opportunity to advance differentiation therapy.Implications: ASAP1 and ARF1 regulate MEKi-induced differentiation of FN-RMS cells by modulating WWTR1 (TAZ) activity, supporting YAP1/TAZ inhibition as a FN-RMS differentiation therapy strategy.

AB  - Abnormalities in genes that regulate early brain development are known risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. Engrailed-2 (En2) is a homeodomain transcription factor with established roles in cerebellar patterning. En2 is highly expressed in the developing mid-hindbrain region, and En2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit major deficits in mid-hindbrain structures. However, En2 is also expressed in forebrain regions including the hippocampus, but its function is unknown. Previous studies have shown that the hippocampus of En2-KO mice exhibits reductions in its volume and cell numbers due to aberrant neurogenesis. Aberrant neurogenesis is due, in part, to noncell autonomous effects, specifically, reductions of innervating norepinephrine fibers from the locus coeruleus. In this study, we investigate possible cell autonomous roles of En2 in hippocampal neurogenesis. We examine proliferation, survival, and differentiation using cultures of hippocampal neurospheres of P7 wild-type (WT) and En2-KO hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs). At 7 days, En2-KO neurospheres were larger on average than WT spheres and exhibited 2.5-fold greater proliferation and 2-fold increase in apoptotic cells, similar to in vivo KO phenotype. Further, En2-KO cultures exhibited 40% less cells with neurite projections, suggesting decreased differentiation. Lastly, reestablishing En2 expression in En2-KO NPCs rescued excess proliferation. These results indicate that En2 functions in hippocampal NPCs by inhibiting proliferation and promoting survival and differentiation in a cell autonomous manner. More broadly, this study suggests that En2 impacts brain structure and function in diverse regions outside of the mid-hindbrain.

AB  - Tzong-Shiue Yu et al. assess the impact of astrocytic ApoE on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. Their results suggest that postnatal ablation of astrocytic APOE reduces dendritic complexity in newborn dentate gyrus neurons and cognitive ability, providing further insight into a role for APOE in injury-induced neurogenesis following TBI.
   Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene confer a major genetic risk for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are predictive of outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Alterations in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have long been associated with both the development of AD and recovery following TBI and ApoE is known to play a role in this process. In order to determine how ApoE might influence hippocampal injury-induced neurogenesis, we generated a conditional knockout system whereby functional ApoE from astrocytes was ablated prior to injury. While successfully ablating ApoE just prior to TBI in mice, we observed an attenuation in the development of the spines in the newborn neurons. Intriguingly, animals with a double-hit, i.e. injury and ApoE conditionally inactivated in astrocytes, demonstrated the most pronounced impairments in the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze test, failing to exhibit spatial memory after both acquisition and reversal training trials. In comparison, conditional knockout mice without injury displayed impairments but only in the reversal phase of the test, suggesting accumulative effects of astrocytic ApoE deficiency and traumatic brain injury on AD-like phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytic ApoE is required for functional injury-induced neurogenesis following traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Calcium influx into neurons triggers neuronal death during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Various calcium channels are involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cav3.2 channel is a main subtype of T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channel blockers, such as pimozide and mibefradil, have been shown to prevent cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced brain injury. However, the role of Cav3.2 channels in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unclear. Here, in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury were established using middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and high glucose hypoxia/reoxygenation exposure in primary hippocampal neurons. The results showed that Cav3.2 expression was significantly upregulated in injured hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. We further established a Cav3.2 gene-knockout mouse model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cav3.2 knockout markedly reduced infarct volume and brain water content, and alleviated neurological dysfunction after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Additionally, Cav3.2 knockout attenuated cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis. In the hippocampus of Cav3.2-knockout mice, calcineurin overexpression offset the beneficial effect of Cav3.2 knockout after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. These findings suggest that the neuroprotective function of Cav3.2 knockout is mediated by calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 signaling. Findings from this study suggest that Cav3.2 could be a promising target for treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

AB  - Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels show a ubiquitous distribution on neurons, in both somatodendritic and axonal regions. SK channels are associated with neuronal activity regulating action potential frequency, dendritic excitability, and synaptic plasticity. Although the physiology of SK channels and the mechanisms that control their surface expression levels have been investigated extensively, little is known about what controls SK channel diffusion in the neuronal plasma membrane. This aspect is important, as the diffusion of SK channels at the surface may control their localization and proximity to calcium channels, hence increasing the likelihood of SK channel activation by calcium. In this study, we successfully investigated the diffusion of SK channels labeled with quantum dots on human embryonic kidney cells and dissociated hippocampal neurons by combining a single-particle tracking method with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We observed that actin filaments interfere with SK mobility, decreasing their diffusion coefficient. We also found that during neuronal maturation, SK channel diffusion was gradually inhibited in somatodendritic compartments. Importantly, we observed that axon barriers formed at approximately days in vitro 6 and restricted the diffusion of SK channels on the axon initial segment (AIS). However, after neuron maturation, SK channels on the AIS were strongly immobilized, even after disruption of the actin network, suggesting that crowding may cause this effect. Altogether, our work provides insight into how SK channels diffuse on the neuronal plasma membrane and how actin and membrane crowding impacts SK channel diffusion.

AB  - Maternal alcohol consumption is one of the strong predictive factors of alcohol use and consequent abuse; however, investigations of sex differences in response to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are limited. Here we compared the effects of PAE throughout gestation on alcohol preference, state anxiety and mRNA expression of presynaptic proteins alpha-, beta- and gamma-synucleins in the brain of adult (PND60) male and female Wistar rats. Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampus, midbrain and hypothalamus and mRNA levels were assessed with quantitative RT-PCR. Compared with naive males, naive female rats consumed more alcohol in "free choice" paradigm (10% ethanol vs. water). At the same time, PAE produced significant increase in alcohol consumption and preference in males but not in females compared to male and female naive groups, correspondingly. We found significantly lower alpha-synuclein mRNA levels in the hippocampus and midbrain of females compared to males and significant decrease in alpha-synuclein mRNA in these brain areas in PAE males, but not in females compared to the same sex controls. These findings indicate that the impact of PAE on transcriptional regulation of synucleins may be sex-dependent, and in males' disruption in alpha-synuclein mRNA expression may contribute to increased vulnerability to alcohol-associated behavior.

AB  - Destruction of the blood-brain barrier is a critical component of epilepsy pathology. Several studies have demonstrated that sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 contributes to the modulation of vascular integrity. However, its effect on blood-brain barrier permeability in epileptic mice remains unclear. In this study, we prepared pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus models and pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy models in C57BL/6 mice. S1P1 expression was increased in the hippocampus after status epilepticus, whereas tight junction protein expression was decreased in epileptic mice compared with controls. Intraperitoneal injection of SEW2871, a specific agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, decreased the level of tight junction protein in the hippocampus of epileptic mice, increased blood-brain barrier leakage, and aggravated the severity of seizures compared with the control. W146, a specific antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, increased the level of tight junction protein, attenuated blood-brain barrier disruption, and reduced seizure severity compared with the control. Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 promoted the generation of interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-a and caused astrocytosis. Disruption of tight junction protein and blood-brain barrier integrity by sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 was reversed by minocycline, a neuroinflammation inhibitor. Behavioral tests revealed that sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 exacerbated epilepsy-associated depression-like behaviors. Additionally, specific knockdown of astrocytic S1P1 inhibited neuroinflammatory responses and attenuated blood-brain barrier leakage, seizure severity, and epilepsy-associated depression-like behaviors. Taken together, our results suggest that astrocytic sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 exacerbates blood-brain barrier disruption in the epileptic brain by promoting neuroinflammation.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) triggers many not yet fully understood pathological changes in the nervous system that can lead to the development of epilepsy. In this work, we studied the effects of SE on the properties of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus in the lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy in rats. The studies were performed 1 day (acute phase), 3 and 7 days (latent phase), and 30 to 80 days (chronic phase) after SE. According to RT-qPCR data, expression of the genes coding for the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 was downregulated in the latent phase, which may lead to the increased proportion of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors that play an essential role in the pathogenesis of many CNS diseases. The efficiency of excitatory synaptic neurotransmission in acute brain slices was decreased in all phases of the model, as determined by recording field responses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in response to the stimulation of Schaffer collaterals by electric current of different strengths. However, the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials increased in the chronic phase, indicating an increased background activity of the glutamatergic system in epilepsy. This was also evidenced by a decrease in the threshold current causing hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock seizure threshold test in rats with temporal lobe epilepsy compared to the control animals. The results suggest a series of functional changes in the properties of glutamatergic system associated with the epilepsy development and can be used to develop the antiepileptogenic therapy.

AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy damages the central nervous system of developing fetus and results in persistent physical and neurobehavioral abnormalities, including learning and memory disorders. The hippocampus which is involved in learning and memory is highly susceptible to the ethanol neurotoxic effects. Oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms in alcohol-induced disorders. Ethanol also interferes with the brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) expression. Using vitamin E as a potent antioxidant, we studied the possible interrelation between oxidative stress and BDNF on cognition. Ethanol (4 g/kg) and vitamin E (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) were given to pregnant Wistar rats on first day of gestation (GD) until weaning (28 days). Oxidative stress marker, BDNF expression, and cyclic AMP-response binding-protein (CREB) expression levels were measured on postnatal days (PND) 28. Object location memory (OLM) was evaluated on PND 34. Our results demonstrated that ethanol exposure significantly reduced glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and carbonyl protein content in the hippocampus. Total BDNF, BDNF mRNA, and CREB expression significantly reduced in the hippocampus by ethanol exposure. Also, ethanol significantly reduced the discrimination index (DI) in the OLM test. In addition, vitamin E administration could reduce oxidative stress, increase significantly BDNF and CREB levels, and improve cognitive dysfunction induced by ethanol exposure. Collectively, results suggest that probably oxidative stress can interrelate with the BDNF system for modulating cognitive function in the ethanol-exposed rat.

AB  - Historically, multigenerational health and disease transmission have primarily focused on genetic inheritance. However, the discovery that beneficial microorganisms known as commensal microbiota outnumber human genes tenfold has reshaped this perspective, highlighting their critical role in maintaining homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Unlike the human genome, commensal microbiota is not genetically inherited but is acquired anew with each generation. with initial gut colonization playing a pivotal role in shaping an infant's immune system, neurodevelopment, and long-term health, all heavily influenced by maternal factors. In this review, we examine emerging research on maternal microbial influences on the fetus beginning in utero. We provide an updated overview of the current insights into the impact of the vaginal microbiome during parturition on offspring immunity and discuss the potential long-term health implications for infants born via cesarean section. We explore the advantages and limitations of techniques designed to mitigate these effects, such as vaginal seeding and emphasize that the development of the neonatal immune system is a dynamic process influenced by maternal factors beyond birth, including the transfer of microbiota through breast milk and skin contact. Finally, we present gaps in current research and propose future research directions to deepen our understanding of the impacts of the maternal microbiome on her child. Together, these insights demonstrate how maternal influence on offspring health and immunity extends beyond genetic factors, encompassing the transmission of microbiota, which, in turn, has profound long-term implications for health and disease resilience, offering a novel perspective on intergenerational health dynamics.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent problems in speech, social interaction, restricted and repetitive behavior patterns, lack of interest, and intellectual disabilities. Currently, there is no effective treatment available for the core symptoms of ASD. Among various treatments, herbal pharmacological treatments have shown promising results with fewer side effects, especially cannabidiol (CBD) treatment for the core symptoms and co-morbidities of ASD. The current study was performed to explore the therapeutic potential of CBD oil supplementation against the valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism mouse model. The autism mouse model was developed by exposing albino BALB/c mouse fetuses to VPA (600 mg/kg) on gestational day 13. On postnatal day (PND)-21, the male pups from both control and diseased groups were further divided into the following treatment groups: (I) control saline group, (II) VPA-exposed group, (III) VPA + CBD oil (100 mg/kg/day/orally) group, and (IV) standard group of VPA + risperidone (RISP) (0.5 mg/kg/day/orally) for 3 consecutive weeks. VPA mice displayed autistic behaviors upon delivery, such as increased anxiety levels, delayed response to painful stimuli, and impaired social interaction. VPA mice also showed depletion of glutathione and other antioxidant levels. CBD oil improved these dysfunctions, as seen through biochemical analysis and morphological staining of the hippocampal region, prefrontal cortex, and Purkinje cells. These findings showed that CBD oil treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and lowered the oxidative stress in the autistic mouse model by acting as an antioxidant.

AB  - We previously reported that miR-124-3p is markedly upregulated in microglia-derived exosomes following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. However, its impact on neuronal endoplasmic reticulum stress following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury remains unclear. In this study, we first used an HT22 scratch injury model to mimic traumatic brain injury, then co-cultured the HT22 cells with BV2 microglia expressing high levels of miR-124-3p. We found that exosomes containing high levels of miR-124-3p attenuated apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay analysis confirmed that miR-124-3p bound specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein IRE1 alpha, while an IRE1 alpha functional salvage experiment confirmed that miR-124-3p targeted IRE1 alpha and reduced its expression, thereby inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress in injured neurons. Finally, we delivered microglia-derived exosomes containing miR-124-3p intranasally to a mouse model of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and found that endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis levels in hippocampal neurons were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that, after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, miR-124-3 can be transferred from microglia-derived exosomes to injured neurons, where it exerts a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. Therefore, microglia-derived exosomes containing miR-124-3p may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for repetitive mild traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 5-12% of the general population, and the most challenging patients are those with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Its complexity, unpredictability, and difficulties in selecting a treatment plan individually for each patient prompted scientists to look for possible genetic causes of this disease. It was proven that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TAS2R38 gene may affect the mobility and the activity of the ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract what can contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to CRS. There are two common haplotypes: a "protective" type (PAV), and a "non-protective" type (AVI). CRS patients who are homozygous PAV/PAV are considered as less susceptible to the severe course of the disease, whereas patients with AVI/AVI haplotype are more vulnerable. The aim of this study was to examine TAS2R38 gene polymorphisms among CRSwNP patients and control group (N = 544) with the evaluation of the association between the distribution of studied polymorphic variants and the incidence as well as severity of CRSwNP in the study group. Whole blood samples from CRSwNP patients (N = 106) and the control group (N = 438) were analyzed for alleles of the TAS2R38 gene using real-time PCR single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays for rs713598, rs1726866, and rs10246939. PAV (SG: 41%; CG: 49%) and AVI (SG: 59%; CG: 51%) haplotypes were the only ones detected in the study. The AVI haplotypes were 1.5 times more frequent in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.0204; OR = 1.43). AVI/AVI individuals tended to have more severe symptoms in the VAS scale, less QoL in the SNOT-22 test, and a bigger nasal obstruction upon endoscopic examination. Patients with PAV/PAV were twice more likely to have minor changes in preoperative CT scans (p = 0.0158; OR = 2.1; Fi = 0.24). Our study confirmed that the PAV/PAV diplotype might have some protective properties and carrying the AVI haplotype might predispose to the development of CRSwNP.

AB  - Background and AimAnxiety often occurs both concurrently and sequentially in childhood and adolescence in association with prenatal stress, which may reduce the quality of maternal care and then cause mood disorders among children in later life. Against this background, melatonin, as a powerful antioxidant, was used in the present study to ameliorate risk-taking behaviour induced by pure maternal care in rat pups. Materials and MethodsThe Wistar rat dams recruited in this study were exposed to restraint stress from gestational day (GD) 11 until delivery. They further received melatonin (10 mg/kg) during the postnatal days (PNDs) 0-7 by intraperitoneal (IP) injections at 4:00 PM. The pregnant rats were then divided into four groups, namely, control, stress, stress + melatonin and melatonin, and their maternal behaviour and corticosterone levels were measured. In the offspring, the outcomes of some behavioural tasks, including the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open-field (OF) tests were ultimately assessed. ResultsThe study results revealed that the quantity and quality of maternal care significantly declined and the plasma corticosterone levels compounded in the stressed dams. Melatonin treatment, however, improved their nursing behaviour and reduced their plasma corticosterone levels. The offspring performance in two tasks also showed an upward trend in risk-taking behaviour in the stress group, and melatonin administration ameliorated the effects of stress and lessened their anxiety-like behaviour. ConclusionIt was concluded that prenatal restraint stress could impair stress responses and quality of maternal care, whereas postnatal melatonin administration potentially contributed to the normalization of stress reaction and anxiolysis.

AB  - Micromorphological features of vegetative and reproductive organs in plants are considered important because they can be used as taxonomic characters. Asperula cankiriense B. Sahin & Sagiroglu, commonly known as "Cankiri belumu", belongs to the family Rubiaceae and generally occurs in gypsum steppes. This research reports for the first time the micromorphological characteristics of the vegetative and reproductive organs of A. cankiriense using light and scanning electron microscopy. Taxonomically critical diagnostic features, such as raphide crystals, presence and shape of trichomes, leaf cross-section shape, flower structure, and epidermal ornamentation, were described in detail. This study provided up-to-date information on the micromorphology of this newly described species and provided additional systematic information on A. cankiriense. New data about the species are reported here and will contribute to the knowledge about the family Rubiaceae.

AB  - Background: Preventing delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains an important therapeutic target. Preconditioning stimulates multiple endogenous protective mechanisms and may be a suitable treatment for DCI following SAH. We here compare remote limb conditioning with resveratrol conditioning in a clinically relevant SAH model. Methods: We produced a SAH in 39 male Sprague Dawley rats using a single injection model. Animals were randomized to four groups: repetitive limb conditioning with a blood pressure cuff, sham conditioning, intraperitoneal resveratrol (10 mg/kg) or intraperitoneal vehicle administered at 24, 48 and 72 h after SAH. On day 4 neurological and behavioral scores were obtained, and animals were euthanized. The cross-sectional area of the basilar artery was measured at the vertebrobasilar junction, and at the mid and distal segments. Hippocampal cells were counted in both hemispheres and normalized per mm length. We compared true limb preconditioning with sham conditioning and resveratrol with vehicle preconditioning. Results: The cross-sectional area of the mid-basilar artery in the true limb preconditioning group was significantly larger by 43% (p = 0.03) when compared with the sham preconditioning group. No differences in the cross-sectional area were found in the resveratrol-treated group when compared to the vehicle-treated group. We found no differences in the neuro score, behavioral score, and in mean hippocampal neuron counts between the groups.

AB  - Lactate is a major metabolite largely produced by astrocytes that nourishes neurons. ASIC1a, a Na+ and Ca2+- permeable channel with an extracellular proton sensing domain, is thought to be activated by lactate through chelation of divalent cations, including Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+, that block the channel pore. Here, by monitoring lactate-evoked H+ and Ca2+ transport in cultured mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons, we find that stereo-selective neuronal uptake of L-lactate results in rapid intracellular acidification that triggers H+ extrusion to activate plasma membrane ASIC1a channels, leading to propagating Ca2+ waves into the cytosol and mitochondria. We show that lactate activates ASIC1a at its physiological concentrations, far below that needed to chelate divalent cations. The L-isomer of lactate exerts a much greater effect on ASIC1a-mediated activity than the D-isomer and this stereo-selectivity arises from lactate transporters, which prefer the physiologically common L-lactate. The lactate uptake in turn results in intracellular acidification, which is then followed by a robust acid extrusion. The latter response sufficiently lowers the pH in the vicinity of the extracellular domain of ASIC1a to trigger its activation, resulting in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals that accelerate mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, blocking ASIC1a led to a robust mitochondrial ROS production induced by L-lactate. Together our results indicate that ASIC1a is a metabolic sensor, which by sensing extracellular pH drop triggered by neuronal lactate uptake with subsequent proton extrusion, transmits a Ca2+ response that is propagated to mitochondria to enhance lactate catabolism and suppress ROS production.

AB  - Contact unmodified antisense DNA biotechnology (CUADb), developed in 2008, employs short antisense DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) as a novel approach to insect pest control. These oligonucleotide-based insecticides target pest mature rRNAs and/or pre-rRNAs and have demonstrated high insecticidal efficacy, particularly against sap-feeding insect pests, which are key vectors of plant DNA viruses and among the most economically damaging herbivorous insects. To further explore the potential of CUADb, this study evaluated the insecticidal efficacy of short 11-mer antisense DNA oligos against Coccus hesperidum, in comparison with long 56-mer single-stranded and double-stranded DNA sequences. The short oligos exhibited higher insecticidal activity. By day 9, the highest mortality rate (97.66 +/- 4.04%) was recorded in the Coccus-11 group, while the most effective long sequence was the double-stranded DNA in the dsCoccus-56 group (77.09 +/- 6.24%). This study also describes the architecture of the DNA containment (DNAc) mechanism, highlighting the intricate interactions between rRNAs and various types of DNA oligos. During DNAc, the Coccus-11 treatment induced enhanced ribosome biogenesis and ATP production through a metabolic shift from carbohydrates to lipid-based energy synthesis. However, this ultimately led to a 'kinase disaster' due to widespread kinase downregulation resulting from insufficient ATP levels. All DNA oligos with high or moderate complementarity to target rRNA initiated hypercompensation, but subsequent substantial rRNA degradation and insect mortality occurred only when the oligo sequence perfectly matched the rRNA. Both short and long oligonucleotide insecticide treatments led to a 3.75-4.25-fold decrease in rRNA levels following hypercompensation, which was likely mediated by a DNA-guided rRNase, such as RNase H1, while crucial enzymes of RNAi (DICER1, Argonaute 2, and DROSHA) were downregulated, indicating fundamental difference in molecular mechanisms of DNAc and RNAi. Consistently, significant upregulation of RNase H1 was detected in the Coccus-11 treatment group. In contrast, treatment with random DNA oligos resulted in only a 2-3-fold rRNA decrease, consistent with the normal rRNA half-life maintained by general ribonucleases. These findings reveal a fundamental new mechanism of rRNA regulation via complementary binding between exogenous unmodified antisense DNA and cellular rRNA. From a practical perspective, this minimalist approach, applying short antisense DNA dissolved in water, offers an effective, eco-friendly and innovative solution for managing sternorrhynchans and other insect pests. The results introduce a promising new concept in crop protection: DNA-programmable insect pest control.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of E-VCO on the neurobehaviour and intestinal health parameters of obesity-induced rats, focusing on food consumption, body composition, bacterial and faecal organic acids and histological analyses in the hippocampus and colon. A total of 32 male Wistar rats were randomized into healthy (HG, n = 16) and obese groups (OG, n = 16), which consumed a control or cafeteria diet for eight weeks, respectively. After this period, they were subdivided into four groups: healthy (HG, n = 8); healthy treated with E-VCO (HGCO, n = 8); obese (OG, n = 8); obese treated with E-VCO (OGCO, n = 8), continuing for another eight weeks with their respective diets. The treated groups received 3000 mg kg(-1) of E-VCO and control groups received water via gavage. Food preference, body weight gain, body composition, anxiety- and depression-like behaviour were evaluated. Bacteria and organic acids were evaluated in faeces, and histological analyses of the hippocampus and M1 and M2 macrophages in the colon were performed. E-VCO reduced energy intake (16.68%) and body weight gain (16%), although it did not reduce the fat mass of obese rats. E-VCO showed an antidepressant effect, increased lactic acid bacteria counts and modulated organic acids in obese rats. Furthermore, E-VCO protected the hippocampus from neuronal degeneration caused by the obesogenic diet, decreased the M1 macrophage and increased the M2 macrophage population in the gut. The results suggest neurobehavioural modulation and improved gut health by E-VCO, with promising effects against obesity-related comorbidities.

AB  - Hypertension is reported to cause major brain disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), apart from cardiovascular and chronic kidney disorders. Considering this, for the first time, we explored the effect of modulation of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis using diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced PD model. We found that DIZE treatment improved neuromuscular coordination and locomotor deficits in the 6-OHDA induced PD rat model. Further, the DIZE-mediated activation of ACE2 led to increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporters (DAT) expression in the rat brain, indicating the protection of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons from 6-OHDA induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, 6-OHDA induced activation of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and release of neuroinflammatory mediators were attenuated by DIZE treatment in both in vitro as well as in vivo models of PD. DIZE exerted its effect by activating ACE2 that produced Ang (1-7), a neuroprotective peptide. Ang (1-7) conferred its neuroprotective effect upon binding with the G-protein-coupled MAS receptor that led to the upregulation of cell survival proteins while downregulating apoptotic proteins. Importantly, these findings were further validated by using A-779, a MasR antagonist. The result showed that treatment with A-779 reversed the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of DIZE by decreasing glial activation and neuroinflammatory markers. Although the role of ACE2 in PD pathology needs to be additionally confirmed using transgenic models in either ACE2 overexpressing or knockout mice, still, our study demonstrates that enhancing ACE2 activity could be a novel approach for ameliorating PD pathology.

AB  - Angiotensin II, the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is not only a pivotal peptide implicated in the regulation of blood pressure but also a key mediator of the inflammatory processes that play an important role in the pathology of hypertension-related cSVD. Harpagide is the major bioactive constituent of Scrophulariae Radix widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for numerous diseases including hypertension. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of harpagide on Ang II-induced neuroinflammation and the potential mechanism. Pretreated with harpagide or resatorvid (the TLR4 pathway inhibitor), BV2 cells were treated with Ang II or LPS (the TLR4 activator). NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, the proteins on TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway and the expression of CD86, CD206, TREM2 in BV2 cells were detected respectively. Subsequently, the effects of harpagide on neurotoxicity and BBB destruction triggered by Ang II-induced neuroinflammation were investigated in the co-cultures of BV2 microglia/HT22 hippocampal neurons, BV2 microglia/bEnd.3 endotheliocyte and BV2 microglia/BBB monolayer model. We found that Ang II converted microglia into M1 state and resulted in neuroinflammation through activating TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. It also triggered the imbalance of TLR4/TREM2 in microglia. Ang II-mediated inflammation microglia further led to neuronal apoptosis and BBB damage. Harpagide showed the effect of alleviating Ang II-mediated neuroinflammation as well as the resulting neurotoxicity and BBB destruction through inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B pathway. The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect of harpagide suggested that it might be a potential therapeutic strategy in hypertensive cSVD.

AB  - Inhibition of glycogen breakdown blocks memory formation in young animals, but it stimulates the maintenance of the long-term potentiation, a cellular mechanism of memory formation, in hippocampal slices of old animals. Here, we report that a 2-week treatment with glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor BAY U6751 alleviated memory deficits and stimulated neuroplasticity in old mice. Using the 2-Novel Object Recognition and Novel Object Location tests, we discovered that the prolonged intraperitoneal administration of BAY U6751 improved memory formation in old mice. This was accompanied by changes in morphology of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons, and by "rejuvenation" of hippocampal proteome. In contrast, in young animals, inhibition of glycogen degradation impaired memory formation; however, as in old mice, it did not alter significantly the morphology and density of cortical dendritic spines. Our findings provide evidence that prolonged inhibition of glycogen phosphorolysis improves memory formation of old animals. This could lead to the development of new strategies for treatment of age-related memory deficits.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD), one of the major consequences after stroke, is the second reason for the cognitive decline in aged people. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered as the main cause for cognitive impairment in VaD patients. In our previous study, a synthetic compound, 4-trifluoromethyl-(E)-cinnamoyl] L-4-F phenylalanine acid (AE-18), has been proven to decrease infarct volume and to recover the insufficient blood supply after ischemia-reperfusion in rats, which was reminded that AE-18 may possess the ameliorative effect in CCH. In this study, the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion was performed to establish the CCH model in rats to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of AE-18 in CCH. Results showed that AE-18 (S and 10 mg/kg, i.g.) could recover the learning and memory and increase the number of neurons in the hippocampus, which may be attributed to its neurogenesis effects and its recovery of cerebral blood flow in CCH rats. In addition, the in vitro studies showed that AE-18 promoted neuronal proliferation, induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells into a neuron-like morphology, and accelerated the establishment of axondendrite polarization of primary hippocampal neurons through upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor via the PI3K/Akt/ CREB pathway. In conclusion, AE-18 is a promising candidate for the treatment of cognitive decline after CCH injury by restoring blood supply to the brain and promoting neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - BackgroundAtherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is a risk factor for ischemic and hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) for which autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) appears to be a promising therapy. However, MSCs from ARAS patients exhibit impaired function, senescence, and DNA damage, possibly due to epigenetic mechanisms. Hypoxia preconditioning (HPC) exerts beneficial effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, and gene and protein expression. We hypothesized that HPC could influence MSC function and senescence in ARAS by epigenetic mechanisms and modulating gene expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes.MethodsAdipose-derived MSC harvested from healthy control (N =8) and ARAS (N =8) pigs were cultured under normoxia (20%O-2) or hypoxia (1%O-2) conditions. MSC function was assessed by migration, proliferation, and cytokine release in conditioned media. MSC senescence was evaluated by SA-beta -gal activity. Specific pro-angiogenic and senescence genes were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot blotting was used to measure global genome 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels on DNA and Western blotting of modified histone 3 (H3) proteins to quantify tri-methylated lysine-4 (H3K4me3), lysine-9 (H3K9me3), and lysine-27 (H3K27me3) residues.ResultsSpecific pro-angiogenic genes in ARAS assessed by RT-PCR were lower at baseline but increased under HPC, while pro-senescence genes were higher in ARAS at baseline as compared healthy MSCs. ARAS MSCs under basal conditions, displayed higher H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and 5hmC levels compared to healthy MSCs. During HPC, global 5hmC levels were decreased while no appreciable changes occurred in histone H3 tri-methylation. ARAS MSCs cultured under HPC had higher migratory and proliferative capacity as well as increased vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor expression compared to normoxia, and SA-beta -gal activity decreased in both animal groups.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that swine ARAS MSCs have decreased angiogenesis and increased senescence compared to healthy MSCs and that HPC mitigates MSC dysfunction, senescence, and DNA hydroxymethylation in ARAS MSC. Thus, HPC for MSCs may be considered for their optimization to improve autologous cell therapy in patients with nephropathies.

AB  - Depression is emerging as a social and health-related issue worldwide. Rice bran possesses a variety of biological properties; however, its potential efficacy and molecular mechanisms in depression remain unclear. This study investigated the antidepressant effects of rice bran supplement (RBS) in a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression. RBS was administered to mice subjected to CRS for 5 weeks. RBS improved depressive symptoms in CRS-exposed mice, as evidenced by increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time. It reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones. Additionally, RBS downregulated the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway and upregulated the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, RBS increased neurotransmitter levels and decreased monoamine oxidase levels in the brain. Molecular docking analysis indicated that gamma-oryzanol (ORY) interacts with GR. Moreover, ORY inhibited GR activity in GR-transfected HEK293T cells. The effects of ORY were not significantly altered by treatment with GR antagonist mifepristone or GR siRNA, suggesting ORY functions as a GR antagonist. Additionally, ORY administration improved depressive behaviors in CRS-exposed mice and modulated the imbalance of HPA axis-related hormones in mice. Mechanisms of action in the RBS were partially attributed by ORY, a key component of RBS, suggesting that ORY contributes synergistically to the effect of RBS. Thus, RBS administration could be a promising therapeutic approach to treating CRS-induced depression.
   RBS alleviates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors by modulating the HPA axis, increasing neurotransmitter levels, downregulating GR, and enhancing ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling. gamma-Oryzanol, a major component, acts as a GR antagonist, contributing to RBS's antidepressant effects.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a complication of the central nervous system (CNS) often occurred after surgery or anesthesia in the elder patients. Mind bomb-2 (MIB2) has been reported to modulate neuronal functions. Here, we aimed to study whether MIB2 exerts roles in the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on mice hippocampal neurons and function, and how. Aging male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to sevoflurane administration, and primary hippocampal neurons were adopted to study sevoflurane effects in vitro. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay were used to study the protein expression of MIB2. CCK-8 assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining were performed to evaluate cell viability and cell death, respectively. Ferroptosis-related indicators malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and iron levels were checked through indicated ELISA kits. Co-immunoprecipitation was adopted to study the binding effects of MIB2 to GPX4. We found that sevoflurane anesthesia increased MIB2 expression in mice hippocampus tissues and neurons. Knockdown of MIB2 alleviated neuron death and ferroptosis induced by sevoflurane exposure. Downregulated MIB2 enhanced GPX4 stability and reduced its ubiquitination. MIB2 was verified to bind to GPX4. The effects of MIB2 knockdown on the neuron death and ferroptosis can be reversed by further siGPX4 transfection. In vivo results also showed that MIB2 knockdown reduced hippocampal neuron death, ferroptosis, and cognitive impairments in the sevoflurane-exposed mice. Taking all together, downregulation of MIB2 could alleviate the sevoflurane-anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction and neuron injury through reducing ferroptosis via GPX4. Our results also provide novel directions for POCD treatment using anti-MIB2-related drugs or strategies.

AB  - Hippocampal function can be impaired by diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity. Abelmoschus esculentus (AE) fractions reportedly mitigate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by downregulating dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)-mediated insulin resistance. AE extracted by alcohol (fraction 1, F1) and water (fraction 2, F2) contained quercetin glycosides and polysaccharides, respectively. In this study, we investigated whether AE affects hippocampal function in in vitro and in vivo systems. Our results indicate that F1 or F2 enhanced neurogenesis and synapse formation in palmitate-treated hippocampal neural cells, presumably by downregulating DPP-4. In db/db mice fed with high fat diet, the hippocampal insulin resistance correlated spatial recognition, with fraction F2 improving hippocampal function. Of note, the alteration of neurogenesis seems interconnecting with changes in gut microbiota. In summary, AE can improve hippocampal function, attenuate insulin resistance, and promote neurogenesis by regulating DPP-4. AE, particularly F2, has the potential to serve as an adjuvant in preventing DM-associated AD.

AB  - Multiple molecular targets have been identified to mediate membrane-delimited and nongenomic effects of natural and synthetic steroids, but the influence of steroid metabolism on neuroactive steroid signaling is not well understood. To begin to address this question, we set out to identify major metabolites of a neuroprotective synthetic steroid 20-oxo5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-yl L-glutamyl 1-ester (pregnanolone glutamate, PAG) and characterize their effects on GABAA and NMDA receptors (GABARs, NMDARs) and their influence on zebrafish behavior. Gas chromatography- mass spectrometry was used to assess concentrations of PAG and its metabolites in the hippocampal tissue of juvenile rats following intraperitoneal PAG injection. PAG is metabolized in the peripheral organs and nervous tissue to 20-oxo-17 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-yl L-glutamyl 1-ester (17-hydroxypregnanolone glutamate, 17-OH-PAG), 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one (pregnanolone, PA), and 3 alpha,17 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one (17-hydroxypregnanolone, 17-OH-PA). Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrate that PA and 17-OH-PA are potent positive modulators of GABARs, while PAG and 17-OH-PA have a moderate inhibitory effect at NMDARs. PAG, 17-OH-PA, and PA diminished the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae in a dose-dependent manner. Our results show that PAG and its metabolites are potent modulators of neurotransmitter receptors with behavioral consequences and indicate that neurosteroid-based ligands may have therapeutic potential.

AB  - Background: Equine milk, including its whey proteins, is a source of nutrients and functional components in the human diet, and is especially beneficial for people with weakened immune systems, newborns, and athletes. Objectives Whey proteins in equine milk constitute approximately 20% of the total protein content and include various fractions such as albumin, globulin, and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is one of the most extensively studied whey proteins in equine milk. Methods: HPLC-Mass analysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, modeling of 3D structure and biological activity in silico. Results: It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, making it a promising candidate for influencing the various aspects of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. The products of Lactoferrin hydrolysis by trypsin were confirmed using HPLC. The half-lives of the hydrolysate in the bloodstream and in an intestine-like environment were predicted in silico. Various biological activities (antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic) were also estimated in silico and compared with the corresponding activities of lactoferrin hydrolysate amino acid sequences from camel and dromedary milk. Conclusions: The three-dimensional modeling of lactoferrin hydrolysate peptides was performed to support the development of computational models or simulations, as well as to investigate their potential antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or immune-modulating functions in clinical or nutritional applications.

AB  - The Preyssler-type polyoxotungstate ({P5W30}) belongs to the family of polyanionic metal-oxides formed by group V and VI metal ions, such as V, Mo and W, commonly known as polyoxometalates (POMs). POMs have demonstrated inhibitory effect on a significant number of ATP-binding proteins in vitro. Purinergic P2 receptors, widely expressed in eukaryotic cells, contain extracellularly oriented ATP-binding sites and play many biological roles with health implications. In this work, we use the immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells in culture to study the effects of {P5W30} on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration were monitored using fluorescence microscopy of HT-22 cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo3. 31P-Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of {P5W30} indicate its stability in the medium used for cytosolic Ca2+ measurements for over 30 min. The findings reveal that addition of {P5W30} to the extracellular medium induces a sustained increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration within minutes. This Ca2+ increase is triggered by extracellular Ca2+ entry into the cells and is dose-dependent, with a half-of-effect concentration of 0.25 +/- 0.05 mu M {P5W30}. In addition, after the {P5W30}-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increase, the transient Ca2+ peak induced by extracellular ATP is reduced up to 100% with an apparent half-of-effect concentration of 0.15 +/- 0.05 mu M {P5W30}. Activation of metabotropic purinergic P2 receptors affords about 80% contribution to the increase of Fluo3 fluorescence elicited by {P5W30} in HT-22 cells, whereas ionotropic receptors contribute, at most, with 20%. These results suggest that {P5W30} could serve as a novel agonist of purinergic P2 receptors.

AB  - Microglial polarization modulation has been considered the potential therapeutic strategy for relieving cognitive impairment in sepsis survivors. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a water-soluble polyphenolic natural compound, processes a strong protective effect on various types of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, depression, and anxiety. However, its role and potential molecular mechanisms in sepsis-associated cognitive impairment remain unclear. To investigate the preventive and therapeutic effect of RA on sepsis-associated cognitive impairment and elucidate the potential mechanism of RA on regulating microglial polarization, we established a CLP-induced cognitive impairment model in mice and a lipopolysaccharide-induced microglia polarization cell model in BV-2. RACK1 siRNA was designed to identify the potential molecular mechanism of RACK1 on microglial polarization. The preventive and therapeutic effect of RA on cognitive impairment followed by PET-CT and behavioral tests including open-field test and tail suspension test. RACK1/HIF-1 alpha pathway and microglial morphology in the hippocampus or BV-2 cells were measured. The results showed that RA significantly ameliorated the CLP-induced depressive and anxiety-like behaviors and promoted whole-brain glucose uptake in mice. Moreover, RA markedly improved CLP-induced hippocampal neuron loss and microglial activation by inhibiting microglial M1 polarization. Furthermore, experiments showed RACK1 was involved in the regulation of LPS-induced microglial M1 polarization via HIF-1 alpha, and RA suppressed lipopolysaccharide or sepsis-associated microglial M1 polarization via RACK1/HIF-1 alpha pathway (rescued the decrease of RACK1 and increase of HIF-1 alpha). Taken together, RA could be a potential preventive and therapeutic medication in improving cognitive impairment through RACK1/HIF-1 alpha pathway-regulated microglial polarization.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Angelica Sinensis Radix (ASR) is a commonly used Chinese medicine known for its effects on tonifying blood, promoting blood circulation, and alleviating pain associated with menstrual regulation. Additionally, it has been used in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The primary pharmacodynamic agent within ASR is volatile oil of Angelica Sinensis Radix (VOASR), which has demonstrated efficacy in combating cognitive impairment, although its mechanism remains unclear.Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying VOASR's improvement of cognitive function in cerebral ischemic mice.Methods: A model of cerebral ischemic mice was established through unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) surgery, followed by intervention with VOASR. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, while RT-qPCR was utilized to measure the differential expression of miR-301a-3p in the hippocampus. To evaluate cognitive function and hippocampal protein differences, wild-type mice and miR301a-3p knockout mice were subjected to the MWM test and iTRAQ protein profiling. The relationship between miR-301a-3p and potential target genes was validated through a Dual-Luciferase Reporter experiment. RTqPCR and Western blot were employed to determine the differential expression of Ppp2ca and synaptic plasticity related proteins in the mouse hippocampus.Results: Intervention with VOASR significantly improved cognitive impairment in cerebral ischemic mice and reduced the expression of miR-301a-3p in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that miR-301a-3p may regulate cognitive function by targeting Ppp2ca. Furthermore, VOASR intervention led to an increase in the expression of Ppp2ca and synaptic plasticity-related proteins. Conclusion: Our study indicates that VOASR may be involved in regulating cognitive function by inhibiting miR301a-3p, consequently increasing the expression of Ppp2ca and synaptic plasticity proteins. These results provide a new target and direction for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (Lats2) is a member of the Hippo pathway, a critical regulator of organ size. Since Lats2 activity may trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, a key pathogenic factor in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this study sought to investigate whether Lats2 deletion confers cardioprotection in AMI. AMI was induced in cardiomyocyte-specific Lats2 knockout (Lats2Cko) and control (Lats2flox) mice. Twenty-eight days after AMI surgery, myocardial performance and mitochondrial homeostasis were impaired in Lats2flox mice. In contrast, Lats2Cko mice exhibited markedly preserved cardiac structure and contraction/relaxation activity, decreased fibrosis, reduced circulating cardiac injury biomarker levels, and enhanced cardiomyocyte viability. Consistent with these findings, siRNA-mediated Lats2 silencing sustained mitochondrial respiration and inhibited apoptosis in hypoxia-treated HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Notably, Lats2 deficiency inhibited AMI/hypoxia-related mitochondrial fission and inactivated STING/p65 signaling by preventing hypoxia-induced release of mtDNA into the cytosol. Accordingly, pharmacological reactivation of STING signaling abolished the cardioprotective effects of Lats2 ablation. Those data suggest that AMI-induced Lats2 upregulation is associated with impaired cardiomyocyte viability and function resulting from enhanced mitochondrial fission, mtDNA release, and STING/p65 pathway activation.

AB  - Background: Mitophagy plays a critical role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by timely removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. In mammals, PINK1/Parkin is the most classic pathway mediating mitophagy. And the activation of PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy exerts neuroprotective effects during cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). Ligustilide (LIG) is a natural compound extracted from ligusticum chuanxiong hort and angelica sinensis (Oliv.) diels that exerts neuroprotective activity after cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, it still remains unclear whether LIG could attenuates cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) through regulating mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin. Purpose: To explore the underlying mechanism of LIG on PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy in the hippocampus induced by ischemia reperfusion. Methods: This research used the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) animal model and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) as in vitro model. Neurological behavior score, 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) Staining were used to detect the neuroprotection of LIG in MCAO/R rats. Also, the levels of ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and activities of Na+-K+-ATPase were detected to reflect mitochondrial function. Moreover, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fluorescence microscope were used to observe mitophagy and the western blot was performed to explore the changes in protein expression in PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. Finally, exact mechanism between neuroprotection of LIG and mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin was explored by cell transfection. Results: The results show that LIG improved mitochondrial functions by mitophagy enhancement in vivo and vitro to alleviate CIRI. Whereas, mitophagy enhanced by LIG under CIRI is abolished by PINK1 deficiency and midivi1, a mitochondrial division inhibitor which has been reported to have the function of mitophagy, which could further aggravate the ischemia-induced brain damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury. Conclusion: LIG could ameliorate the neuronal injury against ischemia stroke by promoting mitophagy via PINK1/ Parkin. Targeting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy with LIG treatment might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemia stroke.

AB  - Herein, we investigate the cognitive effects of a traditional polyherbal formulation, Brahmi Nei (BN) for its effect on cognitive health. Network pharmacological analysis of the bioactives reported in the phytoconstituents of BN was performed by retrieving information from various databases. The in-silico predictions were experimentally validated using in vitro and in vivo models through a combination of biochemical, behavioural and molecular studies. The network pharmacological analysis of the key molecules in BN revealed their ability to modulate molecular targets implicated in memory, cognition, neuronal survival, proliferation, regulation of cellular bioenergetics and oxidative stress. Behavioral studies performed on normal adult rats administered with BN showed a significant improvement in their cognitive performance. Microarray analysis of their brain tissues exhibited an up-regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, learning, neuronal differentiation, extension, regeneration and survival while pro-inflammatory and pro-degenerative genes were down-regulated. The oxygen consumption rate in BN-treated hippocampal cells showed a significant improvement in the bioenergetic health index when compared to untreated cells due to the mitochondrial membrane fortifying effect and antiinflammatory property of the BN constituents. The neuroregenerative potential of BN was manifested in increase in axonal length and neurite outgrowth. Western blots and 2D gel electrophoresis revealed a reduction in pro-apoptotic proteins while increasing Akt and cyclophilin proteins. Taken together, our data reveal that BN, although traditionally used to treat anxiolytic disorders can be explored as a nutraceutical to improve neuronal health as well as a therapeutic option to treat cognitive disorders.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered the most common neurological disorder among people under the age of 50. In modern combat zones, a combination of TBI and organophosphates (OP) can cause both fatal and long-term effects on the brain. We utilized a mouse closed-head TBI model induced by a weight drop device, along with OP exposure to paraoxon. Spatial and visual memory as well as neuron loss and reactive astrocytosis were measured 30 days after exposure to mild TBI (mTBI) and/or paraoxon. Molecular and cellular changes were assessed in the temporal cortex and hippocampus. Cognitive and behavioral deficits were most pronounced in animals that received a combination of paraoxon exposure and mTBI, suggesting an additive effect of the insults. Neuron survival was reduced in proximity to the injury site after exposure to paraoxon with or without mTBI, whereas in the dentate gyrus hilus, cell survival was only reduced in mice exposed to paraoxon prior to sustaining a mTBI. Neuroinflammation was increased in the dentate gyrus in all groups exposed to mTBI and/or to paraoxon. Astrocyte morphology was significantly changed in mice exposed to paraoxon prior to sustaining an mTBI. These results provide further support for assumptions concerning the effects of OP exposure following the Gulf War. This study reveals additional insights into the potentially additive effects of OP exposure and mTBI, which may result in more severe brain damage on the modern battlefield.

AB  - Glutamate neurotoxicity is involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Excess glutamate causes caspase-independent programmed cell death via oxidative stress and calcium influx. Our previous study showed that calpain-1 localizes to both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is cleaved by calpain-1 and translocates to the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation. The autoinhibitory region of calpain-1 conjugated with the cell-penetrating peptide HIV1-Tat (namely Tat-mu CL) specifically prevents the activity of mitochondrial calpain-1 and attenuates neuronal cell death in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa, as well as glutamate-induced cell death in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. In the present study, we constructed a lentiviral vector expressing the Tat-RCL peptide and evaluated its protective effect against glutamate-induced cell death in HT22 cells. Lentiviral transduction with Tat-mu CL significantly suppressed glutamate-induced nuclear translocation of AIF and DNA fragmentation. The findings of the present study suggest that the stable expression of Tat-mu CL may be a potential gene therapy modality for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - SNAREs are undoubtedly one of the core elements of synaptic transmission. Contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons: (1) elongation of STX1A's JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; (2) charge reversal mutations in STX1A's JMD; and (3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1A's TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position-dependent differential effects on Ca2+-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Importantly, we show that STX1A's JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1A's TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1A's JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.

AB  - Background Drosophila melanogaster lipophorin receptors (LpRs), LpR1 and LpR2, are members of the LDLR family known to mediate lipid uptake in a range of organisms from Drosophila to humans. The vertebrate orthologs of LpRs, ApoER2 and VLDL-R, function as receptors of a glycoprotein involved in development of the central nervous system, Reelin, which is not present in flies. ApoER2 and VLDL-R are associated with the development and function of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, important association areas in the mammalian brain, as well as with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders linked to those regions. It is currently unknown whether LpRs play similar roles in the Drosophila brain. Results We report that LpR-deficient flies exhibit impaired olfactory memory and sleep patterns, which seem to reflect anatomical defects found in a critical brain association area, the mushroom bodies (MB). Moreover, cultured MB neurons respond to mammalian Reelin by increasing the complexity of their neurite arborization. This effect depends on LpRs and Dab, the Drosophila ortholog of the Reelin signaling adaptor protein Dab1. In vitro, two of the long isoforms of LpRs allow the internalization of Reelin, suggesting that Drosophila LpRs interact with human Reelin to induce downstream cellular events. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that LpRs contribute to MB development and function, supporting the existence of a LpR-dependent signaling in Drosophila, and advance our understanding of the molecular factors functioning in neural systems to generate complex behaviors in this model. Our results further emphasize the importance of Drosophila as a model to investigate the alterations in specific genes contributing to neural disorders.

AB  - The TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor forms a transcription co-activation complex with the key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ. TEAD-YAP controls the expression of Hippo-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and tumorigenesis. Hyperactivation of TEAD-YAP activities is observed in many human cancers and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival, and immune evasion. Therefore, targeting the TEAD-YAP complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. We previously reported that the mammalian TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4) possess auto-palmitoylation activities and contain an evolutionarily conserved palmitate-binding pocket (PBP), which allows small-molecule modulation. Since then, several reversible and irreversible inhibitors have been reported by binding to PBP. Here, we report a new class of TEAD inhibitors with a novel binding mode. Representative analog TM2 shows potent inhibition of TEAD auto-palmitoylation both in vitro and in cells. Surprisingly, the co-crystal structure of the human TEAD2 YAP-binding domain (YBD) in complex with TM2 reveals that TM2 adopts an unexpected binding mode by occupying not only the hydrophobic PBP, but also a new side binding pocket formed by hydrophilic residues. RNA-seq analysis shows that TM2 potently and specifically suppresses TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities. Consistently, TM2 exhibits strong antiproliferation effects as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor in YAP-dependent cancer cells. These findings establish TM2 as a promising small-molecule inhibitor against TEAD-YAP activities and provide new insights for designing novel TEAD inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency.

AB  - Depression associated with poor general medical condition, such as post-stroke (PSD) or post-myocardial infarction (PMID) depression, is characterized by resistance to classical antidepressants. Special treatment strategies should thus be developed for these conditions. Our study aims to investigate the mechanism of action of 2-morpholino-5-phenyl-6H-1,3,4-thiadiazine, hydrobromide (L-17), a recently designed thiadiazine derivative with putative neuro- and cardioprotective and antidepressant-like effects, using combined in silico (for prediction of the molecular binding mechanisms), ex vivo (for assessment of the neural excitability using c-Fos immunocytochemistry), and in vivo (for direct examination of the neuronal excitability) methodological approaches. We found that the predicted binding affinities of L-17 to serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) and 5-HT3 and 5-HT1A receptors are compatible with selective 5-HT serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antagonists of 5-HT3 and 5-HT1A receptors, respectively. L-17 robustly increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the amygdala and decreased it in the hippocampus. L-17 dose-dependently inhibited 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus; this inhibition was partially reversed by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100135. We suggest that L-17 is a potent 5-HT reuptake inhibitor and partial antagonist of 5-HT3 and 5-HT1A receptors; the effects of L-17 on amygdaloid and hippocampal excitability might be mediated via 5-HT, and putatively mediate the antidepressant-like effects of this drug. Since L-17 also possesses neuro- and cardioprotective properties, it can be beneficial in PSD and PMID. Combined in silico predictions with ex vivo neurochemical and in vivo electrophysiological assessments might be a useful strategy for early assessment of the efficacy and neural mechanism of action of novel CNS drugs.

AB  - The neuronal cell adhesion molecule contactin-4 (CNTN4) is genetically associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders. Cntn4-deficient mouse models have previously shown that CNTN4 plays important roles in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. However, the pathogenesis and functional role of CNTN4 in the cortex has not yet been investigated. Our study found a reduction in cortical thickness in the motor cortex of Cntn4 -/- mice, but cortical cell migration and differentiation were unaffected. Significant morphological changes were observed in neurons in the M1 region of the motor cortex, indicating that CNTN4 is also involved in the morphology and spine density of neurons in the motor cortex. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis identified an interaction partner for CNTN4, confirming an interaction between CNTN4 and amyloid-precursor protein (APP). Knockout human cells for CNTN4 and/or APP revealed a relationship between CNTN4 and APP. This study demonstrates that CNTN4 contributes to cortical development and that binding and interplay with APP controls neural elongation. This is an important finding for understanding the physiological function of APP, a key protein for Alzheimer's disease. The binding between CNTN4 and APP, which is involved in neurodevelopment, is essential for healthy nerve outgrowth.

AB  - Experience and training are known to boost our skills and mold the brain's organization and function. Yet, structural plasticity and functional neurotransmission are typically studied at different scales (large-scale networks, local circuits), limiting our understanding of the adaptive interactions that support learning of complex cognitive skills in the adult brain. Here, we employ multimodal brain imaging to investigate the link between microstructural (myelination) and neurochemical (GABAergic) plasticity for decision-making. We test (in males, due to potential confounding menstrual cycle effects on GABA measurements in females) for changes in MRI-measured myelin, GABA, and functional connectivity before versus after training on a perceptual decision task that involves identifying targets in clutter. We demonstrate that training alters subcortical (pulvinar, hippocampus) myelination and its functional connectivity to visual cortex and relates to decreased visual cortex GABAergic inhibition. Modeling interactions between MRI measures of myelin, GABA, and functional connectivity indicates that pulvinar myelin plasticity interacts-through thalamocortical connectivity-with GABAergic inhibition in visual cortex to support learning. Our findings propose a dynamic interplay of adaptive microstructural and neurochemical plasticity in subcortico-cortical circuits that supports learning for optimized decision-making in the adult human brain.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tibetan ginseng named Wangla (tuber of Coeloglossum viride var. bracteatum) is a traditional tonic that has Yang-strengthening and qi-enhancing, tranquilizing, intelligence-enhancing and longevity-enhancing properties. It has been used to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, anemia and insomnia. Therefore, its characteristic components and neuronal modulating effects were studied.
   Aim of the study: To investigate the elimination of A beta-induced toxicity by CE and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involving BDNF, FGF2, and their related signaling axis, and the RIP1-driven inflammatory pathway.
   Materials and methods: We established A beta-induced toxicity models in cultured neurons and ICR mice, respectively. MWM and fear conditioning tests were performed for behavioral analysis of cognitive functions in mice. Western blot was used to investigate the levels of BDNF, FGF2, and their downstream effector TrkB/Akt/Bcl-2, as well as the RIP1-driven RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway. Immunofluorescence assay is used to examine the status of glial cells.
   Results: CE abrogated A beta toxicity and inhibited apoptosis in cultured neurons, mainly by regulating the BDNF, FGF2, and TrkB/Akt signaling pathways as well as RIP1-driven inflammation and necroptosis. Similarly, mice injected intracerebrally with A beta exhibited cognitive deficits and had elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory factors detected in their serum and brain. However, CE-treated mice showed recovery of cognitive abilities and quelled levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors. Moreover, A beta toxicity led to a reduction in BDNF, FGF2, and related signaling regulators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, accompanied by activation of RIP1-driven inflammatory signaling pathways, and a reduction in TBK1 and Bcl-2. However, CE restored the levels of BDNF, FGF2, and TrkB/Akt signaling pathway, while inhibiting RIP1-induced RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway, thereby antagonizing apoptosis and maintaining neuronal activity.
   Conclusions: CE effectively eliminated the toxicity of A beta in cultured neurons and mouse models, which holds promise for drug development.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy (HIE) in term newborns is a leading cause of mortality and chronic disability. Hypothermia (HT) is the only clinically available therapeutic intervention; however, its neuroprotective effects are limited. Lactoferrin (LF) is the major whey protein in milk presenting iron-binding, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties and has been shown to protect very immature brains against HI damage. We hypothesized that combining early oral administration of LF with whole body hypothermia could enhance neuroprotection in a HIE rat model. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed an LF-supplemented diet (1 mg/kg) or a control diet from (P6). At P7, the male and female pups had the right common carotid artery occluded followed by hypoxia (8% O2 for 60 ') (HI). Immediately after hypoxia, hypothermia (target temperature of 32.5-33.5 degrees C) was performed (5 h duration) using Criticool (R). The animals were divided according to diet, injury and thermal condition. At P8 (24 h after HI), the brain neurochemical profile was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and a hyperintense T2W signal was used to measure the brain lesions. The mRNA levels of the genes related to glutamatergic excitotoxicity, energy metabolism and inflammation were assessed in the right hippocampus. The cell markers and apoptosis expression were assessed using immunofluorescence in the right hippocampus. HI decreased the energy metabolites and increased lactate. The neuronal-astrocytic coupling impairments observed in the HI groups were reversed mainly by HT. LF had an important effect on astrocyte function, decreasing the levels of the genes related to glutamatergic excitotoxicity and restoring the mRNA levels of the genes related to metabolic support. When combined, LF and HT presented a synergistic effect and prevented lactate accumulation, decreased inflammation and reduced brain damage, pointing out the benefits of combining these therapies. Overall, we showed that through distinct mechanisms lactoferrin can enhance neuroprotection induced by HT following neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia.

AB  - Chicory and lucerne are used as specialised forages in sheep or dairy production systems in some parts of the world. Recently, these plants are gaining attention as raw materials in the search for natural antioxidants for use in animal feeds, human foods and nutraceutical formulations. The antioxidant potential of these plants is credited to polyphenols, a subgroup of phytochemicals. Therefore, phenolic characterisation is an essential step before their use as ingredients in animal feeds, human food or nutraceutical preparations. In this study, we performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of polyphenols in chicory and lucerne. Profiling of polyphenols from chicory and lucerne was performed by LC-ESI/QTOF-MS with a total of 80 phenolic compounds identified in chicory and lucerne. The quantification of polyphenols was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography, coupled with a photo diode array (HPLC-PDA). Chicoric acid was the major phenolic acid found in chicory, with the highest concentration (1692.33 +/- 0.04 mu g/g DW) among all the polyphenols quantified in this study. 2-hydroxybenzoic acid was the major phenolic acid found in lucerne, with the highest concentration of 1440.64 +/- 0.04 mu g/g DW. Total phenolic, flavonoids and total tannin contents were measured, and the antioxidant potential was determined by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power, 2,2-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic Acid, Hydroxyl (OH-) Radical Scavenging Activity, Chelating Ability of Ferrous Ion (Fe2+) and Reducing Power (RPA) assays. Both chicory (8.04 +/- 0.33 mg AAE/g DW) and lucerne (11.29 +/- 0.25 mg AAE/g DW) showed high values for Hydroxyl (OH-) Radical Scavenging Activity. The current study allowed us to draw a profile of polyphenols from chicory and lucerne. They provided a molecular fingerprint useful for the application of these plant materials in human foods, animal feeds and pharmaceutical formulations.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is a highly mortal bone tumor, with a high metastatic potential, promoted in part by the enzyme procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2). Increasing level of PLOD2 in osteosarcoma tissue correlates with lymphatic and distant metastasis. The adipokine apelin (APLN) is also found in different cancers and APLN upregulation promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, but its effects on osteosarcoma metastasis are uncertain. We explored APLN functioning in metastatic osteosarcoma. An analysis of records from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database showed higher levels of APLN expression in osteosarcoma tissue than in normal tissue. Similarly, levels of APLN and PLOD2 mRNA synthesis were upregulated in osteosarcoma tissue. Levels of APLN and PLOD2 protein correlated positively with osteosarcoma clinical stages. APLN increased PLOD2 expression in human osteosarcoma cell lines and cell migration via the mammalian Sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1), monopolar spindle-one-binder protein (MOB)1, and YAP cascades, and through hsa_circ_0000004 functioning as a sponge of miR-1303. We also found that knockdown of APLN antagonized lung metastasis in mice with osteosarcoma. APLN may be a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma metastasis.

AB  - Background: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is generally thought to be neuroprotective, yet results have been inconsistent. Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK Biobank. Methods: 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Detailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. We tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter brain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT user status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of administration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the effects of a history of hysterectomy +/- bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users and examined associations by APOE epsilon 4 status. Results: Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter brain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes compared to never-users. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post-menopause was associated with older gray and white matter brain age, larger white matter hyperintensity volume, and smaller hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy +/- bilateral oophorectomy showed younger gray matter brain age relative to MHT users without such history. We found no associations by APOE epsilon 4 status and with other MHT variables. Conclusions: Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history.

AB  - The global increase in the aging population has led to a rise in many age-related diseases with continuing unmet therapeutic needs. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying both aging and neurodegeneration has identified promising therapeutic targets, such as the oxytosis/ferroptosis cell death pathway, in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role. This study focused on sterubin and fisetin, two flavonoids from the natural pharmacopeia previously identified as strong inhibitors of the oxytosis/ferroptosis pathway. Here, we investigated the effects of the compounds on the mitochondrial physiology in HT22 hippocampal nerve cells under oxytotic/ferroptotic stress. We show that the compounds can restore mitochondrial homeostasis at the level of redox regulation, calcium uptake, biogenesis, fusion/fission dynamics, and modulation of respiration, leading to the enhancement of bioenergetic efficiency. However, mitochondria are not required for the neuroprotective effects of sterubin and fisetin, highlighting their diverse homeostatic impacts. Sterubin and fisetin, thus, provide opportunities to expand drug development strategies for anti-oxytotic/ferroptotic agents and offer new perspectives on the intricate interplay between mitochondrial function, cellular stress, and the pathophysiology of aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - It has been shown that anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) can exert anti-hypoxic effect preventing post-hypoxic neuronal hyperexcitability. Yet, exact mechanisms of IL-10 mediated anti-hypoxic action on neuronal function are not fully understood. We suggested that IL-10 can exert its anti-hypoxic action via modulation of activity of two-pore potassium TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels. To study the involvement of TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels we employed a combination of whole-cell patch clamp and pharmacological inhibitory analysis to assess if IL-10 and brief hypoxic episode can modulate K+ background leak current (I-leak) and membrane input resistance (R-in) in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner can significantly increase I-leak with concomitant reduction in R-in. Neurons that were exposed to brief hypoxic episode on contrary showed significant decrease in I-leak with concomitant increase in R-in. Pretreatment with IL-10 prior hypoxic episode was able to abolish negative effect of hypoxia on I-leak and R-in. IL-10 potentiating action on I-leak and R-in was occluded by co-addition of selective blockers of TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels - ML365 and PK-THPP. Co-addition of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase occluded IL-10 action on I(leak )and R-in showing involvement of PI3K-associated pathway in IL-10 mediated regulation of TASK channel function. Our results provide new insights into IL-10 mediated neuroprotective and anti-hypoxic actions showing TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels as downstream targets of this anti-inflammatory cytokine.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the value of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the brain extraction tool (BET) algorithm in evaluating the cranial nerve function of patients with delirium in intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 100 patients with delirium in hospital were studied, and 20 healthy volunteers were used as control. All the subjects were examined by MRI, and the images were analyzed by the BET algorithm, and the convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm was introduced for comparison. The application effects of the two algorithms were analyzed, and the differences of brain nerve function between delirium patients and normal people were explored. The results showed that the root mean square error, high frequency error norm, and structural similarity of the BET algorithm were 70.4%, 71.5%, and 0.92, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the CNN algorithm (P < 0.05). Compared with normal people, the ReHo values of pontine, hippocampus (right), cerebellum (left), midbrain, and basal ganglia in delirium patients were significantly higher. ReHo values of frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe and anisotropy scores (FA) of cerebellums (left), frontal lobe, temporal lobe (left), corpus callosum, and hippocampus (left) decreased significantly. The average diffusivity (MD) of medial frontal lobe, superior temporal gyrus (right), the first half of cingulate gyrus, bilateral insula, and caudate nucleus (left) increased significantly (P < 0.05). MRI based on the deep learning algorithm can effectively improve the image quality, which is valuable in evaluating the brain nerve function of delirium patients. Abnormal brain structure damage and abnormal function can be used to help diagnose delirium.

AB  - L-Theanine, a natural amino acid found in green tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves, is known for its diverse psychotropic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of L-theanine on melanin production and uncover its regulatory mechanism. We evaluated the anti-melanogenic activities of L-theanine in vitro and in vivo. In B16F10 murine melanoma cells induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, melanin content and intracellular tyrosinase activity were determined, and melanogenesis-related protein expression and signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. Melanin reduction was further assessed using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) test. L-Theanine reduced the intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin content of B16F10 cells. It also attenuated the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins, such as microphthalmia- associated transcription factor, tyrosinase (TYR), TYR-related protein-1, and dopachrome tautomerase. L-Theanine modulated the protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP responder element binding protein (CREB), phosphorylation of/protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), and beta-catenin. The antimelanogenic activity of L-theanine (<2 mg/mL) was further confirmed using zebrafish larvae. L-Theanine inhibited melanogenesis by downregulating the PKA/CREB and Akt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathways. In summary, L-theanine shows potential as a skin-whitening compound, warranting further investigation for its possible applications in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.

AB  - Aluminum is a ubiquitous metal that causes multiple brain pathologies such as, cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease like symptoms. Exposure to aluminum through drinking water is responsible for hampering learning and memory. This study aimed to compare (1) the time-dependent effect of aluminum exposure (keeping total exposure of 5850 mg/kg same) in two durations, 30 and 45 days, and (2) to compare post-exposure self-recovery effect after 20 days in both (30 and 45 days exposure) groups. Rats were given 130 and 195 mg/kg of AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O for 45 and 30 days respectively, to see the time-dependent exposure effect. At the end of exposure, rats were given distilled water and allowed to self-recover for 20 days to study the recovery. Expression levels of synaptic genes (Syp, SNAP25, Nrxn1/2, PSD95, Shank1/2, Homer1, CamkIV, Nrg1/2 and Kalrn) were measured using qPCR and compared in the exposure and recovery groups. Cellular morphology of the rat brain cortex and hippocampus was also investigated. Damage in lipid and protein profile was measured by employing FTIR. Results showed downregulation of mRNA expression of synaptic genes, plaques deposition, disorganization in lipid and protein profile by increasing membrane fluidity, and disorder and alteration of protein secondary structure after both exposure periods. However, better improvement/recovery in these parameters were observed in recovery group of 30 days aluminum exposure compared to 45 days aluminum exposure group. Taken together, these results suggested that short-term exposure resulted in better restoration of lipid and protein profile after time-dependent exposure of aluminum than prolonged exposure.

AB  - Incensole acetate (IA) is a major component of Boswellia serrata resin that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective properties. The present study determined the effect of IA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment, and hippocampal cytokines and oxidative stress indicators level. We used 32 Wistar rats (220-250 g weight) randomly divided into four groups. The control group, which only received the saline-diluted DMSO (vehicle); LPS group which received LPS and was treated with the vehicle; and two IA-treated groups which received 2.5 or 5 mg/ kg IA before LPS injection. Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests were performed. Finally, the brains were removed and were used to assess cytokines levels and oxidative stress status. Compared to the LPS group, IA administration reduced the time spent and path traveled to reach the hidden platform during 5 days of learning in MWM while increased the time spent in the target quadrant in the probe test. Moreover, IA increased latency while decreased entry number and time spent in the dark chamber of PA test compared to the LPS group. Additionally, pre-treatment with IA attenuated interleukin(IL)-6, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites levels while increased those of IL-10, total thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Our results indicated that IA improved LPS-induced learning and memory impairments. The observed effects seem to be mediated via a protective activity against neuro-inflammation and brain tissue oxidative damage and through improving BDNF.

AB  - Cholinergic system dysfunction, oxidative damage, and alterations in ion pump activity have been associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones have emerged as a class of compounds with potential therapeutic effects due to their potent anticholinesterase activity. Accordingly, this study investigated the effect of the 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) compound on memory, cholinergic and oxidative stress parameters, ion pump activity, and serum biochemical markers in a scopolamine-induced memory deficit model. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: I-Control; II-Scopolamine; III-DS12 (5 mg/kg) + scopolamine; and IV-DS12 (10 mg/kg) + scopolamine. The animals from groups III and IV received DS12 diluted in canola oil and administered for 7 days by gavage. On the last day of treatment, scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 min after training in an inhibitory avoidance apparatus. Twenty-four hours after scopolamine administration, the animals were subjected to an inhibitory avoidance test and were thereafter euthanized. Scopolamine induced memory deficits, increased acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative damage, and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Pretreatment with DS12 prevented these brain alterations. Scopolamine also induced an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in lymphocytes and whereas butyrylcholinesterase in serum and treatment with DS12 prevented these changes. In animals treated with DS12, no changes were observed in renal and hepatic parameters when compared to the control group. In conclusion, DS12 emerged as an important multitarget compound capable of preventing neurochemical changes associated with memory deficits.

AB  - In higher eukaryotes, tRNA methyltransferase 10A (TRMT10A) is responsible for N1-methylguanosine modification at position nine of various cytoplasmic tRNAs. Pathogenic mutations in TRMT10A cause intellectual disability, microcephaly, diabetes, and short stature in humans, and generate cytotoxic tRNA fragments in cultured cells; however, it is not clear how TRMT10A supports codon translation or brain functions. Here, we generated Trmt10a null mice and showed that tRNAGln(CUG) and initiator methionine tRNA levels were universally decreased in various tissues; the same was true in a human cell line lacking TRMT10A. Ribosome profiling of mouse brain revealed that dysfunction of TRMT10A causes ribosome slowdown at the Gln(CAG) codon and increases translation of Atf4 due to higher frequency of leaky scanning of its upstream open reading frames. Broadly speaking, translation of a subset of mRNAs, especially those for neuronal structures, is perturbed in the mutant brain. Despite not showing discernable defects in the pancreas, liver, or kidney, Trmt10a null mice showed lower body weight and smaller hippocampal postsynaptic densities, which is associated with defective synaptic plasticity and memory.

AB  - Skin aging is the most visible element of the aging process, giving rise to a major concern for many people. Plants from the Ericaceae family generally have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making them potential anti-aging active ingredients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and anti-aging efficacy of a Kalmia angustifolia extract using reconstructed skin substitutes. The safety evaluation was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, while the efficacy was determined by assessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and analyzing skin substitutes reconstructed according to the self-assembly method by histology and immunofluorescence staining (elastin, collagen-1, collagen-3, aquaporin-3). The cell viability assay established the safety of the extract at a concentration up to 200 mu g/mL. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay and a cell-based assay using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) revealed a strong antioxidant activity with an ORAC value of 16 mu mol Trolox Equivalent/mg and a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.37 +/- 0.02 mu g/mL, while an interesting anti-inflammatory activity was found in the inhibition of NO production, with an inhibition percentage of NO production of 49 +/- 2% at 80 mu g/mL. The isolation and characterization of the extract allowed the identification of compounds that could be responsible for these biological activities, with two of them being identified for the first time in K. angustifolia: avicularin and epicatechin-(2 beta-O-7, 4 beta-6)-ent-epicatechin. Histological analyses of skin substitutes treated with the extract showed an increase in dermal thickness compared with the controls. K. angustifolia extract enhanced the expression of elastin and collagen-1, which are usually decreased with skin aging. These results suggest that K. angustifolia has promising antioxidant efficacy and anti-aging potential.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of paeoniflorin (PA) on cognitive impairment and to elucidate its potential mechanisms in MRL/lpr mice, a model of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated cognitive dysfunction. Method: Cognitive performance and behavioral responses were assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests, including the Morris water maze, the Novel object recognition test, and the Y maze. Neuropathological changes in the hippocampal regions were visualized through Nissl, HE and Immunohistochemistry staining. Protein expression levels of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and LC3B were quantified by immunofluorescence, while the ultrastructure of autophagic organelles was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inflammatory cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified in both serum and hippocampal homogenates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The hippocampal expression of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), RAGE, p62, Beclin-1, and key proteins involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including p38MAPK, ERK, and mTOR were analyzed by Western blotting. Result: Paeoniflorin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction, neuronal damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in MRL/lpr mice. Paeoniflorin suppresses RAGE and autophagy levels and P38 MAPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway activation in the hippocampus of MRL/lpr mice. Conclusion: Paeoniflorin may exert its neuroprotective effects by modulating the AGEs/RAGE/P38MAPK/ERK/ mTOR autophagy signaling pathway.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) impairs fetal development. Alcohol consumption was shown to modulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This study aimed to analyze the effects of PAE on the expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) peptide systems in the hippocampus and heart of mice of both sexes. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to alcohol during pregnancy at a concentration of 10% (v/v). On postnatal day 45 (PN45), mouse hippocampi and left ventricles (LV) were collected and processed for messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of components of the RAS and KKS. In PAE animals, more pronounced expression of AT1 and ACE mRNAs in males and a restored AT2 mRNA expression in females were observed in both tissues. In LV, increased AT2, ACE2, and B2 mRNA expressions were also observed in PAE females. Furthermore, high levels of H2O2 were observed in males from the PAE group in both tissues. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of the expression of these peptidergic systems in PAE females may make them less susceptible to the effects of alcohol.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The traditional Chinese medicine formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) has been reported to show therapeutic effect on dementia. Aim of the study: The present study aims to investigate whether DSS treatment could alleviate diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction, and explores its neuroprotective mechanism on db/db mice. Materials and methods: The female db/db mice were randomly divided into model group, DSS low-dose group and DSS high-dose group. Homologous female db/m mice were used as the control group. DSS was intragastric administrated for 15 weeks. Glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, blood glucose and blood lipid levels were measured. Morris water maze was used to measure spatial learning and memory ability in mice. Nissl staining and Tunel staining were used to measure the changes of brain neurons, and ELISA kits were used to measure levels of inflammatory mediators (PGE2, TXB2 and LTB4). The kits detected oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, CAT, GSH-PX), nitrosative stress (NO, iNOS, TNOS) and glucose metabolism (LDH, PK, HK) levels. Western blot and immunofluorescence detected neurotrophic factors (PSD95, BDNF, NGF and SYN), apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xl, Caspase-3) and changes of ER alpha, O-GlcNAc, OGT, OGA levels. Results: Morris water maze results showed that DSS could improve the learning and memory abilities of female db/db mice. Nissl staining showed that DSS could relieve hippocampal neurons damage of db/db mice. In addition, the serological tests showed that DSS could improve the impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, while reduce hyperlipemia in db/db mice. Besides, DSS treatment increased the activities of SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT, and reduced MDA, NO, iNOs, tNOS, PGE2, TXB2 and LTB4 levels. Western blot and immunofluorescence results of PSD95, BDNF, NGF, and SYN showed that DSS could improve the expressions of neurotrophic factors. Meanwhile, Tunel staning and Western blot (Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xl, Caspase-3) results indicated

AB  - Aims: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a redox protein that protects neurons from various injuries. Our study revealed that Trx-1 overexpression improved the learning and memory impairments induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). However, the role of the specific transmission of signals from the SNpc to the hippocampus regulated by Trx-1 in cognition deficits associated with PD is still unknown.Results: We observed that Trx-1 downregulation in the SNpc aggravated cognitive dysfunction induced by MPTP. Importantly, we observed that the SNpc directly projects to the hippocampus. We found that the loss of DAergic neurons in the SNpc induced by MPTP resulted in a decrease in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) expression in the hippocampus, which was promoted by Trx-1 downregulation in the SNpc. The levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the hippocampus were decreased by MPTP and further decreased by Trx-1 downregulation in the SNpc. Finally, the number of synapses in the hippocampus was decreased by MPTP in the hippocampus and further reduced by Trx-1 downregulation in the SNpc.Innovation: Trx-1 downregulation accelerated the loss of DAergic neurons in the SNpc, leading to a decrease in the number dopaminergic projections to the hippocampus, subsequently inhibiting the D1R-ERK1/2-CREB-BDNF pathway in the hippocampus, and ultimately impairing hippocampus-dependent cognition.Conclusions: These results indicate that a decrease in Trx-1 level in the SNpc plays a critical regulatory role in cognitive dysfunction in individuals with PD by decreasing the hippocampal D1R signaling pathway.

AB  - Global aging has led to growing health concerns posed by Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. Aripiprazole is an atypical FDA-approved anti-psychotic drug with potential against AD. To investigate its therapeutic effects on AD pathology, we administered aripiprazole to 5xFAD AD model mice and examined beta-amyloid (beta A)-induced AD-like phenotypes, including beta A production, neuroinflammation, and cerebral glucose metabolism. Aripiprazole administration significantly decreased beta A accumulation in the brains of 5xFAD AD mice. Aripiprazole significantly modified amyloid precursor protein processing, including carboxyl-terminal fragment beta and beta A, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10, and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, as determined by Western blotting. Neuroinflammation, as evidenced by ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation was dramatically inhibited, and the neuron cell layer of the hippocampal CA1 region was preserved following aripiprazole administration. In 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, after receiving aripiprazole, 5xFAD mice showed a significant increase in glucose uptake in the striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus compared to vehicle-treated AD mice. Thus, aripiprazole effectively alleviated beta A lesions and prevented the decline of cerebral glucose metabolism in 5xFAD AD mice, suggesting its potential for beta A metabolic modification and highlighting its therapeutic effect over AD progression.

AB  - Troxerutin is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in nerve impairment. The purpose of this study is to investi-gate the effect of troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injections (TCHis) on prenatal valproic acid (VPA)-exposed rats. The VPA was administered to pregnant rats on gestational day 12.5 to induce a model of autism. The offspring were given the treat-ment of TCHis on postnatal day (PND) 21-50. On PND 43-50, the behavioral analysis of offspring was performed after the treat-ment of TCHis for 1 h. On PND 50, the offspring were harvested and the brains were collected. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were isolated for relevant biochemical detections. The administration of TCHis increased pain sensitivity and improved abnormal social behaviors in prenatal VPA-exposed rats. Prenatal exposure of VPA induced neuronal loss and apoptosis, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoted oxidative stress in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas these effects were reversed by the postnatal treatment of TCHis. In addition, postnatal administration of TCHis amelio-rated mitochondrial function in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of prenatal VPA-exposed rats. This study concluded that post-natal treatment of TCHis reduced oxidative stress and ameliorated abnormal behavior in a prenatal VPA-induced rat model of autism.

AB  - NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cell pyroptosis aggravates the development of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and the aim of this study is to investigate the potential utilization of the Chinese medicine, Puerarin, in treating this disease. Through conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments, the present study illustrated that Puerarin regulated LncRNA double homeobox A pseudogene 8 (DUXAP8)/miR-223-3p axis to inactivate NLRP3-mediated pyroptotic cell death, resulting in the attenuation of I/R injury. Specifically, the cerebral I/R injury in rat models and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in primary hippocampus neuron (PHN) cells were inducted, which were subsequently exposed to Puerarin treatment. As expected, we validated that Puerarin suppressed cell pyroptosis and rescued cell viability in I/R rat hippocampus tissues and H/R PHN cells. Next, through bioinformatics analysis, we noticed that miR-223-3p targeted both LncRNA DUXAP8 and NLRP3 mRNA, and both LncRNA DUXAP8 ablation and miR223-3p overexpression inactivate NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis to rescue cell viability in H/R PHN cells. Interestingly, we evidenced that Puerarin restrained LncRNA DUXAP8 expressions, but upregulated miR-223-3p in I/R rat tissues and H/R PHN cells, and the protective effects of Puerarin on H/R PHN cells were abrogated by overexpressing LncRNA DUXAP8 and silencing miR-223-3p. Collectively, we concluded that Puerarin regulated LncRNA DUXAP8/miR-223-3p/NLRP3 signaling cascade to attenuate I/R injury.

AB  - Gastrodin, which is extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Gastrodia elata Blume, can ameliorate neuro-genesis after cerebral ischemia. However, it's possible underlying mechanisms remain still elusive. PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway is involved in the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) after cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether the beneficial effect of gastrodin on hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia is correlated with the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in primary cultured hippocampal NSCs were used to mimic brain ischemic injury. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was executed to detect spatial learning and memory. Proliferation, differentiation, and mature neurons were examined using immu-nofluorescence. The survival and proliferation of NSCs were assessed by CCK-8 assay and BrdU immunofluo-rescence staining, respectively. ELISA and western blot were used to detect the level of the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. In BCCAO mice, administering gastrodin (50 and 100 mg/kg) for 14 d restored cognitive behaviors; meanwhile, neurogenesis in hippocampus was stimulated, and PDE9 was inhibited and cGMP-PKG was activated by gastrodin. Consistent with the results, administering gastrodin (from 0.01-1 mu mol/L) for 48 h dose-dependently ameliorated the cell viability and promoted greatly the proliferation in primary hippocampal NSCs exposed to OGD/R. Gastrodin further decreased PDE9 activity and up-regulated cGMP-PKG level. KT5823, a PKG inhibitor, markedly abrogated the protective effects of gastrodin on OGD/R-injured NSCs, accompanied by the down-regulation of PKG protein expression, but had no effects on PDE9 activity and cGMP level. Gastrodin could accelerate hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia, which is mediated, at least partly, by PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.

AB  - Epilepsy is a severe neurological disease characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). A complex pathophysiological process referred to as epileptogenesis transforms a normal brain into an epileptic one. Prevention of epileptogenesis is a subject of intensive research. Currently, there are no clinically approved drugs that can act as preventive medication. Our previous studies have revealed highly promising antiepileptogenic properties of a compound-myo-inositol (MI) and the present research broadens previous results and demonstrates the long-term disease-modifying effect of this drug, as well as the amelioration of cognitive comorbidities. For the first time, we show that long-term treatment with MI: (i) decreases the frequency and duration of electrographic SRS in the hippocampus; (ii) has an ameliorating effect on spatial learning and memory deficit associated with epileptogenesis, and (iii) attenuates cell loss in the hippocampus. MI treatment also alters the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein, LRRC8A subunit of volume-regulated anion channels, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R, all expected to counteract the epileptogenesis. All these effects are still present even 4 weeks after MI treatment ceased. This suggests that MI may exert multiple actions on various epileptogenesis-associated changes in the brain and, therefore, could be considered as a candidate target for prevention of epileptogenesis.

TI  - Caspase-6-cleaved Tau fails to induce Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, neurodegeneration, glial inflammation, and cognitive deficits
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
LA  - English
AB  - Active Caspase-6 (Casp6) and Tau cleaved by Casp6 at amino acids 402 (TauD402) and 421 (TauD421) are present in early Alzheimer disease intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which are made primarily of filamentous Tau aggregates. To assess whether Casp6 cleavage of Tau contributes to Tau pathology and Casp6-mediated age-dependent cognitive impairment, we generated transgenic knock-in mouse models that conditionally express full-length human Tau (hTau) 0N4R only (CTO) or together with human Casp6 (hCasp6) (CTC). Region-specific hippocampal and cortical hCasp6 and hTau expression were confirmed with western blot and immunohistochemistry in 2-25-month-old brains. Casp6 activity was confirmed with TauD421 and Tubulin cleaved by Casp6 immunopositivity in 3-25-month-old CTC, but not in CTO, brains. Immunoprecipitated TauD402 was detected in both CTC and CTO brains, but was more abundant in CTC brains. Intraneuronal hippocampal Tau hyperphosphorylation at S202/T205, S422, and T231, and Tau conformational change were absent in both CTC and CTO brains. A slight accumulation of Tau phosphorylated at S396/404 and S202 was observed in Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampal neuron soma of CTC compared to CTO brains. Eighteen-month-old CTC brains showed rare argentophilic deposits that increased by 25 months, whereas CTO brains only displayed them sparsely at 25 months. Tau microtubule binding was equivalent in CTC and CTO hippocampi. Episodic and spatial memory measured with novel object recognition and Barnes maze, respectively, remained normal in 3-25-month-old CTC and CTO mice, in contrast to previously observed impairments in ACL mice expressing equivalent levels of hCasp6 only. Consistently, the CTC and CTO hippocampal CA1 region displayed equivalent dendritic spine density and no glial inflammation. Together, these results reveal that active hCasp6 co-expression with hTau generates Tau cleavage and rare age-dependent argentophilic deposits but fails to induce cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and Tau pathology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder that progress overtime, which is best known for mood swings and loss of cognitive, behavioral and functional abilities. Quercetin is one of the most consumed flavonoids in the diet and has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential neurotherapeutic effect of quercetin and compare it with donepezil. 40 Wister male rats were used and separated into two main groups: Group I: control group; Group II: AD group, which was divided into four subgroups: Group IIA: untreated AD-rats; Group IIB: quercetin treated AD-rats; Group IIC: donepezil treated AD-rats and Group IID: combined group of quercetin and donepezil. Hydrated aluminum chloride (AlCl3.6H(2)O) solution (75 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 6 weeks to induce the AD-like conditions. Morris water maze, behavior test, was used to monitor the cognitive function. Hippocampal tissues were excised for assessment of Alzheimer's parameters and blood samples were obtained for liver and kidney function assessment. According to the final findings, untreated rats presented significantly increased levels of amyloid beta(1-42); tau protein; malondialdehyde; nuclear factor kappa-B; acetylcholinesterase activity, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 upregulation and miRNA-124 downregulation. The best results of treatment were observed in the combination of donepezil and quercetin, as revealed by histopathological observations via H&E and Congo red stains. This study led to the conclusion that quercetin, by targeting several pathogenic pathways, could be used as an adjuvant drug with donepezil for AD treatment.

AB  - Nicotine intake, whether through tobacco smoking or e-cigarettes, remains a global health concern. An emerging preclinical literature indicates that parental nicotine exposure produces behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in subsequent generations. However, the heritable effects of voluntary parental nicotine taking are unknown. Here, we show increased acquisition of nicotine taking in male and female offspring of sires that self-administered nicotine. In contrast, self-administration of sucrose and cocaine were unaltered in male and female offspring suggesting that the intergenerational effects of paternal nicotine taking may be reinforcer specific. Further characterization revealed memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behaviors in drug-naive male, but not female, offspring of nicotine-experienced sires. Using an unbiased, genome-wide approach, we discovered that these phenotypes were associated with decreased expression of Satb2, a transcription factor known to play important roles in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, in the hippocampus of nicotine-sired male offspring. This effect was sex-specific as no changes in Satb2 expression were found in nicotine-sired female offspring. Finally, increasing Satb2 levels in the hippocampus prevented the escalation of nicotine intake and rescued the memory deficits associated with paternal nicotine taking in male offspring. Collectively, these findings indicate that paternal nicotine taking produces heritable sex-specific molecular changes that promote addiction-like phenotypes and memory impairments in male offspring.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population. RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein that plays a crucial role in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases but its precise role in the progression of AD is unclear. The purpose of our study is to understand the role of Rlip in the progression and pathogenesis of AD in mutant APP/ amyloid beta (A & beta;)-expressed mouse primary hippocampal (HT22) hippocampal neurons. In the current study, we used HT22 neurons that express mAPP, transfected with Rlip-cDNA and/or RNA silenced, and studied cell survival, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, immunoblotting & immunofluorescence analysis of synaptic and mitophagy protein's and colocalization of Rlip and mutant APP/A & beta; proteins and mitochondrial length and number. We also assessed Rlip levels in autopsy brains from AD patients and control subjects. We found cell survival was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in Rlip-overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. OCR was increased in Rlip-overexpressed in mAPP-HT22 cells. Mitochondrial function was defective in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA silenced Rlip in HT22 cells, however, it was rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Synaptic and mitophagy proteins were decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells, further reducing RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. However, these were increased in mAPP+Rlip-HT22 cells. Colocalization analysis revealed Rlip is colocalized with mAPP/A & beta;. An increased number of mito-chondria and decreased mitochondrial length were found in mAPP-HT22 cells. These were rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Reduced Rlip levels were found in autopsy brains from AD patients. These observations strongly suggest that Rlip deficiency causes oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction and Rlip overexpression reduced these defects.

AB  - The mechanisms of brain protection during ischaemic reperfusion injury induced by isoflurane (ISO) post-conditioning are unclear. Myocyte enhancement factor 2 (MEF2D) has been shown to promote neural survival in a variety of models, in which multiple survival and death signals converge on MEF2D and modulate its activity. Here, we investigated the effect of MEF2D on the neuroprotective effects of ISO post-conditioning on rats after cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery with ischaemia for 90 minutes and reperfusion for 24-48 hours. After MCAO, neurological status was assessed at 12, 24 and 48 hours by the Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) test. The passive avoidance test (PAT) was used to assess cognition function. Histological and neuropathological evaluations were performed with HE staining and Nissl's staining, respectively. We measured the expression of MEF2D, ERK5, GFAP and caspase-3 by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting, and TUNEL staining to assess the severity of apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 area. We found that MEF2D was involved in nerve protection after I/R injury, and post-treatment of ISO significantly promoted the phosphorylation of ERK5, increased MEF2D transcriptional activity, inhibited the expression of caspase-3 and played a role of brain protection.

AB  - The RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway is associated with the protective effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) against cerebral ischemia. H2S protects rat hippocampal neurons (RHNs) against hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury by promoting phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188. However, effect of H2S on the phosphorylation of ROCK2-related sites is unclear. The present study was designed to investigate whether H2S can play a role in the phosphorylation of ROCK2 at Tyr722, and explore whether this role mediates the protective effect of H/R injury in RHNs. Prokaryotic recombinant plasmids ROCK2wild-pGEX-6P-1 and ROCK2Y722F-pGEX-6P-1 were constructed and transfected into E. coli in vitro, and the expressed protein, GST-ROCK2wild and GST-ROCK2Y722F were used for phosphorylation assay in vitro. Eukaryotic recombinant plasmids ROCK2Y722-pEGFP-N1 and ROCK2Y722F-pEGFP-N1 as well as empty plasmid were transfected into the RHNs. Western blot assay and whole-cell patch-clamp technique were used to detect phosphorylation of ROCK2 at Tyr722 and BKCa channel current in the RHNs, respectively. Cell viability, leakages of intracellular enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and nerve-specific enolase (NSE) were measured. The H/R injury was indicated by decrease of cell viability and leakages of intracellular LDH and NSE. The results of Western blot have shown that NaHS, a H2S donor, significantly promoted phosphorylation of GST-ROCK2wild at Tyr722, while no phosphorylation of GST-ROCK2Y722F was detected. The phosphorylation of ROCK2wild promoted by NaHS was also observed in RHNs. NaHS induced more potent effects on protection against H/R injury, phosphorylation of ROCK2 at Tyr722, inhibition of ROCK2 activity, as well as increase of the BKCa current in the ROCK2Y722-pEGFP-N1-transfected RHNs. Our results revealed that H2S protects the RHNs from H/R injury through promoting phosphorylation of ROCK2 at Tyr722 to inhibit ROCK2 activity and potentially by opening channel currents.

AB  - Findings from recent studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are related to numerous neurological disorders. However, whether miRNAs regulate neuronal anomalies involved in the pathogenesis of depression remain unclear. In the present study, we screened miRNA expression profiles in the CA1 hippocampus of a rat model of depression and found that a specific miRNA, microRNA-211-5p, was significantly down-regulated in depressed rats. When miR-211-5p was up-regulated in these rats, neuronal apoptosis within the CA1 area was suppressed, effects which were accompanied with an amelioration of depression-like behaviours in these rats. These neuroprotective effects of miR-211-5p in depressed rats appear to result through suppression of the Dyrk1A/ASK1/JNK signalling pathway within the CA1 area. In further support of this proposal are the findings that knock-down of miR-211-5p within the CA1 area of normal rats activated the Dyrk1A/ASK1/JNK pathway, resulting in the promotion of neuronal apoptosis and display of depression-like behaviours in these rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate that deficits in miR-211-5p contribute to neuronal apoptosis and thus depression-like behaviours in rats. Therefore, the miR-211-5p/Dyrk1A pathway may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of depression and serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Insulin is known to be a key hormone in the regulation of peripheral glucose homeostasis, but beyond that, its effects on the brain are now undisputed. Impairments in insulin signaling in the brain, including changes in insulin levels, are thought to contribute significantly to declines in cognitive performance, especially during aging. As one of the most widely studied experimental interventions, dietary restriction (DR) is considered to delay the neurodegenerative processes associated with aging. Recently, however, data began to suggest that the onset and duration of a restrictive diet play a critical role in the putative beneficial outcome. Because the effects of DR on insulin signaling in the brain have been poorly studied, we decided to examine the effects of DR that differed in onset and duration: long-term DR (LTDR), medium-term DR (MTDR), and short-term DR (STDR) on the expression of proteins involved in insulin signaling in the hippocampus of 18- and 24-month-old male Wistar rats. We found that DR-induced changes in insulin levels in the brain may be independent of what happens in the periphery after restricted feeding. Significantly changed insulin content in the hippocampus, together with altered insulin signaling were found under the influence of DR, but the outcome was highly dependent on the onset and duration of DR.

AB  - Increased oxidative stress is a crucial factor for the progression of cellular senescence and aging. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of licochalcone D (Lico D) on oxidative stress-induced senescence, both in vitro and in vivo, and explore its potential mechanisms. Hydrogen peroxide (200 mu M for double time) and D-galactose (D-Gal) (150 mg/kg) were used to induce oxidative stress in human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) and mice, respectively. We performed the SA-beta-gal assay and evaluated the senescence markers, activation of AMPK, and autophagy. Lico D potentially reduced oxidative stress-induced senescence by upregulating AMPK-mediated activation of autophagy in hBM-MSCs. D-Gal treatment significantly increased the expression levels of senescence markers, such as p53 and p21, in the heart and hippocampal tissues, while this effect was reversed in the Lico D-treated animals. Furthermore, a significant increase in AMPK activation was observed in both tissues, while the activation of autophagy was only observed in the heart tissue. Interestingly, we found that Lico D significantly reduced the expression levels of the receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the hippocampal tissue. Taken together, our findings highlight the antioxidant, anti-senescent, and cardioprotective effects of Lico D and suggest that the activation of AMPK and autophagy ameliorates the oxidative stress-induced senescence.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a neurological symptom caused by reduced estrogen levels in menopausal women. The Thai traditional medicine, Yakae-Prajamduen-Jamod (YPJ), is a formula consisting of 23 medicinal herbs and has long been used to treat menopausal symptoms in Thailand. In the present study, we investigated the effects of YPJ on cognitive deficits and its underlying mechanisms of action in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, an animal model of menopause. OVX mice showed cognitive deficits in the Y-maze, the novel object recognition test, and the Morris water maze. The serum corticosterone (CORT) level was significantly increased in OVX mice. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were reduced, while the mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of OVX mice. These alterations were attenuated by daily treatment with either YPJ or 17 beta-estradiol. HPLC analysis revealed that YPJ contained antioxidant and phytoestrogen constituents including gallic acid, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin, genistein, and coumestrol. These results suggest that YPJ exerts its ameliorative effects on OVX-induced cognitive deficits in part by mitigating HPA axis overactivation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative brain damage. Therefore, YPJ may be a novel alternative therapeutic medicine suitable for the treatment of cognitive deficits during the menopausal transition.

AB  - Subtype 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu3R) displays a broad range of neuroprotective effects. We previously demonstrated that mGlu3R activation in astrocytes protects hippocampal neurons from A beta neurotoxicity through stimulation of both neurotrophin release and A beta uptake. Alternative-spliced variants of mGlu3R were found in human brains. The most prevalent variant, mGlu3 Delta 4, lacks exon 4 encoding the transmembrane domain and can inhibit ligand binding to mGlu3R. To date, neither its role in neurodegenerative disorders nor its endogenous expression in CNS cells has been addressed. The present paper describes for the first time an association between altered hippocampal expression of mGlu3 Delta 4 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the preclinical murine model PDAPP-J20, as well as a deleterious effect of mGlu3 Delta 4 in astrocytes. As assessed by western blot, hippocampal mGlu3R levels progressively decreased with age in PDAPP-J20 mice. On the contrary, mGlu3 Delta 4 levels were drastically increased with aging in nontransgenic mice, but prematurely overexpressed in 5-month-old PDAPP-J20-derived hippocampi, prior to massive senile plaque deposition. Also, we found that mGlu3 Delta 4 co-precipitated with mGlu3R mainly in 5-month-old PDAPP-J20 mice. We further showed by western blot that primary cultured astrocytes and neurons expressed mGlu3 Delta 4, whose levels were reduced by A beta, thereby discouraging a causal effect of A beta on mGlu34 induction. However, heterologous expression of mGlu3 Delta 4 in astrocytes induced cell death, inhibited mGlu3R expression, and prevented mGlu3R-dependent A beta glial uptake. Indeed, mGlu3 Delta 4 promoted neurodegeneration in neuron-glia co-cultures. These results provide evidence of an inhibitory role of mGluadott in mGlu3R-mediated glial neuroprotective pathways, which may lie behind AD onset.

AB  - We assessed the effects of conventional and ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) electron irradiation on behavioral and cognitive performance one month following exposure and assessed whether these effects were associated with alterations in the number of immune cells in the hippocampus using flow cytometry. Two-month-old female and male C57BL/6J mice received whole-brain conventional or UHDR irradiation. UHDR mice were irradiated with 9 MeV electrons, delivered by the Linac-based/modified beam control. The mice were irradiated or sham-irradiated at Dartmouth, the following week shipped to OHSU, and behaviorally and cognitively tested between 27 and 41 days after exposure. Conventional- and UHDR-irradiated mice showed impaired novel object recognition. During fear learning, conventional- and UHDR-irradiated mice moved less during the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and UHDR-irradiated mice also moved less during the baseline period (prior to the first tone). In irradiated mice, reduced activity levels were also seen in the home cage: conventional- and UHDR-irradiated mice moved less during the light period and UHDR-irradiated mice moved less during the dark period. Following behavioral and cognitive testing, infiltrating immune cells in the hippocampus were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of Ly6G+ CD45+ cells in the hippocampus was lower in conventional- and UHDR-irradiated than sham-irradiated mice, suggesting that neutrophils might be particularly sensitive to radiation. The percentage of Ly6G+ CD45+ cells in the hippocampus was positively correlated with the time spent exploring the novel object in the object recognition test. Under the experimental conditions used, cognitive injury was comparable in conventional and UHDR mice. However, the percentage of CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6+ and CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G- cells in the hippocampus cells in the hippocampus was altered in conventional- but not UHDR-irradiated mice and the reduced percentage of Ly6G+ CD45+ cells in the hippocampus might mediate some of the detrimental radiation-induced cognitive effects.

AB  - Background The relationship between the fluctuation in body size and brain health is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the associations of long-term variability in body mass index (BMI) and waist -to -hip ratio (WHR) with neuroimaging metrics that approximate brain health. Methods This cohort study recruited 1114 participants aged 25-83 years from a multicenter, community -based cohort study in China. We modeled the BMI and WHR trajectories of participants during 2006-2018 and assessed the BMI and WHR variability (direction and speed of change) by calculating the slope. Generalized linear models were applied to investigate the associations of BMI and WHR variability with MRI markers of brain tissue volume, white matter microstructural integrity, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Findings Progressive weight gain during follow-up was associated with lower global fractional anisotropy (beta = -0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.34 to -0.02), higher mean diffusivity (beta = 0.15, 95% CI 0.01-0.30) and radial diffusivity (beta = 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32). Weight loss was also associated with a lower burden of periventricular WMH (beta = -0.26, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.03) and a lower risk of moderate -to -severe basal ganglia enlarged perivascular spaces (BG-EPVS, odds ratio [OR] = 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.83). Among overweight populations, weight loss was linked with smaller volumes of WMH (beta = -0.47, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.15), periventricular WMH (beta = -0.57, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.26), and deep WMH (beta = -0.36, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.03), as well as lower risk of CSVD (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.62), lacune (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.91) and moderate -to -severe BG-EPVS (OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). In adults with central obesity, WHR loss was positively associated with larger gray matter volume (beta = 0.50, 95% CI 0.11-0.89), hippocampus volume (beta = 0.62, 95% CI 0.15-1.09), and parahippocampal gyrus volume (beta = 0.85, 95% CI 0.34-1.37). The sex -stratification and age -stratification analyses revealed similar findings with the main results, with the pattern of associations significantly presented in the individuals at mid-life and late -life. Interpretation Long-term stability of BMI level is essential for maintaining brain health. Progressive weight gain is associated with impaired white matter microstructural integrity. Weight and WHR losses are associated with improved general brain health. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the integrated associations between variations in obesity measures and brain health.

AB  - The prevention of tau protein aggregations is a therapeutic goal for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hydromethylthionine (HMT) (also known as leucomethylthioninium-mesylate [LMTM]), is a potent inhibitor of tau aggregation in vitro and in vivo. In two Phase 3 clinical trials in AD, HMT had greater pharmacological activity on clinical endpoints in patients not receiving approved symptomatic treatments for AD (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and/or memantine) despite different mechanisms of action. To investigate this drug interaction in an animal model, we used tau-transgenic L1 and wild-type NMRI mice treated with rivastigmine or memantine prior to adding HMT, and measured changes in hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) by microdialysis. HMT given alone doubled hippocampal ACh levels in both mouse lines and increased stimulated ACh release induced by exploration of the open field or by infusion of scopolamine. Rivastigmine increased ACh release in both mouse lines, whereas memantine was more active in tau-transgenic Li mice. Importantly, our study revealed a negative interaction between HMT and symptomatic AD drugs: the HMT effect was completely eliminated in mice that had been pre-treated with either rivastigmine or memantine. Rivastigmine was found to inhibit AChE, whereas HMT and memantine had no effects on AChE or on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The interactions observed in this study demonstrate that HMT enhances cholinergic activity in mouse brain by a mechanism of action unrelated to AChE inhibition. Our findings establish that the drug interaction that was first observed clinically has a neuropharmacological basis and is not restricted to animals with tau aggregation pathology. Given the importance of the cholinergic system for memory function, the potential for commonly used AD drugs to interfere with the treatment effects of disease-modifying drugs needs to be taken into account in the design of clinical trials.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self-renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water-driven Ni-Zn micromotor via a self-established electric-chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric-chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni-Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self-established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

AB  - Cognitive deficiency is one of the fundamental characteristics of late-onset depression (LOD). Luteolin (LUT) possesses antidepressant, anti-aging, and neuroprotective properties, which can dramatically enhance cognition. The altered composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is involved in neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis, directly reflects the physio-pathological status of the central nervous system. It is not well known whether the effect of LUT on LOD is in association with a changed CSF composition. Therefore, this study first established a rat model of LOD and then tested the therapeutic effects of LUT using several behavioral approaches. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to evaluate the CSF proteomics data for KEGG pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology annotation. We combined network pharmacology and differentially expressed proteins to screen for key GSEA-KEGG pathways as well as potential targets for LUT therapy for LOD. Molecular docking was adopted to verify the affinity and binding activity of LUT to these potential targets. The outcomes demonstrated that LUT improved the cognitive and depression-like behaviors in LOD rats. LUT may exert therapeutic effects on LOD through the axon guidance pathway. Five axon guidance molecules-EFNA5, EPHB4, EPHA4, SEMA7A, and NTNG-as well as UNC5B, L1CAM, and DCC, may be candidates for the LUT treatment of LOD.

AB  - Background Hippocalcin-like 1 (HPCAL1), a neuronal calcium sensor protein family member, has been reported to regulate cancer growth. As yet, however, the biological functions of HPCAL1 and its molecular mechanisms have not been investigated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Methods HPCAL1 expression in NSCLC samples was detected using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and RT-PCR. The anticancer effects of HPCAL1 knockdown were determined by MTT, soft agar, cell cycle, oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species assays. The effect of HPCAL1 knockdown on in vivo tumor growth was assessed using NSCLC cancer patient-derived xenograft models. Potentially interacting protein partners of HPCAL1 were identified using IP-MS/MS, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays. Metabolic alterations resulting from HPCAL1 knockdown were investigated using non-targeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing analyses. Results We found that HPCAL1 is highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and is positively correlated with low survival rates and AJCC clinical staging in lung cancer patients. Knockdown of HPCAL1 strongly increased oxygen consumption rates and the production of reactive oxygen species. HPCAL1 knockdown also inhibited NSCLC cell growth and patient-derived NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that HPCAL1 can directly bind to LDHA and enhance SRC-mediated phosphorylation of LDHA at tyrosine 10. The metabolomics and RNA sequencing analyses indicated that HPCAL1 knockdown reduces amino acid levels and induces fatty acid synthesis through regulating the expression of metabolism-related genes. Additionally, rescued cells expressing wild-type or mutant LDHA in HPCAL1 knockdown cells suggest that LDHA may serve as the main substrate of HPCAL1. Conclusions Our data indicate that the effect of HPCAL1 knockdown on reducing SRC-mediated LDHA activity attenuates NSCLC growth. Our findings reveal novel biological functions and a mechanism underlying the role of HPCAL1 in NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Psilocybin is a psychedelic with therapeutic potential. While there is growing evidence that psilocybin exerts its beneficial effects through enhancing neural plasticity, the exact brain regions involved are not completely understood. Determining the impact of psilocybin on plasticity-related gene expression throughout the brain can broaden our understanding of the neural circuits involved in psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity. In this study, whole-brain serial two-photon microscopy and light sheet microscopy were employed to map the expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, in male and female mice. The drug-induced c-Fos expression following psilocybin administration was compared to that of subanesthetic ketamine and saline control. Psilocybin and ketamine produced acutely comparable elevations in c-Fos expression in numerous brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, locus coeruleus, primary visual cortex, central and basolateral amygdala, medial and lateral habenula, and claustrum. Select regions exhibited drug-preferential differences, such as dorsal raphe and insular cortex for psilocybin and the CA1 subfield of hippocampus for ketamine. To gain insights into the contributions of receptors and cell types, the c-Fos expression maps were related to brain-wide in situ hybridization data. The transcript analyses showed that the endogenous levels of Grin2a and Grin2b predict whether a cortical region is sensitive to drug-evoked neural plasticity for both ketamine and psilocybin. Collectively, the systematic mapping approach produced an unbiased list of brain regions impacted by psilocybin and ketamine. The data are a resource that highlights previously underappreciated regions for future investigations. Furthermore, the robust relationships between drug-evoked c-Fos expression and endogenous transcript distributions suggest glutamatergic receptors as a potential convergent target for how psilocybin and ketamine produce their rapid-acting and long-lasting therapeutic effects.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to confirm that G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) deficiency affects cognitive function by reducing hippocampal neurogenesis via the PKA/ERK/IGF-I signaling pathway in mice with schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: Mice were divided into four groups, namely, KO Con, WT Con, KO Con, and WT SZ (n = 12 in each group). All mice were accustomed to the behavioral equipment overnight in the testing service room. The experimental conditions were consistent with those in the animal house. Forced swimming test and Y-maze test were conducted. Neuronal differentiation and maturation were detected using immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. The protein in the PKA/ERK/IGF-I signaling pathway was tested using Western blot analysis. Results: GPER1 KO aggravated depression during forced swimming test and decreased cognitive ability during Y-maze test in the mouse model of dizocilpine maleate (MK-801)-induced SZ. Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging results demonstrated that GPER1 knockout reduced adult hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis. Furthermore, GPER1-KO aggravated the hippocampal damage induced by MK-801 in mice through the PKA/ ERK/IGF-I signaling pathway. Conclusions: GPER1 deficiency reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuron survival by regulating the PKA/ERK/IGF-I signaling pathway in the MK-801-induced mouse model of SZ.

AB  - Breast cancer has become the most common form of cancer among women. In recent years, deep learning has shown great potential in aiding the diagnosis of pathological images, particularly through the use of convolutional neural networks for locating lymph node metastasis under gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). However, the massive size of these images at the highest magnification introduces redundant computation during the inference process. Additionally, the diversity of biological textures and structures within WSIs can cause confusion for classifiers, particularly in identifying hard examples. As a result, the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency remains a critical issue for whole-slide image metastasis localization. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network that takes a pair of low-and high-magnification image patches as input for identifying hard examples during the training phase. Specifically, our framework focuses on samples where the outputs of the two magnification networks are dissimilar. We adopt a dual magnification hard mining loss to re-weight the ambiguous samples. To more efficiently locate tumor metastasis cells in whole slide images, the two stream networks are decomposed into a cascaded network during the inference phase. The low magnification WSIs scanned by the low-mag network generate a coarse probability map, and the suspicious areas in the map are refined by the high-mag network. Finally, we evaluate our fast location dual magnification hard example mining network on the Camelyon16 breast cancer whole-slide image dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 0.871 FROC score with a faster inference time, and our high magnification network also achieves a 0.88 FROC score.

AB  - Aging is a degenerative disease in which organisms and neurological functions decline. Emerging research has underscored the vital role of the gut microbiota in age-related processes. However, the identification of aging-associated core microbiota remains limited. In this investigation, we isolated a strain of B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 from the feces of centenarians and assessed its impact on aging using a mouse model induced by d-gal. Our study revealed the exceptional probiotic attributes of B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08. Administration of B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 significantly ameliorated age-related memory impairment, motor dysfunction, and anxiety-like behaviors in aging mice (p < 0.01). Moreover, tissue staining analysis demonstrated that B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 reduced the intensity of SA-beta-gal-positive in the hippocampus of aging mice. It also reversed pathological damage and structural abnormalities in brain and intestinal tissue. B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 inhibited neuroinflammation induced by TLR4/NF-kappa B (p < 0.01) and preserved the blood-brain barrier integrity by activating the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway (p < 0.05). Furthermore, it mitigated neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress by upregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (p < 0.01) and enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including GSH-Px (p < 0.01), SOD (p < 0.01), and CAT (p < 0.01). Besides, analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing data demonstrated that treatment with B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 restored intestinal microbiota homeostasis after senescence. It enhanced the abundance of beneficial bacteria while suppressing the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. In summary, our study unveiled that this novel strain of B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 exerts anti-aging effects through regulating the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway and intestinal microbiota. It holds promise as a functional food for promoting anti-aging effects and offers a novel approach to address aging and associated metabolic disorders.

AB  - We have recently reported that alpha 7 and alpha 3134 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes are expressed in human chromaffin cells in the plasma membrane where they colocalize and physically interact. The present study was designed to evaluate whether those receptor subtypes also colocalize at the central nervous system to mutually interact, and whether their expression and colocalization are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes, as they are in human chromaffin cells. We have here found that in isolated and maintained in culture mouse hippocampal neurons, nAChR expression and colocalization of alpha 7, but not alpha 3134, nAChR subtypes decreased by tyrosine (Tyr)- and serine/threonine (Ser/Thr)-phosphatase inhibition. However, Tyr-kinase inhibition or protein-phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation increased alpha 3134 nAChR expression, diminishing receptor subtypes colocalization. Furthermore, colocalization is not recovered if the inhibitors of Tyr-phosphatase and kinases, or the inhibitor of Ser/Thr-phosphatases and the activator of PP2A are applied together. Therefore, regulation of alpha 7 and alpha 3134 nAChR subtypes expression by Tyr- and Ser/Thr kinases and phosphatases exhibit differential mechanisms in mouse hippocampal neurons. Colocalization of nAChR subtypes, however, is altered by any maneuver that affects these kinases or phosphatases, which might have consequences in the functional activity of nAChR subtypes.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) known as the deciduous shrub has been reported to have effects of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. Tropomyosin (TM) induced a regulatory immune response associated with food allergy. In this study, a mouse model of food allergy sensitized to tropomyosin (TM) was established to assess the antiallergic properties of sea buckthorn flavonoid extract (SBF). SBF alleviated mice's allergic symptoms and exhibited a significant reduction in the levels of IgE and histamine. Meanwhile, SBF repaired the allergic Th2 cell overpolarization generated by TM, via downregulating the IL-4 production and upregulating IFN-gamma production to restore the balance of Th1/Th2 cells. Furthermore, the 16S RNA analysis showed that SBF primarily restored the gut microbiota via increasing the abundance in Chitinophilidae and decreasing in Burkholderiaceae, Pneumatobacteriaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. Gut metabolomes determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) suggested that TM upregulated PE (14:0/22:1(13Z)) and SBF decreased formimino-l-glutamic acid and urocanic acid levels. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, SBF treatment has been shown to modulate glycerophospholipid and histidine metabolism to improve allergic reactions. SBF holds great promise as a novel potential agent for the treatment of food allergies.

AB  - Brain aging is associated with cognitive decline, memory loss and many neurodegenerative disorders. The mammalian brain has distinct structural regions that perform specific functions. However, our understanding in gene expression and cell types within the context of the spatial organization of the mammalian aging brain is limited. Here we generated spatial transcriptomic maps of young and old mouse brains. We identified 27 distinguished brain spatial domains, including layer-specific subregions that are difficult to dissect individually. We comprehensively characterized spatial-specific changes in gene expression in the aging brain, particularly for isocortex, the hippocampal formation, brainstem and fiber tracts, and validated some gene expression differences by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. We identified aging-related genes and pathways that vary in a coordinated manner across spatial regions and parsed the spatial features of aging-related signals, providing important clues to understand genes with specific functions in different brain regions during aging. Combined with single-cell transcriptomics data, we characterized the spatial distribution of brain cell types. The proportion of immature neurons decreased in the DG region with aging, indicating that the formation of new neurons is blocked. Finally, we detected changes in information interactions between regions and found specific pathways were deregulated with aging, including classic signaling WNT and layer-specific signaling COLLAGEN. In summary, we established a spatial molecular atlas of the aging mouse brain (), which provides important resources and novel insights into the molecular mechanism of brain aging.
   We generated spatial maps of young and old mouse brains and identified brain spatial domains. We analyzed genes and functional changes in different spatial regions with aging, and revealed changes in cell types in different regions by combining single-cell data.

AB  - Despite major advances, not all patients achieve rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remission, thus highlighting a pressing need for new therapeutic treatments. Given this scenario, this study sought to evaluate Se-[(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl] 4-chlorobenzoselenolate ( Se-DMC) potential on a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced unilateral arthritis model. The effects of Se-DMC (5 mg/kg; oral dose) and meloxicam (5 mg/kg; oral dose), both administered to animals daily for 14 days, on paw edema, mechanical sensitivity, neurobehavioral deficits (anxiogenic- and depressive-like behaviors), Na+/K+-ATPase activity, oxidative stress, and inflammation were evaluated in male Swiss mice exposed to CFA (intraplantar injection of 0.1 mL; 10 mg/mL). Se-DMC reduced the paw withdrawal threshold and CFA-induced paw edema. Histopathological results revealed the antiedematogenic potential of the compound, which was evidenced by lower quantities of dilated lymphatic vessels compared with the CFA group. Se-DMC reduced mRNA relative expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the hippocampus and paw of CFA mice. The CFA-induced anxiogenic- and depressive-like behaviors were reversed by SeDMC to the control levels in the elevated plus-maze and tail suspension tests. Se-DMC reduced the paw reactive species levels and restored the superoxide dismutase (hippocampus and paw) and Na+/K+-ATPase (hippocampus) activities previously increased by CFA. Moreover, CFA administration inhibited serum creatinine kinase activity, albeit the Se-DMC effects did not appear to involve the modulation of this enzyme and were equal to or greater than meloxicam. Se-DMC attenuates CFA-induced inflammatory response, nociception, and neurobehavioral deficits in mice.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic brain diseases affecting up to 70 million people worldwide. Major challenges of epilepsy treatment include the high pharmacoresistance in patients and the lack of disease-modification. Extracellular adenosine 3'triphosphate (ATP), a key neurotransmitter in the activation of the purinergic signalling system, is increasingly recognized to contribute to pathological brain hyperexcitability in epilepsy. Consequently, targeting ATP-release mechanisms may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for seizure control and epilepsy. The calcium channel, Calcium Homeostasis Modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated, non-selective ion channel that permits the passage of various cations and small molecules, is expressed in neurons and plays an essential role during neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. In addition to ions, CALHM1 also allows the passage of ATP into the extracellular space, activating thereby purinergic receptors. Here, we tested if the pharmacological blocking of CALHM1 via CGP37157 (7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2-(1H)-one) alters the severity of intra-amygdala kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. Our results show that CGP37157 increased the severity of seizures during status epilepticus. In addition, CALHM1 protein levels are down-regulated in the hippocampus in epileptic mice and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) patients. In summary, our results identify CALHM1 as a new contributor to seizures and suggest targeting of CALHM1 as new treatment strategy for epilepsy.

AB  - Neurons are almost exclusively cultured in media containing glucose at much higher concentrations than found in the brain. To test whether these "standard" hyperglycemic culture conditions affect neuronal respiration relative to near-euglycemic conditions, we compared neuronal cultures grown with minimal glial contamination from the hippocampus and cortex of neonatal C57BL/6NCrl mice in standard commercially available media (25 mM Glucose) and in identical media with 5 mM glucose. Neuronal growth in both glucose concentrations proceeded until at least 14 days in vitro, with similar morphology and synaptogenesis. Neurons grown in high glucose were highly dependent on glycolysis as their primary source of ATP, measured using ATP luminescence and cellular respirometry assays. In contrast, neurons grown in 5 mM glucose showed a more balanced dependence on glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), greater reserve mitochondrial respiration capacity, and increased mitochondrial population relative to standard media. Our results show that neurons cultured in artificially high glucose-containing media preferentially use glycolysis, opposite to what is known for neurons in vivo as the primary pathway for ATP maintenance. Changes in gene and protein expression levels corroborate these changes in function and additionally suggest that high glucose culture media increases neuronal inflammation. We suggest using neuronal culture systems in 5 mM glucose to better represent physiologically relevant neuronal respiration.image

AB  - Quercetin (Que) is a flavonol compound found in plants, which has a variety of biological activities. Necroptosis, a special form of programmed cell death, plays a vital role in the development of many gastrointestinal diseases. This study aimed to explore whether Que could attenuate the intestinal injury and barrier dysfunction of piglets after deoxynivalenol (DON) exposure through modulating the necroptosis signaling pathway. Firstly, twenty-four weaned piglets were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design and the main factors, including Que (basal diet or diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg Que) and DON exposure (control feed or feed contaminated with 4 mg/kg DON). After feeding for 21 d, piglets were killed for samples. Next, the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-1) was pretreated with or without Que (10 mu mol/mL) in the presence or absence of a DON challenge (0.5 mu g/mL). Dietary Que increased the body weight, average daily gain, and average daily feed intake (p < 0.05) through the trial. Que supplementation improved the villus height, and enhanced the intestinal barrier function (p < 0.05) indicated by the higher protein expression of occludin and claudin-1 (p < 0.05) in the jejunum of the weaned piglets after DON exposure. Dietary Que also down-regulated the protein abundance of total receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (t-RIP1), phosphorylated RIP1 (p-RIP1), p-RIP3, total mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (t-MLKL), and p-MLKL (p < 0.05) in piglets after DON exposure. Moreover, Que pretreatment increased the cell viability and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (p < 0.05) in the supernatant of IPEC-1 cells after DON challenge. Que treatment also improved the epithelial barrier function indicated by a higher transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (p < 0.001), lower fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (FD4) flux (p < 0.001), and better distribution of occludin and claudin-1 (p < 0.05) after DON challenge. Additionally, pretreatment with Que also inhibited the protein abundance of t-RIP1, p-RIP1, t-RIP3, p-RIP3, t-MLKL, and p-MLKL (p < 0.05) in IPEC-1 cells after DON challenge. In general, our data suggest that Que can ameliorate DON-induced intestinal injury and barrier dysfunction associated with suppressing the necroptosis signaling pathway.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have an important role in cellular biology, being involved, in a way that depends on their levels, in cell signaling processes or in oxidative stress, probably associated with neurodegenerative and other diseases. Most of the studies about ROS formation were performed in ischemic conditions, and thus, there is limited knowledge about ROS formation in less severe hypoxic conditions. This study investigates neuronal ROS generation and autofluorescence changes in hypoxic conditions, focusing on the involvement of calcium and zinc. Using hippocampal slices from Wistar rats, ROS production was monitored by the permeant fluorescent indicator H2DCFDA under different oxygenation levels. Moderate hypoxia (40% O2) led to a small ROS increase, while severe hypoxia (0% O2) showed a more pronounced rise. KCl-induced depolarization significantly enhanced ROS formation, particularly under severe hypoxia. Inhibition of NMDA receptors reduced ROS generation without affecting autofluorescence, while chelation of zinc ions decreased ROS production and increased flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) autofluorescence. These findings suggest that, in hypoxic conditions, ROS formation is mediated by calcium entry through NMDA receptors and also by zinc influxes. Thus, these ions play a crucial role in oxidative stress, which may be related with neurodegenerative diseases associated with ROS dysregulation.

AB  - BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) refers to the widespread impairment of brain function caused by noncentral nervous system infection mediated by sepsis. Lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis contributes to the occurrence and course of SAE. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between neuronal injury and lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis in SAE.MethodsBaseline data were collected from pediatric patients upon admission, and the expression levels of various markers related to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis were monitored in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SAE as well as SAE model mice. The hippocampal phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP)-1/15-lysine oxidase (LOX)/ glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) pathway was assessed for its role on the inhibitory effect of ferroptosis in SAE treatment.ResultsThe results showed elevated levels of S100 calcium-binding protein beta (S-100 beta), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and malondialdehyde in the serum of SAE patients, while superoxide dismutase levels were reduced. Furthermore, analysis of PBMCs revealed increased transcription levels of PEBP1, LOX, and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4) in SAE patients, while the transcription levels of GPX4 and cystine/glutamate transporter xCT (SLC7A11) were decreased. In comparison to the control group, the SAE mice exhibited increased expression of S-100 beta and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the hippocampus, whereas the expression of S-100 beta and NSE were reduced in deferoxamine (DFO) mice. Additionally, iron accumulation was observed in the hippocampus of SAE mice, while the iron ion levels were reduced in the DFO mice. Inhibition of ferroptosis alleviated the mitochondrial damage (as assessed by transmission electron microscopy, hippocampal mitochondrial ATP detection, and the JC-1 polymer-to-monomer ratio in the hippocampus) and the oxidative stress response induced by SAE as well as attenuated neuroinflammatory reactions. Further investigations revealed that the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of ferroptosis in SAE treatment is associated with the hippocampal PEBP-1/15-LOX/GPX4 pathway.ConclusionThese results offer potential therapeutic targets for the management of neuronal injury in SAE and valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of ferroptosis in neurological disorders.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) refers to a secondary brain injury that results in mitochondrial dysfunction of variable extent, leading to neuronal cell damage. The impact of this process has mainly been studied in the short term, from the early hours up to one week after blood flow reperfusion, and in the ischemic hemisphere only. The focus of this study was to assess the long-term impacts of I/R on mitochondrial functionality using high-resolution fluorespirometry to evaluate state-dependent activities in both ischemic (ipsilateral) and non-ischemic (contralateral) hemispheres of male mice 60, 90, 120, and 180 days after I/R caused by 60-min-long filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (fMCAo). Our results indicate that in cortical tissues, succinate-supported oxygen flux (Complex I&II OXPHOS state) and H2O2 production (Complex II LEAK state) were significantly decreased in the fMCAo (stroke) group ipsilateral hemisphere compared to measurements in the contralateral hemisphere 60 and 90 days after stroke. In hippocampal tissues, during the Complex I&II ET state, mitochondrial respiration was generally lower in the ipsilateral compared to the contralateral hemisphere 90 days following stroke. An aging-dependent impact on mitochondria oxygen consumption following I/R injury was observed 180 days after surgery, wherein Complex I&II activities were lowest in both hemispheres. The obtained results highlight the importance of long-term studies in the field of ischemic stroke, particularly when evaluating mitochondrial bioenergetics in specific brain regions within and between separately affected cerebral hemispheres.

AB  - Exposure to a prototypic air pollutant ozone (O-3) has been associated with the activation of neuroendocrine stress response along with neural changes in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies in susceptible animal models. We hypothesized that neural oxidative and transcriptional changes induced by O-3 in stress responsive regions are sex-dependent. Male and female adult Long-Evans rats were exposed to filtered air or O-3 for two consecutive days (0.8 ppm, 4 h/day) and brain regions were flash-frozen. Activities of cerebellar OS parameters and mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV enzymes were assessed to confirm prior findings. We assessed transcriptional changes in hypothalamus (HYP) and hippocampus (HIP) for markers of OS, microglial activity and glucocorticoid signaling using qPCR. Although there were no O-3 or sex-related differences in the cerebellar activities of OS and mitochondrial enzymes, the levels of protein carbonyls and complex II activities were higher in females regardless of O-3. There were no statistical differences in baseline expression of genes related to OS (Cat, Dhcr24, Foxm1, Gpx1, Gss, Nfe2l2, Sod1) except for lower HYP Sod1 expression in air-exposed females than males, and higher HIP Gss expression in O-3-exposed females relative to matched males. Microglial marker Aif1 expression was higher in O-3-exposed females relative to males; O-3 inhibited Itgam only in males. The expression of Bdnf in HIP and HYP was inhibited by O-3 in both sexes. Genes related to glucocorticoid signaling (Fkbp4, Fkbp5, Hsp90aa1, Hspa4, nr3c1, nr3c2) showed sex-specific effects due to O-3 exposure. Baseline expression of HIP Fkbp4 was higher in females relative to males. O-3 inhibited Nr3c1 in female HIP and male HYP, but Nr3c2 was inhibited in male HYP. Fkbp4 expression was higher in O-3-exposed females when compared to matched males, whereas Fkbp5 was expressed at higher levels in both brain regions of males and females. These results indicate that sex-specific brain region responses to O-3 might, in part, be caused by OS and regulation of glucocorticoid signaling.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly. The imbalance of protein production and degradation processes leads to the accumulation of misfolded and abnormally aggregated amyloid-beta (A beta) in the extracellular space and forms senile plaques, which constitute one of the most critical pathological hallmarks of AD. KIF9, a member of the kinesin protein superfamily, mediates the anterograde transport of intracellular cargo along microtubules. However, the exact role of KIF9 in AD pathogenesis remains largely elusive. In this study, we reported that the expression of kinesin family member 9 (KIF9) in the hippocampus of APP23/PS45 double-transgenic AD model mice declined in an age-dependent manner, concurrent with macroautophagy dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that KIF9 mediated the transport of lysosomes through kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), thereby participating in the degradation of amyloidogenic pathway-related proteins of A beta precursor protein (APP) in AD model cells through promoting the macroautophagy pathway. Importantly, genetic upregulation of KIF9 via adeno-associated virus (AAV) diminished A beta deposition and alleviated cognitive impairments in AD model mice by enhancing macroautophagy function. Collectively, our findings underscore the ability of KIF9 to promote macroautophagy through KLC1-mediated anterograde transport of lysosomes, effectively ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. These discoveries suggest that KIF9 may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomers, formed by A beta aggregation, are the causative agent of Alzheimer's disease and induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (Tau) and neurotoxicity. The antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO) is transferred to the brain after oral ingestion and protects against A beta- induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction. However, the impact of ERGO on A beta oligomer-induced Tau phosphorylation remains unclear. <bold>Objective: </bold>To investigate the effects of ERGO on A beta-induced Tau phosphorylation and their mechanism in neurons. <bold>Method: </bold>SH-SY5Y cells differentiated into cholinergic neuron-like cells or primary cultured neurons derived from the murine hippocampus were pretreated with ERGO and exposed to A beta(25-35) oligomers. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by assessing the chemiluminescence of dead cell-derived proteases. The expression of phosphorylated (p-) Tau at serine 396, p-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) at serine 9, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; beta-secretase), and nicastrin, which is a component protein of the gamma-secretase complex, was assessed by western blotting. <bold>Result: </bold>Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of choline acetyltransferase, and showed cholinergic neuron-like characteristics compared with those of undifferentiated cells. ERGO significantly suppressed the A beta(25-35) oligomer-induced increased cytotoxicity and p-Tau expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. ERGO recovered the decreased expression of p-GSK-3 beta at serine 9, indicating its inactivation, and the increased expression of APP, BACE1, and nicastrin induced by A beta(25-35) oligomer exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons. These ERGO effects on A beta(25-35) oligomers were inhibited by treatment with LY294002, which activated GSK-3 beta. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>ERGO may suppress the increased expression of p-Tau and proteins involved in A beta production induced by A beta oligomers by inactivating GSK-3 beta, thereby mitigating neurotoxicity.

AB  - Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) catalyze the reduction of H2O2 by using glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor. However, the profiles of altered GPx1 expression in response to status epilepticus (SE) have not been fully explored. In the present study, GPx1 expression was transiently decreased in dentate granule cells, while it was temporarily enhanced and subsequently reduced in CA1 neurons following SE. GPx1 expression was also transiently declined in CA1 astrocytes (within the stratum radiatum) following SE. However, it was elevated in reactive CA1 astrocytes, but not in clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes, in chronic epilepsy rats. Under physiological condition, L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, an inducer of GSH depletion) increased GPx1 expression in CA1 neurons but decreased it in CA1 astrocytes. However, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, an inducer of GSH synthesis) did not influence GPx1 expression in these cell populations. Following SE, BSO aggravated CA1 neuronal death, concomitant with reduced GPx1 expression. Further. BSO also lowered GPx1 expression in CA1 astrocytes. NAC effectively prevented neuronal death and GPx1 downregulation in CA1 neurons, and restored GPx1 expression to the control level in CA1 astrocytes. In chronic epilepsy rats, BSO reduced GPx1 intensity and exacerbated clasmatodendritic degeneration in CA1 astrocytes. In contrast, NAC restored GPx1 expression in clasmatodendritic astrocytes and ameliorated this autophagic astroglial death. To the best of our knowledge, our findings report, for the first time, the spatiotemporal profiles of altered GPx1 expression in the rat hippocampus following SE, and suggest GSH-mediated GPx1 regulation, which may affect SE-induced neuronal death and autophagic astroglial degeneration.

AB  - Bleomycin exhibits effective chemotherapeutic activity against multiple types of tumors, and also induces various side effects, such as pulmonary fibrosis and neuronal defects, which limit the clinical application of this drug. Macroautophagy/autophagy has been recently reported to be involved in the functions of bleomycin, and yet the mechanisms of their crosstalk remain insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during bleomycin activation hampered autophagy flux by inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and obstructing lysosomal degradation. Exhaustion of ROS with N-acetylcysteine relieved LMP and autophagy defects. Notably, we observed that LMP and autophagy blockage preceded the emergence of cellular senescence during bleomycin treatment. In addition, promoting or inhibiting autophagy-lysosome degradation alleviated or exacerbated the phenotypes of senescence, respectively. This suggests the alternation of autophagy activity is more a regulatory mechanism than a consequence of bleomycin-induced cellular senescence. Taken together, we reveal a specific role of bleomycin-induced ROS in mediating defects of autophagic degradation and further regulating cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo. Our findings, conversely, indicate the autophagy-lysosome degradation pathway as a target for modulating the functions of bleomycin. These provide a new perspective for optimizing bleomycin as a clinically applicable chemotherapeutics devoid of severe side-effects.Abbreviations: AT2 cells: type II alveolar epithelial cells; ATG7: autophagy related 7; bEnd.3: mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells; BNIP3L: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; CCL2: C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; CDKN1A: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; CDKN2A: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; FTH1: ferritin heavy polypeptide 1; gamma-H2AX: phosphorylated H2A.X variant histone; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HUVEC: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; HT22: hippocampal neuronal cell lines; Il: interleukin; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; NCOA4: nuclear receptor coactivator 4; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RPS6KB/S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase; SA-GLB1/beta-gal: senescence-associated galactosidase, beta 1; SAHF: senescence-associated heterochromatic foci; SASP: senescence-associated secretory phenotype; SEC62: SEC62 homolog, preprotein translocation; SEP: superecliptic pHluorin; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB

AB  - Substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with postcardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI). MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are essential regulators of neuronal metabolism processes and have been shown to contribute to alleviated neurological injury after cardiac arrest. In this study, we identified miRNAs related to the prognosis of patients with neurological dysfunction after cardiopulmonary resuscitation based on data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we explored the effects of miR-483-5p on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, and oxidative stress levels after ischemia-reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo. MiR-483-5p was downregulated in PC12 cells and hippocampal samples compared with that in normal group cells and hippocampi. Overexpression of miR-483-5p increased the viability of PC12 cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury and reduced the proportion of dead cells. A western blot analysis showed that miR-483-5p increased the protein expression of PCG-1, NRF1, and TFAM and reduced the protein expression of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and alleviating oxidative stress injury by inhibiting the production of ROS and reducing MDA activity. We confirmed that miR-483-5p targeted TNFSF8 to regulate the AMPK/JNK pathway, thereby playing a neuroprotective role after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Hence, this study provides further insights into strategies for inhibiting neurological impairment after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and suggests a potential therapeutic target for PCABI.

AB  - Purpose Music therapy, like red-pink (soothing) music, is an important treatment for neurological disorders associated with learning and memory. Magnetic fields have been proved to have a similar regulating effect. However, the effect of magnetic fields with musical rhythm generated by the combination of the two has not been confirmed. This study aimed to investigate the regulation of magnetic stimulation with music rhythm on LTP (long-term potentiation) of Schaffer-CA1. Materials and methods This article selected three sorts of music tracks in different frequencies (music track (1) Turkish March, music track (2) Moonlight Sonata, music track (3) Funeral March) and four sorts of pure sinusoidal tracks of four different harmonic frequency (music track (4) the frequency is 3500 Hz; music track (5) the frequency is 2500 Hz; music track (6) the frequency is 1500 Hz; music track (7) the frequency is 500 Hz). These music tracks are converted into analog signals by the external sound card and power amplifier and fed into a homemade coil that meets the demand for this frequency bandwidth. The coil can generate seven sorts of time-varying magnetic fields with musical rhythm with a mean intensity of about 2 mT. We used multi-electrode array (MEA) to record the LTP signals of Schaffer-CA1 synaptic induced by seven sorts of musical rhythmic magnetic fields and analyze the regulation of them. Results The musical rhythmic magnetic fields generated by track 1 and track 2 have a remarkable enhancing effect on the amplitude of fEPSPs (field excitatory postsynaptic potentials) (p < .05), and these effects intensify with the increase of frequency. Nevertheless, there is no significant enhancing effect on LTP of the rhythmic magnetic field generated by track 3 (p > .05). The sinusoidal magnetic fields generated by track 4 and track 5 have an enhancing effect on the amplitude of fEPSPs (p < .05), and the enhancement is better than track 1 and track 2. The sinusoidal magnetic fields generated by track 6 and track 7 have an inhibiting effect (p < .05). Conclusion We found that the enhancing effect of musical rhythmic magnetic fields generated by track 1 was the most significant. The frequency of 1500 Hz could be a turning-point frequency in the regulation of magnetic field on LTP.

AB  - Adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) activation modulates several brain processes, ranging from neuronal maturation to synaptic plasticity. Most of these actions occur through the modulation of the actions of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this work we studied the role of A(2A)Rs in regulating postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Here we show that A(2A)R activation with CGS 21680 promoted neural stem cell self-renewal, protected committed neuronal cells from cell death and contributed to a higher density of immature and mature neuronal cells, particularly glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, A(2A)R endogenous activation was found to be essential for BDNF-mediated increase in cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Our findings contribute to further understand the role of adenosinergic signaling in the brain and may have an impact in the development of strategies for brain repair under pathological conditions.

TI  - Widespread choroid plexus contamination in sampling and profiling of brain tissue
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
LA  - English
AB  - The choroid plexus, a tissue responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid, is found predominantly in the lateral and fourth ventricles of the brain. This highly vascularized and ciliated tissue is made up of specialized epithelial cells and capillary networks surrounded by connective tissue. Given the complex structure of the choroid plexus, this can potentially result in contamination during routine tissue dissection. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing studies, as well as genome-wide in situ hybridization experiments (Allen Brain Atlas), have identified several canonical markers of choroid plexus such as Ttr, Folr1, and Prlr. We used the Ttr gene as a marker to query the Gene Expression Omnibus database for transcriptome studies of brain tissue and identified at least some level of likely choroid contamination in numerous studies that could have potentially confounded data analysis and interpretation. We also analyzed transcriptomic datasets from human samples from Allen Brain Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and found abundant choroid contamination, with regions in closer proximity to choroid more likely to be impacted such as hippocampus, cervical spinal cord, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, and amygdala. In addition, analysis of both the Allen Brain Atlas and GTEx datasets for differentially expressed genes between likely "high contamination" and "low contamination" groups revealed a clear enrichment of choroid plexus marker genes and gene ontology pathways characteristic of these ciliated choroid cells. Inclusion of these contaminated samples could result in biological misinterpretation or simply add to the statistical noise and mask true effects. We cannot assert that Ttr or other genes/proteins queried in targeted assays are artifacts from choroid contamination as some of these differentials may be due to true biological effects. However, for studies that have an unequal distribution of choroid contamination among groups, investigators may wish to remove contaminated samples from analyses or incorporate choroid marker gene expression into their statistical modeling. In addition, we suggest that a simple RT-qPCR or western blot for choroid markers would mitigate unintended choroid contamination for any experiment, but particularly for samples intended for more costly omic profiling. This study highlights an unexpected problem for neuroscientists, but it is also quite possible that unintended contamination of adjacent structures occurs during dissections for other tissues but has not been widely recognized.

AB  - In patients with Alzheimer's disease, gamma-glutamyl transferase 5 (GGT5) expression has been observed to be downregulated in cerebrovascular endothelial cells. However, the functional role of GGT5 in the development of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of GGT5 on cognitive function and brain pathology in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the underlying mechanism. We observed a significant reduction in GGT5 expression in two in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (A beta(1-42)-treated hCMEC/D3 and bEnd.3 cells), as well as in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Additionally, injection of APP/PS1 mice with an adeno-associated virus encoding GGT5 enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and mitigated cognitive deficits. Interestingly, increasing GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells reduced levels of both soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. This effect may be attributable to inhibition of the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, which is mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B. Our findings demonstrate that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is inversely associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and that GGT5 upregulation mitigates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Sex steroids are neuromodulators that play a crucial role in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity, providing circuit flexibility and dynamic functional connectivity in mammals. Previous studies indicate that testosterone is crucial for neuronal functions and required further investigation on various frontiers. However, it is surprising to note that studies on testosterone-induced neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) expression and its influence on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory moderation are scanty. The present study is focused on analysing the localized influence of NT-4 on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and associated moderation in learning and memory under testosterone deprivation. Adult Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into various groups, control (Cont), orchidectomy (ORX), ORX + testosterone supplementation (ORX + T), and Cont + testosterone (Cont + T). After 2 weeks, the serum testosterone level was undetectable in ORX rats. The behavioural assessment showed a decline in the learning ability of ORX rats with increased working and reference memory errors in the behavioural assessment in the 8-arm radial maze. The mRNA and protein expressions of NT-4 and androgen receptors (ARs) were significantly reduced in the ORX group. In addition, there was a decrease in the number of neuronal dendrites in Golgi-Cox staining. These changes were not seen in ORX + T rats with improved learning behaviour indicating that testosterone exerts its protective effect on hippocampal synaptic plasticity through AR-dependent NT-4 regulation in learning and memory upgrade.

AB  - Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the growth, differentiation, maintenance and survival of neurons. These attributes make BDNF a potentially powerful therapeutic agent. However, its charge, instability in blood, and poor blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrability have impeded its development. Here, we show that engineered clathrin triskelia (CT) conjugated to BDNF (BDNF-CT) and delivered intranasally increased hippocampal BDNF concentrations 400-fold above that achieved previously with intranasal BDNF alone. We also show that BDNF-CT targeted Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and increased TrkB expression and downstream signaling in iTat mouse brains. Mice were induced to conditionally express neurotoxic HIV Transactivator-of-Transcription (Tat) protein that decreases BDNF. Down-regulation of BDNF is correlated with increased severity of HIV/neuroAIDS. BDNF-CT enhanced neurorestorative effects in the hippocampus including newborn cell proliferation and survival, granule cell neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and increased dendritic integrity. BDNF-CT exerted cognitive-enhancing effects by reducing Tat-induced learning and memory deficits. These results show that CT bionanoparticles efficiently deliver BDNF to the brain, making them potentially powerful tools in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Background: Memory-dependent psychological behaviors have an important role in life. Memory strengthening in adulthood to prevent its defects in aging is a significant issue. The ghrelin endogenous hormone improves memory by targeting glutamatergic and serotonergic circuits. Also, citicoline, a memory strengthening drug in aging, is not recommended to adults due to its side effects. The current study aims to test that ghrelin treatment, like citicoline, would improve passive avoidance memory via expression of the genes encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR1) and the serotonin receptor 1A (HTR1 alpha) involved in this process.
   Methods: Five groups of adult male rats received (1) saline (as control), (2) 0.5 mg/kg citicoline, or (3-5) 0.3, 1.5, and 3 nmol/mu l ghrelin). The rats received the drugs via intra-hippocampal injection. Passive avoidance memory was determined using a shuttle box device. The latency to enter the dark chamber before (IL) and after (RL) injection and the total duration of the animal's presence in the light compar intent (TLC) were evaluated. Then, the gene expression rates of NMDAR1 and HTR1 alpha were measured by the Real-Time PCR.
   Results: Ghrelin and citicoline had some similar and significant effects on passive avoidance memory, and both increased NMDAR1 and decreased HTR1 alpha expression.
   Conclusions: Ghrelin, like citicoline, improves passive avoidance learning by altering the NMDAR1 and HTR1 alpha expression in the hippocampus.

AB  - The neurofilaments formed by hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark of tauopathies. However, the biological functions of tau and the physiological significance of its phosphorylation are still not fully understood. By using human tau (441 a.a.) transgenic (hTau) mice, murine tau KO mice, and C57BL/6J (C57) mice, unexpectedly, we found that under acute hyperglycemia conditions, JNK but not previously reported GSK3(3 mediated tau phosphorylation. Moreover, Akt, the inhibitory kinase upstream of GSK3(3, was activated in a tau-dependent manner. Furthermore, under acute high glucose conditions, the presence of human tau significantly augmented Akt activation but inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation simultaneously, indicating that human tau is also involved in regulating the alternative activation of mTORC1/2. By comparing the hippocampal membrane-associated proteome, we found that human tau influenced the homeostasis of protein-membrane association under acute hyperglycemia conditions. Of note, with respect to C57 and Tau KO mice, the membrane association of oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins was impeded by human tau in the hippocampus. In vitro study consistently showed that aerobic glycolysis was promoted in the presence of human tau under high glucose conditions, which maintained the ratio of NAD+/NADH. On the other hand, human tau restricted the level of oxidative phosphorylation, modulated the activity of SDH, and reduced ROS production upon high glucose challenging. In summary, the current study revealed that human tau played an important role in regulating glycolytic metabolism under acute hyperglycemia conditions, which is similar with the Warburg effect, through influencing the homeostasis of protein-membrane association.

TI  - Ginkgo Biloba Extract Reduces Cardiac and Brain Inflammation in Rats Fed a HFD and Exposed to Chronic Mental Stress through NF-κB Inhibition
T2  - MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION
LA  - English
KW  - HIPPOCAMPUS
AB  - Background. Cardiac and brain inflammation can lead to a host of deleterious health effects. Our formal experimental research showed that Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE) contributed to the reduction of inflammation in mice with myocardial infarction along with depression. This study is aimed at expanding on these findings via analysis of the cardiac and brain inflammation, which was prevented by GBE in rats suffering with a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Methods. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups treated with normal diet, UCMS, HFD, HFD+UCMS, or HFD+UCMS+GBE respectively. Rats treated with HFD were fed a high-fat diet for 10 or 13 weeks. Rats treated with UCMS were exposed to 8 types of chronic physical and psychological stressors for 10 or 13 weeks. The HFD+UCMS+GBE group was given GBE via intragastric gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. Sucrose preference was established for the assessment of depressive behaviors. The heart function was evaluated by echocardiography. The rats were terminated at the end of the 10th or 13th week. The blood was used for detecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and total cholesterol (TCHO) by the kit instructions; Helper T Lymphocytes (TH cells, CD3(+)CD4(+)) by flow cytometry; and Interleukin(IL-) 1 beta, IL-37, IL-38, NT-proBNP, hs-cTNI, and Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cardiac tissues were used for detecting IL-1 beta, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), inhibitor molecule protein (I kappa B), and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) by ELISA and P65, P-P65, I kappa B, and phosphorylated inhibitor molecule protein alpha (P-I kappa Ba) for western blotting. Cortex tissues were used for detecting 8-iso-prostaglandinF2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2 alpha) by ELISA. Oil Red staining was carried out to evaluate the lipid deposits in the rats' aortic arteries. Sirius Red staining was performed to display collagen fibers in the arteries. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining was applied to reveal pathological changes to arteries and cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to assess the distribution of inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta in arteries and cardiac tissues. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed to observe the ultrastructure of hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA)1 (CA1) neurons. Results. In the rats with HFD+UCMS+GBE, over 13 weeks, GBE exerted a protective role of both the heart and brain, by attenuating cardiac inflammation and brain oxidative stress. Levels of Helper T lymphocytes and serum anti-inflammatory cytokines involving IL-37 and IL-38 were all elevated, and the depressive behaviors of HFD+UCMS rats were attenuated by GBE. This protective role was accomplished via inhibition of the canonical NF-kappa B signaling pathway, through downregulation of the expressions of P-P65 and P-I kappa B-alpha in the heart, hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus. Conclusions. This study suggests that GBE poses a protective role from the various pathologies associated with high-fat diets, unpredictable chronic mild stress, and depression, possibly via improving peripheral immunity and reducing cardiac and brain inflammation.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury is a severe health problem leading to autophagy and apoptosis in the brain. 3,6-Dibromo-beta-fluoro-N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-9-propanamine (P7C3-A20) can be neuroprotective in various diseases, including ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether P7C3-A20 has a therapeutic effect on traumatic brain injury and its possible molecular mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of P7C3-A20 on traumatic brain injury and explored the putative underlying molecular mechanisms. We established a traumatic brain injury rat model using a modified weight drop method. P7C3-A20 or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally after traumatic brain injury. Severe neurological deficits were found in rats after traumatic brain injury, with deterioration in balance, walking function, and learning memory. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed significant neuronal cell damage, while terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining indicated a high rate of apoptosis. The presence of autolysosomes was observed using transmission electron microscope. P7C3-A20 treatment reversed these pathological features. Western blotting showed that P7C3-A20 treatment reduced microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) autophagy protein, apoptosis-related proteins (namely, Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3 [BNIP3], and Bcl-2 associated x protein [Bax]), and elevated ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (p62) autophagy protein expression. Thus, P7C3-A20 can treat traumatic brain injury in rats by inhibiting excessive autophagy and apoptosis.

AB  - The polymerization and severing of microtubules are fundamental to the growth and branching of neurites in hippocampal neurons. The catalytic ATPase-containing A-subunit of katanin p60 (p60, KATNA1) promotes growth and development of hippocampal neurites by severing microtubules, while collapsing response mediator protein 3 (CRMP3) assembles microtubules to regulate neurite outgrowth. However, whether microtubule severing and assembling proteins would work together to regulate neurite outgrowth, especially for KATNA1 and CRMP3 remains to be elucidated. In this study, we revealed the interaction between KATNA1 and CRMP3 through GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays and identified the binding domains between KATNA1 and CRMP3 as the MIT of KATNA1 (residues 1-77) and the D region of CRMP3 (residues 64-413). Furthermore, we demonstrated that CRMP3 enhances the microtubule-severing efficiency of KATNA1. In cultured hippocampal neurons, overexpression of KATNA1 and CRMP3 increased neurite length and branch number, and co- expression of both proteins further enhanced the promoting effect. Moreover, genetic knockout of KATNA1 or/and CRMP3 significantly inhibited neurite outgrowth. Overall, our data suggest that the CRMP3 interaction enhances the severing activity of KATNA1, thereby promoting hippocampal neurite outgrowth.

AB  - Recent work by us and others has implicated NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes as main producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following a brain insult such as status epilepticus, contributing to neuronal damage and development of epilepsy. Although several NOX isoforms have been examined in the context of epilepsy, most attention has focused on NOX2. In this present study, we demonstrate the effect of gp91ds-tat, a specific competitive inhibitor of NOX2, in in vitro epileptiform activity model as well as in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) model in rats. We showed that in in vitro seizure model, gp91ds-tat modulated Ca2+ oscillation, prevented epileptiform activity-induced ROS generation, mitochondrial depolarization, and neuronal death. Administration of gp91ds-tat 1 h after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus significantly decreased the expression of NOX2, as well as the overall NOX activity in the cortex and the hippocampus. Finally, we showed that upon continuous intracerebroventricular administration to epileptic rats, gp91ds-tat significantly reduced the seizure frequency and the total number of seizures post-treatment compared to the scrambled peptide-treated animals.The results of the study suggest that NOX2 may have an important effect on modulation of epileptiform ac-tivity and has a critical role in mediating seizure-induced NOX activation, ROS generation and oxidative stress in the brain, and thus significantly contributes to development of epilepsy following a brain insult.

AB  - To elucidate the effect of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition on corticosterone release, mice were divided into a group receiving NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor at a dose of 3 mg/kg for seven days, and a group receiving NS398 for fourteen days. After this time, the mice were sacrificed, and blood serum was collected. An ELISA protocol was used to analyze serum corticosterone levels. Short-term COX-2 inhibition increased corticosterone levels, while long-term inhibition lowered them. The exact schedule of experiments was repeated after the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Escherichia coli challenge in mice to check the influence of stress stimuli on the tested parameters. In this case, we observed increases in corticosterone levels, significant in a seven-day pattern. These results indicate that corticosterone levels are regulated through a COX-2-dependent mechanism in mice.

AB  - Author summaryEssentially all data processed by mammals and many other living organisms is sequential. This holds true for all types of sensory input data as well as motor output activity. Being able to form memories of such sequential data, to predict future sequence elements, and to replay learned sequences is a necessary prerequisite for survival. It has been hypothesized that sequence learning, prediction and replay constitute the fundamental computations performed by the neocortex. The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) constitutes an abstract powerful algorithm implementing this form of computation and has been proposed to serve as a model of neocortical processing. In this study, we are reformulating this algorithm in terms of known biological ingredients and mechanisms to foster the verifiability of the HTM hypothesis based on electrophysiological and behavioral data. The proposed model learns continuously in an unsupervised manner by biologically plausible, local plasticity mechanisms, and successfully predicts and replays complex sequences. Apart from establishing contact to biology, the study sheds light on the mechanisms determining at what speed we can process sequences and provides an explanation of fast sequence replay observed in the hippocampus and in the neocortex.
   Sequence learning, prediction and replay have been proposed to constitute the universal computations performed by the neocortex. The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm realizes these forms of computation. It learns sequences in an unsupervised and continuous manner using local learning rules, permits a context specific prediction of future sequence elements, and generates mismatch signals in case the predictions are not met. While the HTM algorithm accounts for a number of biological features such as topographic receptive fields, nonlinear dendritic processing, and sparse connectivity, it is based on abstract discrete-time neuron and synapse dynamics, as well as on plasticity mechanisms that can only partly be related to known biological mechanisms. Here, we devise a continuous-time implementation of the temporal-memory (TM) component of the HTM algorithm, which is based on a recurrent network of spiking neurons with biophysically interpretable variables and parameters. The model learns high-order sequences by means of a structural Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanism supplemented with a rate-based homeostatic control. In combination with nonlinear dendritic input integration and local inhibitory feedback, this type of plasticity leads to the dynamic self-organization of narrow sequence-specific subnetworks. These subnetworks provide the substrate for a faithful propagation of sparse, synchronous activity, and, thereby, for a robust, context specific prediction of future sequence elements as well as for the autonomous replay of previously learned sequences. By strengthening the link to biology, our implementation facilitates the evaluation of the TM hypothesis based on experimentally accessible quantities. The continuous-time implementation of the TM algorithm permits, in particular, an investigation of the role of sequence timing for sequence learning, prediction and replay. We demonstrate this aspect by studying the effect of the sequence speed on the sequence learning performance and on the speed of autonomous sequence replay.

AB  - Deficiencies in epithelial barrier integrity are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). This study aimed to investigate the role of ephrinA1/ephA2 signaling on sinonasal epithelial permeability and rhinovirus-induced epithelial permeability. This role in the process of epithelial permeability was evaluated by stimulating ephA2 with ephrinA1 and inactivating ephA2 with ephA2 siRNA or inhibitor in cells exposed to rhinovirus infection. EphrinA1 treatment increased epithelial permeability, which was associated with decreased expression of ZO-1, ZO-2, and occludin. These effects of ephrinA1 were attenuated by blocking the action of ephA2 with ephA2 siRNA or inhibitor. Furthermore, rhinovirus infection upregulated the expression levels of ephrinA1 and ephA2, increasing epithelial permeability, which was suppressed in ephA2-deficient cells. These results suggest a novel role of ephrinA1/ephA2 signaling in epithelial barrier integrity in the sinonasal epithelium, suggesting their participation in rhinovirus-induced epithelial dysfunction.

AB  - Short-term or permanent reduction in cerebral blood flow can lead to cerebral ischemia, and if it persists, it can lead to necrosis and cell death. Reperfusion is restoration of blood supply, but it may further aggra-vate the damage of ischemic brain tissue. Propofol has characteristics such as rapid recovery, continuous infusion, and no accumulation. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a HIF-1-a inhibitor and reduces cell apoptosis. The brain ischemia-reperfusion hippocampal nerve cell model was in this study prepared in vitro. Samples IP: 8.46.247.10 On: Mon, 07 Nov 2022 09:19:50 were randomly assigned into control group (control), cerebralischemia-reperfusion (CIR) group, propofol Copyright: American Scientific Publishers group (Propofol), 2ME2 nanoparticle group (2ME2-NPs), and combination group (Propofol+2ME2-NPs). The Delivered b Ingenta changes of cell proliferation and apoptosis activities were analyzed in each group, which included changes of Survivin expression, changes of intracellular Adenosine monophosphate, diphosphate, and triphosphate (AMP, ADP, and ATP, respectively) changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) Analysis also included secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a, and detection of HIF-1a and NF-KB expression. Results revealed that, CIR hippocampal nerve cell proliferation decreased, apoptosis activity increased, while Survivin expression increased. Moreover, ATP, ADP and AMP contents decreased, while secretion of inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-a increased, MDA increased, and SOD decreased. HIF-1a and NF-KB expressions increased. Propofol and 2ME2 nanoparticles promoted hippocampal neurons proliferation after CIR brain injury, inhibit the apoptotic activity, and reduce the expression of apoptotic protein Survivin. ATP, ADP and AMP content increased, IL-6 and TNF-a decreased, MDA decreased, SOD activity increased, HIF-1a and NF-KB decreased. The and combined group had a more significant effect. 2ME2 nanoparticles combined with propofol can inhibit HIF-1a and secretion of inflammatory factors by regulating oxidative stress and NF-KB signaling pathways, promoting the proliferation of hippocampal neurons, inhibiting apoptosis, and restoring cell energy and helping to restore nerve cell function.

AB  - BackgroundThe study investigated the effect of co-administration of curcumin and donepezil on several markers of cognitive function (such as spatial memory, astrocyte activation, cholinesterase expressions) in the brain cortex and hippocampus of scopolamine-treated rats.Method and resultsFor seven consecutive days, a pre-treatment of curcumin (50 mg/kg) and/or donepezil (2.5 mg/kg) was administered. On the seventh day, scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was administered to elicit cognitive impairment, 30 min before memory test was conducted. This was followed by evaluating changes in spatial memory, cholinesterase, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities, as well as nitric oxide (NO) level were determined. Additionally, RT-qPCR for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cholinesterase gene expressions was performed in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Also, GFAP immunohistochemistry of the brain tissues for neuronal injury were performed in the brain cortex and hippocampus. In comparison to the control group, rats given scopolamine had impaired memory, higher levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and ADA activities, as well as elevated markers of oxidative stress. In addition to enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity, there was also overexpression of the GFAP and BChE genes in the brain tissues. The combination of curcumin and donepezil was, however, observed to better ameliorate these impairments in comparison to the donepezil-administered rat group.ConclusionHence, this evidence provides more mechanisms to support the hypothesis that the concurrent administration of curcumin and donepezil mitigates markers of cognitive dysfunction in scopolamine-treated rat model.

AB  - BackgroundHydrogen-rich water (HRW) has been shown to prevent cognitive impairment caused by ionizing radiation. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of HRW on ionizing radiation by coupling the brain metabolomics and biological target network methods.Methods and resultsHRW significantly improves the cognitive impairment in rats exposed to ionizing radiation. Based on metabolomics and biological network results, we identified 54 differential metabolites and 93 target genes. The KEGG pathway indicates that glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, and glycerophospholipid metabolism play important roles in ionizing radiation therapy.ConclusionOur study has systematically elucidated the molecular mechanism of HRW against ionizing radiation, which can be mediated by modulating targets, pathways and metabolite levels. This provides a new perspective for identifying the underlying pharmacological mechanism of HRW.

AB  - Yamanaka factors (YFs) can reverse some aging features in mammalian tissues, but their effects on the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we induced YFs in the mouse brain in a controlled spatiotemporal manner in two different scenarios: brain development and adult stages in the context of neurodegeneration. Embryonic induction of YFs perturbed cell identity of both progenitors and neurons, but transient and low-level expression is tolerated by these cells. Under these conditions, YF induction led to progenitor expansion, an increased number of upper cortical neurons and glia, and enhanced motor and social behavior in adult mice. Additionally, controlled YF induction is tolerated by principal neurons in the adult dorsal hippocampus and prevented the development of several hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, including cognitive decline and altered molecular signatures, in the 5xFAD mouse model. These results highlight the powerful impact of YFs on neural proliferation and their potential use in brain disorders.

AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase, carboxyl terminus of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) interacting protein (CHIP), also functions as a co-chaperone and plays a crucial role in the protein quality control system. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of overexpressed CHIP on Alzheimer's disease. We used an adeno-associated virus vector that can cross the blood-brain barrier to mediate CHIP overexpression in APP/PS1 mouse brain. CHIP overexpression significantly ameliorated the performance of APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze and nest building tests, reduced amyloid-beta plaques, and decreased the expression of both amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau. CHIP also alleviated the concentration of microglia and astrocytes around plaques. In APP/PS1 mice of a younger age, CHIP overexpression promoted an increase in ADAM10 expression and inhibited beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, insulin degrading enzyme, and neprilysin expression. Levels of HSP70 and HSP40, which have functional relevance to CHIP, were also increased. Single nuclei transcriptome sequencing in the hippocampus of CHIP overexpressed mice showed that the lysosomal pathway and oligodendrocyte-related biological processes were up-regulated, which may also reflect a potential mechanism for the neuroprotective effect of CHIP. Our research shows that CHIP effectively reduces the behavior and pathological manifestations of APP/PS1 mice. Indeed, overexpression of CHIP could be a beneficial approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is the most severe collateral effect of chemotherapy originated by an excess of oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes that leads to cardiac dysfunction. We assessed clinical data from patients with breast cancer receiving anthracyclines and searched for discriminating microRNAs between patients that developed cardiotoxicity (cases) and those that did not (controls), using RNA sequencing and regression analysis. Serum levels of 25 microRNAs were differentially expressed in cases versus controls within the first year after anthracycline treatment, as assessed by three different regression models (elastic net, Robinson and Smyth exact negative binomial test and random forest). MiR-4732-3p was the only microRNA identified in all regression models and was downregulated in patients that experienced cardiotoxicity. MiR-4732-3p was also present in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and was modulated by anthracycline treatment. A miR-4732-3p mimic was cardioprotective in cardiac and fibroblast cultures, following doxorubicin challenge, in terms of cell viability and ROS levels. Notably, administration of the miR-4732-3p mimic in doxorubicin-treated rats preserved cardiac function, normalized weight loss, induced angiogenesis, and decreased apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis and cardiac myofibroblasts. At the molecular level, miR-4732-3p regulated genes of TGF beta and Hippo signaling pathways. Overall, the results indicate that miR-4732-3p is a novel biomarker of cardiotoxicity that has therapeutic potential against anthracycline-induced heart damage.

AB  - Ketamine is a noncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that exerts rapid antidepressant effects. Preclinical studies identify eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) signaling as essential for the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine. Here, we combine genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological strategies to investigate the role of eEF2K in synaptic function and find that acute, but not chronic, inhibition of eEF2K activity induces rapid synaptic scaling in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling also elicits a similar form of rapid synaptic scaling in the hippocampus, which we observe is independent of eEF2K functioni. The RA signaling pathway is not required for ketamine-mediated antidepressant action; however, direct activation of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) evokes rapid antidepressant action resembling ketamine. Our findings show that ketamine and RAR alpha activation independently elicit a similar form of multiplicative synaptic scaling that is causal for rapid antidepressant action.

AB  - Encoding and retaining novel sequences of sensory stimuli in working memory is crucial for adaptive behavior. A fundamental challenge for the central nervous system is to maintain each sequence item in an active and discriminable state, while also preserving their temporal context. Nested neural oscillations have been postulated to disambiguate the "what"and "when"of sequences, but the mechanisms by which these multiple streams of information are coordinated in the human brain remain unclear. Drawing from foundational animal studies, we recorded local field potentials from the human piriform cortex and hippocampus during a working memory task in which subjects experienced sequences of three distinct odors. Our data revealed a unique organization of odor memories across multiple timescales of the theta rhythm. During encoding, odors elicited greater gamma at distinct theta phases in both regions, time stamping their positions in the sequence, whereby the robustness of this effect was predictive of temporal order memory. During maintenance, stimulus-driven patterns of theta-coupled gamma were spontaneously reinstated in piriform cortex, recapitulating the order of the initial sequence. Replay events were time compressed across contiguous theta cycles, coinciding with periods of enhanced piriform-hippocampal theta-phase synchrony, and their prevalence forecasted subsequent recall accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. Our data provide a novel link between endogenous replay orchestrated by the theta rhythm and short-term retention of sequential memories in the human brain.

AB  - Existing pharmacological treatments for mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) offer limited effectiveness and adverse side effects. Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) utilizing ultrashort ultrasound pulses reaches deep brain regions and may circumvent conductivity issues associated with brain stimulation. This study addresses the gap in TPS research for mild NCD during a critical intervention period before irreversible cognitive degradation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness and tolerability of TPS in older adults with mild NCD. In an open-label study, 17 older adults (including 10 females and 7 males) with mild NCD underwent TPS for two weeks with three sessions per week. Cognitive evaluations and fMRI scans were conducted pre- and post-intervention. The results indicated changes in functional connectivity in key brain regions, correlating with cognitive improvement at B = 0.087 (CI, 0.007-0.167; p = 0.038). However, cortical thickness measurements showed no significant differences. Here we show that TPS can enhance cognitive function within mild NCD. This proof-of-concept study suggests that TPS has potential as a non-invasive therapy used to attenuate cognitive decline, encouraging further investigation in larger randomized trials. The findings could influence clinical practice by introducing TPS as an adjunctive treatment option and potentially impact policy by promoting its inclusion in new treatment strategies for mild NCD.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment. And the underlying mechanism remains unillustrated. HSPB8 is a member of the small heat shock protein family. In this study, we found that the expression of HSPB8 was upregulated in the hippocampus of high-fat diet HFD+streptozotocin STZ- induced diabetic mice and N2a cells exposed to high glucose. Overexpression of HSPB8 relieved cognitive decline in DM mice. Mechanically, HSPB8 overexpression in the hippocampus of diabetic mice inhibited NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation via dephosphorylating mitochondrial fission-associated protein dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at the phosphorylated site Ser616 (p-Drp1S616). Furthermore, HSPB8 overexpression increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reduced oxidative stress. These results indicate a protective effect of HSPB8 in the hippocampus of diabetic mice and N2a cells exposed to high glucose. Overexpression of HSPB8 might be a useful strategy for treating T2DM-related cognitive decline.

AB  - Memories involving the hippocampus can take several days to consolidate, challenging efforts to uncover the neuronal signatures underlying this process. Here, we use calcium imaging in freely moving mice to track the hippocampal dynamics underlying memory consolidation across a 10-day contextual fear conditioning task. We find two neural signatures that emerge following learning and predict memory performance: context-specific place field remapping and coordinated neural activity prior to memory recall (freezing). To test whether these signatures support memory consolidation, we pharmacologically induced amnesia in separate mice by administering anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, immediately following learning. We find that anisomycin paradoxically accelerates cell turnover. Anisomycin also arrests learning-related remapping and blocks coordinated activity predictive of memory-related freezing behavior, effects that are likewise absent in untreated mice that exhibit poor memory expression. We conclude that context-specific place field remapping and the development of coordinated ensemble activity underlie contextual memory consolidation.

AB  - To investigate the effects of the GluN2C subunit on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, we fabricated magnetic nano-gene vectors to inhibit and overexpress GluN2C in rat hippocampal neurons. The present study comprised six experimental groups: normal control (Control); oxygen and glucose deprivation withreoxygenation (OGD/R); Glu2NC si-RNA knockdown (si-RNA); GluN2C si-RNA knockdown and oxygen-glucose deprivation with reoxygenation (si-RNA+ OGD/R); GluN2C overexpression (GluN2C); and GluN2C overexpression and oxygen-glucose deprivation with reoxygenation (GluN2C+ OGD/R). Cells were then cultured for 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h under standard conditions. GluN2C expression was detected by Western blotting. Cell activity was determined using MTT assays. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. GluN2C protein levels in the GluN2C and GluN2C+ OGD/R groups increased with reoxygenation time. GluN2C protein levels were significantly higher in the GluN2C group compared to the GluN2C+ OGD/R group at all measured timepoints. No differences in GluN2C protein levels were observed between the other four experimental groups at any timepoint. After 6 h of reoxygenation, neuronal activity in the si- RNA+ OGD/R group was significantly higher than in the GluN2C+ OGD/R group (0.451 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.419 +/- 0.005; P < 0 .05). Compared to the OGD/R group, neuronal activity was higher in the si-RNA+ OGD/R group and lower in the GluN2C+ OGD/R group after 12 h and 24 h of reoxygenation. Neuronal activity was significantly higher in the si-RNA+ OGD/R group compared to the GluN2C+ OGD/R group. Compared to the OGD/R group, the rate of neuronal apoptosis was lower in the si-RNA+OGD/R group and higher in the GluN2C+ OGD/R group increased. The rate of neuronal apoptosis rate was significantly lower in the si-RNA+ OGD/R group compared to the GluN2C+ OGD/R group at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after reoxygenation. The findings of the present study demonstrate the role of the GluN2C subunit in nerve injury during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB  - Among all major organs, the brain is one of the most susceptible to the inexorable effects of aging. Throughout the last decades, several studies in human cohorts and animal models have revealed a plethora of age-related changes in the brain, including reduced neurogenesis, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence. As the main immune effectors and first responders of the nervous tissue, microglia are at the center of these events. These cells experience irrevocable changes as a result from cumulative exposure to environmental triggers, such as stress, infection and metabolic dysregulation. The age-related immunosenescent phenotype acquired by microglia is characterized by profound modifications in their transcriptomic profile, secretome, morphology and phagocytic activity, which compromise both their housekeeping and defensive functions. As a result, aged microglia are no longer capable of establishing effective immune responses and sustaining normal synaptic activity, directly contributing to age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This review discusses how lifestyle and environmental factors drive microglia dysfunction at the molecular and functional level, also highlighting possible interventions to reverse aging-associated damage to the nervous and immune systems.

AB  - Chronic stress and elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GCs), the main stress hormones, accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression. A major driver of AD progression is the spreading of pathogenic Tau protein between brain regions, precipitated by neuronal Tau secretion. While stress and high GC levels are known to induce intraneuronal Tau pathology (i.e. hyperphosphorylation, oligomerization) in animal models, their role in trans-neuronal Tau spreading is unexplored. Here, we find that GCs promote secretion of full-length, primarily vesicle-free, phosphorylated Tau from murine hippocampal neurons and ex vivo brain slices. This process requires neuronal activity and the kinase GSK3 beta. GCs also dramatically enhance trans-neuronal Tau spreading in vivo, and this effect is blocked by an inhibitor of Tau oligomerization and type 1 unconventional protein secretion. These findings uncover a potential mechanism by which stress/GCs stimulate Tau propagation in AD.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive tumors with poor prognosis and inadequate response to treatment, such as gemcitabine (Gem), the first-line chemotherapeutic drug. Understanding the molecular determinants that control drug resistance to Gem is critical to predict potentially responsive patients and improve the benefits of Gem therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that certain developmental pathways, such as Hippo signaling, are aberrated and play important roles in Gem resistance in cancers. Although Hippo signaling has been reported to play a role in chemoresistance in cancers, it has not been clarified which specific target gene(s) functionally mediates the effect. In the present study, we found that YAP serves as a potent barrier for the cellular sensitivity of PDAC cells to Gem. We then identified and characterized laminin subunit beta 3 (LAMB3) as a bona fide target of YAP-TEAD4 to amplify YAP signaling via a feedback loop. Such a YAP-LAMB3 axis is critical to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and mediate Gem resistance. Taken together, we uncovered that YAP-LAMB3 axis is an important regulator of Gem, thus providing potential therapeutic targets for overcoming Gem resistance in PDAC.

AB  - Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) in the brain is a central component of pathology in Alzheimer's disease. A growing volume of evidence demonstrates close associations between periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Treponema denticola (T. denticola) and AD. However, the effect and mechanisms of T. denticola on accumulation of A beta remain to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that T. denticola was able to enter the brain and act directly on nerve cells resulting in intra- and extracellular A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) accumulation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice by selectively activating both beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Furthermore, both KMI1303, an inhibitor of beta-secretase, as well as DAPT, an inhibitor of gamma- secretase, were found to be able to inhibit the effect of T. denticola on A beta accumulation in N2a neuronal cells. Overall, it is concluded that T. denticola increases the expression of A beta(1-42) and A beta(1-40) by its regulation on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 and presenilin 1.

AB  - The disease Alzheimer is an irrepressible neurologicalbrain disorder. Earlier detection and proper treatment of Alzheimer's disease can help for brain tissue damage prevention. The study was intended to explore the segmentation effects of convolutional neural network (CNN) model on Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging for Alzheimer's diagnosis and nursing. Specifically, 18 Alzheimer's patients admitted to Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) hospital were selected as the experimental group, with 18 healthy volunteers in the Ctrl group. Furthermore, the CNN model was applied to segment the MR imaging of Alzheimer's patients, and its segmentation effects were compared with those of the fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. It was found that the CNN model demonstrated higher segmentation precision, and the experimental group showed a higher clinical dementia rating (CDR) score and a lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score (P < 0.05). The size of parahippocompalgyrus and putamen was bigger in the Ctrl (P < 0.05). In experimental group, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was positively correlated with the MMSE score in areas of bilateral cingulum gyri (r = 0.65) and precuneus (r = 0.59). In conclusion, the grey matter structure is damaged in Alzheimer's patients, and hippocampus ALFF and regional homogeneity (ReHo) is involved in the neuronal compensation mechanism of hippocampal damage, and the caregivers should take an active nursing method.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the molecular basis through which Curcumin (Cur) mitigates neuronal damage caused by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). HT22 was used to simulate intermittent hypoxia (IH) injury and explore the effect of Cur on these cells. We evaluated the cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, proliferation, and Wnt/(3-catenin (W(3C) pathway. IWR-1 was used to block the pathway and investigate the protective mechanism of Cur. We constructed an in vivo model of IH to validate the results of the cellular experiments. IH accelerated apoptosis and cytotoxicity, suppressed proliferation, and decreased the activity of the W(3C pathway. Cur can significantly improve cell viability, reduce apoptosis rate and cell toxicity, promote cell proliferation, and up-regulate the W(3C. After blocking the W(3C pathway, the proliferative effect of Cur was observably weakened. In vivo, IH caused hippocampal damage and inhibited W(3C pathway activity in mice, which was ameliorated by Cur treatment. This implies that Cur could be a novel treatment option for neurological impairment brought on by OSA.

AB  - Rhinovirus (RV) infection of the bronchial epithelium is implicated in the vast majority of severe asthma exacerbations. Interestingly, the susceptibility of bronchial epithelium to RV infection is increased in persons with asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) remodeling is an important feature of severe asthma pathophysiology, and its reduction using bronchial thermoplasty has been associated with a significant decrease in the exacerbation rate. We hypothesized that asthmatic BSM can play a role in RV infection of the bronchial epithelium. Using an original co-culture model between bronchial epithelium and BSM cells, we show that asthmatic BSM cells increase RV replication in bronchial epithelium following RV infection. These findings are related to the increased production of CCL20 by asthmatic BSM cells. Moreover, we demonstrate an original downregulation of the activity of the epithelial protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) antiviral pathway. Finally, we identify a direct bottom-up effect of asthmatic BSM cells on bronchial epithelium susceptibility to RV infection.

AB  - Bioactive compounds present in the powdered leaves of matcha green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) (MGTP) and moringa (Moringa oleifera) (MOLP) seem to be related to health benefits due to their antioxidant properties. The growing accessibility of these powders has led to their being more widely used in food production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (AC) of white chocolate (WCh) supplemented with MGTP and MOLP. AC was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), cupric ion-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, whereas TPC was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) method. Both additives were incorporated at four levels (1, 2, 3 and 4%) in two chocolate processing steps (conching and tempering). Additionally, the amounts of phenolic acids, tocopherols, and carotenoids in WCh samples enriched by MGTP and MOLP were determined to explain their influence on AC. The results showed that the chocolates supplemented with MGTP were characterized by higher antioxidant properties than those with MOLP. In turn, MOLP significantly increased the content of lipophilic antioxidants in chocolates, tocopherols and carotenoids, which also exhibit pro-health effects. Furthermore, the incorporation of these additives during the tempering process was more relevant to the improvement of the antioxidant properties of WCh.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Acute mesenteric ischemia can lead to severe liver damage due to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study investigated the protective effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) against liver damage induced by mesenteric artery I/R via endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mechanisms. Methods: Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups: control, I/R, I/R+TMZ, and I/R+DEX. TMZ (20 mg/kg) was administered orally for seven days, and DEX (100 mu g/kg) was given intraper-itoneally 30 min before I/R induction. Liver tissues were analyzed for creatinine, alanine ami-notransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total thiol (TT) levels. Results: Compared with the control group, the I/R group presented significantly increased AST, ALT, TBARS, and TT levels. TMZ notably reduced creatinine levels. I/R caused significant liver necrosis, inflammation, and congestion. TMZ and DEX treatments reduced this histopathological damage, with DEX resulting in a more significant reduction in infiltrative areas and vascular congestion. The increase in the expression of caspase-3, Bax, 8-OHdG, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) decreased with the TMZ and DEX treatments. In addition, Bcl-2 positivity decreased both in the TMZ and DEX treatments. Conclusions: Both TMZ and DEX have protective effects against liver damage. These effects are likely mediated through the reduction in ERS and apoptosis, with DEX showing slightly superior protective effects compared with TMZ.

AB  - Narirutin (Nar) is a flavonoid that is abundantly present in citrus fruits and has attracted considerable attention because of its diverse pharmacological activities and low toxicity. Here, we evaluated the preventive effects of Nar in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injured mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-injured bEnd.3 cells. Pretreatment with Nar (150 mg/kg) for 7 days effectively reduced infarct volume, improved neurological deficits, and significantly inhibited neuronal death in the hippocampus and cortex in MCAO/R-injured mice. Moreover, anti-apoptotic effects of Nar (50 mu M) were observed in OGD/R-injured bEnd.3 cells. In addition, Nar pre-administration regulated blood-brain barrier function by increasing tight junction-related protein expression after MCAO/R and OGD/R injury. Nar also inhibited NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by reducing the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results provide new evidence for the use of Nar in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

AB  - The developing human and mouse teeth constitute an ideal model system to study the regulatory mechanism underlying organ growth control since their teeth share highly conserved and well-characterized developmental processes, and their developmental tempo varies notably. In the current study, we manipulated heterogenous recombination between human and mouse dental tissues and demonstrated that the dental mesenchyme dominates the tooth developmental tempo and FGF8 could be a critical player during this developmental process. Forced activation of FGF8 signaling in the dental mesenchyme of mice promoted cell proliferation, prevented cell apoptosis via p38 and perhaps PI3K-Akt intracellular signaling, and impelled the transition of the cell cycle from G1- to S-phase in the tooth germ, resulting in the slowdown of the tooth developmental pace. Our results provide compelling evidence that extrinsic signals can profoundly affect tooth developmental tempo, and the dental mesenchymal FGF8 could be a pivotal factor in controlling the developmental pace in a non-cell-autonomous manner during mammalian odontogenesis.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are stress hormones that play central roles in the immediate and slower adaptive responses of the brain and body to new behavioral experience. The exact mechanisms by which the rapid and slow processes underlying glucocorticoid mnemonic effects unfold are under intensive scrutiny. It is possible that glucocorti-coids rapidly modify memory representations in the brain by interfering with synaptic functions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons in a timing and context dependent manner. In particular, activity-dependent trans-synaptic messengers appear to have all the necessary attributes to engage in the rapid signaling by glu-cocorticoids and regulate the brain and behaviors. Novel frameworks for the treatment of stress-related disorders could emerge from a better characterization of the dynamic interplay between the rapid and slow signaling components by glucocorticoids on large-scale brain networks. Here I present some of the exact factors that could help reach this objective.

AB  - BackgroundDiabetes mellitus (DM) patients with cognitive impairment seriously affect their quality of life. The onset and development of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction are associated with neuronal excitability. In this work, we aimed to reveal the pathogenesis of DM-induced cognitive impairment.MethodsDM mouse model was constructed by high-fat diet combined with streptozocin. Morris water maze test and novel object recognition was used to examine spatial learning and memory ability of mice. The protein expression levels of Fc gamma receptor 2b (FCGR2B), SHC1, p-PI3K and p-AKT were measured by Western blot. Neuronal markers c-Fos and GABAA were detected by Immunohistochemistry.ResultsFCGR2B was highly expressed in hippocampus of DM mice, which was directly associated with Shc1. In vivo, DM mice exhibited decrease of spatial learning and memory ability and up-regulation of FCGR2B. FCGR2B knockdown improved spatial learning and memory ability of DM mice. Not only that, FCGR2B silencing increased the expression of SHC1, p-PI3K and p-AKT in hippocampus of DM mice. Excitatory neuron marker c-Fos was markedly increased and inhibitory neuron marker gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor was markedly decreased in the hippocampus of DM mice with FCGR2B silencing.ConclusionKnock-down FCGR2B within hippocampus of DM mice activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via SHC1 in DM mice and alleviated DM-induced cognition impairment. Knock-down FCGR2B alleviated DM-induced cognition impairment by regulating hippocampal neuronal excitability. Thus, this work suggested that FCGR2B may be a potential target for treatment of DM-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs as a common complication after injury or in genetic disorders. The mechanisms underlying HO remain incompletely understood, and there are no approved prophylactic or secondary treatments available. Here, we identify a self-amplifying, self-propagating loop of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-Sonic hedgehog (SHH) as a core molecular mechanism underlying diverse forms of HO. In mouse models of progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH), a disease caused by null mutations in GNAS, we found that Gnas(-/-) mesenchymal cells secreted SHH, which induced osteoblast differentiation of the surrounding wild-type cells. We further showed that loss of Gnas led to activation of YAP transcription activity, which directly drove Shh expression. Secreted SHH further induced YAP activation, Shh expression, and osteoblast differentiation in surrounding wild-type cells. This self-propagating positive feedback loop was both necessary and sufficient for HO expansion and could act independently of Gnas in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), another genetic HO, and non-hereditary HO mouse models. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP or SHH abolished HO in POH and FOP and acquired HO mouse models without affecting normal bone homeostasis, providing a previously unrecognized therapeutic rationale to prevent, reduce, and shrink HO.

AB  - Simple Summary Identifying effective and economically feasible changes to apply at the farming level to improve animal welfare are of great importance. Horses reared for meat production are conventionally fed high amounts of concentrates rich in starch and simple sugars; however, horses are herbivores and adapted to eat a fibre-based diet. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of two different feeding management systems on the behavioural activities and subsequent welfare of horses reared for meat purposes. Our findings provide new insights into the positive consequences of feeding horses reared for meat production on a fibre-based diet in terms of both welfare and farming economics. This change in feed management allows horses to express a more natural time budget, spending more time expressing feeding behaviour, which improves horse welfare and reduces energy expenditure in the form of excitable behaviours. Horses reared for meat production are generally fed a diet rich in starch with the aim of maximizing production performances. This study evaluated the effects of two feeding management systems on horse welfare by analysing the relative time spent engaged in different behavioural activities. Nineteen Bardigiano horses aged 14.3 +/- 0.7 months were randomly assigned to one of two group pens: one group was fed high amounts of starch-rich concentrates (HCG; n = 10), the other was fed a fibre-based diet (HFG; n = 9). Behavioural activities performed by each horse were video-recorded over a 96-h period. A scan sampling process (n = 144 scans/horse/day; total n of scans sampled = 10,368) was used, and the scans were analysed according to a specific ethogram. The mean frequency (%/24 h) spent exhibiting each behavioural activity was calculated to obtain the time budget. After checking for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), Student's t tests (normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney tests (not normally distributed data) were used to compare the time budgets of the two groups of horses (HCG vs. HFG). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the components explaining the variability in behavioural activities between the two groups. K-means cluster analysis subsequently confirmed the PCA results. The behavioural activities associated with feeding horses a fibre-based diet correlated with better horse welfare compared with feeding horses a starch-based diet. Feeding horses a fibre-based diet resulted advantageous from both the welfare and economic perspective; it allowed horses to spend more time expressing feeding behaviours and reduced energy expenditure in the form of excitable, or "fizzy", behaviours.

AB  - Nanobodies (Nbs) are single domain antibody fragments derived from heavy-chain antibodies found in members of the Camelidae family. They have become a relevant class of biomolecules for many different applications because of several important advantages such as their small size, high solubility and stability, and low production costs. On the other hand, synthetic Nb libraries are emerging as an attractive alternative to animal immunization for the selection of antigen-specific Nbs. Here, we present the design and construction of a new synthetic nanobody library using the phage display technology, following a structure-based approach in which the three hypervariable loops were subjected to position-specific randomization schemes. The constructed library has a clonal diversity of 10(8) and an amino acid variability that matches the codon distribution set by design at each randomized position. We have explored the capabilities of the new library by selecting nanobodies specific for three antigens: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the glycoprotein complex (GnGc) of Andes virus. To test the potential of the library to yield a variety of antigen-specific Nbs, we introduced a biopanning strategy consisting of a single selection round using stringent conditions. Using this approach, we obtained several binders for each of the target antigens. The constructed library represents a promising nanobody source for different applications.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy has various origins, involving or not involving structural changes in brain tissue. The mechanisms of epileptogenesis are associated with cell regulation and signaling disruptions expressed in varied levels of proteins. The blood plasma proteomic profiling of temporal lobe epilepsy patients (including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positive and MRI-negative ones) and healthy volunteers using mass spectrometry and label-free quantification revealed a list of differently expressed proteins. Several apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOD, and APOA4), serpin protease inhibitors (SERPINA3, SERPINF1, etc.), complement components (C9, C8, and C1R), and a total of 42 proteins were found to be significantly upregulated in the temporal lobe epilepsy group. A classification analysis of these proteins according to their biological functions, as well as a review of the published sources, disclosed the predominant involvement of the processes mostly affected during epilepsy such as neuroinflammation, intracellular signaling, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress. The presence of several proteins related to the corresponding compensatory mechanisms has been noted. After further validation, the newly identified temporal lobe epilepsy biomarker candidates may be used as epilepsy diagnostic tools, in addition to other less specific methods such as electroencephalography or MRI.

AB  - Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication skills, ataxia, motor and balance deficits, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. The genetic cause of AS is the neuronal loss of UBE3A expression in the brain. A novel approach, described here, is a stem cell gene therapy which uses lentivector-transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to deliver functional UBE3A to affected cells. We have demonstrated both the prevention and reversal of AS phenotypes upon transplantation and engraftment of human CD34+ cells transduced with a Ube3a lentivector in a novel immunodeficient Ube3a(mat-/pat+) IL2rg(-/y) mouse model of AS. A significant improvement in motor and cognitive behavioral assays as well as normalized delta power measured by electroencephalogram was observed in neonates and adults transplanted with the gene modified cells. Human hematopoietic profiles observed in the lymphoid organs by detection of human immune cells were normal. Expression of UBE3A was detected in the brains of the adult treatment group following immunohistochemical staining illustrating engraftment of the gene-modified cells expressing UBE3A in the brain. As demonstrated with our data, this stem cell gene therapy approach offers a promising treatment strategy for AS, not requiring a critical treatment window.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a critical regulator in controlling the expression level of genes involved in cell differentiation and development. Primordial follicle activation (PFA) is the first step for follicle maturation, and excessive PFA results in premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). However, the correlation between lncRNA and cell differentiation was largely unknown, especially during PFA. In this study, we observed the expression level of lncRNA was more specific than protein-coding genes in both follicles and granulosa cells, suggesting lncRNA might play a crucial role in follicle development. Hence, a systematical framework was needed to infer the functions of lncRNAs during PFA. Additionally, an increasing number of studies indicate that the subpathway is more precise in reflecting biological processes than the entire pathway. Given the complex expression patterns of lncRNA target genes, target genes were further clustered based on their expression similarity and classification performance to reveal the activated/inhibited gene modules, which intuitively illustrated the diversity of lncRNA regulation. Moreover, the knockdown of SBF2-AS1 in the A549 cell line and ZFAS1 in the SK-Hep1 cell line further validated the function of SBF2-AS1 in regulating the Hippo signaling subpathway and ZFAS1 in the cell cycle subpathway. Overall, our findings demonstrated the importance of subpathway analysis in uncovering the functions of lncRNAs during PFA, and paved new avenues for future lncRNA-associated research.

AB  - The significant development of industry and the growing demand for renewable fuels lead to the accumulation of massive amounts of glycerol as a by-product. Scientists have been trying to use this product as a raw material for several years. One of its uses is in the acquirement of 1,3-propanediol (PDO). This work presents studies on the synthesis of two new urethane acrylate resins obtained from 1,3-propanediol and urethane acrylate oligomers containing isocyanate groups in each molecule. The method for obtaining the resins was presented, considering various conditions of synthesis, i.e., the structure of the carbon chain of the oligomer used, the molar ratio of the reactants, or the use of solvents. The reactions were monitored in real time by FTIR until the disappearance of the NCO groups. Then, polymer films were prepared from the obtained products and cured using UV radiation or thermally. The obtained coatings were tested in terms of the photopolymerization kinetics and properties of the cured coatings. Resultantly, the obtained bio-sourced coatings were observed to be characterized by good functional properties and a short curing duration, both with the use of UV radiation-based or thermal curing. These types of resins obtained using a bioproduct can be employed as eco-friendly film-forming products in the coating industry for many applications. In particular, due to their potential for dual curing methods (UV or thermal), these resins can be used on three-dimensional surfaces, i.e., those in which there is a possibility of the insufficient availability of UV radiation.

AB  - Ca2+ imaging methods are widely used for studying cellular activity in the brain, allowing detailed analysis of dynamic processes across various scales. Enhanced by high-contrast optical microscopy and fluorescent Ca2+ sensors, this technique can be used to reveal localized Ca2+ fluctuations within neurons, including in sub-cellular structures, such as the dendritic shaft or spines. Despite advances in Ca2+ sensors, the analysis of miniature Synaptic Calcium Transients (mSCTs), characterized by variability in morphology and low signal-to-noise ratios, remains challenging. Traditional threshold-based methods struggle with the detection and segmentation of these small, dynamic events. Deep learning (DL) approaches offer promising solutions but are limited by the need for large annotated datasets. Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning addresses this limitation by leveraging unlabeled instances to increase dataset size and enhance performance. This approach is particularly useful in the case of mSCTs that are scarce and small, associated with a very small proportion of the foreground pixels. PU learning significantly increases the effective size of the training dataset, improving model performance. Here, we present a PU learning-based strategy for detecting and segmenting mSCTs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We evaluate the performance of two 3D deep learning models, StarDist-3D and 3D U-Net, which are well established for the segmentation of small volumetric structures in microscopy datasets. By integrating PU learning, we enhance the 3D U-Net's performance, demonstrating significant gains over traditional methods. This work pioneers the application of PU learning in Ca2+ imaging analysis, offering a robust framework for mSCT detection and segmentation. We also demonstrate how this quantitative analysis pipeline can be used for subsequent mSCTs feature analysis. We characterize morphological and kinetic changes of mSCTs associated with the application of chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) stimulation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Our data-driven approach shows that a cLTP-inducing stimulus leads to the emergence of new active dendritic regions and differently affects mSCTs subtypes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate how the cumulative expulsion interval, litter size, and birth order influence the characteristics of newborn piglets from hyperprolific sows, as well as their intake of colostrum. Analysis was conducted on the temporal aspects of parturition in 254 sows, including 3920 piglets. Newborn piglet characteristics examined encompassed delivery time, birth order, birth status, umbilical cord rupture, meconium staining, delivery ease, birth weight, blood oxygen saturation, and heart rate. From the raw data, colostrum intake, birth interval, and cumulative birth interval of each piglet were computed. Piglets were sorted based on the cumulative expulsion interval into nine categories: 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 121-150, 151-180, 181-210, 211-240, and >240 min. Litter sizes were categorized into three groups: 10-13, 14-17, and >18 piglets per litter. The birth-order ranking referred to the piglet's position within a litter and was categorized into four quartiles: 1, 2, 3, and 4. On average, the expulsion interval, cumulative expulsion interval, and colostrum consumption were 14.8 f 21.8 min, 138.6 f 155.7 min, and 407.6 f 162.1 g, respectively. In litters with >18 piglets, the percentage of piglets with inadequate colostrum intake (<300 g) was higher compared to litters with 10-13 piglets (33.1 % vs. 12.9%, P < 0.001) and 14-17 piglets (23.9 %, P < 0.001). The occurrence of stillbirths in the fourth quartile of the litter was higher than in the first (16.0 % vs. 2.2 %, P < 0.001), second (4.0 %, P < 0.001), and third (7.8 %, P < 0.001) quartiles. Among litters with >18 piglets, those born in the third quartile exhibited lower colostrum consumption compared to those born in the first quartile (346.0 f 9.9 vs. 391.4 f 8.6 g, P = 0.028). Colostrum intake decreased with longer cumulative expulsion intervals, evident from a notable decline starting at 90 min post-farrowing compared to piglets born within the first 30 min (P = 0.004). Interestingly, colostrum consumption exhibited a negative correlation with the cumulative expulsion interval (P < 0.001), but not with individual piglet expulsion intervals (P = 0.460). Piglets born with meconium staining were most prevalent among those with a cumulative expulsion interval of >240 min. In summary, both the cumulative expulsion interval and birth-order ranking significantly impact the physiological characteristics of newborn piglets and their colostrum intake. Colostrum consumption decreases and newborn piglet characteristics change with higher cumulative expulsion intervals. Identifying piglets at high risk of hypoxia and implementing appropriate treatments and management strategies within an optimal timeframe could aid pig producers in reducing pre-weaning mortality among piglets born to hyperprolific sows.

AB  - Simple Summary Zoos are home to a diverse range of species, including those in need of conservation. Given the high costs involved in caring for their residents and satisfying their commitments to educating the public, zoos rely on patronage from visitors. Zoos, therefore, need to understand how visitors think and feel about the well-being of the animals in their collections. If visitors perceive zoos as spaces where animals are unhappy, they will be less likely to visit. This qualitative study documented and assessed visitor experiences of and responses to training activities provided for the resident herd of African elephants at Zoo Tampa, Florida, USA. Surveys were conducted with visitors following their attendance at elephant training and enrichment sessions, and they focused on ascertaining visitor perceptions of elephant emotions, care, and welfare. These surveys revealed that visitors perceived that the elephants involved in the encounters were happy, content, calm, comfortable, engaged, excited, good, playful, and safe (among other emotional descriptors) and that they experienced good welfare. Responses also gave insight into why visitors felt this was the case and identified aspects that visitors did not like or that they felt could be improved. The research provides zoos with insight into the impact that animal-caregiver interactions can have on visitors' perceptions, and it offers a model that could be applied across the sector.Abstract Zoos strive to provide excellent welfare for resident animals, including those belonging to endangered species involved in captive breeding programs while addressing visitors' concerns regarding the ethics of captivity. Zoos also rely on income and support from visitors to provide exceptional care for their animal residents. It is essential, therefore, that zoos consider how visitors perceive their animals' well-being, including physical and psychological welfare. This pragmatic, qualitative research explores the aspects of training-focused enrichment activities provided for a resident herd of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) that visitors liked/disliked, and it assesses perceptions of the animals' emotions and welfare. Data were collected via surveys following live encounters at Zoo Tampa, Florida (USA). Reflexive Thematic Analysis generated key themes related to visitors' most/least-liked aspects of the encounters, including proximity, elephant-caregiver relationships (ECRs), educational content, and teaching/learning opportunities for the elephants themselves. Participants in the research perceived the elephants as happy, content, calm, comfortable, engaged, excited, good, playful, and safe (among other emotional descriptors) and as having excellent welfare. Expressions of dislike referred to visitors' inability to have contact with the elephants, such as via touching or feeding. While focused on one case-study zoo and a charismatic species, this study nonetheless provides zoos with insight into the impact that animal-caregiver interactions can have on visitors' perceptions, and it offers a model that could be applied to other species and at other zoological institutions. These visitor experiences and visitor perceptions of animal welfare drive future visitor actions, including support for zoos.

AB  - The Sardinian grass snake, Natrix helvetica cetti, is an island-endemic subspecies with a restricted and highly fragmented distribution confined to Sardinia, Italy. Information on its reproductive biology and wild offspring remain scarce in the scientific literature. This present study reports the first recorded data on a clutch of eggs laid by a wild melanistic female N. h. cetti that exhibited lethargy when observed basking, prompting a brief period of health monitoring and screening for the presence of the pathogenic fungus Ophidiomyces ophidiicola (Oo). The clutch yielded nine hatchlings, for which phenotypic data are provided and compared with existing information on the Natrix natrix complex. Both the adult female and its offspring tested negative in the Oo screening. The body size of the adult grass snake, specifically its snout-to-vent length of 48.3 cm, is the smallest ever recorded for a gravid female N. helvetica. This may indicate that maturity is reached at particularly small sizes, a distinctive trait of this intriguing island subspecies, suggesting the need for further investigation.

AB  - Simple Summary Supernumerary marker chromosomes, as they are known in the human population, are usually small chromosomes that differ morphologically and structurally from the standard ones and in many cases are formed by genetically inert heterochromatin. Similar features were observed for a supernumerary chromosome discovered in two Asian elephants, a mother and her male offspring. In this study, we present its detailed analysis using several molecular cytogenetic techniques including laser microdissection and fluorescence in situ hybridization that allowed identification of this marker chromosome. Based on our findings, we propose the most possible mechanism for the origin of the marker studied. We extended our investigation and showed that the distribution of nucleolar organizer regions on the chromosomes of Asian and savanna elephants may be related to the distribution of heterochromatin. Supernumerary chromosomes or, in other words, additional or extra chromosomes added to typical human or animal karyotypes, have recently gained the attention of scientists as model systems for the study of chromosome evolution, which may include the chromosome marker described here. We identified a small, supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) in two phenotypically normal Asian elephants (Elephas maximus): a female (2n = 57,XX,+mar) and her male offspring (2n = 57,XY,+mar). sSMCs are defined as structurally abnormal chromosomes that cannot be identified by conventional banding analysis since they are usually small and often lack distinct banding patterns. Although current molecular techniques can reveal their origin, the mechanism of their formation is not yet fully understood. We determined the origin of the marker using a suite of conventional and molecular cytogenetic approaches that included (a) G- and C-banding, (b) AgNOR staining, (c) preparation of a DNA clone using laser microdissection of the marker chromosome, (d) FISH with commercially available human painting and telomeric probes, and (e) FISH with centromeric DNA derived from the centromeric regions of a marker-free Asian elephant. Moreover, we present new information on the location and number of NORs in Asian and savanna elephants. We show that the metacentric marker was composed of heterochromatin with NORs at the terminal ends, originating most likely from the heterochromatic region of chromosome 27. In this context, we discuss the possible mechanism of marker formation. We also discuss the similarities between sSMCs and B chromosomes and whether the marker chromosome presented here could evolve into a B chromosome in the future.

AB  - The FLT3-ITD mutation occurs in about 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor prognosis. However, FLT3 inhibitors are only partially effective and prone to acquired resistance. Here, we identified Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) as a tumor suppressor in FLT3-ITD+ AML. YAP1 inactivation conferred FLT3-ITD+ AML cell resistance to chemo- and targeted therapy. Mass spectrometric assay revealed that DNA damage repair gene poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) might be the downstream of YAP1, and the pro-proliferative effect by YAP1 knockdown was partly reversed via PARP1 inhibitor. Importantly, histone deacetylase 10 (HDAC10) contributed to decreased YAP1 acetylation levels through histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation, leading to the reduced nuclear accumulation of YAP1. Selective HDAC10 inhibitor chidamide or HDAC10 knockdown activated YAP1, enhanced DNA damage, and significantly attenuated FLT3-ITD+ AML cell resistance. In addition, combination chidamide with FLT3 inhibitors or chemotherapy agents synergistically inhibited growth and increased apoptosis of FLT3-ITD+ AML cell lines and acquired resistant cells from the relapse FLT3-ITD+ AML patients. These findings demonstrate that the HDAC10-YAP1-PARP1 axis maintains FLT3-ITD+ AML cells and targeting this axis might improve clinical outcomes in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary sources of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are essential in canine diets and provide many health benefits. Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a low-input, high-yield oilseed crop that produces highly unsaturated oil (similar to 90%), has a desirable omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio, and high concentrations of tocopherols. These attributes make camelina oil a potential alternative to other plant-based oil products for canine nutrition. In the current study, we evaluated the safety of dietary camelina oil supplementation in dogs over a 16-week period in dogs by assessing body weight, body condition score, food intake, and hematology and biochemistry analytes. Differences in the results were minimal compared to dogs fed canola and flaxseed oil, which are regarded as safe for use in canine diets. Therefore, camelina oil can be considered safe for use in the nutrition of adult dogs. This study aimed to determine whether camelina oil is safe for use in canine diets, using canola oil and flax oil as controls, as they are similar and generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for canine diets. A total of thirty privately-owned adult dogs of various breeds (17 females; 13 males), with an average age of 7.2 +/- 3.1 years (mean +/- SD) and a body weight (BW) of 27.4 +/- 14.0 kg were used. After a 4-week wash-in period using sunflower oil and kibble, the dogs were blocked by breed, age, and size and were randomly allocated to one of three treatment oils (camelina (CAM), flax (FLX), or canola (OLA)) at a level of 8.2 g oil/100 g total dietary intake. Body condition score (BCS), BW, food intake (FI), and hematological and select biochemical parameters were measured at various timepoints over a 16-week feeding period. All of the data were analyzed with ANOVA using the PROC GLIMMIX of SAS. No biologically significant differences were seen between the treatment groups in terms of BW, BCS, FI, and hematological and biochemical results. Statistically significant differences noted among some serum biochemical results were considered small and were due to normal biological variation. These results support the conclusion that camelina oil is safe for use in canine nutrition.

AB  - Simple Summary It is paramount to preserve the genetic material of endangered wildlife species for future generations, including that of the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana). By analyzing their genetic information, it is possible to decipher how endangered species such as elephants adapted to live on our planet and how they are related to one another and to their extinct ancestors. This information can further assist us in the protection of endangered animals and the habitats they live in. One way of doing this is through the cryopreservation of elephants' primary cell lines. This protocol presents the successful establishment of primary dermal fibroblast cell lines using a simple explant outgrowth method, starting from a small punch biopsy sample, which is minimally invasive and allows sample collection of free-roaming elephants. The average explant outgrowth, doubling time and further characterization of the dermal fibroblast cells of different elephants have been evaluated and compared. This preliminary method illustrates the potential to establish cell lines from living elephants, which contributes to the conservation of their genetic material and allows further research on the cancer suppressing ability of elephants. Following population declines of the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) across the African continent, the establishment of primary cell lines of endangered wildlife species is paramount for the preservation of their genetic resources. In addition, it allows molecular and functional studies on the cancer suppression mechanisms of elephants, which have previously been linked to a redundancy of tumor suppressor gene TP53. This methodology describes the establishment of primary elephant dermal fibroblast (EDF) cell lines from skin punch biopsy samples (diameter: & PLUSMN;4 mm) of African savanna elephants (n = 4, 14-35 years). The applied tissue collection technique is minimally invasive and paves the way for future remote biopsy darting. On average, the first explant outgrowth was observed after 15.75 & PLUSMN; 6.30 days. The average doubling time (Td) was 93.02 & PLUSMN; 16.94 h and 52.39 & PLUSMN; 0.46 h at passage 1 and 4, respectively. Metaphase spreads confirmed the diploid number of 56 chromosomes. The successful establishment of EDF cell lines allows for future elephant cell characterization studies and for research on the cancer resistance mechanisms of elephants, which can be harnessed for human cancer prevention and treatment and contributes to the conservation of their genetic material.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increase in the popularity of breeding insect larvae (Tenebrio Molitor and Hermetia Illucens). Dimensioning larvae and observing their growth over time is a key component of monitoring insect larvae breeding. Due to the high number of larvae in the analysed images (dense scenes) and their overlap, determining the size distribution of larvae in real-time is a research challenge. In this work, we proposed an efficient method for determining the size distribution of larvae based on a regression convolutional neural network (RegCNN) and knowledge transfer. Larval width was chosen as the main measured larval parameter due to its ease of registration in dense scenes. The larval length L and its volume V were determined indirectly using determined regression models L(width) and V(width). RegCNN training was performed using knowledge transfer to omit the time-consuming labelling of multiple images containing larvae at different growth stages. Training used quartiles (lower quartile, median, upper quartile) of larval widths determined using improved multistage larvae phenotyping based on classical computer vision methods and larvae segmentation model. Finally, our approach required labelling only a few images for calibration purposes. The study evaluated different RegCNN architectures: pre-trained on ImageNet (ResNet, EfficientNet) and custom with a reduced number of model parameters. The proposed method was validated for the distribution of larvae characterised by width quartiles taking values from 1.7 mm to 3.1 mm, corresponding to an average larval length of 16 mm to 28 mm. For the best evaluated model (ResNet18) in larval width estimation, we obtained RMSE = 0.131 mm (average RMSE = 1.12 mm for larval length estimation) and R-2 = 0.870 (coefficient of determination) with an average inference time of 0.30 s/box. The best proposed custom architecture (TenebrioRegCNN_v3) achieved slightly lower accuracy (RMSE = 0.134 mm, R-2 = 0.864) with about five times lower inference time per image than ResNet18. The quantitative results confirmed the proposed method's potential to be applied in real breeding conditions.

AB  - -Tryptophan hydroxylases 1 and 2 (TPH1 and TPH2) play a key role in the synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), a hormone and neurotransmitter, in the peripheral organs and brain, respectively. The main aim of this study was to clarify the distribution of mRNA of the Tph1 and Tph2 genes in brain structures under normal conditions and after inflammation. The experiments were carried out on young (4 weeks old) male C57BL/6 mice. The animals were divided into three groups: intact, control, injected ip with saline, and injected ip with 2 mg/kg of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Markers of inflammation, spleen mass and thymus mass were assayed 5 days after the saline or LPS administration. In the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain the concentrations of 5-HT and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), and TPH activity were assayed using HPLC, while Tph1 and Tph2 mRNA were quantified using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. A dramatic increase of spleen mass and decrease of thymus mass 5 days after LPS administration was shown. A significant increase of 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the midbrain as well as decrease of 5-HIAA concentration and TPH activity in hypothalamus in mice treated with LPS and saline compared with intact animals was revealed. The highest concentration of Tph2 gene mRNA was observed in the midbrain in 5-HT neuron bodies, while this gene mRNA level was lower in 5-HT endings (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus). Trace amounts of Tph1 mRNA was found in all studied brain structures in mice of the three groups. Thus, Tph1 gene expression in the mouse brain is too low to significantly affect 5-HT synthesis in normal conditions and during inflammation.

AB  - Astrocyte maldevelopment is implicated in various neuropsychiatric diseases associated with early life stress. However, the underlying astrocytopathy mechanism, which can result in the psychiatric symptoms, remains unclear. In this study, it is shown that a reduced oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) population accompanies hindered hippocampal astrocytic development in an improved parental isolation mouse model, and that the loss of OPCs suppresses astrocytic network formation and activity. It is further demonstrated that OPC-derived Wnt ligands, in particular Wnt7b, are required for Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-mediated astrocytic development and subsequent effects related to neuronal function. In addition, focal replenishment of Wnt7a/b is sufficient to rescue astrocytic maldevelopment. These results elucidate a Wnt-paracrine-dependent but myelin-independent role of OPCs in regulating astrocytic development, which provides a unique insight into the astrocytopathy mechanism in early life stress, and can be implicated in the pathogenesis of human early life stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - . Clefts of the lip and/or palate (CLP) are visible disruptions of standard facial structure. The aim of our study was to determine a relative number and appearance of the tissue factors in bone of patients with CLP during first time plastic alveolar osteoplasty or rhinoplasty. Immunohistochemistry was performed with matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), Runt -related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), beta-defensin-2 (beta def-2), beta-defensin-3 (beta def-3), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). The bone formation was observed by Masson-trichrome (Masson) staining. For the quantification of structures, the semi-quantitative census method was used. Spearman rank order correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney U test were used for the statistical analysis. A significantly higher number of OPN positive osteocytes was observed in the CLP group when compared to the control group (p=0.002). The number of OC positive osteocytes (p=0.000) and beta def-2 positive osteocytes (p=0.003) was significantly lower in the CLP group in comparison to the control group. Strong, positive correlations between IL-10 and OC (rs=0.608; p=0.002), IL-1 alpha and MMP-9 (rs=0.666; p=0.000), OPN and MMP-8 (rs=0.620; p=0.002) were detected in the CLP group. A tendency for the increased appearance of MMP-8, MMP-9 positive osteocytes of the patients with CLP, suggests elevated tissue remodelling properties. Increased appearance of OPN positive osteocytes in bone of the patients with CLP shows increased bone homeostasis based on seriously decreased mineralization, which may be a possible compensatory reaction to decreased quality of postsurgical bone.

AB  - This study classified cows' foraging behaviors using machine learning (ML) models evaluated through random test split (RTS) and cross-validation (CV) data partition methods. Models included Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB). These models classified activity states (active vs. static), foraging behaviors (grazing (GR), resting (RE), walking (W), ruminating (RU)), posture states (standing up (SU) vs. lying down (LD)), and posture combinations with rumination and resting behaviors (RU_SU, RU_LD, RE_SU, and RE_LD). XGB achieved the highest accuracy for state classification (74.5% RTS, 74.2% CV) and foraging behavior (69.4% CV). RF outperformed XGB in other classifications, including GR, RE, and RU (62.9% CV vs. 56.4% RTS), posture (83.9% CV vs. 79.4% RTS), and behaviors-by-posture (58.8% CV vs. 56.4% RTS). Key predictors varied: speed and Actindex were crucial for GR and W when increasing and for RE and RU when decreasing. X low values were linked to RE_SU and RU_SU, while X and Z influenced RE_LD more. RTS showed higher accuracy in activity states classification while CV in foraging behaviors and by posture classification. These results emphasize CV in RF's reliability in managing complex behavioral patterns and the importance of continuous recording devices and movement data to monitor cattle behavior accurately.

AB  - Simple Summary The hippocampus (Hp) is involved in various aspects of spatial cognition during navigation, reflected in multiple neural oscillations across different frequencies. Given the structure homology between the avian and mammalian Hp, does it exhibit similar cross-frequency interaction mechanisms? Unlike rodents, birds can navigate by walking and flying. So, does the avian Hp share the same information interaction under different locomotor modes? In this study, we employed rock pigeons with exceptional spatial navigation abilities and conducted two goal-directed navigational experiments: a ground maze task with a circuitous paradigm and an outdoor homing flight task. These experiments were designed to explore the interactions between different frequency bands in the avian Hp during walking and flying navigation. The study revealed that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) existed in the avian Hp during the navigational active phases. Meanwhile, the sub-frequency bands modulated by theta oscillations are different in different modes of locomotion. These findings support evidence for cross-frequency interactions in the avian Hp during spatial navigation and contribute to explaining the role of coupling, at least partially, in the ongoing cognitive demands during the navigation process.Abstract Navigation is a complex task in which the hippocampus (Hp), which plays an important role, may be involved in interactions between different frequency bands. However, little is known whether this cross-frequency interaction exists in the Hp of birds during navigation. Therefore, we examined the electrophysiological characteristics of hippocampal cross-frequency interactions of domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica) during navigation. Two goal-directed navigation tasks with different locomotor modes were designed, and the local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded for analysis. We found that the amplitudes of high-frequency oscillations in Hp were dynamically modulated by the phase of co-occurring theta-band oscillations both during ground-based maze and outdoor flight navigation. The high-frequency amplitude sub-frequency bands modulated by the hippocampal theta phase were different at different tasks, and this process was independent of the navigation path and goal. These results suggest that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the avian Hp may be more associated with the ongoing cognitive demands of navigational processes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of potential mechanisms of hippocampal PAC on multi-frequency informational interactions in avian navigation and provide valuable insights into cross-species evolution.

AB  - Small-molecule positive allosteric modulator 1 (SPAM1), which targets pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor 1 (PAC1-R), has been found to have a neuroprotective effect, and the underlying mechanism was explored in this study. First, using a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model, we confirmed that SPAM1 improves the structure of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and restores the number of neurons. Compared with D-gal model mice, SPAM1-treated mice showed up-regulated expression of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and Lamin B1 and down-regulated expression of YinYang 1 (YY1) and p16. A similar tendency was observed in senescent RGC-5 cells induced by long-term culture, indicating that SPAM1 exhibits significant in vitro and in vivo anti-senescence activity in neurons. Then, using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis, we further explored the mechanism behind SPAM1's neuroprotective effects and found that SPAM is involved in the longevity-regulating pathway. Finally, the up-regulation of neurofilament light and medium polypeptides indicated by the proteomics results was further confirmed by Western blotting. These results help to lay a pharmacological network foundation for the use of SPAM1 as a potent anti-aging therapeutic drug to combat neurodegeneration with anti-senescence, neuroprotective, and nerve regeneration activity.

AB  - Simple Summary Beginning with Darwin, scientists have long considered the reasons for why some species but not others were domesticated. For example, of the equid species, horses and asses, but not the zebra, were domesticated. Many reasons for the 'domesticability' of mammalian species have been proposed (e.g., diet, social organization, response to humans). However, none of these traits have been subjected to empirical investigation. Here, we review past proposals for several domesticability traits and use a novel quantitative and evolutionary analysis to evaluate the explanatory power of these traits for domestication. For hoofed mammals, a heightened physiological response to humans, modeled as vulnerability to capture myopathy, emerged as the only significant obstacle to domestication. This is consistent with the reconstructed evolution of capture myopathy in ungulates, especially equids, and the prehistory of predation on equids, which shows that ancestral horses lost the vulnerability to capture myopathy consequent to a reduction in predation pressure on horses. Zebras, however, retained the vulnerability to capture myopathy as an adaptation to persistent high predation pressure, which would have impeded their domestication. Our results point to the importance of considering an animal's behavior and biology as either an impediment or facilitator of domestication or developing a human-animal symbiotic relationship.Abstract Since Darwin, many evolutionary and behavioral researchers have considered the role of phenotypic traits that favor the domestication of nonhuman animals. Among such proposed traits are a species' social structure, level of intra- and interspecific agonistic interactions, sociosexual behaviors, parental strategies, reaction to humans, habitat preference, dietary habits, developmental trajectories, and utility to humans. However, little to no comparative phylogenetic evidence exists concerning the importance of these attributes for the domestication of animals. Moreover, rather than considering domestication as a dichotomous event (non-domesticated vs. domesticated), humans and their potential domesticates encountered numerous socioecological challenges/obstacles during the domestication process before reaching the stage of full domestication. The present study explored the influence of adult body mass, gregariousness, dietary breadth, and reaction to humans on the domestication process of ungulates. The phylogenetic comparative model revealed that capture myopathy (CM), as a proxy for reaction to humans, negatively and significantly influenced the domestication process. The present paper also explored the evolution of CM in equine species in response to the presence of large carnivoran predators during the Pleistocene. Ecologies that preserved most of the large carnivoran predators of equine species also featured more equine taxa with CM (e.g., zebras), which were thus less suitable for domestication.

AB  - Depression and its increasing prevalence challenge patients, the healthcare system, and the economy. We recently created a mouse model based on the three-hit concept of depression. As genetic predisposition (first hit), we applied pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide heterozygous mice on CD1 background. Maternal deprivation modeled the epigenetic factor (second hit), and the chronic variable mild stress was the environmental factor (third hit). Fluoxetine treatment was applied to test the predictive validity of our model. We aimed to examine the dynamics of the epigenetic marker acetyl-lysine 9 H3 histone (H3K9ac) and the neuronal activity marker FOSB in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Fluoxetine decreased H3K9ac in PFC in non-deprived animals, but a history of maternal deprivation abolished the effect of stress and SSRI treatment on H3K9ac immunoreactivity. In the hippocampus, stress decreased, while SSRI increased H3K9ac immunosignal, unlike in the deprived mice, where the opposite effect was detected. FOSB in stress was stimulated by fluoxetine in the PFC, while it was inhibited in the hippocampus. The FOSB immunoreactivity was almost completely abolished in the hippocampus of the deprived mice. This study showed that FOSB and H3K9ac were modulated in a territory-specific manner by early life adversities and later life stress interacting with the effect of fluoxetine therapy supporting the reliability of our model.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia. Despite research efforts, currently there are no effective pharmacotherapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of AD. Recently, numerous studies highlighted the beneficial effects of curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol, in the neuroprotection. Especially, its dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties attracted the interest of researchers. In fact, besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, this biomolecule is not degraded in the intestinal tract. Additionally, CUR is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore to be used to treat neurodegenerative pathologies associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. The present study aimed to assess the ability of CUR to induce neuronal protective and/or recovery effects on a rat model of neurotoxicity induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl3), which mimics the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease. Our results showed that treatment with CUR enhances pro-oxidant levels, antioxidant enzymes activities and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and decreases apoptotic cells in AlCl3-exposed hippocampus rats. Additionally, histopathological analysis of hippocampus revealed the potential of CUR in decreasing the hallmarks in the AlCl3-induced AD. We also showed that CUR post-treatment significantly improved the behavioral, oxidative stress and inflammation in AlCl3-exposed rats. Taken together, our data presented CUR as a nutraceutical potential through its protective effects that are more interesting than recovery ones in sporadic model of AD.

AB  - Simple Summary Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) have unique physiological and behavioral characteristics that make them a species of interest in biomedical research. However, due to their small size, frequent blood sampling to monitor the animals is not possible. Thus, we aimed to validate enzyme immunoassays, tools which detect the quantity of hormone molecules, for monitoring stress-related hormones, glucocorticoids, and/or their metabolites, in naked mole-rats using urine and feces. We administered a high and low dose of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which causes the animal to physiologically respond to stress, and a saline administration as a control, which should not elicit a physiological stress response. The results revealed two enzyme immunoassays, namely, a 5 alpha-pregnane-3 beta,11 beta,21-triol-20-one detecting glucocorticoid metabolites with a 5 alpha-3 beta-11 beta-diol structure and an 11-oxoaetiocholanolone detecting glucocorticoid metabolites with a 5 beta-3 alpha-ol-11-one structure, for measuring stress-related hormones in male and female urine, respectively. Furthermore, one enzyme immunoassay, namely, 11-oxoaetiocholanolone detecting 11,17 dioxoandrostanes for measuring stress-related hormones in feces of both sexes. There were sex-related differences in how the animals responded to the high and low doses of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone. We recommend using feces to monitor stress-related hormones in naked mole-rats, which will be valuable when investigating housing conditions and other animal welfare aspects. Small size in mammals usually restricts long-term, frequent monitoring of endocrine function using plasma as a matrix. Thus, the non-invasive monitoring of hormone metabolite concentrations in excreta may provide an invaluable approach. The aim of the current study was to examine the suitability of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring responses to stressors in the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber, NMR) using urine and feces as hormone matrices. A saline control administration, and a high- and low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge were performed on six male and six female disperser morph NMRs. The results revealed that a 5 alpha-pregnane-3 beta,11 beta,21-triol-20-one EIA detecting glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) with a 5 alpha-3 beta-11 beta-diol structure is the most suitable assay for measuring concentrations in male urine samples, whereas an 11-oxoaetiocholanolone EIA detecting GCMs with a 5 beta-3 alpha-ol-11-one structure appears the most suitable EIA for quantifying GCMs in female urine. An 11-oxoaetiocholanolone EIA detecting 11,17 dioxoandrostanes was the most suitable EIA for quantifying GCMs in the feces of both sexes. There were sex-related differences in response to the high- and low-dose ACTH challenge. We recommend using feces as a more suitable matrix for non-invasive GCM monitoring for NMRs which can be valuable when investigating housing conditions and other welfare aspects.

AB  - Neural-derived 17 beta-estradiol (E2) plays an important role in the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but the mechanism is not well defined. This study was designed to explore the effect and mechanism of neural-derived E2 on synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Primary cultured hippocampal and prefrontal cells in mice were randomly divided into the DMSO (D), aromatase (Ratelimiting enzymes for E2 synthesizes) inhibitor letrozole (L), and ERs antagonist (MPG) treated groups. After intervention for 48 h, the cell was collected, and then, the expressions of AMPA-receptor subunit GluR1 (GluR1), synaptophysin (SYN), p-21-Activated kinase (PAK) phosphorylation, Rho kinase (ROCK), p-Cofilin, F-actin, and G-actin proteins were detected. Letrozole or ER antagonists inhibited the expression of GluR1, F-actin/G-actin, pPAK and p-Cofilin proteins in prefrontal cells significantly. And the expressions of GluR1 and F-actin/G-actin proteins were declined in hippocampal cells markedly after adding letrozole or ERs antagonists. In conclusion, neural-derived E2 and ERs regulated the synaptic plasticity, possibly due to promoting actin polymerization in prefrontal and hippocampal cells. The regional specificity in the effect of neural-derived E2 and ERs on the actin polymerization-related pathway may provide a theoretical basis for the functional differences between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Simple Summary A distributed brain network supports the goal-directed spatial learning of animals, in which the formation of the route from the current location to the goal is one of the central problems. To enhance our understanding of how the avian hippocampus (Hp) and nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) cooperate during route formation, we examined neural activity in the Hp-NCL network of pigeons and explored their connectivity dynamics in a goal-directed spatial task. We found that pigeons' behavioral changes during route formation are accompanied by modifications of their neural patterns in the Hp-NCL network. The depressed spectral power in Hp and NCL, together with the different dynamics of the functional connectivity in both regions, as well as, most importantly, the enhanced Hp-NCL theta functional connectivity, provide insight into the potential mechanism of avian spatial learning. Goal-directed spatial learning is crucial for the survival of animals, in which the formation of the route from the current location to the goal is one of the central problems. A distributed brain network comprising the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex has been shown to support such capacity, yet it is not fully understood how the most similar brain regions in birds, the hippocampus (Hp) and nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), cooperate during route formation in goal-directed spatial learning. Hence, we examined neural activity in the Hp-NCL network of pigeons and explored the connectivity dynamics during route formation in a goal-directed spatial task. We found that behavioral changes in spatial learning during route formation are accompanied by modifications in neural patterns in the Hp-NCL network. Specifically, as pigeons learned to solve the task, the spectral power in both regions gradually decreased. Meanwhile, elevated hippocampal theta (5 to 12 Hz) connectivity and depressed connectivity in NCL were also observed. Lastly, the interregional functional connectivity was found to increase with learning, specifically in the theta frequency band during route formation. These results provide insight into the dynamics of the Hp-NCL network during spatial learning, serving to reveal the potential mechanism of avian spatial navigation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mahuang-Lianqiao-Chixiaodou decoction (MLCD) is a traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) formula recorded in the Treatise on Febrile Diseases. It is commonly used for clinical treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the potential mechanisms of MLCD intervention in AD combined with mental disorders behaviors such as anxiety and depression remain elusive and deserves further investigation.Aim of the study: The study aims to observe the effect of MLCD on anxiety-and depression-like behaviors in AD mice and explore the possible neuroinflammatory mechanism of NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.Materials and methods: The chemical components of MLCD extracts were identified using UHPLC-MS. The AD mice were induced by 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and treated with MLCD or mometasone furoate (MF, as a positive control) for 7 days. The pathological changes in their skin tissue and brain hippocampus were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Elevated plus-maze test (EPM), open field test (OFT), and the suspended tail (TST) were used to measure the anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors in AD mice. Expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in brain hippocampus were measured by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (WB).Results: We found that MLCD contain many active ingredients, including ephedrine, Forsythoside A, phillyrin, glycyrrhizic acid, etc. Both MLCD and MF alleviated skin lesions and promoted positive histopathological changes in the hippocampus of AD mince to varying degrees. MLCD however, could further increase their proportion of open arm entry times (Oentries%) in EPM, residence time in the central area (Ctime) and the proportion of the number of times in the central area (Centries%) in OFT significantly. MLCD also reduces their immobility time in TST considerably. Mechanistically, MLCD downregulated the relative mRNA expression and protein level of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in hippocampal tissue compared to the model group.Conclusions: MLCD can alleviate anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in AD mice by intervening in the gene and protein expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related factors, thus treating AD.

AB  - Simple Summary When tusk fractures occur in elephants under managed care, they can expose the soft tissues and substantial blood supply of the tusk's pulp. The management strategies and clinical consequences of those fractures vary immensely in both the literature and the collective experiences of elephant managers and clinicians. Outcomes have ranged from self-healing with conservative management to life-threatening systemic infection. A detailed survey requesting tusk fracture characteristics and subsequent management and outcomes was completed by elephant veterinarians globally. A larger pulp canal diameter at the time of fracture and the use of tap water in the course of treatment were associated with an increased risk of the development of an infected and inflamed pulp, meriting further investigation. Endodontic treatment of fractured tusks with pulp exposure was associated with a reduced risk of tusk extraction. These guidelines can aid elephant managers and clinicians in their clinical decision making surrounding these challenging events. Elephant tusk fractures are a clinical challenge that can impact the overall health of the animal, particularly when they result in pulp exposure. An international survey was sent to veterinarians to understand individual fracture characteristics and management strategies as they relate to outcomes, with the goal of better informing treatment procedures. The data set consisted of 79 fractures from 64 elephants (including Asian and African males and females), 44.3% of which were Class III fractures with pulpal involvement. Of this subset, pulp canal exposures of >0.5 cm were 23.8-fold more likely to develop pulpitis than fractures with <0.5 cm exposed, though canal size did not impact healing versus extraction outcome. Odds ratios showed that treatments including endodontics were 12.0-fold more likely to heal than tusks treated exclusively with medical management, though no association was observed in reducing the risk of pulpitis. Further, pulpitis was 7.58-fold more likely to develop when tap water was used to rinse exposed pulpal tissue; a finding that merits further investigation. The use of endodontic treatment versus medical management alone was significantly associated with improved recovery outcomes (i.e., reduced risk of extraction) in tusk fractures with pulpal involvement.

AB  - Neurogenesis plays a crucial role in cognitive processes. During aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), altered neurogenesis and neuroinflammation are evident both in C57BL/6J, APP(Swe)/PS1(dE9) (Tg) mice and humans. AD pathology may slow down upon drug treatment, for example, in a previous study of our group P33, a putative neuroprotective agent was found to exert advantageous effects on the elevated levels of APP, A beta, and neuroinflammation. In the present study, we aimed to examine longitudinal alterations in neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and AD pathology in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model, and assessed the putative beneficial effects of long-term P33 treatment on AD-specific neurological alterations. Hippocampal cell proliferation and differentiation were significantly reduced between 8 and 12 months of age. Regarding neuroinflammation, significantly elevated astrogliosis and microglial activation were observed in 6- to 7-month-old Tg animals. The amounts of the molecules involved in the amyloidogenic pathway were altered from 4 months of age in Tg animals. P33-treatment led to significantly increased neurogenesis in 9-month-old animals. Our data support the hypothesis that altered neurogenesis may be a consequence of AD pathology. Based on our findings in the transgenic animal model, early pharmacological treatment before the manifestation of AD symptoms might ameliorate neurological decline.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, affects globally more than 30 million people suffering from cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Substantial evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and/or progression of AD has been shown in addition to the pathological hallmarks amyloid beta (A beta) and tau. Still, the selective vulnerability and associated selective mitochondrial dysfunction cannot even be resolved to date. We aimed at optically quantifying mitochondrial function on a single-cell level in primary hippocampal neuron models of AD, unraveling differential involvement of cell and mitochondrial populations in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. NADH lifetime imaging is a highly sensitive marker-free method with high spatial resolution. However, deciphering cellular bioenergetics of complex cells like primary neurons has still not succeeded yet. To achieve this, we combined highly sensitive NADH lifetime imaging with respiratory inhibitor treatment, allowing characterization of mitochondrial function down to even the subcellular level in primary neurons. Measuring NADH lifetime of the same neuron before and after respiratory treatment reveals the metabolic delta, which can be taken as a surrogate for cellular redox capacity. Correlating NADH lifetime delta with overexpression strength of A beta-related proteins on the single-cell level, we could verify the important role of intracellular A beta-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. Subcellularly, we could demonstrate a higher respiration in neuronal somata in general than dendrites, but a similar impairment of somatic and dendritic mitochondria in our AD models. This illustrates the power of NADH lifetime imaging in revealing mitochondrial function on a single and even subcellular level and its potential to shed light into bioenergetic alterations in neuropsychiatric diseases and beyond.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is associated with inflammation and tissue remodeling including myofibroblasts differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition mediated by TGF-beta 1 and IL-4. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine involved in fibrotic processes in other cellular subtypes. We investigated the mechanisms of action of OSM in the fibrosis process associated with CRSwNP. The expression of IL-4, OSM and TGF-beta 1 was assessed by RT-qPCR. Primary human cultures of nasal-polyp-derived fibroblasts were established and stimulated by TGF-beta 1 and/or IL-4 and/or OSM. The expression of ECM components and alpha SMA was determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. TGF-beta 1-Smad3 signaling was investigated by immunofluorescence. TGF-beta 1, IL-4 and OSM as well as alpha SMA were overexpressed in nasal polyps when compared to noninflammatory nasal mucosa. In TGF-beta 1-stimulated nasal-polyp-derived fibroblasts, ECM genes and alpha SMA gene and protein were overexpressed, as well as alpha SMA in IL-4-stimulated fibroblasts. OSM counteracted the profibrotic effect of TGF-beta 1 on ECM components and alpha SMA. TGF-beta 1-induced nuclear translocation of Smad3 was completely reversed by OSM. OSM counteracts the profibrotic effect of IL-4 and also TGF-beta 1, by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Smad3. We suggest OSM could be an efficient tool to protect against fibrosis in CRSwNP.

AB  - MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and scopolamine, a cholinergic receptor blocker, are widely used as tool compounds to induce learning and memory deficits in animal models to study schizophrenia or Alzheimer-type dementia (AD), respectively. Memory impairments are observed after either acute or chronic administration of either compound. The present experiments were performed to study the nitric oxide (NO)-related mechanisms underlying memory dysfunction induced by acute or chronic (14 days) administration of MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). The levels of L-arginine and its derivatives, L-citrulline, L-glutamate, L-glutamine and L-ornithine, were measured. The expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthases (cNOS), dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH1) and protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PMRTs) 1 and 5 was evaluated, and the impact of the studied tool compounds on cGMP production and NMDA receptors was measured. The studies were performed in both the cortex and hippocampus of mice. S-nitrosylation of selected proteins, such as GLT-1, APP and tau, was also investigated. Our results indicate that the availability of L-arginine decreased after chronic administration of MK-801 or scopolamine, as both the amino acid itself as well as its level in proportion to its derivatives (SDMA and NMMA) were decreased. Additionally, among all three methylamines, SDMA was the most abundant in the brain (~70%). Administration of either compound impaired eNOS-derived NO production, increasing the monomer levels, and had no significant impact on nNOS. Both compounds elevated DDAH1 expression, and slight decreases in PMRT1 and PMRT5 in the cortex after scopolamine (acute) and MK-801 (chronic) administration were observed in the PFC, respectively. Administration of MK-801 induced a decrease in the cGMP level in the hippocampus, accompanied by decreased NMDA expression, while increased cGMP production and decreased NMDA receptor expression were observed after scopolamine administration. Chronic MK-801 and scopolamine administration affected S-nitrosylation of GLT-1 transport protein. Our results indicate that the analyzed tool compounds used in pharmacological models of schizophrenia or AD induce changes in NO-related pathways in the brain structures involved in cognition. To some extent, the changes resemble those observed in human samples.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, but there is still no available treatment. Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent. Using THC in conventional high doses may have deleterious effects. Therefore, we propose to use an ultra-low dose of THC (ULD-THC). We previously published that a single injection of ULD-THC ameliorated cognitive functioning in several models of brain injuries as well as in naturally aging mice. Here, 5xFAD AD model mice received a single treatment of ULD-THC (0.002 mg/kg) after disease onset and were examined in two separate experiments for cognitive functions, neurotropic, and inflammatory factors in the hippocampus. We show that a single injection of ULD-THC alleviated cognitive impairments in 6- and 12-month-old 5xFAD mice. On the biochemical level, our results indicate an imbalance between the truncated TrkB receptor isoform and the full receptor, with AD mice showing a greater tendency to express the truncated receptor, and ULD-THC improved this imbalance. We also investigated the expression of three AD-related inflammatory markers and found an ameliorating effect of ULD-THC. The current research demonstrates for the first time the beneficial effects of a single ultra-low dose of THC in a mouse model of AD after disease onset.

AB  - Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger transcription factor which has various mechanisms in different tumors. Ursolic acid (UA), a natural compound that exists in many herbs, is known to prevent tumor progression and has anticancer effects on many human cancers. The present study was to evaluate the antitumor effect of UA on gastric cancer (GC) through KLF4 and the Hippo pathway. Our data showed that UA inhibited the growth of GC in vivo and in vitro. UA treatment significantly increased the expression of KLF4 and decreased the expression of CTGF. The overexpression of KLF4 inhibited the proliferation and cell cycle of GC and decreased the expression of CTGF, whereas the knockdown of KLF4 attenuated the effects of UA. Furthermore, the inhibition of CTGF arrested tumor cells in G2/M which blocked proliferation progress. Confocal laser scanning and molecular simulation software MOE showed that KLF4 combined with YAP1 which may block the formation of the TEADs-YAP1 complex to interrupt the expression of CTGF and the downstream oncogenic process. In conclusion, UA can inhibit GC growth both in vivo and in vitro, and it activated KLF4 which may competitively bind with YAP1 against TEADs and block the oncogenic Hippo pathways.

AB  - Purpose To clarify the preventive and therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on brain injury induced by X-ray cranial irradiation, preliminarily identify the mechanism and provide a novel clinical approach for the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced brain injury (RBI). Materials and methods Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the sham group, large fractionated dose (5 Gy x 4 d) group, large fractionated dose + rTMS (5 Gy x 4 d + rTMS) group, conventional fractionated dose (2 Gy x 10 d) group and conventional fractionated dose + rTMS (2 Gy x 10 d + rTMS) group. After cranial irradiation and rTMS, behavioral experiments, morphological staining and molecular biology experiments were performed. We further determined the mechanism of rTMS on the prevention and treatment of RBI, including changes in hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation, and neuronal synaptic plasticity. Results rTMS alleviated the negative effects of cranial radiation on the general health of mice and promoted their recovery. rTMS ameliorated the impairment of spatial learning and memory induced by cranial radiation, and this beneficial effect was more robust in the conventional fractionated dose group than the large fractionated dose group. Moreover, rTMS alleviated the alterations in hippocampal structure and neuronal death and had preventive and therapeutic effects against RBI. In addition, rTMS reduced hippocampal cell apoptosis, promoted NSC proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus after cranial irradiation, and enhanced neuronal synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Subsequent studies showed that rTMS upregulated the expression of learning- and memory-related proteins. Conclusion rTMS could alleviate learning and memory impairment caused by RBI, and the preventive and therapeutic effects of rTMS were better for the conventional fraction radiation paradigms.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common, chronic disorder with spontaneous seizures that is often refractory to drug therapy. A potential cause of temporal lobe epilepsy is primary brain injury, making prevention of epileptogenesis after the initial event an optimal method of treatment. Despite this, no preventive therapy for epilepsy is currently available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of anakinra, lamotrigine, and their combination on epileptogenesis using the rat lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The study showed that there was no significant difference in the number and duration of seizures between treated and untreated animals. However, the severity of seizures was significantly reduced after treatment. Anakinra and lamotrigine, alone or in combination, significantly reduced neuronal loss in the CA1 hippocampus compared to the control group. However, the drugs administered alone were found to be more effective in preventing neuron loss in the hippocampal CA3 field compared to combination treatment. The treatment alleviated the impairments in activity level, exploratory behavior, and anxiety but had a relatively weak effect on TLE-induced impairments in social behavior and memory. The efficacy of the combination treatment did not differ from that of anakinra and lamotrigine monotherapy. These findings suggest that anakinra and lamotrigine, either alone or in combination, may be clinically useful in preventing the development of histopathological and behavioral abnormalities associated with epilepsy.

AB  - Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine binding to CXC motif receptors 1/2 (CXCR1/2). Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) exhibit increased serum CXCL8 levels. CXC motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), a murine ortholog of CXCL8, has been implicated in seizure generation and neuronal loss. This study evaluated the antiepileptogenic and antiseizure effects of reparixin in amygdaloid kindling rat model of TLE. Reparixin was administered during the kindling period for 14 days, and seizures were induced twice daily via electrical stimulation. To assess the antiseizure effects, reparixin was administered to fully kindled animals, and stimulations were performed 24 and 48 h later. Levetiracetam, a broad-spectrum antiseizure drug, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) as positive control 1 h before each stimulation. Reparixin delayed secondary seizure generalization during kindling. Reparixin reduced seizure severity and after-discharge duration in fully kindled animals at 24 h from treatment initiation. CXCR1/2 and protein kinase B pathway proteins exhibited no significant changes; reparixin reduced the phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)/ERK ratio in the cortex and hippocampus. CXCL1 expression was significantly decreased in the cortex. Reparixin exhibited antiepileptogenic and partial antiseizure effects by modulating the CXCL1-CXCR1/2 axis and reducing ERK signaling. Already in clinical trials on respiratory diseases, reparixin could be repurposed for epilepsy therapy.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known as carriers of anticancer activities for effectual target treatment of cancer cells. Plant-mediated synthesis for AgNPs synthesis is valuable for biomedical applications due to their more safety and cost-effectiveness. In this work, AgNPs were synthesized successfully using green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract (CSE-AgNPs). The physicochemical properties of CSE-AgNPs were identified by UV-visible spectrophotometry, FT-IR, PXRD, DLS and TEM. The results indicated the successful synthesis of well-dispersed CSE-AgNPs with spherical shape and size (8-68 nm). The cytotoxic effects of CSE-AgNPs on hominid testicular embryonic cancer stem cells (NTERA-2) and normal cells (ACTH2 cell line) were done by the MTT assay and acridine orange/propidium iodide staining. CSE-AgNPs exhibited toxic effects in a dose-dependent manner as their half inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 6 mu g/mL and 28 mu g/mL against the cancerous and normal cells after 24 h, respectively. The investigation of Bcl2, Bax, caspase 3 and 9, p53 and HSPA2 genes' expression indicated CSE-AgNPs as an apoptosis-inducing complex. The findings document the usability of the biosynthesized CSE-AgNPs for triggering cell death in cancerous cells in vitro and provide a strong rationale for conducting in vivo studies.

AB  - Background: There is no doubt that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the greatest threats facing mankind today. Within the next few decades, Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) will be the most widely used treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The withdrawal of the first generation AChEIs drug Tacrine (TAC)/ Cognex from the market as a result of hepatotoxicity has always been an interesting case study. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural compound of phenolic acids that has pharmacological activity for inhibiting Alzheimer's disease, as well as liver protection.
   Purpose and study design: In this study, we determined that RA can reduce the hepatotoxicity of TAC, and both of them act synergistically to inhibit the progression of AD in mice.
   Methods: In addition to the wild type mice (WT) group, the 6-month-old APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) double-transgenic (Tg) mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: Tg group, TAC group, RA group, TAC+Silymarin (SIL) group, TAC+RA-L (Rosmarinic Acid Low Dose) goup and TAC+RA-H (Rosmarinic Acid High Dose) group. A series of experiments were carried out, including open field test, Morris water maze test, Hematoxylin - Eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, western blotting analysis and so on.
   Results: RA combined with TAC could enter the brain tissue of AD mice, and the combination of drugs could better improve the cognitive behavior and brain pathological damage of AD mice, reduce the expression of A beta oligomer, inhibit the deposition of A beta, inhibit the activity of AChE and enhance the level of Ach in hippocampus. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that RA could alleviate the hepatotoxicity or liver injury induced by TAC. The Western blot analysis of the liver of AD mice showed that RA combined with TAC might inhibit the apoptosis of Bcl-2/Bax, reduce the programmed apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 and reduce the burden of liver induced by TAC, could inhibit the development of liver apoptosis by alleviating the hepatotoxicity of TAC and inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK.
   Conclusion: The potential drug combination that combines rosmarinic acid with tacrine could reduce tacrine's hepatotoxicity as well as enhance its therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Gamma-oryzanol (ORY), found in rice (Oryza sativa L.), is a mixture of ferulic acid esters with triterpene alcohols, well-known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our past research demonstrated its positive impact on cognitive function in adult mice, influencing synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. In this study, we explored whether ORY can exert neuro-differentiating effects by using different experimental models. For this purpose, chemical characterization identified four components that are most abundant in ORY. In human neuroblastoma cells, we showed ORY's ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth, upregulating the expression of GAP43, BDNF, and TrkB genes. In addition, ORY was found to guide adult mouse hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) toward a neuronal commitment. Microinjection of ORY in zebrafish Tg (-3.1 neurog1:GFP) amplified neurog1-GFP signal, islet1, and bdnf mRNA levels. Zebrafish nrf2a and nrf2b morphants (MOs) were utilized to assess ORY effects in the presence or absence of Nrf2. Notably, ORY's ability to activate bdnf was nullified in nrf2a-MO and nrf2b-MO. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested ORY's single components have different affinities for the Keap1-Kelch domain. In conclusion, although more in-depth studies are needed, our findings position ORY as a potential source of bioactive molecules with neuro-differentiating potential involving the Nrf2 pathway.

AB  - Bladder fibrosis is the final common pathway of neurogenic bladder (NB), and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The current study aims to evaluate the involvement of Piezo1, a mechanosensitive channel, in bladder fibrosis. A full-thickness bladder specimen was taken during ileocystoplasty or ureteral reimplantation from the surgical cut's edge. By chopping off the bilateral lumbar 6 (L6) and sacral 1 (S1) spinal nerves, NB rat models were produced. Utilizing both pharmacological inhibition and Piezo1 deletion, the function of Piezo1 in the TGF-(31-induced fibrosis model of SV-HUC-1 cells was delineated. RNA-seq, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blotting were used to evaluate the degrees of fibrosis and biochemical signaling pathways. Piezo1 protein expression was noticeably elevated in the human NB bladder. The abundance of Piezo1 protein in bladder of NB rats was significantly increased. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the ECMreceptor interaction signaling pathway and collagen-containing ECM were increased in spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced bladder fibrosis. Moreover, the bladder of the NB rat model showed activation of YAP1 and TGF(31/Smad. In SV-HUC-1 cells, siRNA suppression of Piezo1 led to profibrotic responses and activation of the TGF(31/Smad pathway. However, Yoda1, a Piezo1-specific agonist, significantly reduced these effects. TGF-(31 increased Piezo1 activation and profibrotic responses in SV-HUC-1 cells. In the TGF-(31-induced fibrosis model of SV-HUC-1 cells, the TGF-(31/Smad pathway was activated, whereas the Hippo/YAP1 signal pathway was blocked. Inhibition of Piezo1 further prevented this process. Piezo1 is involved in the progression of NB bladder fibrosis and profibrotic alterations in SV-HUC-1 cells, likely through regulating the TGF-(31/Smad and Hippo/ YAP1 pathways.

AB  - A serious pathological condition known as pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury can develop after procedures like cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary embolism, or lung transplantation. This process has a negative impact on distant organs, including the brain, and is linked to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and systemic inflammation. The purpose of this study was to assess the preventive effects of dexpanthenol (DEX) against pulmonary I/R injury-induced brain tissue damage in rats. Thirty-two male Wistar Albino rats were divided into four groups: control, IR (60 min of reperfusion and ischemia), IR + DEX (500 mg/kg), and DEX. After 60 min of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed and brain, cerebellum and hippocampus tissues were taken. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on brain, cerebellum and hippocampus tissues. Genetic and biochemical analyses were performed on brain tissue to evaluate oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. In addition to increased expressions of Caspase-3 (CASP3), inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), pulmonary I/R injury markedly increased hyperemia, edema, neuronal damage, and gliosis. Biochemical studies showed lower total antioxidant status (TAS) levels and higher oxidative stress index (OSI) and total oxidant status (TOS) values. According to a genetic research, anti-apoptotic genes were downregulated whereas pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated. DEX treatment reduced histopathological damage by 60% (p <= 0.001) and decreased TNF-alpha expression by 45% in brain tissue compared to the IR group. Oxidative stress markers (TOS, OSI) were lowered by 35-50%, while anti-apoptotic BCL2 expression increased 2.1-fold (p <= 0.01). By lowering inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, DEX showed strong neuroprotective benefits on brain and cerebellar damage resulting from pulmonary I/R injury. According to these results, DEX might be a useful medication for treating brain damage brought on by systemic inflammation.

AB  - Background: Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized primarily by the decline of learning and memory abilities. The physiological and pathological mechanisms of CD are very complex, which is mainly related to normal function of the hippocampus. Lancao decoction (LC) is a Chinese medicine formula, which has been used to treat neurodegenerative disorders. However, the potential of LC for the treatment of CD, as well as its underlying mechanisms, is unclear. Purpose: In the study, we aimed to reveal the functional and neuronal mechanisms of LC's treatments for CD in scopolamine-induced mice. Methods: Gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the stability of LC's extraction. CD model was established by the chronic induction of scopolamine (Scop, 1 mg/kg/day) for 1 week. Behavioral tests including morris water maze (MWM) and y-maze were used to evaluate learning and memory abilities of mice after LC's treatments. Immunofluorescence was used to detected the expressions of cFOS, Brdu and Ki67 after LC's treatments. Pharmacological blockade experiments explored the role of alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) in LC's treatments for CD and its relationships with regeneration, activities and differentiation of neurons. Results: The results showed that LC was capable of improving spatial learning and memory and spontaneous alternating abilities in Scop-induced mice, which was similar to donepezil. LC could increase the number of cFOS positive cells, which was used as a marker of neuronal activity to upregulate by neuronal activities in hippocampus, but donepezil did not. Moreover, LC could strengthen neurogenesis and neuro-differentiation by increasing the number of Brdu and Ki67 positive cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), meanwhile, donepezil could only enhance the number of Ki67 positive cells. Transient inhibition of AMPAR by NBQX blunted the function of LC's treatment for CD and inhibited the enhanced effect of LC on Scop-induced hippocampal neuronal excitability and neurogenesis in mice. Conclusion: To sum up, our study demonstrated that LC had the function of treating CD by enhancing content of acetylcholine (ACh) to activate AMPAR, which further up-regulated neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation to strengthen neuroactivities in hippocampus.

AB  - Complex disease phenotypes often span multiple molecular processes. Functional characterization of these processes can shed light on disease mechanisms and drug effects. Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) is a mass-spectrometry (MS) based technique assessing changes in thermal protein stability that can serve as proxies of functional protein changes. These unique insights of TPP can complement those obtained by other omics technologies. Here, we show how TPP can be integrated with phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics in a network-based approach using COSMOS, a multi-omics integration framework, to provide an integrated view of transcription factors, kinases and proteins with altered thermal stability. This allowed us to recover consequences of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in ovarian cancer cells on cell cycle and DNA damage response as well as interferon and hippo signaling. We found that TPP offers a complementary perspective to other omics data modalities, and that its integration allowed us to obtain a more complete molecular overview of PARP inhibition. We anticipate that this strategy can be used to integrate functional proteomics with other omics to study molecular processes.

It is used to generate multi-omics mechanistic hypotheses, as showcased in this study for PARP inhibition.Functional proteomics (TPP data) can be integrated with phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics in network models.

AB  - This work aimed to elucidate how O-3 pollution causes a loss of regulation in the immune response in both the brain and the intestine. In this work, we studied the effect of exposing rats to low doses of O-3 based on the association between the antioxidant response of superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and the nuclear factor kappa light chains of activated B cells (NF kappa B) as markers of inflammation. Method: Seventy-two Wistar rats were used, divided into six groups that received the following treatments: Control and 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of O-3. After treatment, tissues were extracted and processed using Western blotting, biochemical, and immunohistochemical techniques. The results indicated an increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and Cu/Zn-SOD and a decrease in Mn-SOD, and SOD activity in the substantia nigra, jejunum, and colon decreased. Furthermore, the translocation of NF kappa B to the nucleus increased in the different organs studied. In conclusion, repeated exposure to O-3 alters the regulation of the antioxidant and inflammatory response in the substantia nigra and the intestine. This indicates that these factors are critical in the loss of regulation in the inflammatory response; they respond to ozone pollution, which can occur in chronic degenerative diseases.

AB  - The essential trace element selenium plays an important role in maintaining brain function. Selenoprotein W (SELENOW), the smallest selenoprotein that has been identified in mammals, is sensitive to selenium levels and abundantly expressed in the brain. However, its biological role in the brain remains to be clarified. Here, we studied the morphological and functional changes in the brain caused by SELENOW deficiency using its gene knockout (KO) mouse models. Histomorphological alterations of the amygdala and hippocampus, specifically in the female SELENOW KO mice, were observed, ultimately resulting in less anxiety-like behavior and impaired contextual fear memory. Fear conditioning (FC) provokes rapidly intricate responses involving neuroplasticity and oligodendrogenesis. During this process, the females generally show stronger contextual FC than males. To characterize the effect of SELENOW deletion on FC, specifically in the female mice, a Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based comparative proteomic approach was applied. Notably, compared to the wildtype (WT) no shock (NS) mice, the female SELENOW KO NS mice shared lots of common differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with the WT FC mice in the hippocampus, enriched in the biological process of ensheathment and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Immunostaining and Western blotting analyses further confirmed the proteomic results. Our work may provide a holistic perspective of gender-specific SELENOW function in the brain and highlighted its role in oligodendrogenesis during fear memory.

AB  - Mammals may experience physical changes from birth, and their diet varies at different stages of life. This study investigates the impact of development on the diet composition of three horseshoe bats: Rhinolophus euryale, R. hipposideros, and R. ferrumequinum in the Basque Country, north of the Iberian Peninsula. The diets of juvenile and adult individuals of each species were obtained by analysing their droppings using metabarcoding and then compared at (1) the taxonomic and (2) prey trait levels (size, flying speed, hardness). The diets of juvenile and adult individuals of R. euryale and R. hipposideros showed significant differences at the taxonomic level and regarding prey traits. In contrast, in the case of R. ferrumequinum, we could only observe discernible diet patterns through the trait analysis. Additionally, we discovered a shared pattern: younger individuals tend to feed on easier-to-hunt and/or handle smaller and smoother prey. The varying degrees of dissimilarity between juvenile and adult diets observed in this study suggest that the relative importance of psychomotor development, foraging strategies, prey discrimination, and/or spatial learning may differ among species. These findings contribute to conservation efforts, especially by recognising the dietary needs of juveniles for their survival and successful development.

AB  - The hipposideros larvatus (intermediate roundleaf bat) is one of the insectivorous bats which has an agro-ecological role as a controller of the insect population. The reproductive patterns of H. larvatus are intricately linked to its ecological role and survival. An understanding of the testicular morphology can contribute to conservation for this species particularly in areas where its populations might be declining or under threat. However, these bats may also be associated with zoonotic diseases which can have significant public health implications. The aims of the study were to examine the morphological data as well as the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the male reproductive organs of H. larvatus from different areas of Thailand and at different sampling periods. Their testes were processed for histological investigation and immunohistochemistry for AR and AMH. The results showed differences among the various sampling areas and different sampling periods, which suggested seasonal breeding characteristics. The higher testicular morphometric data were observed in H. larvatus from the Dong Phayayen (DY) and Chiang Dao (CD) areas during June, while the size of seminiferous tubules decreased thereafter. High AR immunostaining was noticed when the testicular morphometric data were higher in DY bats during June. On the other hand, low AR was observed in bats during August and September, which was concomitant with the decreases in seminiferous tubule size and germinal epithelial height. The results suggest a potential correlation between AR immunostaining and the active phase of testicular functions in H. larvatus during June which may imply the involvement of AR with the enhancement of testicular activity. Conversely, the low expression of AR may contribute to the upregulation of AMH in the testes and may indicate lower testicular activity in H. larvatus in Thailand.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiology of diabetic encephalopathy (DE), a significant diabetes-related pathological complication of the central nervous system, is poorly understood. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulated necrotic cell death process that mediates the development of neurodegenerative and diabetes-related lesions. Quercetin (QE) exerts anti-ferroptotic effects in various diseases. However, the roles of ferroptosis in DE and the potential anti-ferroptotic mechanisms of QE are unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate if quercetin can ameliorate DE by inhibiting ferroptosis and to elucidate the potential anti-ferroptotic mechanisms of QE, thus providing a new perspective on the pathogenesis and prevention of DE. Methods: The spontaneously type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizak rats and high glucose (HG)-induced PC12 cells were used as animal and in vitro models, respectively. The Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the cognition of rats. Pathological damage was examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mitochondrial damage was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by examining the levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. Additionally, the contents of iron ions were quantified. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were carried out to poke the protein levels. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to construct a protein-protein interaction network for the therapeutic targets of QE in DE. Additionally, molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay was performed to examine the target of QE. Results: QE alleviated cognitive impairment, decreased lipid peroxidation and iron deposition in the hippocampus, and upregulated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. HG-induced ferroptosis in PC12 cells resulted in decreased cell viability accompanied by lipid peroxidation and iron deposition. QE mitigated HG-induced ferroptosis by upregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which was partially suppressed upon Nrf2 inhibition. Network pharmacology analysis further indicated that the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway is a key target of QE. Molecular docking experiments revealed that QE binds to KEAP1 through four hydrogen bonds. Moreover, QE altered the thermostability of KEAP1. Conclusion: These results indicated that QE inhibits ferroptosis in the hippocampal neurons by binding to KEAP1 and subsequently upregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Defatted walnut powder (DWP), the byproduct remaining after extracting oil from the walnut kernel, has the actions of nourishing liver and the kidney, replenishing blood, and calming the nerves, which is believed to be a brain-nourishing in Chinese medicine. DWP is rich in phenolic substances with demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipid-lowering and neuroprotective effects. Despite these promising properties of DWP, its effectiveness in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, and further research is needed to understand the mechanism of action.Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of DWP on AD by constructing the overall metabolic profile of mice with an anti-scopolamine AD model and verification of the highly correlated pathway.Materials and methods: The neuroprotective efficacy of DWP in a mouse model of AD established by scopolamine injection was examined. Spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), markers of cholinergic function in hippocampus and cortex, and neuropathological changes were compared among control, model, and DWP-consuming model group mice. In addition, combined metabolomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to investigate changes in metabolite and protein expression profiles in AD model mice induced by DWP con-sumption. Differentially expressed proteins and metabolites were then analyzed for KEGG pathway enrichment and results confirmed through targeted amino acid metabolomics.Results: The results showed that consumption of DWP improved spatial learning and memory in the MWM, enhanced cholinergic function, and reduced histopathological damage in the cortex and hippocampus of AD model mice. Based on differentially abundant metabolites and proteins, 43 metabolic pathways modulated by DWP were identified, mainly involving in amino acid metabolic pathways strongly associated with cellular energetics and antioxidant capacity, and targeted amino acid metabolomics confirmed that DWPE significantly elevated the levels of Arginine (Arg), Histidine (His), Proline (Pro), Serine (Ser), and Tyrosine (Tyr), while reducing the levels of Glutamate (Glu). This ultimately resulted in an improvement in the progression of AD.Conclusion: This study identified numerous metabolic networks modulated by DWP that can mitigate scopolamine-induced AD neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. DWP is a promising resource to identify AD-related pathogenic pathways and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Seed is a major storage organ that determines the yield and quality of Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a signaling molecule involved in plant growth and development. However, the role of MeJA in the development of C. oleifera seeds remains a mystery. This study demonstrated that the larger seeds induced by MeJA resulted from more cell numbers and a larger cell area in the outer seed coat and embryo at the cellular level. At the molecular level, MeJA could regulate the expression of factors in the known signaling pathways of seed size control as well as cell proliferation and expansion, resulting in larger seeds. Furthermore, the accumulation of oil and unsaturated fatty acids due to MeJA-inducement was attributed to the increased expression of fatty acid biosynthesis-related genes but reduced expression of fatty acid degradation-related genes. CoMYC2, a key regulator in jasmonate signaling, was considered a potential hub regulator which directly interacted with three hub genes (CoCDKB2-3, CoCYCB2-3, and CoXTH9) related to the seed size and two hub genes (CoACC1 and CoFAD2-3) related to oil accumulation and fatty acid biosynthesis by binding to their promoters. These findings provide an excellent target for the improvement of the yield and quality in C. oleifera.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Toona sinensis fruit polyphenols (TSFP) are polyphenols that have been separated and extracted from mature Toona sinensis fruits. TSFP anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties have demonstrated promise. However, the underlying mechanisms require more elucidation. Study aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms by which TSFP alleviates cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury (CIRI) through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NOD-,LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathways on middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats. Materials and methods: The TSFP neuroprotective effect was evaluated using transmission electron microscope (TEM), 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), neurological function, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence were used to measure the TSFP influence on inflammation. In addition, a Western blot assay was performed to assess the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK pathway proteins expressions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, and double immunofluorescence methods were used to identify gasdermin D (GSDMD) secretion in neurons. Results: The TSFP group in the MCAO/R model had improved levels of cerebral infarction and brain pathological damage. The TEM demonstrated that TSFP ameliorated ischemia-induced neuronal pyroptosis, and there was a significant decrease in the expressions of NLRP3, the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing Caspase recruitment domain (ASC), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-1 (caspase-1), and GSDMD in the TSFP groups. TSFP reduced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and extracellular signal- regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), and reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampus. The results also revealed that TSFP significantly lowered the interleukin-1(3 (IL-1(3) and interleukin-1(3 (IL-18) expressions and attenuated glial cell activation caused by ischemia in the PFC and hippocampus DG areas. Conclusion: This study provided evidence for the efficacy of TSFP in the treatment of CIRI, with potential mechanisms that involved the control of the MAPK signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis, which highlights the potential benefits of TSFP in the treatment of CIRI.

AB  - Fish oil's neuroprotective effects in ethanol-induced liver injury was investigated through the factor 2 (NRF2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) pathway. Male Wistar rats received a control liquid diet (C) or an ethanol diet (E), with 25% or 57% of fat replaced by fish oil (CF25, CF57, EF25, EF57) for 8 weeks. Compared to the C group, the E group exhibited brain damage, including impaired performance of Y maze and novel object recognition test, increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive microglia. In the prefrontal cortex, glutathione (GSH) and phosphorylated (p)-NRF2 decreased, catalase activity increased, and nqo1 mRNA declined; hippocampal NRF2 and nqo1 were also downregulated. However, compared to the E group, the EF25 and EF57 groups exhibited restored spatial and memory functions, reduced GFAP and Iba-1 expressions, potentiated beta-amyloid (A beta) clearance, and escalated catalase activity. Furthermore, increases in p-NRF2 and elevated hippocampal nqo1 mRNA expressions in the prefrontal cortex were observed in the EF25 and EF57 groups. In conclusion, fish oil ameliorated deficits in spatial and memory functions, and enhanced A beta 1-42 clearance in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats with chronic ethanol-induced liver damage by activating the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a particularly malignant primary brain tumor. Despite enormous advances in the surgical treatment of cancer, radio- and chemotherapy, the average survival of patients suffering from this cancer does not usually exceed several months. For obvious ethical reasons, the search and testing of the new drugs and therapies of GBM cannot be carried out on humans, and for this purpose, animal models of the disease are most often used. However, to assess the efficacy and safety of the therapy basing on these models, a deep knowledge of the pathological changes associated with tumor development in the animal brain is necessary. Therefore, as part of our study, the synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy was applied for multi-elemental micro-imaging of the rat brain in which glioblastoma develops. Elemental changes occurring in animals after the implantation of two human glioma cell lines as well as the cells taken directly from a patient suffering from GBM were compared. Both the extent and intensity of elemental changes strongly correlated with the regions of glioma growth. The obtained results showed that the observation of elemental anomalies accompanying tumor development within an animal's brain might facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis and progress of GBM and also determine potential biomarkers of its extension. The tumors appearing in a rat's brain were characterized by an increased accumulation of Fe and Se, whilst the tissue directly surrounding the tumor presented a higher accumulation of Cu. Furthermore, the results of the study allow us to consider Se as a potential elemental marker of GBM progression.

AB  - Compelling evidence has shown that Neuralized1 (Neurl1) facilitates hippocampal-dependent memory storage by modulating cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3)-dependent protein synthesis. In the current study, we investigated the role of Neurl1 in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and the underlying mechanisms. The neuropathic pain was evaluated by lumbar 5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in rats. Immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that SNL led to an increase of Neurl1 in the spinal dorsal horn. Spinal microinjection of AAV-EGFP-Neurl1 shRNA alleviated mechanical allodynia; decreased the level of CPEB3 ubiquitination; inhibited the production of GluA1, GluA2, and PSD95; and reduced GluA1-containing AMPA receptors in the membrane of the dorsal horn following SNL. Knockdown of spinal CPEB3 decreased the production of GluA1, GluA2, and PSD95 in the dorsal horn and attenuated abnormal pain after SNL. Overexpression of Neurl1 in the dorsal horn resulted in pain-related hypersensitivity in naive rats; raised the level of CPEB3 ubiquitination; increased the production of GluA1, GluA2, and PSD95; and augmented GluA1-containing AMPA receptors in the membrane in the dorsal horn. Moreover, spinal Neurl1 overexpression-induced mechanical allodynia in naive rats was partially reversed by repeated intrathecal injections of CPEB3 siRNA. Collectively, our results suggest that SNL-induced upregulation of Neurl1 through CPEB3 ubiquitination-dependent production of GluA1, GluA2, and PSD95 in the dorsal horn contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in rats. Targeting spinal Neurl1 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Recent advancements in the classification of Alzheimer's disease have leveraged the automatic feature generation capability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using neuroimaging biomarkers. However, most of the existing CNN-based methods often disregard the local features of the brain data, which leads to a loss of subtle fine-grained features in the brain imaging data. Moreover, the existing CNN architectures, which mainly rely on global features, do not pay much attention to the discriminability of the extracted features for the task of classification of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the existing architectures often end up using a large number of parameters to enhance the richness of the extracted features. This paper proposes a novel lightweight deep CNN, which extracts local and global contextual features from the sagittal slices of structural MRI data and uses both of these two types of features for the classification of the disease. The main idea used in designing the proposed network is to process separately the local and global features by using modules that pay a special attention to extract local and global contextual features. The fused local and global contextual features are then used for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. The proposed network is tested for the binary and multiclass classifications of the disease using the MR images taken from the ADNI database. The proposed network is shown to provide a performance that is significantly higher than that provided by other existing state-of-the-art networks, yet using a number of parameters that is a small fraction of that used by the other schemes.

AB  - Jin-Xiu Pan et al. report that an osteoblast-specific expression of Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) induces ER stress-driven senescence, leading to systemic inflammation and inflammation in the cortex that drives behavioral changes. The results demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of osteoblastic APPswe to brain axis in AD development.
   Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often have osteoporosis or osteopenia. However, their direct link and relationship remain largely unclear. Previous studies have detected osteoporotic deficits in young adult Tg2576 and TgAPP(swe)(OCN) mice, which express APP(swe) (Swedish mutant) ubiquitously and selectively in osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells. This raises the question, whether osteoblastic APP(swe) contributes to AD development. Here, we provide evidence that TgAPP(swe)(OCN) mice also exhibit AD-relevant brain pathologies and behavior phenotypes. Some brain pathologies include age-dependent and regional-selective increases in glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are accompanied by behavioral phenotypes such as anxiety, depression, and altered learning and memory. Further cellular studies suggest that APP(swe), but not APP(wt) or APP(lon) (London mutant), in OB-lineage cells induces endoplasmic reticulum-stress driven senescence, driving systemic and cortex inflammation as well as behavioral changes in 6-month-old TgAPP(swe)(OCN) mice. These results therefore reveal an unrecognized function of osteoblastic APP(swe) to brain axis in AD development.

AB  - There is an urgent need to identify interventions that broadly target aging-related cognitive decline and progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have histologic changes similar to AD in humans, and they also develop shared age-associated co-morbidities identified as risk factors for AD in humans, including type 2 diabetes, ferroptosis, and iron overload, which can be driven by nutritional C15:0 deficiency. We hypothesized that (1) dolphins would have amyloid beta (A beta) plaques and neuroinflammation that paralleled that of humans in relation to age-related progression, quantitative concentration, and brain region; and (2) C15:0 would have dose-dependent activities relevant to protecting cognitive health. Quantitative immunohistochemistry staining was used to assess 68 tissues from archived brains of 19 Navy dolphins to evaluate associations among amyloid beta (A beta) plaques and neuroinflammation by brain region, sex, and age group. Further, dose-dependent C15:0 activities, using a third-party panel intended to screen for potential AD therapeutics, were evaluated. Similar to humans, dolphins had the highest A beta plaque density variation in the hippocampus (90th percentile of 4.95 plaques/mm2), where plaque density increased with age (p = 0.05). All measured markers of neuroinflammation were detected, including the highest concentrations of activated microglia (CD68+) in the hippocampus (0.46 +/- 0.38 cells/mm2). C15:0 was a dose-dependent inhibitor of two targets, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (IC50 2.5 mu M, 89% maximum inhibition at 50 mu M relative to URB597) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) (IC50 19.4 mu M, 70% maximum inhibition at 50 mu M relative to R(-)-Deprenyl). These activities have demonstrated efficacy against A beta formation and neuroinflammation, including protection of cognitive function in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that, in addition to protecting against AD co-morbidities, C15:0 may play a distinct role in supporting cognitive health, especially at higher concentrations.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy in both adult and children. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) are abnormally expressed in neurological diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression level and clinical significance of miR-148a-3p in TLE children and explore its effect on the biological viability of hippocampal neurons. The expression level of miR-148a-3p in the serum of TLE children was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of miR-148a-3p in TLE. Hippocampal neurons were cultured in magnesium-free medium to construct a TLE cell model. The effects of miR-148a-3p on hippocampal neuronal viability and apoptosis rate were detected by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. miR-148a-3p was overexpressed and correlated with seizure frequency and febrile seizure (FS) history in TLE children. miR-148a-3p was of great value in the diagnosis of TLE, and it can be used to distinguish cases with FS history. Hippocampal neurons treated with magnesium-free medium were used as an in vitro model of TLE and showed significantly increased miR-148a-3p, decreased cell viability, and increased cell apoptosis, while these changes were eliminated markedly by miR-148a-3p knockdown. miR-148a-3p is overexpressed and associated with seizure frequency and FS history and serves as a novel diagnostic biomarker in TLE. In addition, the downregulation of miR-148a-3p exerts neuroprotective role by improving hippocampal neuronal cell viability. miR-148a-3p may provide new ideas for the treatment and diagnosis of TLE.

AB  - COVID survivors frequently experience lingering neurological symptoms that resemble cancer-therapy -related cognitive impairment, a syndrome for which white matter microglial reactivity and consequent neural dysregulation is central. Here, we explored the neurobiological effects of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and found white-matter-selective microglial reactivity in mice and humans. Following mild respiratory COVID in mice, persistently impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, decreased oligodendrocytes, and myelin loss were evident together with elevated CSF cytokines/chemokines including CCL11. Systemic CCL11 adminis-tration specifically caused hippocampal microglial reactivity and impaired neurogenesis. Concordantly, humans with lasting cognitive symptoms post-COVID exhibit elevated CCL11 levels. Compared with SARS-CoV-2, mild respiratory influenza in mice caused similar patterns of white-matter-selective microglial reactivity, oligodendrocyte loss, impaired neurogenesis, and elevated CCL11 at early time points, but after influenza, only elevated CCL11 and hippocampal pathology persisted. These findings illustrate similar neuro-pathophysiology after cancer therapy and respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection which may contribute to cogni-tive impairment following even mild COVID.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate whether exposure to Sunset Yellow FCF (SY) since post-weaning can lead to hippocampal structural changes and memory impairment in adult rat and whether the Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) can protect against these adverse effects.MethodsThe weanling rats were randomly divided into six groups and were treated daily by oral gavage for 6 weeks, as follows: (I) control group, administered distilled water (0.3 mL/100 g/day); (II) CoQ10 group, received 10 mg/kg/day CoQ10; (III) low SY group, received 2.5 mg/kg/day SY; (IV) high SY group, received 70 mg/kg/day SY; (V) low SY + CoQ10 group; and (VI) high SY + CoQ10 group. At the end of the sixth week, the novel object recognition (NOR) test was conducted to evaluate memory. Then, after sacrificing animals, the cerebral hemispheres were removed for stereological study and evaluation of MDA levels.ResultsThe low and high doses of SY led to significant neuronal loss and a decrease in the volume of the hippocampus (CA1 and DG subregions), as well as increased the MDA level, which was associated with short- and long-term memory impairment. Although, administration of CoQ10 prevented the hippocampal neural loss and volume, and caused a reduction in MDA and improved memory in the low and high SY groups.ConclusionIt seems that CoQ10 could prevent the neuronal loss and hippocampal atrophy caused by post-weaning exposure to SY through preventing oxidative stress, ultimately improving memory impairment in rats.

AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons are of interest for studying neurological disease mechanisms, developing potential therapies and deepening our understanding of the human nervous system. However, compared to an extensive history of practice with primary rodent neuron cultures, human iPSC-neurons still require more robust characterization of expression of neuronal receptors and ion channels and functional and predictive pharmacological responses. In this study, we differentiated human amniotic fluid-derived iPSCs into a mixed population of neurons (AF-iNs). Functional assessments were performed by evaluating electrophysiological (patch-clamp) properties and the effect of a panel of neuropharmacological agents on spontaneous activity (multi-electrode arrays; MEAs). These electrophysiological data were benchmarked relative to commercially sourced human iPSC-derived neurons (CNS.4U from Ncardia), primary human neurons (ScienCell (TM)) and primary rodent cortical/hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp whole-cell recordings showed that mature AF-iNs generated repetitive firing of action potentials in response to depolarizations, similar to that of primary rodent cortical/hippocampal neurons, with nearly half of the neurons displaying spontaneous post-synaptic currents. Immunochemical and MEA-based analyses indicated that AF-iNs were composed of functional glutamatergic excitatory and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Principal component analysis of MEA data indicated that human AF-iN and rat neurons exhibited distinct pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Collectively, this study establishes a necessary prerequisite for AF-iNs as a human neuron culture model suitable for pharmacological studies. Graphic Abstract

AB  - A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that sleep spindles occurring during stage 2 non-rapid-eye-movement (N2) sleep often organize into travelling waves, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of these waves and their functional significance remain unclear. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we demonstrate that N2 sleep spindles frequently form travelling spiral waves, primarily concentrated in the frontoparietal cortices and symmetrically distributed across hemispheres. These spiral waves display rich spatiotemporal dynamics, rotating around phase singularity centers while propagating across the cortex. We find that the propagation trajectories of these spiral waves exhibit two distinct types of behaviour: while some spirals undergo long-range propagation, traversing considerable distances across the cortex, others remain confined to local regions. We illustrate remarkable consistency in the distribution of these trajectories, which repeat across N2 epochs in hours-long recording sessions and remain consistent over a three-month period. Crucially, the consistency of these trajectories can reliably predict subjects' overnight memory retention performance in a word-pair association task, with greater consistency predicting better performance. Additionally, we find a progressive decrease in trajectory consistency with age, proposing these spiral waves as a potential biomarker for aging. Together, our findings indicate that spiral waves are a defining spatiotemporal feature of N2 sleep and play a crucial role in memory consolidation, offering a promising avenue for further research into sleep-dependent memory processing.

AB  - Objectives Valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) and its cofactor, small p97/VCP-interacting protein (SVIP), are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD). We investigated the cellular localization of vitamin D receptor (VDR), ERAD, and autophagic proteins (LC3B and p62) in rat brain tissue.Methods There were four groups consisting of 24 Wistar albino rats: control and treatment groups for vitamin D, omega-3, and both vitamin D and omega-3. Brain tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, azan trichrome, and toluidine blue for histopathological evaluation. The immunohistochemistry assay was performed for VDR, p97/VCP, SVIP, LC3B, and p62 in rat brain sections.Results The immunoexpression of VDR and p97/VCP was significantly increased in hippocampus and cortex of brain tissue from the vitamin D-supplemented group. Furthermore, the protein expression level of SVIP reached the highest level in vitamin D-treated group. LC3B and p62 revealed reduced expressions in vitamin D-treated group in rat brain and hippocampus, in contrast to p97/VCP, SVIP, and VDR.Conclusions Vitamin D and omega-3 supplementations had no negative effects at a cellular level on hippocampus and cortex of the brain tissue. Vitamin D increased the expression of the proteins that are related to the ERAD pathway, whereas it reduced the expression of the proteins in the autophagy pathway. Also, in this study, SVIP expressions were shown in rat hippocampus and cortex of the brain tissue.

AB  - Background. Silymarin, a polyphenolic flavonoid found in milk thistle, has been used to treat liver and brain injuries in humans and animals. The study aims to investigate the protective effects of silymarin on spatial and passive avoidance memory, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors in the brain and liver tissues of ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar rats. Methods. The study involved 30 female Wistar rats divided into control, sham, and three silymarin-treated groups. After ovariectomy, rats underwent CT scan, and some of them were administered silymarin via gavage for 2 months. Memory and learning were assessed using Morris water maze and shuttle box tests. Brain and liver tissues were analyzed for inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers (CAT, SOD, and MDA) after sacrifice. Results. Silymarin improved spatial memory and fear learning compared to the sham group (P <= 0.05 to P <= 0.001). It also significantly reduced IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels in the cortex, hippocampus, and liver (P <= 0.05 to P <= 0.0001) and increased CAT and SOD while decreasing MDA levels (P <= 0.05 to P <= 0.001) compared to control and sham groups. Conclusion. Long-term administration of silymarin extract can improve learning and memory, reverse cognitive impairment caused by ovariectomy, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory factors induced by ovariectomy in the liver and brain of Wistar rats. This is due to the reduction in MDA levels and an increase in CAT activity, although silymarin has some effect on SOD at high doses.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) using mometasone. A total of 140 patients with moderate and severe AR treated at our hospital between January 2017 and August 2020 were recruited as subjects for this study. The patients were randomly divided into control and experimental groups, with 70 patients in each group. Mometasone nasal spray was used in both groups, and vitamin D was administered to the experimental group for four weeks. The total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) were used to assess the efficacy of treatment. T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) and serum anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were analyzed. The incidence of adverse reactions was recorded. Serum vitamin D levels were lower in patients with AR. After 4 weeks of treatment, total TNSS scores, T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+), CD4+/CD8+ ratio, TNF-alpha, and total RQLQ scores were significantly reduced compared to the initial testing (P<0.05) in the two groups; CD8+, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 levels as well as serum vitamin D were significantly increased compared to the initial test (P<0.05). The improvement in these parameters in the experimental group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P<0.05), except for sneezing and eye symptoms in the TNSS and RQLQ scores. It was concluded that vitamin D supplementation improves the therapeutic effect of mometasone nasal spray on AR and is thus recommended as an adjuvant therapy for moderate and severe AR.

AB  - Exercise has been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of affective disorders and to increase the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with reduced activity-dependent BDNF release and increased risk for anxiety and depression. Male and female Val66Met rats were given access to running wheels from 3 weeks of age and compared to sedentary controls. Anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were measured in adulthood using the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), and forced swim test (FST). Expression of BDNF and a number of stress-related genes, the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1), and FK506 binding protein 51 (Fkbp5) in the hippocampus were also measured. Rats given access to running wheels developed high levels of voluntary exercise, decreased open-arm time on the EPM and center-field time in the OF, reduced overall exploratory activity in the open field, and increased immobility time in the FST with no differences between genotypes. Chronic exercise induced a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA and BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus with some of these effects being genotype specific. Exercise decreased the expression of Nr3c1 and Sgk1, but increased the expression of Fkbp5. These results suggest that chronic running-wheel exercise from adolescence increased anxiety and depression-like phenotypes in adulthood, independent of BDNF Val66Met genotype. Further studies are required to confirm that increased indices of anxiety-like behavior are independent from reduced overall locomotor activity.

AB  - Calcium dynamics control synaptic transmission. Calcium triggers synaptic vesicle fusion, determines release probability, modulates vesicle recycling, participates in long-term plasticity and regulates cellular metabolism. Mitochondria, the main source of cellular energy, serve as calcium signaling hubs. Mitochondrial calcium transients are primarily determined by the balance between calcium influx, mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), and calcium efflux through the sodium/lithium/calcium exchanger (NCLX). We identified a human recessive missense SLC8B1 variant that impairs NCLX activity and is associated with severe mental retardation. On this basis, we examined the effect of deleting NCLX in mice on mitochondrial and synaptic calcium homeostasis, synaptic activity, and plasticity. Neuronal mitochondria exhibited basal calcium overload, membrane depolarization, and a reduction in the amplitude and rate of calcium influx and efflux. We observed smaller cytoplasmic calcium transients in the presynaptic terminals of NCLX-KO neurons, leading to a lower probability of release and weaker transmission. In agreement, synaptic facilitation in NCLX-KO hippocampal slices was enhanced. Importantly, deletion of NCLX abolished long term potentiation of Schaffer collateral synapses. Our results show that NCLX controls presynaptic calcium transients that are crucial for defining synaptic strength as well as short- and long-term plasticity, key elements of learning and memory processes. Stavsky et al. examined the effects of deleting the mitochondrial sodium/lithium/calcium exchanger, NCLX, on mitochondrial and synaptic calcium homeostasis, synaptic activity, and plasticity in mice. Having identified a human mutation that impairs NCLX activity and is associated with mental retardation, they show that NCLX is crucial for defining synaptic strength and plasticity, which are pivotal elements of learning and memory.

AB  - This study aims to establish whether adrenomedullin (ADM) is capable to restore the steroidogenic functions of Leydig cells by suppressing transforming growth factor-01 (TGF-01) through Hippo signaling. Primary Leydig cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an adeno-associated virus vector that expressed ADM (Ad-ADM) or sh-RNA of TGF-01 (Ad-sh-TGF-01). The cell viability and medium concentrations of testosterone were detected. Gene expression and protein levels were determined for steroidogenic enzymes, TGF-01, RhoA, YAP, TAZ and TEAD1. The role of Ad-ADM in the regulation of TGF-01 promoter was confirmed by ChIP and Co-IP. Similar to Ad-sh-TGF-01, Ad-ADM mitigated the decline in the number of Leydig cells and plasma concentrations of testosterone by restoring the gene and protein levels of SF-1, LRH1, NUR77, StAR, P450scc, 30-HSD, CYP17 and 170-HSD. Similar to Ad-sh-TGF-01, Ad-ADM not only inhibited the LPS-induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis but also restored the gene and protein levels of SF-1, LRH1, NUR77, StAR, P450scc, 30-HSD, CYP17 and 170-HSD, along with the medium concentrations of testosterone in LPS-induced Leydig cells. Like Ad-sh-TGF-01, Ad-ADM improved LPS-induced TGF-01 expression. In addition, Ad-ADM suppressed RhoA activation, enhanced the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, reduced the expression of TEAD1 which interacted with HDAC5 and then bound to TGF-01 gene promoter in LPS-exposed Leydig cells. It is thus suspected that ADM can exert anti-apoptotic effect to restore the steroidogenic functions of Leydig cells by suppressing TGF-01 through Hippo signaling.

AB  - Background The Chinese herbal formula Chaihujia Longgu Muli Decoction (CD) has a good antiepileptic effect, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in this study we explored the molecular mechanisms of CD against epilepsy. Methods Twelve-day-old SD rats were randomly divided into a normal group, model group, valproic acid group, and CD high, medium, and low groups. Except for the normal group, the other groups were given an intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) to establish epilepsy models, and the Racine score was applied for model judgment. After 14 consecutive days of dosing, the Morris water maze test was performed. Then, hippocampal Nissl staining and immunofluorescence staining were performed, and synaptic ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway proteins were detected. Results In PTZ model rats, the passing times were reduced, and the escape latency was prolonged in the Morris water maze test. Nissl staining showed that some hippocampal neurons swelled and ruptured, Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm were significantly reduced, and neurons were lost. Immunofluorescence detection revealed that the expression of PSD95 and SYP was significantly reduced. Electron microscopy results revealed that the number of synapses in hippocampal neurons was significantly reduced and the postsynaptic membrane length was significantly reduced. Western blot analysis showed that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway was activated, while SYP, SPD95, and PTEN expression was significantly decreased. After treatment with CD, neurobehavioral abnormalities and neuronal damage caused by epileptic seizures were improved. Conclusion CD exerted an antiepileptic effect by inhibiting the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.

AB  - The TEAD (Sd in drosophila) transcription factors are essential for the Hippo pathway. Human VGLL4 and drosophila Tgi bind to TEAD/Sd via two distinct binding sites. These two regions are separated by few amino acids in VGLL4 but they are very distant from each other in Tgi. This difference prompted us to study whether it influences the interaction with TEAD4/Sd. We show that the full-length VGLL4/Tgi proteins behave as intrinsically disordered proteins. They have a similar affinity for TEAD4/Sd revealing that the length of the region between the two binding sites has little effect on the interaction. One of their two binding sites (high-affinity site) binds to TEAD4/Sd 100 times more tightly than to the other site, and size exclusion chromatography experiments reveal that VGLL4/Tgi only form trimeric complexes with TEAD4/Sd at high protein concentrations. In solution, therefore, VGLL4/Tgi may predominantly interact with TEAD4/Sd via their high-affinity site to create dimeric complexes. In contrast, when TEAD4/Sd molecules are immobilized on sensor chips used in Surface Plasmon Resonance experiments, one VGLL4/Tgi molecule can bind simultaneously with an enhanced affinity to two immobilized molecules. This effect, due to a local increase in protein concentration triggered by the proximity of the immobilized TEAD4/Sd molecules, suggests that in vivo VGLL4/Tgi could bind with an enhanced affinity to two nearby TEAD/Sd molecules bound to DNA. The presence of two binding sites in VGLL4/Tgi might only be required for the function of these proteins when they interact with TEAD/Sd bound to DNA.

AB  - Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of poor hemodynamic reconstitution outcomes after myocardial infarction or circulatory arrest. Currently, the search for effective therapeutic agents and tools is a focus of research in the field of myocardial I/R injury. Resveratrol (Res) has been extensively studied in recent years because of its good cardiovascular therapeutic effects, but its specific mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of interaction between myocardial I/R injury and Res in vitro and in vivo. In our in vivo study, we used PI/TUNEL staining and western blotting to detect relevant necroptotic key molecules such as RIP1, RIP3 and p-MLKL/MLKL to observe myocardial necroptosis. The extent of myocardial injury was determined using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as well as serum levels of CK-MB and LDH and echocardiography. In the in vitro study, cellular injury was assessed by CCK-8 and cell supernatant LDH levels. In addition, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to knock down YAP, a key effector molecule of the Hippo pathway, to validate the molecular mechanism of action by which Res exerts myocardial protection. The localization of YAP in H9c2 cardiomyocytes was examined using immunofluorescence. Our data demonstrated that Res could ameliorate myocardial I/R-induced necroptosis by modulating the Hippo pathway, and that the beneficial effect of Res might be associated with nuclear translocation of the transcriptional regulator YAP.

AB  - Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) has been shown to alleviate cognitive impairment in an APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage. However, this enhancement was only observed immediately after AtDCS, and the long-term effect of AtDCS remains unknown. In this study, we treated 26-week-old mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage with 10 AtDCS sessions or sham stimulation. The Morris water maze, novel object recognition task, and novel object location test were implemented to evaluate spatial learning memory and recognition memory of mice. Western blotting was used to detect the relevant protein content. Morphological changes were observed using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. Six weeks after treatment, the mice subjected to AtDCS sessions had a shorter escape latency, a shorter path length, more platform area crossings, and spent more time in the target quadrant than sham-stimulated mice. The mice subjected to AtDCS sessions also performed better in the novel object recognition and novel object location tests than sham-stimulated mice. Furthermore, AtDCS reduced the levels of amyloid-beta 42 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astrocyte activation, and increased the level of neuronal marker NeuN in hippocampal tissue. These findings suggest that AtDCS can improve the spatial learning and memory abilities and pathological state of an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage, with improvements that last for at least 6 weeks.

AB  - Objectives: Diabetes mellitus associated cognitive impairment is suggested to be due to oxidative stress. Considering the anti-diabetic, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory effects of Zingiber officinale, the present study aimed to investigate its effect on memory and oxidative stress factors in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.
   Methods: The rats were allocated into five groups: Control, Diabetic, Diabetic + Ginger 100, Diabetic + Ginger 200, and Diabetic + Ginger 400. Following diabetes induction by STZ (60 mg/kg), 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg Ginger was given for eight weeks. Passive avoidance test (PA) was done and thiol, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) measurements were carried out in the brain.
   Results: The latency into the dark compartment decreased (p<0.001) and the number of entries and time spent in the dark chamber increased in the Diabetic group compared to the Control (p<0.001 for all). All three doses of extract improved performance of the rats in the PA test (p<0.001 for all). The hippocampal and cortical MDA level was higher (p<0.001) while CAT, SOD, and total thiol were lower (p<0.01-p<0.001) in the Diabetic group than the Control. Treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg Z. officinale extract reduced hippocampal and cortical MDA (p<0.001) and improved CAT (p<0.001) while, just the dose of 400 mg/kg of the extract increased SOD and total thiol in hippocampal and cortical tissues (p<0.001) compared with Diabetic group.
   Conclusions: Z. officinale extract could improve memory by reducing the oxidative stress in STZ-induced diabetes model.

AB  - Centrosomal protein 152 (Cep152) regulates centriole duplication as a molecular scaffold during the cell cycle. Its gene abnormalities are responsible for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly 9 and Seckel syndrome. In this study, we prepared an antibody against mouse Cep152, anti-Cep152, and performed expression analyses focusing on mouse brain development. Western blotting analyses revealed that Cep152 with a molecular mass of similar to 150 kDa was expressed strongly at embryonic day (E)13 and then gradually decreased during the brain development process. Instead, protein bands of similar to 80 kDa and similar to 60 kDa came to be recognized after postnatal day (P)15 and P30, respectively. In immunohistochemical analyses, Cep152 was enriched in the centrosome of neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone at E14, whereas it was diffusely distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons at P18. In developing cerebellum at P7, Cep152 was localized at the centrosome in the external granular layer, where neurogenesis takes place. Notably, biochemical analysis revealed that Cep152 was also present in the postsynaptic density fraction. Subsequent immunofluorescent analyses showed co-localization of Cep152 with excitatory synaptic markers, PSD95 and synaptophysin, but not with an inhibitory synaptic marker gephyrin in differentiated primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The obtained results suggest that Cep152 takes part not only in neurogenesis during corticogenesis but also in the regulation of synaptic function in differentiated neurons.

AB  - The 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most active compound of Boswellia serrata proposed for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized in its early phase by alteration in mood. Accordingly, we have previously demonstrated that an intracerebroventricular injection of soluble amyloid beta (1-42) (A beta) peptide evokes a depressive-like phenotype in rats. We tested the protective effects of AKBA in the mouse model of an A beta-induced depressive-like phenotype. We evaluated the depressive-like behavior by using the tail suspension test (TST) and the splash test (ST). Behavioral analyses were accompanied by neurochemical quantifications, such as glutamate (GLU), kynurenine (KYN) and monoamines, and by biochemical measurements, such as glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), CD11b and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), in mice prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPP). AKBA prevented the depressive-like behaviors induced by A beta administration, since we recorded a reduction in latency to initiate self-care and total time spent to perform self-care in the ST and reduced time of immobility in the TST. Likewise, the increase in GLU and KYN levels in PFC and HIPP induced by the peptide injection were reverted by AKBA administration, as well as the displayed increase in levels of GFAP and NF-kB in both PFC and HIPP, but not in CD11b. Therefore, AKBA might represent a food supplement suitable as an adjuvant for therapy of depression in early-stage AD.

AB  - Brain function is linked with many peripheral tissues, including the liver, where hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) mediates communication between the liver and brain. Lycopene (LYC), a naturally occurring carotenoid, posses multiple health-promoting properties, including neuroprotective function. Here, we investigated the effects of LYC on age-related memory impairment and the relative contribution of liver-brain FGF21 signaling in these process. The results showed that after treatment with LYC for 3 months, brain aging and age- related cognitive deficits were effectively managed. In addition, LYC ameliorated neuronal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage, and promoted synaptic vesicle fusion in 18-month-old mice. Notably, LYC activated liver-brain FGF21 signalling in aging mice. Whereas all these central effects of LYC were negated by blocking FGF21 via i. v. injection of adeno-associated virus in aging mice. Furthermore, recombinant FGF21 elevated mitochondrial ATP levels and enhanced synaptic vesicle fusion in mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells, which promoted neurotransmitter release. Additionally, we co-cultured hepatocytes and neurons in Transwell and found that LYC enhanced hepatocytes' support for neurons. This support included improved cell senescence, enhanced mitochondrial function, and increased axon length in co-cultured neurons. In conclusion, LYC protects against age-related cognitive deficit, partly explained by activating liver-brain FGF21 signalling, hence promoting neurotransmitters release via increasing mitochondrial ATP levels and enhancing synaptic vesicle fusion. These findings revealed that FGF21 could be a potential therapeutical target in nutritional intervention strategies to improve cognitive damage caused by aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - . Background. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by high prevalence and morbidity. However, its pathogenesis is still obscure. This work focuses on the effects of Eupatilin (EUP) on inflammation reaction and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in CRSwNP. Methods. In vivo and in vitro CRSwNP models were established based on BALB/c mice and human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) to investigate the effects of EUP on EMT and inflammation in CRSwNP. Protein levels TFF1, EMT -related factors (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin), and Wnt/f3-catenin signaling -related proteins (Wnt3a and f3-catenin) were assayed via western blotting. Pro -inflammatory factors (TNF-a, IL -6, and IL 8) were assessed via ELISA assay. Results. EUP treatment significantly reduced the number of polyps, epithelial thickness, and mucosal thickness in CRSwNP mice. Besides, EUP treatment also suppressed inflammation reaction and EMT events in CRSwNP mice and SEB-challenged hNECs in a dose dependent manner. Also, EUP treatment dose dependently upregulated TFF1 expression and inhibited Wnt/f3-catenin activation in CRSwNP mice and SEBchallenged hNECs. In addition, TFF1 inhibition or Wnt/f3-catenin activation partially abated EUP-mediated protection against SEB-induced inflammation reaction and EMT events in hNECs. Conclusions. Taken together, our findings highlighted the inhibitory role of EUP on the inflammation and EMT processes in CRSwNP in vivo and in vitro via upregulating TFF1 and inhibiting the Wnt/f3-catenin signaling, suggesting EUP could be promising therapeutic agent for CRSwNP.

AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive and cytotoxic alpha-dicarbonyl byproduct of glycolysis. Our bodies have several biodefense systems to detoxify MG, including an enzymatic system by glyoxalase (GLO) 1 and GLO2. We identified a subtype of schizophrenia patients with novel mutations in the GLO1 gene that results in reductions of enzymatic activity. Moreover, we found that vitamin B6 (VB6) levels in peripheral blood of the schizophrenia patients with GLO1 dysfunction are significantly lower than that of healthy controls. However, the effects of GLO1 dysfunction and VB6 deficiency on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Here, we generated a novel mouse model for this subgroup of schizophrenia patients by feeding Glo1 knockout mice VB6-deficent diets (KO/VB6(-)) and evaluated the combined effects of GLO1 dysfunction and VB6 deficiency on brain function. KO/VB6(-) mice accumulated homocysteine in plasma and MG in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and striatum, and displayed behavioral deficits, such as impairments of social interaction and cognitive memory and a sensorimotor deficit in the prepulse inhibition test. Furthermore, we found aberrant gene expression related to mitochondria function in the PFC of the KO/VB6(-) mice by RNA-sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Finally, we demonstrated abnormal mitochondrial respiratory function and subsequently enhanced oxidative stress in the PFC of KO/VB6(-) mice in the PFC. These findings suggest that the combination of GLO1 dysfunction and VB6 deficiency may cause the observed behavioral deficits via mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the PFC.

AB  - Adenosine operates a modulation system fine-tuning the efficiency of synaptic transmission and plasticity through A(1) and A(2A) receptors (A(1)R, A(2A)R), respectively. Supramaximal activation of A(1)R can block hippocampal synaptic transmission, and the tonic engagement of A(1)R-mediated inhibition is increased with increased frequency of nerve stimulation. This is compatible with an activity-dependent increase in extracellular adenosine in hippocampal excitatory synapses, which can reach levels sufficient to block synaptic transmission. We now report that A(2A)R activation decreases A(1)R-medated inhibition of synaptic transmission, with particular relevance during high-frequency-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, whereas the A(1)R antagonist DPCPX (50 nM) was devoid of effects on LTP magnitude, the addition of an A(2A)R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nM) allowed a facilitatory effect of DPCPX on LTP to be revealed. Additionally, the activation of A(2A)R with CGS21680 (30 nM) decreased the potency of the A(1)R agonist CPA (6-60 nM) to inhibit hippocampal synaptic transmission in a manner prevented by SCH58261. These observations show that A(2A)R play a key role in dampening A(1)R during high-frequency induction of hippocampal LTP. This provides a new framework for understanding how the powerful adenosine A(1)R-mediated inhibition of excitatory transmission can be controlled to allow the implementation of hippocampal LTP.

AB  - To investigate the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on hippocampal network activity Wirt et al induced sustained hyperglycemia in rats and tested them in a spatial delayed alternation task while recording from the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex. They demonstrated that hyperglycemia impaired task performance and altered theta rhythm as well as increasing tau phosphorylation, which suggest there is potentially a direct link between chronic hyperglycemia and Alzheimer's disease.
   Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease associated with dysregulated glucose and insulin levels and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life. It is thought that chronic hyperglycemia leads to neuroinflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus leading to cognitive decline, but effects on hippocampal network activity are unknown. A sustained hyperglycemic state was induced in otherwise healthy animals and subjects were then tested on a spatial delayed alternation task while recording from the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Hyperglycemic animals performed worse on long delay trials and had multiple electrophysiological differences throughout the task. We found increased delta power and decreased theta power in the hippocampus, which led to altered theta/delta ratios at the end of the delay period. Cross frequency coupling was significantly higher in multiple bands and delay period hippocampus-ACC theta coherence was elevated, revealing hypersynchrony. The highest coherence values appeared long delays on error trials for STZ animals, the opposite of what was observed in controls, where lower delay period coherence was associated with errors. Consistent with previous investigations, we found increases in phosphorylated tau in STZ animals' hippocampus and cortex, which might account for the observed oscillatory and cognitive changes.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests the serine protease, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), may play an important role in the modulation of mood and cognitive functions. Also, preliminary evidence indicates that uPA modulates BDNF activity that is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. However, the physiological functions of uPA in specific brain regions for mediating stress-related emotional behaviors remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the role of ectopic uPA expression on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors following social defeat stress in rats. For this purpose, we inspected the behavioral outcomes following bilateral stereotaxic delivery of uPA-overexpressing lentiviral vectors in the hippocampus using a series of behavioral tests. Results show that hippocampal uPA gain-of-function prevented stress-elicited anxiogenic-like effects, as determined in the marble burying, open field, and elevated plus maze tests, with no alterations in spontaneous locomotor activity. Also, ectopic uPA overexpression resulted in anti-depressant-like effects in the sucrose splash, tail suspension, and forced swim tests. Most importantly, uPA overexpression increased hippocampal BDNF levels, and a strong positive correlation was found using the Pearson test. Moreover, the same correlation analysis revealed a strong negative relationship between uPA mRNA and parameters of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of considering uPA activation and provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of stress-elicited mood illnesses, which should help in the development of new approaches to tackle depression and anxiety disorders.

AB  - We sought to determine the effects of long-term voluntary wheel running on markers of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) in skeletal muscle, liver, and the hippocampus of female rats. In addition, markers of the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway that results in inflammation were interrogated. Female Lewis rats (n = 34) were separated into one of three groups including a 6-moold group to serve as a young comparator group (CTL, n = 10), a group that had access to a running wheel for voluntary wheel running (EX, n = 12), and an age-matched group that did not (SED, n = 12). Both SED and EX groups were carried out from 6 mo to 15 mo of age. There were no significant differences in L1 mRNA expression for any of the tissues between groups. Methylation of the L1 promoter in the soleus and hippocampus was significantly higher in SED and EX than in CTL group (P < 0.05). ORF1p expression was higher in older SED and EX rats than in CTL rats for every tissue (P < 0.05). There were no differences between groups for L1 mRNA or cGAS-STING pathway markers. Our results suggest there is an increased ORF1 protein expression across tissues with aging that is not mitigated by voluntary wheel running. In addition, although previous data imply that L1 methylation changes may play a role in acute exercise for L1 RNA expression, this does not seem to occur during extended periods of voluntary wheel running.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder can present a plethora of clinical conditions associated with the disorder, such as greater brain volume in the first years of life in a significant percentage of patients. We aimed to evaluate the brain water content, the blood-brain barrier permeability, and the expression of aquaporin 1 and 4, and GFAP in a valproic acid-animal model, assessing the effect of resveratrol. On postnatal day 30, Wistar rats of the valproic acid group showed greater permeability of the blood-brain barrier to the Evans blue dye and a higher proportion of brain water volume, prevented both by resveratrol. Prenatal exposition to valproic acid diminished aquaporin 1 in the choroid plexus, in the primary somatosensory area, in the amygdala region, and in the medial prefrontal cortex, reduced aquaporin 4 in medial prefrontal cortex and increased aquaporin 4 levels in primary somatosensory area (with resveratrol prevention). Valproic acid exposition also increased the number of astrocytes and GFAP fluorescence in both primary somatosensory area and medial prefrontal cortex. In medial prefrontal cortex, resveratrol prevented the increased fluorescence. Finally, there was an effect of resveratrol per se on the number of astrocytes and GFAP fluorescence in the amygdala region and in the hippocampus. Thus, this work demonstrates significant changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, edema formation, distribution of aquaporin 1 and 4, in addition to astrocytes profile in the animal model of autism, as well as the use of resveratrol as a tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - One common characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases is dysregulation of iron, usually with observed increases in its concentration in various regions. Heavy alcohol consumption is believed to contribute to such iron dysregulation in the brain with accompanying dementia. To examine this effect and related genetic-based individual differences in an animal model, we subjected female mice from 12 BXD recombinant inbred strains to 16 weeks of alcohol consumption using the drinking in the dark (DID) method. Daily consumption was recorded and at the end of 16 weeks hippocampus tissues harvested. Concentrations of iron, copper and zinc were measured using X-ray fluorescence technology. The results showed that, DID increased iron overall across all strains, ranging from 3 to 68%. Copper and Zinc both decreased, ranging from 0.4-42 and 5-35% respectively. Analysis of variance revealed significant strain by treatment interactions for all three metals. Additionally, in the DID group, we observed strain differences in reduction of hippocampus mass. These findings are particularly interesting to us because high alcohol consumption in humans has been associated with neurodegeneration and dementia related to disruption of iron regulation. The findings of alcohol consumption associated decreases in copper and zinc are novel. The role of copper regulation and neurological function related to alcohol consumption is as yet largely unexplored. The role of zinc is better known as a neuromodulator in the hippocampus and appears to be protective against neurological damage. It would seem then, that the alcohol-related decrease in zinc in the hippocampus would be of concern and warrants further study.

AB  - Exercise can promote adult neurogenesis and improve symptoms associated with schizophrenia and other mental disorders via parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus ErbB4 is the receptor of neurotrophic factor neuregulin 1, expressed mostly in PV-positive interneurons. Whether ErbB4 in PV-positive neurons mediates the beneficial effect of exercise and adult neurogenesis on mental disorder needs to be further investigation. Here, we first conducted a four-week study on the effects of AG1478, an ErbB4 inhibitor, on memory and neurogenesis. AG1478 significantly impaired the performance in several memory tasks, including the T-maze, Morris water maze, and contextual fear conditioning, downregulated the expression of total ErbB4 (T-ErbB4) and the ratio of phosphate-ErbB4 (p-ErbB4) to T-ErbB4, and associated with neurogenesis impairment. Interestingly, AG1478 also appeared to decrease intracellular calcium levels in PV neurons, which could be reversed by exercise. These results suggest exercise may regulate adult neurogenesis and PV neuron activity through ErbB4 signaling. Overall, these findings provide further evidence of the importance of exercise for neurogenesis and suggest that targeting ErbB4 may be a promising strategy for improving memory and other cognitive functions in individuals with mental disorders.Graphical AbstractTreadmill running and ErbB4 signaling: AG1478 downregulated the expression of T-ErbB4 and the ratio of p-ErbB4 to T-ErbB4, while treadmill running enhanced neurogenesis, increased spatial learning and memory, non-spatial working, and reference memory and promoted the intracellular Ca2+ levels in PV neurons.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have widely used in industrial and medical applications for their excellent anti-bacterial activities. AgNPs can penetrate into the brain and cause neuronal death, but limited evidence focused on toxic effects and mechanic study in hippocampal neuron. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells and further to explore role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in AgNPs-induced neuro-toxicity. Our results showed that acute exposure to AgNPs at low doses (2-8 mu g/mL) increased ROS generation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP synthesis in HT22 cells. In addition, AgNPs promoted mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis via excessive mitochondrial fission/fusion by 8 mu g/mL AgNPs treatment for 24 h. The mechanism was involved in increased protein expression of Drp1, mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), mitofusin 1/2 (Mfn1/2) and inhibited optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), and mainly mediated by phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser616. The AgNPs-induced mitochondrial impair-ment and apoptosis was mainly due to their particle-specific effect rather than silver ions release. Furthermore Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission contributed to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induced by AgNPs, all aforementioned changes were significantly rescued by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and Mdivi-1 except for OPA1 protein expression. Hence, our results provide a novel neurotoxic mechanism to AgNPs-induced neurotoxicity and revealed that the mechanism of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HT22 cells was mediated by excessive activation of ROS-Drp1-mitochondrial fission axis. These findings can deepen current evidences on neuro-toxicological evaluation of AgNPs and aid in guiding their proper applications in different areas, especially in biomedical use.

AB  - Epilepsy is the results from the imbalance between inhibition and excitation in neural circuits, which is mainly treated by some chemical drugs with side effects. Gain-of-function of BK channels or knockout of its beta 4 subunit associates with spontaneous epilepsy. Currently, few reports were published about the efficacy of BK(alpha + beta 4) channel modulators in epilepsy prevention. Charybdotoxin is a non-specific inhibitor of BK and other K+ channels. Here, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other biochemical techniques, we found that charybdotoxin might interact with the extracellular loop of human beta 4 subunit (i.e., h beta 4-loop) of BK(alpha + beta 4) channel at a molar ratio 4:1 (h beta 4-loop vs. charybdotoxin). Charybdotoxin enhanced its ability to prevent K+ current of BK(alpha + beta 4 H101Y) channel. The charybdotoxin Q18F variant selectively reduced the neuronal spiking frequency and increased interspike intervals of BK(alpha + beta 4) channel by pi-pi stacking interactions between its residue Phe(18) and residue His(101) of h beta 4-loop. Moreover, intrahippocampal infusion of charybdotoxin Q18F variant significantly increased latency time of seizure, reduced seizure duration and seizure numbers on pentylenetetrazole-induced pre-sensitized rats, inhibited hippocampal hyperexcitability and c-Fos expression, and displayed neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neurons. These results implied that charybdotoxin Q18F variant could be potentially used for intractable epilepsy treatment by therapeutically targeting BK(alpha + beta 4) channel.

AB  - Lead (Pb), a corrosion-resistant heavy non-ferrous metal, is one of the most common environmental neurotoxic metals. The effects of Pb on other essential metal elements are contradictory. Therefore, this in vivo study addressed the effects of sub-chronic Pb exposure on the distribution of other divalent metals, exploring the relationships between Pb levels in blood, teeth, bones, hair, and brain tissues. Thirty-two healthy male C57BL/6 mice received intragastric administration (i.g.) with 0, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg Pb acetate, once a day for 8 weeks. Levels of Pb and other metal elements [including iron(Fe), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and calcium(Ca)] in the whole blood, teeth, the right thighbone, hair, and brain tissues (including cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus) were detected with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Pb levels in all detected organs were increased after Pb-exposed for 8 weeks. The results of relationship analysis between Pb levels in the tissues and lifetime cumulative Pb exposure (LCPE) showed that Pb levels in the blood, bone, and hair could indirectly reflect the Pb accumulation in the murine brain. These measures might serve as valuable biomarkers for chronic Pb exposure reflective of the accumulation of Pb in the central nervous system (CNS). Sub-chronic Pb exposure for 8 weeks altered Ca, Cu, Fe, and Zn levels, but no effects were noted on Mg levels in any of the analyzed tissues. Pb decreased Ca in teeth, Cu in thighbone and teeth, Zn in whole blood and hair, and Fe in hair. In contrast, Pb increased Ca levels in corpus striatum and hypothalamus, Cu levels in striatum, Zn levels in teeth, and Fe levels in hippocampus, thighbone, and teeth. The Pb-induced changes in metal ratios in various tissues may serve as valuable biomarkers for chronic Pb exposure as they are closely related to the accumulations of Pb in the murine CNS. The results suggest that altered distribution of several essential metal elements may be involved in Pb-induced neurotoxicity. Additional studies should address the interaction between Pb and essential metal elements in the CNS and other organs.

AB  - Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can exert antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, but the exact molecular mechanism underlying their effects is still not fully understood. We conducted both in vitro and clinical investigations to test which EPA or DHA metabolites are involved in these anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antidepressant effects. In vitro, we used the human hippocampal progenitor cell line HPC0A07/03C, and pre-treated cells with either EPA or DHA, followed by interleukin 1beta (IL1 beta), IL6 and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Both EPA and DHA prevented the reduction in neurogenesis and the increase in apoptosis induced by these cytokines; moreover, these effects were mediated by the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) EPA/DHA metabolites, 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), 4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHA), 18-HEPE, 20-HDHA, 17(18)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EpETE) and 19(20)-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (EpDPA), detected here for the first time in human hippocampal neurones using mass spectrometry lipidomics of the supernatant. In fact, like EPA/DHA, co-treatment with these metabolites prevented cytokines-induced reduction in neurogenesis and apoptosis. Moreover, co-treatment with 17(18)-EpETE and 19(20)-EpDPA and the soluble epoxide hydroxylase (sEH) inhibitor, TPPU (which prevents their conversion into dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (DiHETE)/ dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DiHDPA) metabolites) further enhanced their neurogenic and anti-apoptotic effects. Interestingly, these findings were replicated in a sample of n = 22 patients with a DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder, randomly assigned to treatment with either EPA (3.0 g/day) or DHA (1.4 g/day) for 12 weeks, with exactly the same LOX and CYP450 lipid metabolites increased in the plasma of these patients following treatment with their precursor, EPA or DHA, and some evidence that higher levels of these metabolites were correlated with less severe depressive symptoms. Overall, our study provides the first evidence for the relevance of LOX- and CYP450-derived EPA/DHA bioactive lipid metabolites as neuroprotective molecular targets for human hippocampal neurogenesis and depression, and highlights the importance of sEH inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from depressive symptoms.

AB  - Kin of irregular chiasm-like 3 (Kirrel3), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed in the central nervous system during development and in adulthood. It has been reported that Kirrel3 is involved in the axonal fasciculation in the olfactory bulb, the neuronal migration in the pontine nucleus, and the synapse formation in the hippocampal neurons in mice. Although KIRREL3 mutations have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability in humans, the comprehensive expression pattern of Kirrel3 in the adult brain is not fully understood. To better visualize Kirrel3 expression pattern and to gain insight into the role of Kirrel3 in the brain, we investigated the expression of Kirrel3 in the adult brain of Kirrel3-heterozygous (Kirrel3(+/-)) mice, in which Kirrel3-expressing cells could be identified by the expression of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in the nucleus of cells. The strong expression of fl-gal was observed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, amygdala, thalamus, and cerebellum. In the hippocampus, beta-gal was detected in the dentate gyrus and in the ventral parts of CA1 and CA3, which are known to be involved in the social recognition memory. Within the cerebral cortex, many cells with fl-gal expression were observed in the olfactory area and auditory area. In the striatum, neurons with beta-gal expression were mainly observed in the ventral striatum. Expression of beta-gal was observed in all layers in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, except for the olfactory nerve layer. Double-immunofluorescence staining of beta-galactosidase with neuronal markers revealed that fl-gal expression was exclusively detected in neurons. These results suggest that Kirrel3 may be involved in the maintenance of neuronal networks, such as the maintenance of synaptic connectivity and plasticity in the motor, sensory, and cognitive circuits of adult brain (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) embedded in a bio-compatible matrix has been demonstrated as a promising strategy for the treatment of bone defects. This study was designed to explore the effect and mechanism of exosomes derived from mature dendritic cells (mDC-Exo) on the BM-MSCs-mediated bone regeneration using the matrix support in an athymic rat model of femoral bone defect. Methods The BM-MSCs were isolated from rats and incubated with osteoblast induction medium, exosomes derived from immature DCs (imDC-Exo), mDC-Exo, and miR-335-deficient mDC-Exo. BM-MSCs treated without or with mDC-Exo were embedded in a bio-compatible matrix (Orthoss(R)) and then implanted into the femoral bone defect of athymic rats. Results mDC-Exo promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by transferring miR-335. Mechanistically, exosomal miR-335 inhibited Hippo signaling by targeting large tongue suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) and thus promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Animal experiments showed that mDC-Exo enhanced BM-MSCs-mediated bone regeneration after bone defect, and this effect was abrogated when miR-335 expression was inhibited in mDC-Exo. Conclusion mDC-Exo promoted osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs and enhanced BM-MSCs-mediated bone regeneration after femoral bone defect in athymic rats by transferring miR-335.

AB  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a small molecule that acts both in the central and peripheral nervous system as a neurotransmitter and a hormone, respectively. Serotonin is synthesized via a multi-stage pathway beginning with L-tryptophan, which is converted by an enzyme called tryptophan hydroxylase into L-5-Hydroxytryptophan. It is well-known for its significance in the control of mood, anxiety, depression, and insomnia as well as in normal human functions such as sleep, sexual activity, and appetite. Thus, for medical chemists and pharmaceutical firms, serotonin is one of the most desirable targets. Among the seven different classes of serotonin receptors, the 5-HT1A was one of the first discovered serotonin receptors, and the 5-HT7 was the last addition to the serotonin receptor family. Both the classes were thoroughly examined. 5-HT1A neurotransmission-related dysfunctions are linked to many psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, and movement disorders.5-HT7 is a member of the cell surface receptor GPCR superfamily and is regulated by the serotonin neuro-transmitter. It has been the focus of intensive research efforts since its discovery, which was prompted by its presence in functionally important regions of the brain. The thalamus and hypothalamus have the highest 5-HT7 receptor densities. They are also found in the hippocampus and cortex at higher densities. Thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory, and sleep are all associated with the 5-HT7 receptor. It is also suspected that this receptor may be involved in the control of mood, indicating that it may be a beneficial target for depression treatment. Several differently structured molecules such as aminotetralins, ergolines, arylpiperazines, indolylalkylamines, aporphines, and aryloxyalkyl-amines are known to bind to 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor sites. In brain serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 are strongly co-expressed in regions involved in depression. However, their functional interaction has not been identified. An overview of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor ligands belonging to different chemical groups is mentioned in this review.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that AMPK plays an important role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by participating in apoptosis, but the exact mechanism and target of action remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of AMPK activation on brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest. HE, Nills and TUNEL assays were used to evaluate neuronal damage and apoptosis. The relationships between AMPK, HNF4a and apoptotic genes were verified by ChIP-seq, dual-luciferase and WB assays. The results showed that AMPK improved the 7-day memory function of rats, and reduced neuronal cell injury and apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region after ROSC, while the use of HNF4a inhibitor weakened the protective effect of AMPK. Further research found that AMPK positively regulated the expression of HNF4a, and AMPK could promote the expression of Bcl-2 and inhibit the expression of Bax and Cleaved-Caspase 3. In vitro experiments showed that AMPK ameliorated neuronal injury by inhibiting apoptosis through the activation of HNF4a. Combined with ChIP-seq, JASPAR analysis and Dual-luciferase assay, the binding site of HNF4a to the upstream promoter of Bcl-2 was found. Taken together, AMPK attenuates brain injury after CA by activating HNF4a to target Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of cancer development and progression, and as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. In this study, we identified a new lncRNA (LINC02159) that was upregulated in the tumor tissues and serum of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We demonstrated that knockdown of LINC02159 inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro and retarded tumor growth in vivo, while overexpression of LINC02159 led to the opposite effect. We discovered that LINC02159 was highly correlated with cancer growth and metastasis-related pathways by using transcriptomic analysis and that YAP1 was a potential target gene of LINC02159. Mechanistically, LINC02159 bound to the Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF) to enhance the stability of YAP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) via m(5)C modification, which led to the overexpression of YAP1 and the activation of the Hippo and & beta;-catenin signaling pathways in NSCLC cells. Rescue experiments showed that LINC01259 promoted NSCLC progression in a YAP1- and ALYREF-dependent manner. In conclusion, LINC02159 plays an oncogenic role in NSCLC progression by regulating ALYREF/YAP1 signaling, and it has the potential to be utilized as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for NSCLC.

AB  - Background: Nudix Hydrolase 21 (NUDT21) is crucial for the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, with its reduced expression frequently resulting in a shortened mRNA 3 ' untranslated region (UTR), thereby enhancing the protein levels of downstream genes. Although NUDT21 is widely recognized for its tumor-suppressive function in various cancers, its involvement in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. Methods: The expression of NUDT21 in CRC and adjacent normal tissues was analyzed through qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, we investigated the correlation between NUDT21 expression and patient prognosis. With Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Transwell assay, we detected the exact role of NUDT21 in the development and progress of CRC. We used RNA-Seq analysis to explore the downstream target gene of NUDT21. Meanwhile, DaPars analysis revealed the Hippo pathway as a critical pathway in CRC progress. Western blotting and luciferase assays were used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which NUDT21 regulates the Hippo pathway. In addition, the interaction between NUDT21 and TAZ was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and the correlation between the two expressions was verified by IHC. Results: In CRC, elevated NUDT21 expression has been identified as a predictor of poor prognosis, as well as a promoter of CRC cell proliferation and migration. Combined with RNA-seq and DaPars analyses, we identified the Hippo pathway as an important downstream target of NUDT21 in CRC. NUDT21 knockdown significantly downregulated the YAP, TAZ, and TEAD1 protein levels. Mechanistically, shortening of the 3 ' UTR of TAZ by NUDT21 knockdown suppressed TAZ protein expression. A positive correlation was observed between NUDT21 and TAZ proteins in CRC. Conclusion: NUDT21 plays a pro-tumorigenic role in CRC by upregulating TAZ protein expression, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of the Hippo pathway and providing insight into the biological effect of mRNA 3 ' UTR shortening.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychological disorder with a complex pathophysiology and its pharmacotherapy is compromised by adverse side effects. Addressing the need for effective treatment for depression, the current study aims to characterize the antidepressant activity of oil extract derived from Aethoscytus foveolus, bugs that are widely available in India, in a mice model of stress-induced depression. Chemical moieties characterized by GC-MS of A. foveolus oil extract have shown good affinity for monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in-silico. In-vitro MAO-inhibitory assay using mouse brain homogenates also showed similar results at IC50 1.363 nM (R-2 = 0.981, SD +/- 0.05, n = 3) of it. These results encouraged us to investigate the antidepressant potential of this oil extract in vivo. Stress-exposed mice (Swiss Albino, either sex, 25-30 gm) were administered 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of oil extract and classified as separate groups (N = 6 per group). Behavioral tests like the forced-swim test, tail-suspension test, and open-field test demonstrated significant attenuation of stress-induced depressive-like behavior of mice by both doses (p < 0.0001 with positive control group i.e., stress group), while biochemical tests on mice brain tissues showed amelioration of stress-induced hyperactivation of MAO (p < 0.0001) and oxidative stress (by increasing Superoxide dismutase and catalase, while reducing lipid peroxidase and nitric oxide) (p < 0.0001). The altered mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (NF-kappa B, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) (p < 0.015) was also improved by this oil extract. In addition, histopathology of hippocampus tissues of mice supports that this oil recovers stress-mediated structural changes of the brain. In conclusion our findings suggest that oil derived from A. foveolus could be beneficial in the alleviation of stress-mediated depressive-like behavior of mice, and in our knowledge, this is the first report identifying anti-neurodegenerative potential of A. foveolus.

AB  - Background: Nudix Hydrolase 21 (NUDT21) is crucial for the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, with its reduced expression frequently resulting in a shortened mRNA 3 ' untranslated region (UTR), thereby enhancing the protein levels of downstream genes. Although NUDT21 is widely recognized for its tumor-suppressive function in various cancers, its involvement in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. Methods: The expression of NUDT21 in CRC and adjacent normal tissues was analyzed through qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, we investigated the correlation between NUDT21 expression and patient prognosis. With Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Transwell assay, we detected the exact role of NUDT21 in the development and progress of CRC. We used RNA-Seq analysis to explore the downstream target gene of NUDT21. Meanwhile, DaPars analysis revealed the Hippo pathway as a critical pathway in CRC progress. Western blotting and luciferase assays were used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which NUDT21 regulates the Hippo pathway. In addition, the interaction between NUDT21 and TAZ was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and the correlation between the two expressions was verified by IHC. Results: In CRC, elevated NUDT21 expression has been identified as a predictor of poor prognosis, as well as a promoter of CRC cell proliferation and migration. Combined with RNA-seq and DaPars analyses, we identified the Hippo pathway as an important downstream target of NUDT21 in CRC. NUDT21 knockdown significantly downregulated the YAP, TAZ, and TEAD1 protein levels. Mechanistically, shortening of the 3 ' UTR of TAZ by NUDT21 knockdown suppressed TAZ protein expression. A positive correlation was observed between NUDT21 and TAZ proteins in CRC. Conclusion: NUDT21 plays a pro-tumorigenic role in CRC by upregulating TAZ protein expression, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of the Hippo pathway and providing insight into the biological effect of mRNA 3 ' UTR shortening.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) is a common disease that occurs during human aging. Gastrodin (GAS) has potential benefits for the prevention and treatment of VD. In the present study, we investigated the effects of GAS on cognitive dysfunction in rats with VD induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and explored the underlying mechanism. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed that GAS attenuated hippocampal levels of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3), p62, and phosphorylated CaMKII (Ca2+-calmodulin stimulated protein kinase II) in VD rats. Additionally, our results revealed that cobalt chloride blocked autophagic flux in HT22 cells, which was confirmed by increased levels of LC3 and p62 when combined with chloroquine. Notably, GAS ameliorated the impaired autophagic flux. Furthermore, we confirmed that GAS combined with KN93 (a CaMKII inhibitor) or CaMKII knockdown did not impact the reduced p62 levels when compared with GAS treatment alone. Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that endogenous p62 bound to CaMKII, as confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis after the immunoprecipitation of p62 from HT22 cells. These findings revealed that GAS attenuated autophagic flux dysfunction by inhibiting the Ca2+/CaMKII signaling pathway to ameliorate cognitive impairment in VD.

AB  - The dietary ligands, omega-3 fatty acid endocannabinoids (eCBs) eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA) and docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate and butyrate, have anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their action in the human brain remain elusive. Here, we treated human hippocampal neurons (HPC0A07/03 C) with eCBs (EPEA (300 pM) or DHEA (700 pM)), or SCFAs (acetate (200 uM), propionate (30 uM), butyrate (20 uM)), followed by interleukin (IL)1 beta (10,000 pg/ml) or IL6 (50 pg/ml). We found that treatment with either eCBs or SCFAs prevented IL1 beta- and IL6-induced reduction in neurogenesis and increase in apoptosis. These effects were mediated by IL1 beta-induced production of IL6, interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and by IL6-induced IL1 beta, IL8 and IL13, all of which were prevented by treatment with eCBs. In contrast, IL1 beta-induced production of IL6, IL12 and fractalkine (CX3CL1), and IL6-induced production of CX3CL1, were prevented by SCFAs. Treatment with IL1 beta and IL6 also increased the production of candidate kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as kynurenine (KYN) and nicotinic acid (NICA), which again were prevented by eCBs and SCFAs. We then conducted mRNA sequencing analysis to investigate cellular genes and signalling pathways relevant for the neuro-inflammatory changes previously observed, and putatively prevented by eCB and SCFA treatment. We found that IL1 beta decreased the expression of the neuroplasticity gene, FRY microtubule binding gene (FRY), and increased the expression of the neuroinflammation gene, U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein homolog C subunit processome component (UTP14C), and both these effects were prevented by either acetate or propionate. Similarly, the expression of the proinflammatory gene, ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 1 (ADAMTS1), was increased by IL6, an effect that was prevented by either EPEA or acetate. Altogether, we identify novel anti-inflammatory and neurogenic mechanisms mediating the effect of eCBs and SCFAs on human hippocampal neurogenesis, which can be significant as potential future treatment candidates in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - This study was aimed to determine the neuroprotective influence of Stellaria media in terms of restoring normal state of the rat's hippocampus and cortex after oxidative insult caused by in vitro ischemia and reperfusion. Cell viability and membrane integrity were assessed using MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, respectively. Ischemic insult was introduced in the rat brain's hippocampal and cortical slivers by exposing oxygen and glucose deficiency (OGD) for 2 h, followed by 1 h of re-perfusion. Cellular oxidative stress levels were quantified by incorporating 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescent probes. Additionally, the lipid peroxidation was assessed using TBARS assay. Findings revealed significant neuro-protection against OGD-induced mitochondrial impairment at 40 mg/mL of S. media in rat's hippocampal and cortical slices. The LDH levels were decreased significantly (P < 0.001) during pre-incubation and reoxy-genation periods using varied concentrations of S. media extract. Cellular oxidative stress levels results showed significant (P < 0.001) reduction in dichlorofluorescein fluorescence in slices homogenate of hip-pocampus and cortex using S. media extract. The lipid peroxidation assay results showed decreased (P < 0.01) levels of malondialdehyde in liver tissues of treated rats treated (200 mg/kg body weight) when compared to the ischemic animal. In summary, findings clearly indicated the neuroprotective effects of extract against in vitro ischemia in brain hippocampal and cortex slivers. S. media could undoubtedly be utilized as a healing agent in preventing neuronal cells' loss during ischemic-reperfusion process. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Plasma membrane transformation (PMT) during early pregnancy (EP) is a widely observed phenomenon across species, but its role in cows remains understudied. Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) plays a vital role in human embryo implantation and uterine development. However, its relationship with PMT in bovine endometrium remains unclear. This study aims to explore the potential influence of YAP1 on PMT and the proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells. We observed PMT-related changes in the endometrium of cows during EP, characterized by reduced morphometry scores and increased fully developed pinopodes. The epithelial marker cadherin-1 (CDH1, also known as E-cadherin) expression decreased, while the mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) expression increased. Additionally, YAP1 expression was up-regulated and activated in the endometrial epithelium during EP. Interferon-tau (IFNT) potentially promoted PMT-related changes and activated YAP1. The knockdown of YAP1 diminished the effect of IFNT on PMT. At the same time, overexpression of YAP1 might enhance PMT-related changes and promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs). Our findings suggest that YAP1 is activated during EP and may regulate endometrial receptivity by promoting PMT and cell proliferation.

AB  - ADNP syndrome, involving the ADNP transcription factor of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although Adnp-haploinsufficient (Adnp-HT) mice display various phenotypic deficits, whether these mice display abnormal synaptic functions remain poorly understood. Here, we report synaptic plasticity deficits associated with cognitive inflexibility and CaMKIIa hyperactivity in Adnp-HT mice. These mice show impaired and inflexible contextual learning and memory, additional to social deficits, long after the juvenile-stage decrease of ADNP protein levels to similar to 10% of the newborn level. The adult Adnp-HT hippocampus shows hyperphosphorylated CaMKIIa and its substrates, including SynGAP1, and excessive long-term potentiation that is normalized by CaMKIIa inhibition. Therefore, Adnp haploinsufficiency in mice leads to cognitive inflexibility involving CaMKIIa hyperphosphorylation and excessive LTP in adults long after its marked expressional decrease in juveniles.

AB  - Neuronal cultures provide a basis for reductionist insights that rely on molecular and pharmacological manipulation. However, the inability to culture mature adult CNS neurons limits our understanding of adult neuronal physiology. Here, we report methods for culturing adult central nervous system neurons in large numbers and across multiple brain regions for extended time periods. Primary adult neuronal cultures develop polarity; they establish segregated dendritic and axonal compartments, maintain resting membrane potentials, exhibit spontaneous and evoked electrical activity, and form neural networks. Cultured adult neurons isolated from different brain regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum exhibit distinct cell morphologies, growth patterns, and spontaneous firing characteristics reflective of their regions of origin. Using adult motor cortex cultures, we identify a CNS "conditioning "effect after spinal cord injury.

AB  - Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.)-derived drugs have shown their potential in biomedical applications. The seed of A. hippocastanum contains various kinds of chemical compounds including phenolics, flavonoids, coumarins, and triterpene saponins. Here, we investigated the chemical components in A. hippocastanum L. grown in Uzbekistan, which has not yet been studied in detail. We identified 30 kinds of triterpene saponins in an extract of A. hippocastanum L. Classifying extracted saponins into eight fractions, we next studied the hypoglycemic and the anti-inflammatory activities of escin and its derivatives through in vivo experiments. We came by data indicating the highest (SF-1 and SF-2) and the lowest (SF-5 and SF-8) antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects of those eight fractions. These results imply the prospective use of A. hippocastanum L. grown in Uzbekistan in the production of pharmaceutical drugs to treat diabetes and inflammation.

AB  - Depression is the fourth leading cause of death due to suicides every year according to WHO. Various adverse effects are associated with many of the available antidepressants due to the irreversible nature of these drugs. So, it is worthwhile to explore the natural phytoconstituents as an alternative therapy for the treatment of depression-dependent symptoms. Computational chemistry provides a cost-effective method to explore or develop new therapies for various diseases through in silico studies. In this study, multitargeting antidepressant potential of Camellia sinensis is explored via docking and binding interaction studies with monoamine oxidase-A enzyme, serotonin, and dopamine receptors involved in depression as targets. All the selected phytoconstituents were evaluated for drug-likeliness properties using Swiss ADME. Among all the selected phytoconstituents, Theasinensin, and Theaflavin-3-gallate were found to have best affinities with all the selected targets under investigation and can be considered as promising lead molecules for the development of novel antidepressants. Molecular dynamics simulations assessed the binding affinity of four compounds to Human Monoamine Oxidase A. All compounds showed potential, with Theaflavin-3-gallate and Theasinesin displaying the strongest binding. This suggests their potential for modulating enzyme activity and potential relevance in depression treatment.

AB  - Neurosteroids are steroids produced by endocrine glands and subsequently entering the brain, and also include steroids synthesis in the brain. It has been widely known that neurosteroids influence many neurological functions, including neuronal signaling, synaptic adaptations, and neuroprotective effects. In addition, abnormality in the synthesis and function of neurosteroids has been closely linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ), and epilepsy. Given their important role in brain pathophysiology and disorders, neurosteroids offer potential therapeutic targets for a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, and that therapeutic strategies targeting neurosteroids probably exert beneficial effects. We therefore summarized the role of neurosteroids in brain physiology and neuropsychiatric disorders, and introduced the recent findings of synthetic neurosteroid analogues for potential treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, thereby providing insights for further research in the future.

AB  - Deep-brain Magnetic Stimulation (DMS) is a noninvasive brain modulation method that improves hippocampal neural activity. The frequency of DMS has a significant effect on the hippocampal induced electric field. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between stimulation frequency and DMS-induced hippocampal electric field. The frequency sensitivity and distribution uniformity of the hippocampal electric field are calculated to quantify this relationship. The results show that the DMS-induced hippocampal electric field has a frequency-dependent property. The frequency sensitivity of the DMS-induced hippocampal electric field in the high frequency band is lower than that in the low frequency band, which corresponds to the low-pass filtering property of the neuron membrane. The frequency sensitivity of DMS-induced hippocampal electric field is highest in the range of 30-40 Hz. The uniformity of the hippocampal electric field induced by a single coil also reaches the highest in the range of 30-40 Hz, while uniformity of the hippocampal electric field induced by multiple-coil increases with increasing frequency. The frequency-dependent property of the DMS-induced hippocampal electric field is positively correlated with the quantity and size of coils, while negatively correlated with the spacing of the coils. This study is of great help in the selection of DMS frequencies and the design of coils.

TI  - Structural inequality linked to brain volume and network dynamics in aging and dementia across the Americas
T2  - NATURE AGING
LA  - English
AB  - Structural inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities, influences health outcomes. However, the biological embedding of structural inequality in aging and dementia, especially among underrepresented populations, is unclear. We examined the association between structural inequality (country-level and state-level Gini indices) and brain volume and connectivity in 2,135 healthy controls, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobe degeneration from Latin America and the United States. Greater structural inequality was linked to reduced brain volume and connectivity, with stronger effects in Latin America, especially in the temporo-cerebellar, fronto-thalamic and hippocampal regions. In the United States, milder effects were observed in the insular-cingular and temporal areas. Results were more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease and were independent of age, sex, education, cognition and other confounding factors. The findings highlight the critical role of structural inequality in aging and dementia, emphasizing the biological embedding of macrosocial factors and the need for targeted interventions in underserved populations.

AB  - Lead (Pb), a dense, soft, blue-gray metal, is widely used in metallurgy, cables, storage batteries, pigments, and other industrial applications. Pb has been shown to cause degenerative changes in the nervous system. Necroptosis, a form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death modality, is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Whether the TNF-R1-RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway is involved in the neurodegeneration induced by Pb has yet to be determined. Here, we explored the role of the TNF-R1-RIPK1/RIPK3 signaling pathway in the Pb-induced necroptosis by using HT-22 cells, primary mouse hippocampal neurons, and C57BL/6 mice models, demonstrating that Pb exposure elevated lead levels in murine whole blood and hippocampal tissue in a dose-response relationship. Protein expression levels of PARP, c-PARP, RIPK1, p-RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and p-MLKL in the hippocampal tissues were elevated, while the protein expression of caspase-8 was decreased. Furthermore, Pb exposure reduced the survival rates in HT-22 cells and primary mouse hippocampal neurons, while increasing the protein expressions of RIPK1 and p-MLKL. Collectively, these novel findings suggest that the TNF-R1/RIPK1/RIPK3 signaling pathway is associated with Pb-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons in mice.

AB  - The study aimed to explore the influence of Dexmedetomidine (Dex) on cognitive function and inflammatory factors in rats after cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). For this purpose, 30 healthy male SD rats were reared in a quiet and clean environment with alternating light for 12 hours. They were rolled randomly into 3 groups, each with 10 rats, namely the control (Ctrl) group, the experimental group, and the Dex group. The rats in the Ctrl were not treated, and the rats in the experimental group were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mu g/kg saline. After that, cardiac surgery was performed under CPB. Rats in the Dex group were injected with 50 mu g/kg Dex intraperitoneally and underwent cardiac surgery under CPB. The Morris water maze (MWM) experiment was performed to test the learning and memory abilities and spatial positioning abilities of SD rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA method) was adopted to detect the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-113. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was applied to determine the mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-113 in the hippocampus. Results showed that in the MWM experiment, in contrast with the Ctrl, the escape latency of the experimental group and the Dex group after surgery were prolonged (P<0.05), and the times they crossed platforms reduced (P<0.05). In contrast with the experimental group, the escape latency of the Dex group shortened, and the times they crossed platforms increased. ELISA suggested that in contrast with the experimental group, the concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-113 in the Ctrl decreased (P<0.05), and those in the Dex group decreased slightly. In the fluorescence quantitative PCR experiment, in contrast with the experimental group, the mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-113 in the Ctrl increased, and those in the Dex group decreased slightly. Then Dex can improve the cognitive dysfunction of rats undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB, and its molecular mechanism may be to reduce the inflammation around the heart and hippocampus.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of precursor pH (1.3, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via a green synthesis approach using an aqueous extract of green tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves. The formation of AuNPs was monitored using UV-vis spectrophotometry and confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results confirmed that the morphology and size of the AuNPs are strongly dependent on the pH of the reaction medium. Based on spectral features, the color of the colloids, and TEM analysis, the synthesized samples were classified into three groups. The first (pH 8 and 10) contained predominantly spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of similar to 18 nm, the second (pH 1.3 and 2) contained different shaped nanoparticles (20-250 nm in diameter), and the third (pH 4 and 6) contained flower-like nanostructures with a mean diameter of similar to 60 nm. UV-vis analysis revealed good stability of all AuNP colloids, except at pH 1.3, where a significant decrease in absorbance intensity over time was observed. These findings confirm that tuning the precursor pH allows for controlled manipulation of nanoparticle morphology and stability in green synthesis systems.

AB  - Adult Neural stem cells (NSCs)/Neural Progenitor cells (NPCs) are known to play an important role in creating new neurons and glial cells. The self-renewal, multipotent abilities of NSCs are attributed to several of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Insulin is an important neuromodulator, particularly influencing neural survival, memory, and energy homeostasis. Insulin receptor is expressed in the adult NSC niche and also induces neurogenesis and gliogenesis and may be affected by neurotrophins. Neurotrophins have been demonstrated to play an active role in NSC differentiation into neurons and glial cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), both have significant roles in hippocampal plasticity and long-term potentiation events. However, the crosstalk between insulin and neurotrophic signaling pathways is still unclear and requires studies to understand brain development in insulin resistance conditions. Preliminary data from the current study suggest that insulin receptor is involved in regulating the transcript levels of neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF) and Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB and p75NTR). It is also able to regulate the secretion of BDNF by neural stem cells. In addition, the data from the present study also reveal insulin receptor knockdown significantly altered the expression levels of key early brain cell type development markers such as PDGFR-alpha, GFAP, and Tuj1, which further confirms the essential role of crosstalk between insulin receptor and neurotrophins in brain development in regard to neural stem cell differentiation.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a class of toxic compounds which has been widely used in agriculture that can cause multiorgan damage to the liver, kidneys, testes, and nervous system. Currently, most studies on ginseng have concentrated on the roots and rhizomes, and less research has been conducted on the above-ground parts. Our laboratory found that ginseng stem and leaf total saponin (GSLS) features strong antioxidant activity. In this experiment, we selected different concentrations of CPF to induce hippocampal neuronal cell injury model in mice, conducted a cell survival screening test, and also selected appropriate concentrations of CPF to induce brain injury model in mice. CCK-8, flow cytometry, Elisa, Hoechst 33258 staining, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, HE staining, Morris water maze, and qRT-PCR were adopted for detecting the effects of GSLS treatment on CPFinduced cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, Ca2+ concentration and GSLS treatment on CPF-induced brain injury and related signaling in mice, respectively. The effects of GSLS treatment on CPF-induced brain injury and the related signaling pathways in mice were examined. The results showed that GSLS at 60 mu g/ml and 125 mu g/ml concentrations elevated the viability of CPF-induced HT22 cells, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, depleted ROS, decreased Ca2+ concentration, and decreased apoptosis rate. Meanwhile, GSLS treatment significantly reduced CPF-induced escape latency in mice, elevated the number of entries into the plateau and effective area, increased the effective area and target quadrant residence time, as well as improved the pathological damage of mouse hippocampal neurons. The results of mouse brain sections demonstrated that GSLS treatment significantly increased SOD and CAT activities and lowered MDA accumulation in CPF-induced mice. qRT-PCR revealed that PTEN mRNA expression was significantly decreased with PI3K and AKT expression being significantly increased in GSLS-treated CPF-induced mice. Thus, the obtained results indicate that GSLS can effectively antagonize CPF-induced brain toxicity in mice through regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - Hippocampal oxidative stress has a vital role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated behavioral deficits. Ecdysterone (Ecdy), a natural product and primary steroid hormone, exhibits anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as an effective method for improving physiological brain functions. The present study was designed to investigate the comparative effects of separate and combined HIIT and Ecdy treatment on behavioral functions, hippocampal oxidative status, histological changes in an amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced rat model of AD. Adult male rats were treated simultaneously with HIIT exercise and Ecdy (10 mg/kg/day; P.O.), starting ten days after A beta-injection, and they continued for eight consecutive weeks. At the end of the treatment course, the behavioral functions of the rats were assessed by commonly-used behavioral paradigms. Subsequently, brain samples were collected for histological analysis and hippocampus samples were collected for biochemical analysis. Results illustrated that Ap injection impaired learning and memory performances in both novel object recognition and Barnes maze tests, reduced exploratory/locomotor activities in open field test, enhanced anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus-maze (P < 0.05). These behavioral deficits accompanied hippocampal oxidative stress (decreased total antioxidant capacity content and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity, increased total oxidant status and malondialdehyde level) and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in H&E staining (P <0.05). HIIT and Ecdy improved anxiety-like behavior, attenuated total oxidant status and malondialdehyde, and prevented the neuronal loss (P < 0.05). However, their combination resulted in a more complete and powerful improvement in all the above-mentioned Ap-related deficits (P < 0.05). Overall, these data provide evidence that a combination of HIIT and Ecdy treatment improves A beta-induced behavioral deficits, possibly through ameliorating hippocampal oxidative status and preventing neuronal loss.

AB  - The cell-adhesion proteins neuroligin-3 and neuroligin-4X (NLGN3/4X) have well described roles in synapse formation. NLGN3/4X are also expressed highly during neurodevelopment. However, the role these proteins play during this period is unknown. Here we show that NLGN3/4X localized to the leading edge of growth cones where it promoted neuritogenesis in immature human neurons. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that NLGN3/4X clustering induced growth cone enlargement and influenced actin filament organization. Critically, these morphological effects were not induced by autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-associated NLGN3/4X variants. Finally, actin regulators p21-activated kinase 1 and cofilin were found to be activated by NLGN3/4X and involved in mediating the effects of these adhesion proteins on actin filaments, growth cones and neuritogenesis. These data reveal a novel role for NLGN3 and NLGN4X in the development of neuronal architecture, which may be altered in the presence of ASD-associated variants.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury, including ischemia. Ras-related nuclear protein (RAN), a member of the Ras superfamily, involves in a variety of biological roles, such as cell division, proliferation, and signal transduction. Although RAN reveals antioxidant effect, its precise neuroprotective mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of RAN on HT-22 cell which were exposed to H2O2-induced oxidative stress and ischemia animal model by using the cell permeable Tat-RAN fusion protein. We showed that Tat-RAN transduced into HT-22 cells, and markedly inhibited cell death, DNA fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under oxidative stress. This fusion protein also controlled cellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), NF-kappa B, and apoptosis (Caspase-3, p53, Bax and Bcl-2). In the cerebral forebrain ischemia animal model, Tat-RAN significantly inhibited both neuronal cell death, and astrocyte and microglia activation. These results indicate that RAN significantly protects against hippocampal neuronal cell death, suggesting Tat-RAN will help to develop the therapies for neuronal brain diseases including ischemic injury.

AB  - Vps35 (vacuolar protein sorting 35), a key component of retromer, plays a crucial role in selective retrieval of transmembrane proteins from endosomes to trans-Golgi networks. Dysfunctional Vps35/retromer is a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Vps35 is highly expressed in developing pyramidal neurons, both in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus, Although embryonic neuronal Vps35's function in promoting neuronal terminal differentiation and survival is evident, it remains unclear whether and how neuronal Vps35 communicates with other types of brain cells, such as blood vessels (BVs), which are essential for supplying nutrients to neurons. Dysfunctional BVs contribute to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we provide evidence for embryonic neuronal Vps35 as critical for BV branching and maturation in the developing mouse brain. Selectively knocking out (KO) Vps35 in mouse embryonic, not postnatal, neurons results in reductions in BV branching and density, arteriole diameter, and BV-associated pericytes and microglia but an increase in BV-associated reactive astrocytes. Deletion of microglia by PLX3397 enhances these BV deficits in mutant mice. These results reveal the function of neuronal Vps35 in neurovascular coupling in the developing mouse brain and implicate BV-associated microglia as underlying this event.

AB  - Background: Due to the rising cases of treatment-refractory affective disorders, the discovery of newer therapeutic approaches is needed. In recent times, probiotics have garnered notable attention in managing stress-related disorders. Herein, we examined the effect of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 (R) probiotic on anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes employing maternal separation (MS) and chronic-unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in rats.Methods: Both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MS + CUMS. Probiotic treatment was provided for 6 weeks via drinking water. Anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes were assessed using sucrosepreference test (SPT), forced-swimming test (FST), elevated-plus maze test (EPM), and open-field test (OFT). Blood, brain, intestine, and fecal samples were obtained for biochemical and molecular studies.Results: Stress-exposed rats drank less sucrose solution, showed increased passivity, and explored less in openarms in SPT, FST, and EPM, respectively. These stress-generated neurobehavioral aberrations were alleviated by 6-week of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 treatment. The overall locomotor activity in OFT remained unchanged. The decreased levels of BDNF and serotonin and increased levels of C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and dopamine, in the hippocampus and/or frontal cortex of stress-exposed rats were reversed following probiotic treatment. Administration of probiotic also restored the systemic levels of L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, kynurenic-acid, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, villi/crypt ratio, goblet-cell count, Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio, and levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in fecal samples. These results indicate remodeling of the microbiome gut-brain axis in Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 recipient rats. However, protein levels of doublecortin, GFAP, and zona occludens in the hippocampus and occludin-immunoreactivity in the intestine remained unchanged. No prominent sex-specific changes were noted.Conclusion: Anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 in MS + CUMS rat model may be mediated via reshaping the microbiome gut-brain axis.

AB  - The potential harmful effects of polypharmacy (concurrent use of 5 or more drugs) are difficult to investigate in an experimental design in humans. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge on sex-specific differences on the outcomes of multiple-drug use. The present study aims to investigate the effects of an eight-week exposure to a regimen of five different medications (metoprolol, paracetamol, aspirin, simvastatin and citalopram) in young adult female mice. Polypharmacy-treated animals showed significant impairment in object recognition and fear associated contextual memory, together with a significant reduction of certain hippocampal proteins involved in pathways necessary for the consolidation of these types of memories, compared to animals with standard diet. The impairments in explorative behavior and spatial memory that we reported previously in young adult male mice administered the same polypharmacy regimen were not observed in females in the current study. Therefore, the same combination of medications induced different negative outcomes in young adult male and female mice, causing a significant deficit in non-spatial memory in female animals. Overall, this study strongly supports the importance of considering sex-specific differences in designing safer and targeted multiple-drug therapies.

AB  - MPDZ also named MUPP1 is involved in signal transduction mediated by the formation of protein complexes. However, the expression regulation, clinical significance, potential function, and mechanism of this gene in lung cancer remain unclear. Methylation status of MPDZ was measured by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic value of MPDZ. The tumor suppressing effects of MPDZ were determined in vitro and in vivo. The target molecules and signaling pathway that mediated the function of MPDZ were also identified. MPDZ methylation was identified in 61.2% of primary lung cancer tissues and most lung cancer cell lines but not in normal lung tissues. MPDZ expression was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues and negatively associated with DNA hypermethylation, and attenuated MPDZ expression predicted a poor outcome. Furthermore, MPDZ overexpression prominently dampened cell growth, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Conversely, MPDZ knockdown promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MPDZ deficiency promotes tumor metastasis and reduces the survival of MPDZ knockout mice. Importantly, MPDZ promotes tumor suppressor ability that depends on the Hippo pathway-mediated repression of YAP. MPDZ activates the phosphorylation of YAP (Ser127) and inhibits YAP expression through stabilizing MST1 and interaction with LATS1. We first identified and validated that MPDZ methylation and expression could be a good diagnostic marker and independent prognostic factor for lung cancer. MPDZ functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through regulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

AB  - The developmental failures occurring between blastocyst hatching and implantation in farm ungulates are a major cause of pregnancy losses. At the expanded blastocyst stage, three cell lineages emerge in the embryo: trophoblast, hypoblast and epiblast, the latter being the most vulnerable during post-hatching development. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF13) signaling pathway is involved in hypoblast and epiblast development; however, previous in vitro functional studies are limited to the expanded blas-tocyst stage. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of TGF13 inhibition with 10, 20 or 40 mu M SB431542 during ovine post-hatching developmental period using a recently developed culture system able to recapitulate major developmental landmarks. We have found a negative effect of TGF13 inhibition on hypoblast and epiblast development that could be partially reverted by Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular networks regulating embryo development beyond the expanded blastocyst and could help to elucidate the causes of early pregnancy losses in farm ungulates.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is caused by lipid peroxidation. Noteworthily, accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation are found in the proximity of the neuritic plaque, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the relationship between ferroptosis and neuroinflammation in AD is unclear. Silibinin, extracted from the Silybum marianum, is possibly developed as an agent for AD treatment from its neuroprotective effect, but the effect of silibinin on sporadic AD that accounts for more than 95% of AD remains unclear. To determine whether silibinin alleviates the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and investigate the underlying mechanisms, STZ-treated HT22 murine hippocampal neurons and intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rats, a sporadic AD model, were used in this study. Results show that silibinin not only promotes survival of STZ-treated HT22 cells, but also ameliorates the cognitive impairment and anxiety/depression-like behavior of ICV-STZ rats. We here demonstrate that silibinin evidently inhibits the protein level of p53 as well as upregulates the protein level of cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 and ferroptosis inhibitor GPX4, but not p21, leading to the protection against STZ-induced ferroptotic damage. Immunofluorescent staining also shows that accumulation of lipid peroxidation induced by ferroptotic damage leads to increased fluorescence of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8OHDG), a maker of oxidized DNA. The oxidized DNA then leaks to the cytoplasm and upregulates the expression of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING), which triggers the production of IFN-& beta; and other inflammatory cascades including NF-& kappa;B/TNF & alpha; and NLRP3/caspase 1/IL-1 & beta;. However, the treatment with silibinin blocks the above pathological changes. Moreover, in HT22 cells with/without STZ treatment, GPX4-knockdown increases the protein level of STING, indicating that the ferroptotic damage leads to the activation of STING signaling pathway. These results imply that silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect on an STZ-induced sporadic AD model by downregulating ferroptotic damage and thus the downstream STING-mediated neuroinflammation.

AB  - Background: Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein is predominantly expressed in excitatory glutamatergic neurons of vertebrates, where it plays a pivotal role in regulation of synaptic plasticity. Arc protein forms capsid-like particles, which can encapsulate and transfer mRNA in extracellular vesicles (EVs) between hippocampal neurons. Once glioma cell networks actively interact with neurons via paracrine signaling and formation of neurogliomal glutamatergic synapses, we predicted the involvement of Arc in a process of EV-mediated mRNA transfer between glioma cells.Materials and methods: Arc expression in three human glioma cell lines was evaluated by WB and immunocy-tochemistry. The properties of Arc protein/mRNA-containing EVs produced by glioma cells were analyzed by RT-PCR, TEM, and WB. Flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and fluorescent microscopy were used to show the involvement of Arc in EV-mediated mRNA transfer between glioma cells.Results: It was found that human glioma cells can produce EVs containing Arc/Arg3.1 protein and Arc mRNA (or "Arc EVs"). Arc EVs from U87 glioma cells internalize and deliver Arc mRNA to recipient U87 cells, where it is translated into a protein. Arc overexpression significantly increases EV production, alters EV morphology, and enhances intercellular transfer of highly expressed mRNA in glioma cell culture.Conclusion: These findings indicate involvement of Arc EVs into mRNA transfer between glioma cells that could contribute to tumor progression and affect synaptic plasticity in cancer patients.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that the activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome contributes to the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Astrocytes, the homeostatic cells of the central nervous system are intimately involved into pathophysiology of various mental disorders including PTSD. We demonstrated previously that leptin exerts neuroprotection and ameliorates chronic sleep deprivation-induced depressive-like behaviours. Here, we extended the study of therapeutic effects of leptin to PTSD model mice. We discovered that PTSD is associated with significant activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in astrocytes sorted from GFAP-GFP transgenic mice, while administration of leptin markedly suppressed the activation of astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome. Leptin effectively improved PTSD-associated behavioural alterations including fear memory, cognitive impairments, and depressive-like behaviours. Therapeutic effects of leptin were mediated by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in astrocytes. In addition, the PTSD-related activation of NLRP3 inflammasome impairs astrocytic mitochondria suppressing ATP synthesis and leading to an increased ROS production. Leptin reversed mitochondrial inhibition by stimulating STAT3 in astrocytes. We propose leptin as a novel candidate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction closely associated with mortality in the acute phase of sepsis. Abnormal neurotransmitters release, such as glutamate, plays a crucial role in the pathological mechanism of SAE. Munc18-1 is a key protein regulating neurotransmission. However, whether Munc18-1 plays a role in SAE by regulating glutamate transmission is still unclear. In this study, a septic rat model was established by the cecal ligation and perforation. We found an increase in the content of glutamate in the hippocampus of septic rat, the number of synaptic vesicles in the synaptic active area and the expression of the glutamate receptor NMDAR1. Meanwhile, it was found that the expressions of Munc18-1, Syntaxin1A and Synaptophysin increased, which are involved in neurotransmission. The expression levels of Syntaxin1A and Synaptophysin in hippocampus of septic rats decreased after interference using Munc18-1siRNA. We observed a decrease in the content of glutamate in the hippocampus of septic rats, the number of synaptic vesicles in the synaptic activity area and the expression of NMDAR1. Interestingly, it was also found that the down-regulation of Munc18-1 improved the vital signs of septic rats. This study shows that CLP induced the increased levels of glutamate in rat hippocampus, and Munc18-1 may participate in the process of hippocampal injury in septic rats by affecting the levels of glutamate via regulating Syntaxin1A and Synaptophysin.

AB  - A total of 12 new compounds, named fuscoposides A-L (1-12), including 2 phenolic, 9 benzenoid, and 1 phenylethanoid glucosides, were isolated from the mangrove endophytic fungus Fuscoporia sp. A2A6. The structures of these compounds were established by HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic data, single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis, and chemical methods. Most notably, 10 compounds, namely, fuscoposides A-I (1-9) and fuscoposide L (12), are mono- or di-chlorinated. Fuscoposide C (3) exhibited moderate neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in mouse hippocampal neuron HT-22 cells in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration range of 2.0-6.0 mu M, whereas fuscoposide G (7) decreased the expression of COX2 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse microglia BV2 cells at the concentration of 5.0 mu M, thereby displaying anti-inflammatory activity.

AB  - Propofol, a commonly used anesthetic, is known to cause postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), particularly after prolonged or high-dose administration. Its effects on neural remodeling in the hippocampal region, which is vital for cognitive function, remain poorly understood. This study employs single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-throughput transcriptomic analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which propofol impairs hippocampal neural remodeling. Our findings indicate that propofol suppresses the (5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 1A/Glutamate Receptor 2/Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1) HTR1A/GRIA2/PIK3R1 signaling pathway, contributing to cognitive dysfunction in mice. In vitro experiments reveal that propofol treatment reduces the expression of HTR1A/GRIA2/PIK3R1-related factors, decreases neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, and increases apoptosis and inflammation. In vivo experiments demonstrate significant impairments in spatial memory and learning abilities in mice treated with propofol. These results provide new insights into the long-term effects of anesthetic drugs and offer a scientific basis for their judicious use in clinical practice. The study highlights potential strategies and targets for preventing and treating POCD, emphasizing the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced cognitive dysfunction.image

The structural and morphological characteristics of the resulting materials were determined using several techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The maximum removal efficiency of methylene blue (MB) by BNPs Fe/Ni and Fe/Cu materials was found to be 88.60% and 91.06%, respectively, at a concentration of MB = 25 mg.l(-1) and 25 degrees C. According to the results of the kinetic modeling study, the adsorption process of MB on the two BNPs materials followed second-order kinetics, with the maximum adsorption capacities of MB on Fe/Ni and Fe/Cu BNPs being 26.94 mg.g(-1)and 28.00 mg.g(-1), respectively.

KW  - ADULT
KW  - HALLMARKS
AB  - Gradual cognition decline and mitochondrial dysfunction are two notable changes closely associated with aging. Enhancing mitochondrial function has been assumed to be antiaging. However, most current mitochondria-promoting agents usually target 1-2 aspects of mitochondrial function. In the present study, we transplanted mitochondria isolated from young mice into the hippocampus of aged mice, which presumably boost mitochondrial function more thoroughly, examined the effects on cognition, and explored the possible underlying mechanism. Our data showed that exogenous mitochondria were efficiently internalized by nestin-positive neural progenitors in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial transplantation quickly increased ATP levels, enhanced the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV, and decreased Tom20 expression in the hippocampus. In regard of cognitive function, mitochondria-treated mice displayed a remarkable improvement of novel object recognition and spatial memory. Utilizing the Wnt signaling reporting mouse line, TOPGAL mice, we detected activated canonical Wnt signaling in the neural progenitors of the mitochondria-treated hippocampus. Further, BrdU labeling showed that exogenous mitochondria significantly stimulated neural progenitor neurogenesis and proliferation. Taken together, our data demonstrated that exogenous mitochondria from young mice might be a novel way of rejuvenating the function of hippocampal neural progenitors to exert antiaging effects.

AB  - KRM-II-81 (1) is an imidazodiazepine GABA(A) receptor (GABAAR) potentiator with broad antiseizure efficacy and a low sedative burden. A brominated analogue, DS-II-73 (5), was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized as a potential backup compound as KRM-II-81 moves forward into development. The synthesis from 2-amino-5-bromophenyl)-(pyridin-2yl)-methanone (6) was processed in five steps with an overall yield of 38% and without the need for a palladium catalyst. GABAAR binding occurred with a K- i of 150 nM, and only 3 of 41 screened binding sites produced inhibition >= 50% at 10 mu M, and the potency to induce cytotoxicity was >= 240 mM. DS-II-73 was selective for alpha 2/3/5- over that of alpha 1-containing GABAARs. Oral exposure of plasma and brain of rats was more than sufficient to functionally impact GABAARs. Tonic convulsions in mice and lethality induced by pentylenetetrazol were suppressed by DS-II-73 after oral administration and latencies to clonic and tonic seizures were prolonged. Cortical slice preparations from a patient with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (mesial temporal lobe) showed decreases in the frequency of local field potentials by DS-II-73. As with KRM-II-81, the motor-impairing effects of DS-II-73 were low compared to diazepam. Molecular docking studies of DS-II-73 with the alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2L-configured GABAAR showed low interaction with alpha 1His102 that is suggested as a potential molecular mechanism for its low sedative side effects. These findings support the viability of DS-II-73 as a backup molecule for its ethynyl analogue, KRM-II-81, with the human tissue data providing translational credibility.

AB  - Hippo signaling pathway and its effector YAP have been recognized as an essential growth regulator during embryonic development. Hippo has been studied in different contexts; nevertheless, its role during chick lung branching morphogenesis remains unknown. Therefore, this work aims to determine Hippo role during early pulmonary organogenesis in the avian animal model. The current study describes the spatial distribution of Hippo signaling members in the embryonic chick lung by in situ hybridization. Overall, their expression is comparable to their mammalian counterparts. Moreover, the expression levels of phosphorylated-YAP (pYAP) and total YAP revealed that Hippo signaling is active in the embryonic chick lung. Furthermore, the presence of pYAP in the cytoplasm demonstrated that the Hippo machinery distribution is maintained in this tissue. In vitro studies were performed to assess the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in lung branching. Lung explants treated with a YAP/TEAD complex inhibitor (verteporfin) displayed a significant reduction in lung size and branching and decreased expression of ctgf (Hippo target gene) compared to the control. This approach also revealed that Hippo seems to modulate the expression of key molecular players involved in lung branching morphogenesis (sox2, sox9, axin2, and gli1). Conversely, when treated with dobutamine, an upstream regulator that promotes YAP phosphorylation, explant morphology was not severely affected. Overall, our data indicate that Hippo machinery is present and active in the early stages of avian pulmonary branching and that YAP is likely involved in the regulation of lung growth.

AB  - Aging compromises brain function leading to cognitive decline. A cyclic ketogenic diet (KD) improves memory in aged mice after long-term administration; however, short-term effects later in life and the molecular mechanisms that govern such changes remain unclear. Here, we explore the impact of a short-term KD treatment starting at elderly stage on brain function of aged mice. Behavioral testing and long-term potentiation (LTP) recordings reveal that KD improves working memory and hippocampal LTP. Furthermore, the synaptosome proteome of aged mice fed a KD long-term evidence changes predominantly at the presynaptic compartment associated to the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. These findings were corroborated in vivo by western blot analysis, with high BDNF abundance and PKA substrate phosphorylation. Overall, we show that a KD modifies brain function even when it is administered later in life and recapitulates molecular features of longterm administration, including the PKA signaling pathway, thus promoting synaptic plasticity at advanced age.

AB  - The seeds of Camellia oleifera produce high amount of oil, which can be broadly used in the fields of food, industry, and medicine. However, the molecular regulation mechanisms of seed development and oil accumulation in C. oleifera are unclear. In this study, evolutionary and expression analyses of the MADS-box gene family were performed across the C. oleifera genome for the first time. A total of 86 MADS-box genes (ColMADS) were identified, including 60 M-type and 26 MIKC members. More gene duplication events occurred in M-type subfamily (6) than that in MIKC subfamily (2), and SEP-like genes were lost from the MIKCC clade. Furthermore, 8, 15, and 17 differentially expressed ColMADS genes (DEGs) were detected between three developmental stages of seed (S1/S2, S2/S3, and S1/S3), respectively. Among these DEGs, the STK-like ColMADS12 and TT16-like ColMADS17 were highly expressed during the seed formation (S1 and S2), agreeing with their predicted functions to positively regulate the seed organogenesis and oil accumulation. While ColMADS57 and ColMADS07 showed increasing expression level with the seed maturation (S2 and S3), conforming to their potential roles in promoting the seed ripening. In all, these results revealed a critical role of MADS-box genes in the C. oleifera seed development and oil accumulation, which will contribute to the future molecular breeding of C. oleifera.

AB  - Blood-borne factors are essential to maintain neuronal synaptic plasticity and cognitive resilience throughout life. One such factor is osteocalcin (OCN), a hormone produced by osteoblasts that influences multiple physiological processes, including hippocampal neuronal homeostasis. However, the mechanism through which this blood-borne factor communicates with neurons remains unclear. Here we show the importance of a core primary cilium (PC) protein-autophagy axis in mediating the effects of OCN. We found that the OCN receptor GPR158 is present at the PC of hippocampal neurons and mediates the regulation of autophagy machinery by OCN. During aging, autophagy and PC core proteins are reduced in neurons, and restoring their levels is sufficient to improve cognitive impairments in aged mice. Mechanistically, the induction of this axis by OCN is dependent on the PC-dependent cAMP response element-binding protein signaling pathway. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the PC-autophagy axis is a gateway to mediate communication between blood-borne factors and neurons, and it advances understanding of the mechanisms involved in age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - The gut microbiome modulates seizure susceptibility and the anti-seizure effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) in animal models, but whether these relationships translate to KD therapies for human epilepsy is unclear. We find that the clinical KD alters gut microbial function in children with refractory epilepsy. Colonizing mice with KD-associated microbes promotes seizure resistance relative to matched pre-treatment controls. Select metagenomic and metabolomic features, including those related to anaplerosis, fatty acid b-oxidation, and amino acid metabolism, are seen with human KD therapy and preserved upon microbiome transfer to mice. Mice colonized with KD-associated gut microbes exhibit altered hippocampal transcriptomes, including pathways related to ATP synthesis, glutathione metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation, and are linked to susceptibility genes identified in human epilepsy. Our findings reveal key microbial functions that are altered by KD therapies for pediatric epilepsy and linked to microbiome-induced alterations in brain gene expression and seizure protection in mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the socially significant pathologies for which there is still no effective therapy. The aim of this work was to analyze the effectiveness of intravenous administration of exosomes obtained from the cultural fluid of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from the Wharton jelly of the human umbilical cord. Exosomes were isolated by column filtration in a gravitational field and characterized by size, number, expression of specific markers, and in vitro binding to mouse fibroblasts L929. On a model of sporadic AD, it was shown that intravenous administration of exosomes prevented the deterioration of spatial memory in olfactory bulbectomized mice (OBX). Visualization of fluorescently labeled exosomes in the cortex and hippocampus after their intravenous administration indicates that the therapeutic effect could be due to the ability of exosomes to enter the brain of OBX animals.

AB  - Episodic memories formed in early childhood rapidly decay, but their latent traces remain stored long term. These memories require the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and seem to undergo a developmental critical period. It remains to be determined whether the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), a major mechanism of critical periods, contributes to memory development. Here, we show that episodic infantile learning significantly increases the levels of parvalbumin in the dHPC 48 h after training. Chemogenetic inhibition of PVIs before learning indicated that these neurons are required for infantile memory formation. A bilateral dHPC injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist diazepam after training elicited long-term memory expression in infant rats, although direct PVI chemogenetic activation had no effect. Finally, PVI activity was required for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent maturation of memory competence, i.e., adult-like long-term memory expression. Thus, dHPC PVIs are critical for the formation of infantile memories and for memory development.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the socially significant pathologies still lacking effective therapy. The purpose of this work was to analyze the efficacy of the intravenous (i.v.) administration of exosomes obtained from human umbilical cord Wharton jelly multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell culture supernatant. Exosomes were isolated by column filtration and characterized by the expression of specific markers and in vitro binding to mouse fibroblast cells L929. Using a model of the sporadic form of AD, it was shown that i.v. administration of exosomes prevented the deterioration of spatial memory in olfactory bulbectomized mice (OBE). The therapeutic effect was possibly due to the ability of exosomes to penetrate the brain-blood barrier of OBE animals, which was confirmed by visualization of fluorescently labeled exosomes in the cortex and hippocampus after i.v. administration of exosomes.

AB  - Derived from hazelnuts, hazel leaf has been utilized in traditional folk medicine for centuries in countries such as Portugal, Sweden, and Iran. In our previous investigations, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the hazel leaf polyphenol extract (referred to as ZP) and identified nine compounds, such as kaempferol and chlorogenic acid, in its composition. ZP has shown promising properties as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Our research has revealed that ZP has protective effects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). We conducted a comprehensive examination of both the pathological and ultrastructural aspects and found that ZP effectively ameliorated renal tissue lesions and mitigated mitochondrial damage. Moreover, ZP significantly suppressed malondialdehyde levels while increasing glutathione and catalase concentrations in the kidneys of AKI-induced mice. ZP decreased the number of apoptotic cells and decreased pro-apoptotic protein expression in the kidneys of mice and human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). Furthermore, treatment with ZP increased the levels of proteins marking anti-ferroptosis, such as GPX4, FTH1, and FSP1, in experiments both in vivo and in vitro. We elucidated the underlying mechanisms of ZP's actions, revealing its inhibitory effect on Yap phosphorylation and its regulation of Lats expression, which exert a protective influence on the kidneys. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting the Hippo pathway compromised ZP's nephroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In summary, this research shows that ZP exhibits renoprotective properties, effectively reducing oxidative damage, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in the kidneys by targeting the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Despite considerable progress on the study of the effect of standardized extract of Gingko biloba (EGb) on memory processes, our understanding of its role in the persistence of long-term memory (LTM) and the molecular mechanism underlying its effect, particularly episodic-like memory, is limited. We here investigated the effects of EGb on the long-term retention of recognition memory and its persistence and BDNF expression levels in the dorsal hippocampal formation (DHF). Adult male Wistar rats (n = 10/group) were handled for 10 min/5 day. On day 6, the animals were treated with vehicle or 0.4 mg/kg diazepam (control groups) or with EGb (250, 500 or 100 mg/kg) 30 min before the training session (TR1), in which the animals were exposed to two sample objects. On day 7, all rats underwent a second training session (TR2) as described in the TR1 but without drug treatment. Object recognition memory (ORM) was evaluated on day 8 (retention test, T1) and day 9 (persistence test, T2). At the end of T1or T2, animals were decapitated, and DHF samples were frozen at -80 degrees C for analyses of the differential expression of BDNF by Western blotting. EGb-treated groups spent more time exploring the novel object in T2 and showed the highest recognition index (RI) values during the T1 and T2, which was associated with upregulation of BDNF expression in the DHF in a dose-and session-dependent manner. Our data reveal, for the first time, that EGb treatment before acquisition of ORM promotes persistence of LTM by BDNF differential expression.

AB  - Background: Agomelatine, a novel antidepressant, is a melatonin MT receptor agonist and serotonin 5HT(2C) receptor antagonist. In this study, agomelatine was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hippocampal aging associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, all of which led to short-term memory impairment.
   Method: Hippocampal aging was induced in male Wistar rats by D-galactose (D-gal) intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg) for 14 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of D-gal treatment, rats were treated with agomelatine (40 mg/kg) or melatonin (10 mg/kg). At the end of the experiment, all rats were assessed for short-term memory by using the Morris water maze test. Subsequently, rats were sacrified and the hippocampus was removed from each rat for determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays; and immunohistochemistry related to ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis.
   Results: Agomelatine suppressed the expression of the aging-related proteins P16 and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), the expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 and 4, and ROS production. This treatment also shifted the morphology of astrocytes and microglia toward homeostasis. Furthermore, agomelatine decreased inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (pIRE1), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pPERK), and chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), leading to suppression of ER stress markers C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12. Agomelatine reduced Ca2+ from the ER and stabilized the mitochondrial membrane stability, which was denoted by the BCL2 Associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) balance. Agomelatine decreased cleaved caspase-3 production and the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive area, and glutamate excitotoxicity was prevented via suppression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit expression. Agomelatine exhibited effects that were similar to melatonin.
   Conclusion: Agomelatine improved neurodegeneration in a rat model of hippocampal aging by attenuating ROS production, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis.

AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are expressed predominantly on neurons and glial cells and are involved in the modulation of a wide range of signal transduction cascades. Therefore, different subtypes of mGluRs are considered a promising target for the treatment of various brain diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the seizure-induced upregulation of mGluR5; however, its functional significance is still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the effect of treatment with the selective mGluR5 antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) on epileptogenesis and behavioral impairments in rats using the lithium-pilocarpine model. We found that the administration of MTEP during the latent phase of the model did not improve survival, prevent the development of epilepsy, or attenuate its manifestations in rats. However, MTEP treatment completely prevented neuronal loss and partially attenuated astrogliosis in the hippocampus. An increase in excitatory amino acid transporter 2 expression, which has been detected in treated rats, may prevent excitotoxicity and be a potential mechanism of neuroprotection. We also found that MTEP administration did not prevent the behavioral comorbidities such as depressive-like behavior, motor hyperactivity, reduction of exploratory behavior, and cognitive impairments typical in the lithium-pilocarpine model. Thus, despite the distinct neuroprotective effect, the MTEP treatment was ineffective in preventing epilepsy.

AB  - We investigated the cellular and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of 5-HT4R activation in hippocampal-prefrontal pathways. Our findings show that, in addition to pyramidal neurons, 30-60% of parvalbumin+ interneurons in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate (ACC), prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) regions of the prefrontal cortex co-express 5-HT4Rs. Additionally, 15% of somatostatin+ interneurons in CA1 and CA3 express 5-HT4Rs. Partial 5-HT4R agonist RS-67333 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) exerted anxiolytic effects and ameliorated short-term (3-min) and long-term (24-h) memory deficits in a mouse model of schizophrenia-like cognitive impairment induced by sub-chronic phencyclidine (sPCP) but did not enhance memory in healthy mice. At the neurophysiological level, RS-67333 normalized sPCP-induced disruptions in hippocampal-prefrontal neural dynamics while having no effect in healthy animals. Specifically, sPCP increased delta oscillations in CA1 and PL, leading to aberrant delta-high-frequency coupling in CA1 and delta-high-gamma coupling in PL. RS-67333 administration attenuated this abnormal delta synchronization without altering phase coherence or signal directionality within the circuit. Collectively, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of 5-HT4R activation in pyramidal, parvalbumin+, and somatostatin+ neurons of hippocampal-prefrontal pathways for mitigation of cognitive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

AB  - Individuals with bipolar disorders (BD) frequently suffer from obesity, which is often associated with neurostructural alterations. Yet, the effects of obesity on brain structure in BD are under-researched. We obtained MRI-derived brain subcortical volumes and body mass index (BMI) from 1134 BD and 1601 control individuals from 17 independent research sites within the ENIGMA-BD Working Group. We jointly modeled the effects of BD and BMI on subcortical volumes using mixed-effects modeling and tested for mediation of group differences by obesity using nonparametric bootstrapping. All models controlled for age, sex, hemisphere, total intracranial volume, and data collection site. Relative to controls, individuals with BD had significantly higher BMI, larger lateral ventricular volume, and smaller volumes of amygdala, hippocampus, pallidum, caudate, and thalamus. BMI was positively associated with ventricular and amygdala and negatively with pallidal volumes. When analyzed jointly, both BD and BMI remained associated with volumes of lateral ventricles and amygdala. Adjusting for BMI decreased the BD vs control differences in ventricular volume. Specifically, 18.41% of the association between BD and ventricular volume was mediated by BMI (Z = 2.73, p = 0.006). BMI was associated with similar regional brain volumes as BD, including lateral ventricles, amygdala, and pallidum. Higher BMI may in part account for larger ventricles, one of the most replicated findings in BD. Comorbidity with obesity could explain why neurostructural alterations are more pronounced in some individuals with BD. Future prospective brain imaging studies should investigate whether obesity could be a modifiable risk factor for neuroprogression.

AB  - beta-Amyloid (A beta) is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase, where BACE1 acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Elevated BACE1 levels in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients implicate that dysregulated BACE1 expression is crucial to AD pathogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified that the G protein subunit beta 5 gene (Gnb5), a component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, is significantly downregulated in both human AD patients and AD mouse models. Conditional knockout of Gnb5 in excitatory neurons resulted in cognitive impairments, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Gnb5 in the hippocampus ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced A beta deposition in 5xFAD mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Gnb5 interacts with BACE1, modulating its expression and potentially influencing A beta generation. We further identify the first tryptophan-aspartate domain (WD domain) of Gnb5 and the Ser81 residue as crucial for this regulation. Expression of this WD domain alone is sufficient to reduce A beta deposition in 5xFAD mice, whereas a point mutation at Ser81 (S81L) abolishes this effect. Overall, our findings establish Gnb5 as a negative regulator of the BACE1-APP processing axis and unveil mechanistic insights into its role in A beta-mediated AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Cai, Jing, Junyong Ruan, Xi Shao, Yuanjun Ding, Kangning Xie, Chi Tang, Zedong Yan, Erping Luo, and Da Jing. Oxygen enrichment mitigates high-altitude hypoxia-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction associated with attenuated tau phosphorylation. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2021. Background: Brain is predominantly vulnerable to high-altitude hypoxia (HAH), resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. The technology of oxygen enrichment has proven effective to decrease the heart rate and improve the arterial oxygen saturation by reducing the equivalent altitude. However, the efficacy of oxygen enrichment on HAH-induced cognitive impairments remains controversial based on the results of neuropsychological tests, and its role in HAH-induced hippocampal morphological and molecular changes remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to systematically investigate the effects of oxygen enrichment on the memory dysfunction and hippocampal neurodegeneration caused by HAH. Materials and Methods: Fifty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally assigned to three groups: normal control, HAH, and HAH with oxygen enrichment (HAHO). Rats in the HAH and HAHO groups were exposed to hypoxia for 3 days in a hypobaric hypoxia chamber at a simulated altitude of 6,000 m. Rats in the HAHO group were supplemented with oxygen-enriched air, with 12 hours/day in the hypobaric hypoxia chamber. Results: Our results showed that oxygen enrichment improved the locomotor activity of HAH-exposed rats. The Morris water maze test revealed that oxygen enrichment significantly ameliorated HAH-induced spatial memory deficits. Oxygen enrichment also improved morphological alterations of pyramidal cells and the ultrastructure of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats exposed to acute HAH. Tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396, Ser262, Thr231, and Thr181 was also significantly attenuated by oxygen enrichment in HAH-exposed rats. Conclusions: Together, our study reveals that oxygen enrichment can ameliorate HAH-induced cognitive impairments associated with improved hippocampal morphology and molecular expression, and highlights that oxygen enrichment may become a promising alternative treatment against neurodegeneration for humans ascending to the plateau.

AB  - The in vitro antiproliferative activity of a phenolic-rich extract from Lycium barbarum fruits against head and neck HPV16 squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been demonstrated, indicating for the first time that L. barbarum extract inhibits human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 cell lines. Ethanol extract of L. barbarum was used for cell viability evaluation on SCC090, CAL27, and HGnF cell lines. After 24 and 48 h, the cell cycle effect of L. barbarum extract (at 1.0, 10, and 100 mu g/mL) was measured via flow cytometry. In addition, the mRNA expression on E6/E7 and p53 via RT-PCR and the expression of p16, p53, Ki-67, and Bcl-2 via immunohistochemistry were also determined. Untreated cells, 20 mu M cisplatin, and a Camellia sinensis-derived extract were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. We demonstrated that the studied L. barbarum extract resulted in G(0)/G(1) arrest and S phase accumulation in SCC090 at 1.0 and 10 mu g/mL. A reduction in mRNA levels of E6/E7 oncogenes (p < 0.05) with p53 overexpression was also observed through PCR, while immunohistochemical analyses indicated p16 overexpression (p > 0.05) and a decrease in p53 overexpression. The observed effects were associated with anticancer and immunomodulatory phenolics, such as flavonols/flavan-3-ols and tyramine-conjugated hydroxycinnamic acid amides, identified in the studied extract. These findings revealed that the phenolic-rich extract of L. barbarum fruits has promising properties to be considered further for developing new therapies against oral and oropharyngeal HPV lesions.

AB  - KCTD11 has been reported to be a potential tumour suppressor in several tumour types. However, the expression of KCTD11 and its role has not been reported in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whether its potential molecular mechanism is related to its BTB domain is also unknown. The expression of KCTD11 in 139 NSCLC tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry, and its correlation with clinicopathological factors was analysed. The effect of KCTD11 on the biological behaviour of lung cancer cells was verified in vitro and in vivo. Its effect on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT)process and the Wnt/beta-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways were observed by Western blot, dual-luciferase assay, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. KCTD11 is under-expressed in lung cancer tissues and cells and was negatively correlated with the degree of differentiation, tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph node metastasis. Low KCTD11 expression was associated with poor prognosis. KCTD11 overexpression inhibited the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells. Further studies indicated that KCTD11 inhibited the Wnt pathway, activated the Hippo pathway and inhibited EMT processes by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and YAP. KCTD11 lost its stimulatory effect on the Hippo pathway after knock down of beta-catenin. These findings confirm that KCTD11 inhibits beta-catenin and YAP nuclear translocation as well as the malignant phenotype of lung cancer cells by interacting with beta-catenin. This provides an important experimental basis for the interaction between KCTD11, beta-catenin and YAP, further revealing the link between the Wnt and Hippo pathways.

AB  - Isorhamnetin (ISO), a flavonoid compound isolated from sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) fruit, has anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effects of ISO on neuroinflammation and cognitive function are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of ISO on cognitive impairment in obese mice induced by a high-fat and high fructose diet (HFFD). It has been found that oral administration of ISO (0.03% w/w and 0.06% w/w) for 14 weeks significantly reduced the body weight, food intake, liver weight, liver lipid level, and serum lipid level of HFFD-fed mice. ISO can also significantly prevent HFFD-induced neuronal working, spatial, and long-term memory impairment. Notably, the ISO treatment activated the CREB/BDNF pathway and increased neurotrophic factors in the brains of mice. Furthermore, ISO inhibited HFFD-induced microglial overactivation and down-regulated inflammatory cytokines in both serum and the brain. It can also inhibit the expression of p-JNK, p-p38, and p-NF kappa B protein in the mouse brain. In conclusion, these results indicated that ISO mitigated HFFD-induced cognitive impairments by inhibiting the MAPK and NF kappa B signaling pathways, suggesting that ISO might be a plausible nutritional intervention for metabolic syndrome-related cognitive complications.

In this progressive neurological disorder, impaired zinc homeostasis has a key role that needs to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zinc deficiency and administration on hippocampal Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression in rats injected with intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ). Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups in equal numbers: Sham 1 group received icy artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF); Sham 2 group received icy a CSF and i.p. saline; STZ group received 3 mg/kg icy STZ; STZ-Zn-deficient group received 3 mg/kg icy STZ and fed a zinc-deprived diet; STZ-Zn-supplemented group received 3 mg/kg icy STZ and i.p. zinc sulfate (5 mg/kg/day). Hippocampus tissue samples were taken following the cervical dislocation of the animals under general anesthesia. Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression levels were determined by real-time-PCR method. Zinc supplementation attenuated the increase in hippocampal Nogo-A receptor gene expression, which was significantly increased in zinc deficiency. Again, zinc supplementation upregulated the intrinsic protective mechanisms of the brain by activating osteocalcin-expressing cells in the brain. The results of the study show that zinc has critical effects on Nogo-A receptor gene expression and hippocampal osteocalcin gene expression levels in the memory-sensitive rat hippocampus that is impaired by icv-STZ injection. These results are the first to examine the effect of zinc deficiency and supplementation on hippocampal Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression in icv-STZ injection in rats.

AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacological effects of black tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) water extract on human kinin-forming enzymes in vitro. Tea is a highly consumed beverage in the world. Factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor)-independent- and -dependent activation of prekallikrein to kallikrein leads to the liberation of bradykinin (BK) from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). The excessive BK production causes vascular endothelial and nonvascular smooth muscle cell permeability, leading to angioedema. The prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced angioedema appears to be through BK. Both histamine and BK are potent inflammatory mediators. However, the treatments for histamine-mediated angioedema are unsuitable for BK-mediated angioedema. We hypothesized that long-term consumption of tea would reduce bradykinin-dependent processes within the systemic and pulmonary vasculature, independent of the anti-inflammatory actions of polyphenols. A purified fraction of the black tea water extract inhibited both kallikrein and activated FXII. The black tea water extracts inhibited factor XII-induced cell migration and inhibited the production of kallikrein on the endothelial cell line. We compared the inhibitory effects of the black tea water extract and twenty-three well-known anti-inflammatory medicinal herbs, in inhibiting both kallikrein and FXII. Surprisingly, arjunglucoside II specifically inhibited the activated factor XII (FXIIa), but not the kallikrein and the activated factor XI. Taken together, the black tea water extract exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, in part, by inhibiting kallikrein and activated FXII, which are part of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), and by decreasing BK production. The inhibition of kallikrein and activated FXII represents a unique polyphenol-independent anti-inflammatory mechanism of action for the black tea.

AB  - In recent years, escitalopram (ESC) has been suggested to have different mechanisms of action beyond its well known selective serotonin reuptake inhibition. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of escitalopram on oxidative stress, apoptosis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), and oligodendrocytes number in the brain of chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressed rats. The animals were randomised in four groups (8 in each group): control, stress, stress + ESC 5 and stress + ESC 5/10. ESC was administered for 42 days in a fixed dose (5 mg/kg b.w.) or in an up-titration regimen (21 days ESC 5 mg/kg b.w. then 21 days ESC 10 mg/kg b.w.). Sucrose preference test (SPT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) were also performed. ESC improved the percentage of sucrose preference, locomotion and anxiety. ESC5/10 reduced the oxidative damage in the hippocampus and improved the antioxidant defence in the hippocampus and frontal lobe. ESC5/10 lowered caspase 3 activity in the hippocampus. Escitalopram had a modulatory effect on BDNF and the number of oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus and frontal lobe and also improved the MeCP2 expressions. The results confirm the multiple pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of depression and suggest that escitalopram exerts an antidepressant effect via different intricate mechanisms.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are valuable tools in pharmacological and biological research, offering unique properties for drug delivery in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates the potential of gold nanoparticles loaded with afzelin, a natural chemical extracted from Ribes fasciculatum, to enhance its therapeutic effects and overcome the limitations of using natural compounds regarding low productivity. We hypothesized that the combined treatment of AuNPs with afzelin (AuNP-afzelin) would remarkably enforce neuroprotective effects compared with the single treatment of afzelin. Central administration of AuNP-afzelin (10 ng of afzelin) indicated improvements in cognition and memory-involved assessments of behavioral tests, comparing single treatments of afzelin (10 or 100 ng of afzelin) in scopolamine-induced AD mice. AuNP-afzelin also performed superior neuroprotective effects of rescuing mature neuronal cells and recovered cholinergic dysfunction compared to afzelin alone, according to further investigations of BDNF-pCREB-pAkt signaling, long-term potentiation, and doublecortin (DCX) expression in the hippocampus. This study highlights the potential of afzelin with gold nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating cognitive impairments associated with neurodegenerative diseases and offers a new avenue for future research and drug development.

AB  - Depression, a prevalent and debilitating mood disorder, remains a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Although pharmacological approaches targeting monoamine dysfunction have demonstrated efficacy, they are often accompanied by limitations and side effects. In this study, reserpine-induced depressed mouse models were used to investigate the antidepressant potential of five essential oils (EOs) derived from Jasminum sambac (JSEOs), Rosa rugosa, Magnolia denudata, Aloysia citriodora (ACEOs), and Abies balsamea. The chemical compositions of the five EOs were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Subsequently, experimental mice inhaled the EOs for 1 h per day, followed by behavioral assessments using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Nissl staining was employed to assess the abundance of normal neurons in the mouse brain. At the same time, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques were utilized to analyze the expression of antidepressant-related genes. GC-MS results revealed that the primary components of the five EOs were oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. All five EOs exhibited antidepressant-like effects, with JSEOs and ACEOs demonstrating the greatest antidepressant efficacy. Behavioral tests showed a reduction in immobility durations in both FST and TST. Nissl staining results indicated an increase in the number of intact neurons in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of mice following EO treatment. Furthermore, the EOs regulated the expression of crucial biomarkers, including 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HT1A), 5-HT2A, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, corticotropin-releasing factor, and tropomyosin-related kinase B. This study underscores the potential of EO inhalation as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for depression treatment, provides novel insights into its molecular mechanisms, and supports further exploration of natural remedies in mental health care.

AB  - Demyelination is observed in animal models of intractable epilepsy (IE). Epileptogenesis damages the myelin sheath and dysregulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) development. However, the molecular pathways regulating demyelination in epilepsy are unclear. Here, we predicted the molecular mechanisms regulating demyelination in a rat model of lithium-pilocarpine hydrochloride-induced epilepsy. We identified DGKA/ Mboat2/Inpp5j and NOS/Keratin 28 as the main target molecules that regulate demyelination via glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling, and estrogen signaling in demyelinated forebrain slice cultures (FSCs). In seizure-like FCSs, the actin cytoskeleton was regulated by Cnp and MBP via Pak4/Tmsb4x (also known as T beta 4) and Kif5c/Kntc1. T beta 4 possibly prevented OPC differentiation and maturation and inhibited MBP phosphorylation via the p38MAPK/ERK1/JNK1 pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway was more likely activated in seizure-like FCSs than in demyelinated FCSs. pMBP expression was decreased in the hippocampus of lithium-pilocarpine hydrochloride-induced acute epilepsy rats. The expression of remyelinationrelated factors was suppressed in the hippocampus and corpus callosum in lithium-pilocarpine hydrochlorideinduced epilepsy rats. These findings suggest that the actin cytoskeleton, T beta 4, and MAPK signaling pathways regulate the decrease in pMBP in the hippocampus in a rat model of epilepsy. Our results indicate that regulating the actin cytoskeleton, T beta 4, and MAPK signaling pathways may facilitate the prevention of demyelination in IE.

AB  - In clinical practice, Alzheimer's disease (AD), as one of the main neurodegenerative diseases globally, currently has no cure. Recently, the delaying and improving effects of physical exercise on AD have gradually been confirmed; however, the specific mechanism involved needs further clarification. (1) Objective: Explore the mechanism aerobic exercise plays in delaying AD by regulating mitochondrial proteostasis and provide new theoretical bases for improving and delaying AD through aerobic exercise in the future. (2) Methods: Male APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into a normal group (NG, n = 20), activation group (AG, n = 20), and inhibition group (SG, n = 20). Then, the mice in each group were randomly divided into control group and exercise group (n = 10 mice each), yielding the normal control group (CNG), normal exercise group (ENG), active control group (CAG), active exercise group (EAG), inhibitive control group (CSG), and inhibitive exercise group (ESG). After adaptive training, the mice in the exercise groups were trained on an aerobic treadmill for 12 weeks; we conducted behavioral tests and sampled the results. Then, quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blot analysis were performed. (3) Results: In the Morris water maze (MWM) test, the latency was significantly reduced and the number of platform crossings was significantly increased in the CAG and ENG compared with the CNG, while the result of the CSG was contrary to this. Compared with the ENG, latency was significantly reduced and the number of platform crossings was significantly increased in the EAG, while the opposite occurred for ESG. Compared with the CAG, the latency was significantly reduced and the number of platform crossings was significantly increased in the EAG, while the results for CSG were contrary. In the step-down test, compared with the CNG, the latency was significantly increased and the number of errors was significantly reduced in the CAG and ENG, respectively, while the results for CSG were contrary. Compared with the ENG, the latency was significantly increased and the number of errors was significantly reduced in the EAG, while the results for ESG were contrary. Compared with the CAG, the latency was significantly increased and the number of errors was significantly reduced in the EAG, while the results for CSG were contrary. Mitochondrial unfolded protein reactions (UPRmt), mitochondrial autophagy, and mitochondrial protein import levels in each group of mice were detected using Q-PCR and Western blot experiments. Compared with the CNG, the UPRmt and mitochondrial autophagy levels in the CAG and ENG were significantly increased and the mitochondrial protein import levels were significantly reduced, while the results for the CSG were contrary. Compared with the ENG, the UPRmt and mitochondrial autophagy levels in the EAG were significantly increased and the mitochondrial protein import levels were significantly reduced, while the results for ESG were contrary. Compared with the CAG, the UPRmt and mitochondrial autophagy levels in the EAG were significantly increased and the mitochondrial protein import levels were significantly reduced, while the results for CSG were contrary. (4) Conclusions: Aerobic exercise can improve cognitive function levels and delay the symptoms of AD in APP/PS1 mice by regulating mitochondrial proteostasis.

AB  - Whole body vibration (WBV) is well known to exert beneficial effects on multiple tissues, improving synaptic transmission, muscle mass, bone quality, and reducing anxiety and depressive behavior. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, and organs and tissues may respond differently to the vibratory stimulus depending on multiple factors. Therefore, we investigated the WBV effects on the brain and musculoskeletal tissue of 4-month-old young mice, evaluating synaptic plasticity by electrophysiological recordings and tissue organization by histology and histomorphometric analysis. Specifically, WBV protocols were characterized by the same vibration frequency (45 Hz), but different in vibration exposure time (five series of 3 min for the B protocol and three series of 2 min and 30 s for the C protocol) and recovery time between two vibration sessions (1 min for the B protocol and 2 min and 30 s for the C protocol). In addition, immunohistochemistry was conducted to evaluate the expression of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), as well as that of tissue-specific markers, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in brain, myostatin in muscle and collagen I (COL-1) in bone. Our results suggest that the WBV effects depend closely on the type of protocol used and support the hypothesis that different organs or tissues have different susceptibility to vibration. Further studies will be needed to deepen our knowledge of physiological adaptations to vibration and develop customized WBV protocols to improve and preserve cognitive and motor functions.

AB  - Whether low-dose phthalate exposure triggers asthma among children, and its underlying mechanisms, remain debatable. Here, we evaluated the individual and mixed effects of low-dose phthalate exposure on children with asthma and five (oxidative/nitrosative stress/lipid peroxidation) mechanistic biomarkers-8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-nitroguanine (8-NO2 Gua), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA), 8-isoprostaglandin Fla (8-isoPF2 alpha), and malondialdehyde (MDA)-using a propensity score-matched case-control study (case vs. control = 41 vs. 111). The median monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations in the case group were significantly higher than those in the control group (3.94 vs. 2.52 ng/mL, p = 0.02), indicating that dust could be an important source. After adjustment for confounders, the associations of high monomethyl phthalate (MMP) (75th percentile) with 8-NO2 Gua (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-6.92) and 8-isoPF2 alpha (aOR: 4.04, 95% CI: 1.51-10.8) and the associations of mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) with 8-isoPF2 alpha (aOR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.13-7.79) were observed. Weighted quantile sum regression revealed that MBzP contributed more than half of the association (56.8%), followed by MiBP (26.6%) and mono-iso-nonyl phthalate (MiNP) (8.77%). Our findings supported the adjuvant effect of phthalates in enhancing the immune system response.

AB  - Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are essential for the regeneration of intestinal cells upon radiation or chemical agent damage. As for radiation-induced damage, the expression of AIM2, YAP, TLR3, PUMA or BVES can aggravate ISCs depletion, while the stimulation of TLR5, HGF/MET signaling, Ass1 gene, Slit/Robo signaling facilitate the radio-resistance of ISCs. Upon chemical agent treatment, the activation of TRAIL or p53/PUMA pathway exacerbate injury on ISCs, while the increased levels of IL-22, beta-arrestin1 can ease the damage. The transformation between reserve ISCs (rISCs) maintaining quiescent states and active ISCs (aISCs) that are highly proliferative has obtained much attention in recent years, in which ISCs expressing high levels of Hopx, Bmi1, mTert, Krt19 or Lrig1 are resistant to radiation injury, and SOX9, MSI2, clusterin, URI are essential for rISCs maintenance. The differentiated cells like Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells can also obtain stemness driven by radiation injury mediated by Wnt or Notch signaling. Besides, Mex3a-expressed ISCs can survive and then proliferate into intestinal epithelial cells upon chemical agent damage. In addition, the modulation of symbiotic microbes harboring gastrointestinal (GI) tract is also a promising strategy to protect ISCs against radiation damage. Overall, the strategies targeting mechanisms modulating ISCs activities are conducive to alleviating GI injury of patients receiving chemoradiotherapy or victims of nuclear or chemical accident.

AB  - Episodic memory provides humans with the ability to mentally travel back to the past,1 where experiences typically involve associations between multimodal information. Forming a memory of the association is thought to be dependent on modification of synaptic connectivity.2,3 Animal studies suggest that the strength of synaptic modification depends on spike timing between pre-and post-synaptic neurons on the order of tens of milliseconds, which is termed "spike-timing-dependent plasticity"(STDP).4 Evidence found in human in vitro studies suggests different temporal scales in long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), compared with the critical time window of STDP in animals.5,6 In the healthy human brain, STDP-like effects have been shown in the motor cortex, visual perception, and face identity recognition.7-13 However, evidence in human episodic memory is lacking. We investigated this using rhythmic sensory stimulation to drive visual and auditory cortices at 37.5 Hz with four phase offsets. Visual relative to auditory cued recall accuracy was significantly enhanced in the 90 & DEG; condition when the visual stimulus led at the shortest delay (6.67 ms). This pattern was reversed in the 270 & DEG; condition when the auditory stimulus led at the shortest delay. Within cue modality, recall was enhanced when a stimulus of the corresponding modality led the shortest delay (6.67 ms) compared with the longest delay (20 ms). Our findings provide evidence for STDP in human episodic memory, which builds an important bridge from in vitro studies in animals to human memory behavior.

AB  - Featured Application This study explores the potential of natural plant extracts as antimicrobial agents for the biological control of wash water pathogens in the agri-food industry. The findings support the development of eco-friendly alternatives to chlorine-based disinfection, contributing to safer and more sustainable food processing practices.Abstract Water used in cleaning processes within the agri-food industry can be a vector for post-harvest contaminants, thus contributing to cross-contamination. The contamination risk is increased when water is not replaced between batches or when disinfection protocols are insufficient. Given the increasing focus in recent years on the potential of natural, non-invasive plant extracts to combat a variety of pathogens, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, environmental strains, and clinical isolates, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of selected water-ethanol plant extracts against six opportunistic pathogens isolated from wash water in the agri-food industry, along with chromatographic analyses of the selected extracts. Plant extracts were obtained from the fruits, leaves, shoots, roots, and bark of 13 species. Antibacterial activity was assessed using the well diffusion method. The results indicated that antimicrobial activity was exhibited by six extracts: Tilia cordata Mill., Camellia sinensis, Quercus robur L., Betula pendula Roth, Rubus idaeus L., and Salix alba L. The extracts showed strain-dependent antimicrobial activity, with C. sinensis and R. idaeus up to 4.0 mm and 8.0 mm inhibition zones, respectively. P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were the most susceptible strains, demonstrating the largest inhibition zones. In contrast, P. vulgaris and K. oxytoca were more resistant. The efficacy of the most active extracts can be linked to the presence of phytochemicals identified via GC-MS, including epicatechin, shikimic acid, quinic acid, gallic acid, and caffeine. These metabolites are known to interfere with bacterial cell structures and metabolic pathways. These studies may serve as a preliminary step toward the development of non-invasive water treatment methods for wash water.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ethanol extracts from sea buckthorn and Cornelian cherry fruits and leaves on physiology of gastrointestinal tract cells. We used three cell lines relevant to the types of cells, which are exposed to bioactive compounds after oral administration, namely intestinal absorptive cells (Caco-2/HT-29 MTX model), hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) and immunocompetent cells (RAW 264.7 and P388D1 monocytes). The contents of antioxidant and bioactive polyphenols, such as cinnamic, caffeic and p-coumaric acids, rutin, myricetin, resveratrol, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol, were assessed in the extracts using HPLC chromatography. The application of the extracts to Caco-2/HT-29-MTX cultures increased enterocyte differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase and villin1 level) and goblet cell markers (mucins) over a fortnight. The extracts reduced lipid droplet size in hepatocytes challenged with hyperglycaemic glucose concentration, insulin and palmitate. Sea buckthorn leaf, fruit and Cornelian cherry leaf extracts blocked oxidative burst in the PMA-stimulated monocytes, while the sea buckthorn leaf and Cornelian cherry fruit extracts downregulated lipopolysaccharide-induced NO and IL-1 beta, respectively. The results indicate that the tested extracts modulate the behaviour of cells in the gastrointestinal tract in a beneficial way, especially regarding lipid accumulation and innate immunity actions.

AB  - Impaired differentiation of newborn neurons or abnormalities at the synapses resulted from stress maladaptation could be the key etiology of depression. Recent studies have shown that mTOR, a crucial factor for neuronal differentiation and synapse development, acts as a common factor that mediates the rapid antidepression effects of several new-class antidepressants. In this study, the antidepressant-like activity of securinine, an alkaloid that has central nervous system stimulation ability, was investigated. Both securinine and its enantiomer virosecurinine exhibited potent in vitro activity on neuronal differentiation and synapse development in Neuro-2a cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, and this activity was dependent on the activation of the AKT-mTOR-S6K pathway. Interestingly, only securinine but not virosecurinine showed mTOR stimulation and antidepressant-like activity in mice. Importantly, a single dose of securinine was capable of alleviating the behavioral deficits induced by both acute and chronic stress models within 30 min of administration, suggesting that securinine has rapid onset of action. Moreover, neither a single dose nor a 3 week treatment of securinine had adverse effects on exploratory locomotion of mice. Together, this study identifies that securinine is a potent agent in promoting neuronal differentiation and synapse formation and shows rapid antidepressant-like activity, without inducing abnormal locomotion, via mTOR activation.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a persistent inflammatory disorder of the upper airways, severely impacting quality of life. Dupilumab, targeting type 2 inflammatory pathways, is effective in managing severe, uncontrolled CRSwNP. However, the comparative accuracy of endoscopic scoring systems in monitoring therapeutic response to dupilumab remains unclear. This study compared the accuracy of the nasal polyp score (NPS) and the modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score (M-LKS) in assessing dupilumab response. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis included 66 severe CRSwNP patients treated with dupilumab at Padua University. Endoscopic scores (NPS and M-LKS), patient-reported outcome mesures (PROMs), and clinician-reported outcome measures (CROMs), including peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and the Sniffin' Sticks test, were evaluated at baseline and over 24 months. Results: Both NPS and M-LKS showed significant reductions over time (p < 0.001), significantly correlating with PNIF (p < 0.001). Given time and patient, PNIF emerged to be the only covariate related to endoscopic scores. No significant differences were observed between NPS and M-LKS regarding clinical outcome associations, suggesting equivalent accuracy. PNIF was identified as a critical predictor of endoscopic improvement, highlighting its clinical utility. These findings reinforce the role of standardized endoscopic metrics in assessing the efficacy of biologic therapies for CRSwNP.

AB  - This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of undulating and oscillatory movements in fish, utilizing numerical simulations to explore correlations among fin thrust and swimming speed. The study distinguishes itself through a unique approach by employing kinematic equations of motion control, specifically in oscillation and undulation, for computational fluid dynamics. Despite increasing energy loss with undulation, the study reveals a reduction in power demand with oscillation, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving desired speeds. The dynamics of undulating fins in aquatic and aerial locomotion remain insufficiently understood. The trade-off between more energy-consuming but highly propulsive movements or simpler and faster movements requires sophisticated design techniques to reduce volume. The geometry, developed using Rhino 6 software, incorporates precise fluid resistance calculations conducted with Ansys Fluent 19. Spanning flow velocities from 1 to 4 m/s were used for the simulation condition. Critical factors such as flexibility, viscosity, and shape change were meticulously examined for their impact on efficiency enhancement.

AB  - Recent advances in visual programming tools for algorithmic modelling have significantly expanded the possibilities for designing industrial products. This study analyses the capacity and adaptability of Grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor integrated with Rhinoceros 3D, as a parametric design tool in the development of product platforms. Three case studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of parameter configuration in product families: perfume bottles, outdoor furniture, and desk organisers. The analysis provided insight into the ability of Grasshopper to (1) automate the generation of product variants within platforms; (2) enable the flexible creation of scalable, customised design alternatives; and (3) improve efficiency in the platform design process in terms of time and technical resources. The results show that Grasshopper provides strong capabilities for customising geometric parameters compared to traditional modelling in Rhinoceros 3D. However, its adaptability is more limited when customisation involves interdependent parameters, such as those related to ergonomics or usability, due to the difficulty of translating these requirements into algorithmic structures. In addition, the initial definition of parameters and constraints may restrict modifications in later design phases. These findings underline the need for algorithm models that support iterative adjustments and flexible reconfiguration throughout all phases of the design process.

AB  - BACKGROUNDRice is considered a high estimated glycemic index (eGI) food because of its higher starch digestibility, which leads to type II diabetes and obesity as a result of a sedentary life style. Furthermore, the incresaing diabetes cases in rice-consuming populations worldwide need alternative methods to reduce the glycemic impact of rice, with dietary prescriptions based on the eGI value of food being an attractive and practical concept. Rice is often paired with vegetables, pulses, tubers and roots, a staple food group in Africa, Latin America and Asia, which are rich in fibre and health-promoting compounds.RESULTSRice from four categories (high protein, scented, general and pigmented) was analyzed for eGI and resistant starch (RS) content. Among the genotypes, Improved Lalat had the lowest eGI (53.12) with a relatively higher RS content (2.17%), whereas Hue showed the lowest RS (0.19%) with the highest eGI (76.3) value. The addition of tuber crops to rice caused a significant lowering of eGI where the maximum beneficial effect was shown by elephant foot yam (49.37) followed by yam bean (53.07) and taro (54.43).CONCLUSIONThe present study suggests that combining rice with suitable tuber crops can significantly reduce its eGI value, potentially reducing the burden of diet-associated lifestyle diseases particularly diabetics.

AB  - Objectives: The cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) elicits pathogenic effects involving disruption of the epithelial barrier function as a part of immunological response networks. It is unclear how these integrated cytokine signals influence inflammation and other physiological processes in the pathology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We investigated the expression and distribution of OSM and OSM receptor (OSMR) in CRS patients' sinonasal specimens, and we compared the results with a panel of inflammatory cytokine levels and clinical features. Patients and Methods: We classified CRS patients as eosinophilic (ECRS, n = 36) or non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS, n = 35) based on the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis phenotypic criteria and compared their cases with those of 20 control subjects. We also examined OSM's stimulatory effects on cytokine receptor expression levels using the human bronchial epithelium cell line BEAS-2B. Results: RT-PCR showed that the OSM mRNA levels were significantly increased in the CRS patients' ethmoid sinus mucosa. The OSM mRNA levels were positively correlated with those of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-13, and OSMR-beta. In BEAS-2B cells, OSM treatment induced significant increases in the OSMR beta, IL-1R1, and IL-13Ra mRNA levels. Conclusions: OSM is involved in the pathogenesis of CRS in both type 1 and type 2 inflammation, suggesting the OSM signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for modulating epithelial stromal interactions.

AB  - Suppressive effect of bis (3-amino-2-pyridine) diselenide (BAPD) on psychiatric disorders - atopic dermatitis (AD) comorbidity in mice was investigated. To sensitize the animals, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was applied to their dorsal skin on days 1-3. Mice were challenged with DNCB on their ears and dorsal skin on days 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, and 29. BAPD and Dexamethasone were administered to the animals, from days 14-29, and skin severity scores and behavioral tests were determined. Oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters were evaluated on the dorsal skin of mice. Na+, K+-ATPase activity and corticosterone levels were determined in hippocampus/cerebral cortex and plasma of mice, respectively. BAPD improved cutaneous damage, scratching behavior, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. BAPD showed anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects and restored Na+, K+-ATPase activity and corticosterone levels. The present study was performed using female mice due the susceptibility for this disease. But, the evaluation of AD model in male mice would help to verify whether the male gender has the same predisposition to present this pathology. Our data demonstrated the suppressive effect of BAPD on psychiatric disorders - AD comorbidity by regulating inflammatory and oxidative status in mice.

AB  - Despite clinical data stretching over millennia, the neurobiological basis of the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating diseases of the central nervous system has remained elusive. Here, using an established model of acupuncture treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) model mice, we show that peripheral acupuncture stimulation activates hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons via nerve conduction. We further identify two separate neural pathways originating from anatomically and electrophysiologically distinct MCH neuronal subpopulations, projecting to the substantia nigra and hippocampus, respectively. Through chemogenetic manipulation specifically targeting these MCH projections, their respective roles in mediating the acupuncture-induced motor recovery and memory improvements following PD onset are demonstrated, as well as the underlying mechanisms mediating recovery from dopaminergic neurodegeneration, reactive gliosis, and impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Collectively, these MCH neurons constitute not only a circuit-based explanation for the therapeutic effectiveness of traditional acupuncture, but also a potential cellular target for treating both motor and non-motor PD symptoms.

AB  - Clinical and animal studies suggest that paternal exposure to adverse environments (bad living habits and chronic stress, etc.) has profound impacts on offspring development; however, the mechanism of paternal disease has not been clarified. In this study, a meta-analysis was first performed to suggest that paternal exposure to nicotine, ethanol, or caffeine is a high-risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Next, we created a rat model of paternal nicotine/ethanol/caffeine mixed exposure (PME), whereby male Wistar rats were exposed to nicotine (0.1 mg/kg/d), ethanol (0.5 g/kg/d), and caffeine (7.5 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks continuously, then mated with normal female rats to obtain a fetus (n = 12 for control group, n = 10 for PME group). Then, we analyzed the changes in paternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, testicular function, pregnancy outcomes, fetal serum metabolic indicators, and multiple organ functions to explore the mechanism from the perspective of chronic stress. Our results demonstrated that PME led to enhanced paternal HPA axis activity, decreased sperm quality, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth and absorption, decreased fetal weight and body length, and intrauterine growth retardation), abnormal fetal serum metabolic indicators (corticosterone, glucolipid metabolism, and sex hormones), and fetal multi-organ dysfunction (including hippocampus, adrenal, liver, ossification, and gonads). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the increased paternal corticosterone level was closely related to decreased sperm quality, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and abnormal offspring multi-organ function development. Among them, the decreased activity of the glucocorticoid-insulin-like growth factor 1 (GC-IGF1) axis may be the main mechanism of offspring development and multi-organ dysfunction caused by PME. This study explored the impact of common paternal lifestyle in daily life on offspring development, and proposed the GC-IGF1 programming mechanisms of paternal chronic stress-induced offspring dysplasia, which provides a novel insight for exploring the important role of paternal chronic stress in offspring development and guiding a healthy lifestyle for men.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that exist in three isoforms: PPAR alpha, PPAR beta/delta and PPAR gamma. Studies suggest that the PPAR signalling system may modulate pain, anxiety and cognition. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous signalling via PPARs differentially modulates innate anxiety responses and mnemonic function in the presence and absence of inflammatory pain. We examined the effects of intraperitoneal administration of GW6471 (PPAR alpha antagonist), GSK0660 (PPAR beta/delta antagonist), GW9662 (PPAR gamma antagonist), and N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) on rat behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), light-dark box (LDB), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests in the presence or absence of chronic inflammatory pain. Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-injected rats exhibited impaired recognition and spatial mnemonic performance in the NOR test and pharmacological blockade of PPAR alpha further impaired spatial memory in CFA-treated rats. N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were higher in the dorsal hippocampus in CFA-injected animals compared to their counterparts. The results suggest a modulatory effect of CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain on cognitive processing, but not on innate anxiety-related responses. Increased OEA-PPAR alpha signalling may act as a compensatory mechanism to preserve spatial memory function following CFA injection.

AB  - Numerous results have revealed an association between inhibited function of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) and several neurodegenerative diseases. This was also corroborated by our previous studies which showed that the EAAT3 function was intimately linked to learning and memory. With this premise, we examined the role of EAAT3 in post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and explored the potential benefit of riluzole in countering POCD in the present study. We first established a recombinant adeno-associated-viral (rAAV)-mediated shRNA to knockdown SLC1A1/EAAT3 expression in the hippocampus of adult male mice. The mice then received an intracerebroventricular microinjection of 2 mu g lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to construct the POCD model. In addition, for old male mice, 4 mg/kg of riluzole was intraperitoneally injected for three consecutive days, with the last injection administered 2 h before the LPS microinjection. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze 24 h following the LPS microinjection. Animal behavioral tests, as well as pathological and biochemical assays, were performed to clarify the role of EAAT3 function in POCD and evaluate the effect of activating the EAAT3 function by riluzole. In the present study, we established a mouse model with hippocampal SLC1A1/EAAT3 knockdown and found that hippocampal SLC1A1/EAAT3 knockdown aggravated LPS-induced learning and memory deficits in adult male mice. Meanwhile, LPS significantly inhibited the expression of EAAT3 membrane protein and the phosphorylation level of GluA1 protein in the hippocampus of adult male mice. Moreover, riluzole pretreatment significantly increased the expression of hippocampal EAAT3 membrane protein and also ameliorated LPS-induced cognitive impairment in elderly male mice. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the dysfunction of EAAT3 is an important risk factor for POCD susceptibility and therefore, it may become a promising target for POCD treatment.

AB  - Organic neuromorphic devices and sensors that mimic the functions of chemical synapses and sensory perception in humans have received much attention for next-generation computing and integrated logic circuits. Despite recent advances, organic artificial synapses capable of detecting both neurotransmitters in liquid environments and light are not reported. Herein, inspired by hippocampal synapses, a dual-gate organic synaptic transistor platform with a photoconductive polymer semiconductor, a ferroelectric insulator of P(VDF-TrFE), and an extended-gate electrode functionalized with boronic acid is developed to simultaneously detect the neurotransmitter dopamine and light. The developed synaptic transistor enables memory consolidation upon repetitive exposure to dopamine and polychromatic light, exhibiting effectively modulated postsynaptic currents. This proof-of-concept hippocampal-synapse-mimetic organic neuromorphic system combining a chemical sensor and a photosensor opens new possibilities for developing low-power organic artificial synaptic multisensors and light-induced memory consolidative artificial synapses, and can also contribute to the development of human-machine interfaces.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) is considered to be one of the most promising multipurpose bioenergetic crops. The goal of this study was to carry out laboratory and field research regarding the tops and tubers of 16 Jerusalem artichoke (JA) cultivars grown on sod-podzolic sandy loam soils, taking into account varietal characteristics in order to point out advances in JA potential as alternative feedstock in herbivorous animal husbandry. The height of JA plants produced was from 147 to 280 cm. Having formed by the beginning of September, the size of the assimilating leaf apparatus surface was 0.41 to 2.31 m(2)/plant. In early September, the productivity of JA green mass amounted to 23.6 to 86.0 t/ha for late-maturing cultivars on average; correspondingly, this was 13.0 to 25.4 t/ha for early-maturing cultivars. At the end of October, the "late" cultivars produced 28.2 to 86.9 t/ha of green mass; on the contrary, the herbage of the "early" ones mostly withered and even dried up. The highest gross yield of tubers in early September was obtained from cultivars Diyeticheskiy (43.5 t/ha) and Nadezhda (40.8 t/ha). The average yield of early-maturing cultivars was 13.4 horizontal ellipsis 43.5 t/ha; as for "late" ones, it was reported to be 6.0 horizontal ellipsis 35.9 t/ha. In the third ten-day period of October, tubers of all cultivars gained weight significantly: the average yield of early-maturing cultivar tubers increased up to 33.1 horizontal ellipsis 51.1 t/ha, whereas the average tuber yields of "late" cultivars were 14.4 horizontal ellipsis 43.9 t/ha. On average, the distribution of dry matter content in JA was 28.8 to 29.8% in aboveground biomass and in tubers, 23.8 to 24.0%. According to the chemical composition, cellulose (10.9 to 13.1%) and sugars (4.0 to 4.2%) could be noted to predominate in the green mass, but tubers were high in sugars (16.9 to 17.6%). The analyses on the trace elements (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and Zn) showed that crop green mass contained more Mg (45 to 72 mg/100 g) and Mn (44 to 65 mg/100 g), but for JA tubers, late-maturing cultivars were rich in Si (27.2 to 79.0 mg/100 g) and early-maturing cultivars were mainly high in Zn (32.8 to 46.5 mg/100 g). The highest total coefficient of energy efficiency was displayed by the following cultivars: Novost VIRa (3.09); Tadzhikskiy (2.78); Spindle (2.68); Korenevskiy (2.43); Interes (2.10); and Skorospelka (1.98). In this respect, Jerusalem artichoke certainly has potential as a forage crop that can reach high yields with low external inputs. The data obtained may be useful for farmers who want to adapt and produce this useful and essential crop for the sustainability of feed production.

AB  - Dietary fiber promotes a healthy gut microbiome and shows promise in attenuating the unfavorable microbial changes resulting from a high-fat/sucrose (HFS) diet. High-fiber diets consisting of oligofructose alone (HFS/O) or in combination with beta-glucan (HFS/OB), resistant starch (HFS/OR), or beta-glucan and resistant starch (HFS/OBR) were fed to diet-induced obese rats for 8 weeks to determine if these fibers could attenuate the obese phenotype. Only the HFS/O group displayed a decrease in body weight and body fat, but all fiber interventions improved insulin sensitivity and cognitive function. The HFS/O diet was the least effective at improving cognitive function and only the HFS/OB group showed improvements in glucose tolerance, thus highlighting the differential effects of fiber types. Hippocampal cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) were more pronounced in the HFS/OB group which coincided with the most time spend in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. All fiber groups showed an increase in beneficial Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus abundance while the HFS group showed higher abundance of Clostridium. Fecal microbiota transplant from fiber-treated rats into germ-free mice did not alter body composition in the mice but did result in a higher abundance of Bacteroides in the HFS/O and HFS/OB groups compared to HFS. The HFS/OB recipient mice also had higher insulin sensitivity compared to the other groups. This study highlights the influence of dietary fiber type on metabolic and cognitive outcomes suggesting that the type of supplementation (single or combined fibers) could be tailored to specific targeted outcomes.

AB  - This is a multicentric investigation involving two Italian centers that examined the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients receiving biological therapy targeting type 2 inflammation and those not receiving biologicals. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of respiratory and allergic disorders and the potential impact of biological therapy in the most severe forms has been a point of uncertainty. Our multicentric investigation aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 and the impact of vaccination in an Italian cohort of patients with atopic disorders caused by a type 2 inflammation, such as eosinophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), atopic dermatitis (AD), and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). A questionnaire was given to patients coming to our outpatient clinic for the first evaluation or follow-up visit, asking for the clinical characteristics of the infection, the ongoing therapy during the infection, any relevant change, and the patient's vaccination status. We enrolled 132 atopic patients from two Italian centers; 62 patients were on biological therapy at the time of infection (omalizumab 31%, mepolizumab 26%, benralizumab 19%, and dupilumab 24%). The median age was 56 (IQR 22.8) for patients on biologicals and 48 (IQR 26.5) for those not on biologicals (p = 0.028). The two groups were comparable in terms of sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, and systemic oral corticosteroid use (OCS). There were no significant differences in non-biological therapy and comorbidity between the two groups. The patients not on biological therapy had a prevalence of 87% for asthma, 52% for CRSwNP, 10% for CSU, and 6% for AD. The patients on biologicals had a prevalence of 93% for asthma, 17% for CRSwNP, and 10% for CSU. In our work, we observed that mAbs targeting type 2 inflammation in patients with COVID-19 appeared to be safe, with no worsening of symptoms, prolongation of infection, or increase in hospitalizations. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in the duration of swab positivity (p = 0.45) and duration of symptoms (p = 0.38). During COVID-19, patients on biologicals experienced a significant increase in common cold-like symptoms (p = 0.038), dyspnea (p = 0.016), and more, but not significant, asthma exacerbations, with no significant differences between the different biologicals. Regarding the vaccination status, we observed that there was an increased number of hospitalizations among unvaccinated patients in both groups, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. No patients on biologicals reported safety issues or adverse effects associated with the use of biological treatments during COVID-19. Our investigation showed that mAbs against type 2 inflammation given during Coronavirus Disease 2019 are safe and do not impact the clinical course or main outcomes. Therefore, we found no signals suggesting that anti-Th2 biological therapy should be discontinued during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Controlled studies and analysis, including data from registries and real-life studies, are required to draw firm conclusions regarding the safety or possible advantages that anti-type 2 mAbs could offer in particular clinical contexts, such as infections.

AB  - Background: Researchers have not studied the integrity, orderly correlation, and dynamic openness of complex organisms and explored the laws of systems from a global perspective. In the context of reductionism, antidepressant development formerly focused on advanced technology and molecular details, clear targets and mechanisms, but the clinical results were often unsatisfactory. Purpose: MDD represents an aggregate of different and highly diverse disease subtypes. The co-occurrence of stress-induced nonrandom multimorbidity is widespread, whereas only a fraction of the potential clusters are well known, such as the MDD-FGID cluster. Mapping these clusters, and determining which are nonrandom, is vital for discovering new mechanisms, developing treatments, and reconfiguring services to better meet patient needs. Study design: Acute stress 15-minute forced swimming (AFS) or CUMS protocols can induce the nonrandom MDDFGID cluster. Multiple biological processes of rats with depression -like behaviours and gastrointestinal dysmobility will be captured under conditions of stress, and the Fructus Aurantii-Rhizoma Chuanxiong (ZQCX) decoction will be utilized to dock the MDD-FGID cluster. Methods/results: Here, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, one of the seven components of Chaihu-shugan-San, elicited the best antidepressant effect on CUMS rats, followed by Fructus Aurantii. ZQCX reversed AFS-induced depressionlike behaviours and gastrointestinal dysmobility by regulating the glutamatergic system, AMPAR/BDNF/mTOR/ synapsin I pathway, ghrelin signalling and gastrointestinal nitric oxide synthase. Based on the bioethnopharmacological analysis strategy, the determined meranzin hydrate (MH) and senkyunolide I (SI) by UPLC-PDA, simultaneously absorbed by the jejunum and hippocampus of rats, have been considered major absorbed bioactive compounds acting on behalf of ZQCX. Cotreatment with MH and SI at an equivalent dose in ZQCX synergistically replicated over 50.33 % efficacy of the parent formula in terms of antidepressant and prokinetic actions by modulating neuroinflammation and ghrelin signalling. Conclusion: Brain -centric mind shifts require the integration of multiple central and peripheral systems and the elucidation of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that ultimately contribute to novel therapeutic options. Ghrelin signalling and the immune system may partially underlie multimorbidity vulnerability, and ZQCX anchors stress -induced MDD-FGID clusters by docking them. Combining the results of micro details with the laws of the macro world may be more effective in finding treatments for MDD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Thunbergia erecta (Benth.) was traditionally used as anxiolytic, sedative and antidepressant.Aim of the study: The study aimed to characterize T. erecta leaf ethyl acetate fraction of alcohol extract (TEAF) and evaluate its neuroprotective effect on doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide-induced chemobrain.Materials and methods: Chemical profiling of TEAF was done using (Liquid chromatography coupled with mass (LC-ESI-MS/MS). In vivo chemobrain model was performed by cognitive impairment induced by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Behavioral assessments included moris water maze, y maze, novel object recognition task and passive avoidance tests. Histological examination and oxidative stress markers were investigated. Protein expression of HMDGB1/RAGE/pNF-Kappa B pathway markers was done using western blotting. All results were applied to hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats. Molecular docking was done within the active sites of Human Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) using Discovery studio software.Results: Twenty-one phytoconstituents, mostly polyphenolics, were characterized in TEAF of which eleven compounds were tentatively identified for the first time from T. erecta leaves where rosmarinic acid (11) rep-resents the most prevailing compound. TEAF resulted in a marked dose-dependent amelioration of the histo-pathological changes evidenced by normal histological structure demonstrated in the hypocampal gesture of rats. TEAF demonstrated an enhanced memory and learning functioning in the different behavioral tests assessed especially at 200 mg/kg. It showed significant long-term spatial memory enhancement manifested by 50.32% increase in probe trial relative to chemobrain-induced group. It showed pronounced antioxidant activity evi-denced by the significant elevation of prefrontal cortical and hippocampal reduced glutathione levels by 2.45 and 2.65 folds, respectively relative to the chemobrain-induced group. The pronounced reduction in hydrogen peroxide (1.24-1.93 folds) and malondialdehyde levels (1.42-2.60 folds) with significant elevation of catalase activity (12.65-31.47%) induced by TEAF supported its potent antioxidant activity. TEAF reversed the inflam-matory cytokines release induced by chemotherapy via its interference with HMGB1/RAGE pathway suppressing the expression of HMBG1, RAGE, p65 (NF-kB), and IL-1 beta. In silico studies showed that rosmarinic acid displayed the best fitting at the active site of RAGE (Delta G =-40.39 kcal/mol).Conclusions: Thunbergia erecta can act as a promising remedy for chemobrain that further consolidates its traditional importance.

AB  - Black tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world. It is stronger in taste as well as in flavour compared to other less oxidized teas. It is made from the leaves of the shrub Camellia sinensis var. assamica. Black tea can be supplemented with other plant parts to enhance its flavour and health-promoting properties. In India, Ocimum spp. leaves have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. These leaves can be added during black tea preparation to enhance their aroma and healing activities. O. gratissimum, known as "Scent Leaf", is traditionally used for the management of many diseases, such as the common cold and cough. This work was designed to evaluate the antioxidant interaction between black tea and O. gratissimum (leaves) at five different ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1). To determine the antioxidant activity, chemical-based methods and ex vivo assays were conducted. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were calculated by Folin's reagent and aluminium chloride colorimetric assays, respectively. The antioxidant interactions were determined by the combination index (CI), using CompuSyn software. The black tea exhibited higher radical quenching activity (DPPH, ABTS, and NO) and antihaemolytic and anti-lipid peroxidation potential compared to the Ocimum gratissimum infusion. Variation in the antioxidant capability was observed for various ratios of the black tea and O. gratissimum (BT+OG) combination. The antioxidant interaction between BT and OG ranged from nearly additive to antagonistic. The total phenolic content was higher for O. gratissimum, whereas the total flavonoid content was high in black tea. The binary mixture of BT+OG at all ratios (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) expressed similar phenolic and flavonoid levels. Overall, black tea and O. gratissimum displayed additive antioxidant interaction and the highest free radical scavenging potential at a 3:1 proportion in all the performed parameters.

AB  - Withania somnifera (WS), also known as ashwagandha, is a popular botanical supplement used to treat various conditions including memory loss, anxiety and depression. Previous studies from our group showed an aqueous extract of WS root (WSAq) enhances cognition and alleviates markers for depression in Drosophila. Here, we sought to confirm these effects in the 5xFAD mouse model of beta-amyloid (A beta) accumulation. Six- to seven-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice were treated with WSAq in their drinking water at 0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL or 2.5 mg/mL for four weeks. In the fourth week of treatment, spatial memory, anxiety and depressive-like symptoms were evaluated. At the conclusion of behavioral testing, brain tissue was harvested, immunohistochemistry was performed, and the cortical expression of antioxidant response genes was evaluated. Both concentrations of WSAq improved spatial memory and reduced depressive and anxiety-related behavior. These improvements were accompanied by a reduction in A beta plaque burden in the hippocampus and cortex and an attenuation of activation of microglia and astrocytes. Antioxidant response genes were upregulated in the cortex of WSAq-treated mice. Oral WSAq treatment could be beneficial as a therapeutic option in AD for improving disease pathology and behavioral symptoms. Future studies focused on dose optimization of WSAq administration and further assessment of the mechanisms by which WSAq elicits its beneficial effects will help inform the clinical potential of this promising botanical therapy.

AB  - Collagen is a ubiquitous protein present in the extracellular matrix of all major metazoan animals, with approximately 28 different human collagen types described in the literature, each with unique physicochemical properties. Collagens found broad application in the cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical fields and can be isolated from environmentally sustainable sources such as marine byproducts, which are abundant in the fish processing industry and are highly appealing low-cost sources. In this study, marine collagen was isolated from the skins of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), an unexplored byproduct from fish processing plants, using three different collagen extraction methods, due to the use of distinct salting-out methods using a solution of 2.6 M NaCl + 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, (method I); a combination of 0.7 M NaCl followed by a solution of 2.3 M NaCl + 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH = 7.5 (method II); and one method using only 0.9 M NaCl (method III), yielding COLRp_I, COLRp_II, and COLRp_III collagens. These extracted type I collagens were produced with a yield of around 2 and 4% and characterized regarding the physicochemical properties, considering possible biotechnological applications. This work evidenced that the typical triple helix structure conformation was preserved in all extraction methods, but influenced the thermal behavior, intrinsic morphology, and moisture capacity of the collagens, with interest for biotechnological application, as the incorporation as an ingredient in cosmetic formulation. Furthermore, the use of collagen isolated from skin byproducts represents a high economic value with decreasing collagen cost for industrial purposes and is also an environmentally sustainable source for industrial uses.

AB  - The combination of natural products with standard chemotherapeutic agents offers a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy or reduce the side effects of standard chemotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX), a standard drug for breast cancer, has several disadvantages, including severe side effects and the development of drug resistance. Recently, we reported the potential bioactive markers of Australian propolis extract (AP-1) and their broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. In the present study, we explored the synergistic interactions between AP-1 and DOX in the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells using different synergy quantitation models. Biochemometric and metabolomics-driven analysis was performed to identify the potential anticancer metabolites in AP-1. The molecular mechanisms of synergy were studied by analysing the apoptotic profile via flow cytometry, apoptotic proteome array and measuring the oxidative status of the MCF7 cells treated with the most synergistic combination. Furthermore, label-free quantification proteomics analysis was performed to decipher the underlying synergistic mechanisms. Five prenylated stilbenes were identified as the key metabolites in the most active AP-1 fraction. Strong synergy was observed when AP-1 was combined with DOX in the ratio of 100:0.29 (w/w) as validated by different synergy quantitation models implemented. AP-1 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of DOX against MCF7 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with significant inhibition of the reactive oxygen species (p < 0.0001) compared to DOX alone. AP-1 enabled the reversal of DOX-mediated necrosis to programmed cell death, which may be advantageous to decline DOX-related side effects. AP-1 also significantly enhanced the apoptotic effect of DOX after 24 h of treatment with significant upregulation of catalase, HTRA2/Omi, FADD together with DR5 and DR4 TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (p < 0.05), contributing to the antiproliferative activity of AP-1. Significant upregulation of pro-apoptotic p27, PON2 and catalase with downregulated anti-apoptotic XIAP, HSP60 and HIF-1 alpha, and increased antioxidant proteins (catalase and PON2) may be associated with the improved apoptosis and oxidative status of the synergistic combination-treated MCF7 cells compared to the mono treatments. Shotgun proteomics identified 21 significantly dysregulated proteins in the synergistic combination-treated cells versus the mono treatments. These proteins were involved in the TP53/ATM-regulated non-homologous end-joining pathway and double-strand breaks repairs, recruiting the overexpressed BRCA1 and suppressed RIF1 encoded proteins. The overexpression of UPF2 was noticed in the synergistic combination treatment, which could assist in overcoming doxorubicin resistance-associated long non-coding RNA and metastasis of the MCF7 cells. In conclusion, we identified the significant synergy and highlighted the key molecular pathways in the interaction between AP-1 and DOX in the MCF7 cells together with the AP-1 anticancer metabolites. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted on this synergistic combination.

AB  - Abnormally phosphorylated tau, an early neuropathologic marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), first occurs in the brain's entorhinal cortex layer II (ECII) and then spreads to the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Animal models of tau propagation aiming to recapitulate this phenomenon mostly show tau transfer from ECII stellate neurons to the dentate gyrus, but tau pathology in the dentate gyrus does not appear until advanced stages of AD. Wolframin-1-expressing (Wfs1(+)) pyramidal neurons have been shown functionally to modulate hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice. Here, we report that Wfs1(+) pyramidal neurons are conserved in the ECII of postmortem human brain tissue and that Wfs1 colocalized with abnormally phosphorylated tau in brains from individuals with early AD. Wfs1+ neuron-specific expression of human P301L mutant tau in mouse ECII resulted in transfer of tau to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting spread of tau pathology as observed in the early Braak stages of AD. In mice expressing human mutant tau specifically in the ECII brain region, electrophysiological recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons showed reduced excitability. Multielectrode array recordings of optogenetically stimulated Wfs1(+) ECII axons resulted in reduced CA1 neuronal firing. Chemogenetic activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons showed a reduction in c-fos(+) cells in the CA1. Last, a fear conditioning task revealed deficits in trace and contextual memory in mice overexpressing human mutant tau in the ECII. This work demonstrates tau transfer from the ECII to CA1 in mouse brain and provides an early Braak stage preclinical model of AD.

AB  - Ultrasound is increasingly applied to modify the structures and physicochemical properties of polysaccharides. Hence, this work investigated the ultrasound-induced changes in the rheological behavior and hydrophobic microdomains of Lignosus rhinocerotis polysaccharide (LRP). With an increase in ultrasonic time, the apparent viscosity, storage modulus, loss modulus, and the final percentage recovery of LRP/water system increased to reach the maximum after 10 min treatment and then decreased. These results indicated that short-term (10 min) ultrasound could increase the strength of the network structure of LRP/water system, while longer-term ultrasound (30 and 60 min) weakened the network structure. The self-healing properties of LRP/water system was not affected by ultrasound treatment according to repeated strain and time sweep data. The critical aggregation concentration of the LRP/water system decreased from 2.5 to 1.8 mg/mL after 10 min ultrasound and the number of hydrophobic microdomains increased, suggesting that ultrasound promoted the hydrophobic aggregation of LRP.

TI  - Highly potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ inhibitors as broad-spectrum anti-rhinoviral agents
T2  - RSC MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
LA  - English
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Human rhinoviruses (hRVs) cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections and exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. hRVs comprise more than 160 strains with considerable genetic variation. Their high diversity and strain-specific interactions with antisera hinder the development of anti-hRV therapeutic agents. Phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III beta (PI4KIII beta) is a key enzyme in the phosphoinositide signalling pathway that is crucial for the replication and survival of various viruses. We identified novel PI4KIII beta inhibitors, N-(4-methyl-5-arylthiazol)-2-amide derivatives, by generating a hit compound, 1a, from the high-throughput screening of a chemical library, followed by the optimization study of 1a. Inhibitor 7e exhibited the highest activity (EC50 = 0.008, 0.0068, and 0.0076 mu M for hRV-B14, hRV-A16, and hRV-A21, respectively) and high toxicity (CC50 = 6.1 mu M). Inhibitor 7f showed good activity and low toxicity and provided the highest selectivity index (SI >= 4638, >3116, and >2793 for hRV-B14, hRV-A16, and hRV-A21, respectively). Furthermore, 7f showed broad-spectrum activities against various hRVs, coxsackieviruses, and other enteroviruses, such as EV-A71 and EV-D68. The binding mode of the inhibitors was investigated using 7f, and the experimental results of plaque reduction, replicon and cytotoxicity, and time-of-drug-addition assays suggested that 7f acts as a PI4KIII beta inhibitor. The kinase inhibition activity of this series of compounds against PI4KIII alpha and PI4KIII beta was assessed, and 7f demonstrated kinase inhibition activity with an IC50 value of 0.016 mu M for PI4KIII beta, but not for PI4KIII alpha (>10 mu M). Therefore, 7f represents a highly potent and selective PI4KIII beta inhibitor for the further development of antiviral therapy against hRVs or other enteroviruses.

AB  - Dynamic pathogen exposure may impact the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2). One potential explanation for the lack of severe SCV2-related morbidity and mortality in Southeast Asia is prior exposure to related betacoronaviruses. Recent discoveries of SCV2-related betacoronaviruses from horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia suggest the potential for bat-to-human spillover exposures in the region. In this work, serum antibodies to protein constructs from SCV2 and a representative bat coronavirus isolated in Cambodia (RshSTT182) are measured in pre-pandemic Cambodian human sera using ELISA assays. Of 293 Cambodian samples tested (N = 131 with acute malaria, n = 162 with acute undifferentiated febrile illness), 32 (10.9%) are seropositive for SCV2 based on established Spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) cutoffs. Within SCV2 seropositive samples, 16 (50%) have higher antibody levels to antigens from the representative virus RshSTT182 versus SCV2 antigens; competitive binding ELISA assays demonstrate inhibition of reactivity to SCV2 Spike after pre-incubation with RshSTT182 Spike. Surrogate virus neutralization tests demonstrate that 8/30 (26.7%) SCV2 ELISA positive pre-pandemic Cambodian samples have neutralizing activity against SCV2, while 14/30 (46.7%) have activity against other SCV2-related betacoronaviruses. These data suggest that exposure to related betacoronaviruses may elicit cross-reactive immunity to SCV2 prior to the global pandemic.

AB  - The recent identification of plasma membrane (Ca2+)-ATPase (PMCA)-Neuroplastin (Np) complexes has renewed attention on cell regulation of cytosolic calcium extrusion, which is of particular relevance in neurons. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PMCA-Neuroplastin complexes exist in specific ganglioside-containing rafts, which could affect calcium homeostasis. We analyzed the abundance of all four PMCA paralogs (PMCA1-4) and Neuroplastin isoforms (Np65 and Np55) in lipid rafts and bulk membrane fractions from GM2/GD2 synthase-deficient mouse brains. In these fractions, we found altered distribution of Np65/Np55 and selected PMCA isoforms, namely PMCA1 and 2. Cell surface staining and confocal microscopy identified GM1 as the main complex ganglioside co-localizing with Neuroplastin in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, blocking GM1 with a specific antibody resulted in delayed calcium restoration of electrically evoked calcium transients in the soma of hippocampal neurons. The content and composition of all ganglioside species were unchanged in Neuroplastin-deficient mouse brains. Therefore, we conclude that altered composition or disorganization of ganglioside-containing rafts results in changed regulation of calcium signals in neurons. We propose that GM1 could be a key sphingolipid for ensuring proper location of the PMCA-Neuroplastin complexes into rafts in order to participate in the regulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis.

AB  - Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common adult hematologic malignancy, with relapse and drug resistance posing major challenges despite treatment advances. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), a diterpenoid compound derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits anticancer activity in various tumors. However, its role and mechanisms in AML remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the inhibitory effects of CTS on AML cells and its potential mechanisms.Methods Network pharmacology was employed to identify potential AML-related targets of CTS, and a disease-drug-target interaction network was constructed. The effects of CTS on KG-1 cells were assessed using CCK-8 proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to analyze the regulatory effects of CTS on the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) signaling pathway. The role of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in CTS-induced AML inhibition was further explored.Results Network pharmacology analysis identified key AML-related targets of CTS, enriched in multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. Experimental results showed that CTS inhibited KG-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, induced S-phase arrest, and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, CTS treatment significantly upregulated ERS-related key proteins. While YAP overexpression attenuated CTS-induced ERS activation and reduced apoptosis levels.Conclusion This study indicates that CTS inhibits AML cell proliferation and induces apoptosis while activating the ERS signaling pathway. However, aberrant activation of the Hippo-YAP pathway weakens this effect. These findings provide novel theoretical insights into potential therapeutic strategies for AML.

AB  - Chronic social isolation (CSIS)-induced alternation in synaptic and mitochondrial function of specific brain regions is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite the wide number of available medications, treating MDD remains an important challenge. Although fluoxetine (Flx) is the most frequently prescribed antidepressant, its mode of action is still unknown. To delineate affected molecular pathways of depressive-like behavior and identify potential targets upon Flx treatment, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of hippocampal purified synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) of rats exposed to six weeks of CSIS, an animal model of depression, and/or followed by Flx treatment (lasting three weeks of six-week CSIS) to explore synaptic protein profile changes. Results showed that Flx in controls mainly induced decreased expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism and the redox system. CSIS led to increased expression of proteins that mainly participate in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Camk2)-related neurotransmission, vesicle transport, and ubiquitination. Flx treatment of CSIS rats predominantly increased expression of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking (exocytosis and endocytosis), and energy metabolism (glycolytic and mitochondrial respiration). Overall, these Flx-regulated changes in synaptic and mitochondrial proteins of CSIS rats might be critical targets for new therapeutic development for the treatment of MDD.

AB  - Patients with vascular dementia, caused by cerebral ischemia, experience long-term cognitive impairment due to the lack of effective treatment. The mechanisms of and treatments for vascular dementia have been investigated in various animal models; however, the insufficient information on gene expression changes that define pathological conditions hampers progress. To investigate the underlying mechanism of and facilitate treatment development for vascular dementia, we established a mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, including bilateral carotid artery stenosis, by using microcoils, and elucidated the molecular pathway underlying vascular dementia development. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1/2, which regulates cellular structure, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) were upregulated in the vascular dementia model. However, expression of claudin-5, which maintains the blood-brain barrier, and MAP2 as a nerve cell-specific factor, was decreased in the hippocampal region of the vascular dementia model. Thus, we revealed that ROCK pathway activation loosens the tight junction of the blood-brain barrier and increases the influx of inflammatory cytokines into the hippocampal region, leading to neuronal death and causing cognitive and emotional dysfunction. Our vascular dementia model allows effective study of the vascular dementia mechanism. Moreover, the ROCK pathway may be a target for vascular dementia treatment development in the future.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders are prevalent stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders and involve multiple molecular changes and dysfunctions across various brain regions. However, the specific and shared pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in these regions remain unclear. Previous research used a rat model of chronic mild stress (CMS) to segregate and identify depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups; then the proteomes of six distinct brain regions (the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, pituitary, olfactory bulb, and striatum) were separately and quantitatively analyzed. To gain a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the molecular abnormalities, this study aimed to investigate and compare differential proteomics data from the six regions. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in between specific regions and across all regions and subjected to a series of bioinformatics analyses. Regional comparisons showed that stress-induced proteomic changes and corresponding gene ontology and pathway enrichments were largely distinct, attributable to differences in cell populations, protein compositions, and brain functions of these areas. Additionally, a notable degree of overlap in the significantly enriched terms was identified, potentially suggesting strong connections in the enrichment across different regions. Furthermore, intra-regional and inter-regional protein-protein interaction networks and drug-target-DEP networks were constructed. Integrated analysis of the three association networks in the six regions, along with the DisGeNET database, identified ten DEPs as potential targets for anti-depression/anxiety drugs. Collectively, these findings revealed commonalities and differences across different brain regions at the protein level induced by CMS, and identified several novel protein targets for the development of new therapeutics for depression and anxiety.

AB  - Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic compound with antiviral properties, often encountered in dietary supplements and herbal drugs. Data on the pharmacokinetics of RA are lacking in cases of the chronic use of supplements containing this compound, and only limited data on the metabolism and distribution of RA are available. The aim of the study was to investigate the plasma levels of RA after 12 weeks of use and determine potential interactions of RA and selected antiretroviral drugs. Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus took a supplement containing RA for 12 weeks, after which the RA concentrations in the plasma samples were analyzed. A detailed in silico analysis was conducted in order to elucidate the potential interactions between RA and the drugs efavirenz, darunavir and raltegravir. It was found that RA can be detected in patients' plasma samples, mainly in the form of sulphoglucuronide. The potential interactions are suggested on the level of liver metabolizing enzymes and efflux P-glycoprotein, with RA competing with antiretroviral drugs as a substrate in metabolism and distribution systems. The present study suggests that the simultaneous use of RA and antiretroviral therapy (containing efavirenz, darunavir or raltegravir) may affect the plasma levels of RA after prolonged supplementation.

AB  - Since ancient times, silver has been known for its pronounced bactericidal, antiviral and fungicidal properties. Currently, nanoparticles of this metal are widely used in the food, light and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in medicine. Silver in any form can have a toxic effect not only on pathogens, but also on healthy cells. The biological activity and bioavailability of silver preparations depend on the degree of their solubility in water. In addition, the maximum permissible concentration of soluble forms of silver is an order of magnitude lower than that of insoluble forms. This makes nanoparticles of silver with a hydrophilic coating that form stable colloidal solutions in aqueous media potentially unsafe objects. In this work, we studied the kinetics of the accumulation of silver nanoparticles with an average size of 34 +/- 5 nm stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone in the organs of laboratory C57Bl/6 mice. The administration of nanoparticles was carried out orally for 30, 60, 120 and 180 days at the dose of 50 mu g/day/animal. All the mice developed and gained weight normally during the experiment. No adverse effects were observed. Determination of the silver content in biological tissues of mammals was accomplished by neutron activation analysis. The masses and concentrations of silver in the brain and its different sections (hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex and remnants), as well as in the lungs, testes, liver, blood, kidneys, spleen and heart, were determined. The injection times at which the accumulation curves reached saturation were established. An extremely high accumulation of silver in the testes was shown at 120 days of administration, and a significant accumulation of silver in the lungs and brain was observed. The accumulation of silver in all parts of the brain except the cortex was significant, and its trend was similar to that in the whole brain.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and a reduction in hippocampal neurotrophins, in which trimethytin (TMT) infusion causes tangles and neuronal dysfunction, creating an AD-like model in rats. Previous studies have demonstrated that crocin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, can enhance learning, memory acquisition, and cognitive behavior. This study aimed to assess the combined impact of aerobic exercise and crocin on memory, learning, and hippocampal Tau and neurotrophins gene expression in AD-like model rats.Methods Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: (1) healthy control, (2) Alzheimer's control, (3) endurance training, (4) crocin consumption, and (5) endurance training + crocin. Alzheimer's induction was achieved in groups 2-5 through intraperitoneal injection of 8 mg/kg TMT. Rats in groups 3 and 5 engaged in treadmill running three sessions per week, 15-30 min per session, at a speed of 15-20 m/min for eight weeks, and groups 4 and 5 received daily crocin supplementation of 25 mg/kg.Results Alzheimer's induction with TMT showed significant reduction in memory, learning, NGF, BDNF, and TrkB gene expression, and increase in tau gene expression (all p < 0.05). Notably, endurance training and crocin consumption separately significantly increased memory, learning, NGF, BDNF, and TrkB gene expression while significantly decreasing tau gene expression (all p < 0.05). Importantly, combined endurance training with crocin yielded the most profound effects on memory (p = 0.001), NGF (p = 0.002), BDNF (p = 0.001), and TrkB (p = 0.003) gene expression (p < 0.005), as well as a reduction in tau gene expression (p = 0.001).Conclusion These findings underscore the possible impact of endurance training, particularly when coupled with crocin, on enhancing memory, learning, and neurotrophin gene expression and reducing tau gene expression in Alzheimer's rats. These results highlight the possibility of synergistic interventions for improved therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - The strongest known genetic risk factor for generalized epilepsy is the human hemizygous 15q13.3 microdeletion (MD). This 1.5 Mb MD encompasses six genes, including CHRNA7 encoding the alpha7 subunit that forms the homo-pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a known regulator of the immune system. In the CNS, hyper activation of neuroimmune responses contributes to increased seizure susceptibility. In a mouse model with a hemizygous deletion of the orthologous region (Df(h15q13)/+) (Het), we previously demonstrated increased hippocampal expression of inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype (WT) mice following a mild peripheral immune challenge. To further characterize neuroimmune responses, hippocampal mRNA expression of the chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL10, and the Gap junction protein connexin 43 (GJA1), all of which are implicated in neuronal hyperexcitability, were determined along with additional immune related targets. Three hours after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C), 5 mg/kg) injection (i.p.), hippocampi were collected, mRNA extracted, and cDNA prepared for qPCR. The results demonstrate extensive upregulation of CXCL2 and CXCL10 expression by LPS and Poly(I:C) (up to 200-fold CXCL2, up to 600-fold CXCL10) (p G 0.0001) with genotype x treatment interactions for CXCL2 by LPS (p G 0.007). Responses to treatment were far smaller in magnitude for all other targets. LPS and Poly(I:C) induced statistically similar increases for Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, HMGB1, and C3, but Poly(I:C) had stronger effects on GJA1, TLR3, C1qA and MARCO expression. Remarkably, TLR3 was the only target with significant downregulation of expression after Poly(I:C) (p G 0.0001). In addition, genotype x treatment interactions were detected for TLR3, TLR4, HMGB1, and C1qA (p G 0.02). Thus, a peripheral immune challenge caused extensive increases for CXCL2 and CXCL10, and the genotype-treatment interactions that was seen for several targets, underscored the augmented neuroinflammatory response in mice carrying the MD. Of note is the dramatic upregulation of CXCL10 by low dose Poly(I:C). CXCL10 causes hyperexcitability via neuronal CXCR3 activation. Thus, even an asymptomatic viral infection may increase seizure susceptibility. In summary, a peripheral immune challenge causes strong upregulation of hippocampal inflammatory mediators implicated in neuronal excitability which is particularly detrimental for individuals with high seizure susceptibility, such as carriers of the 15q13.3 MD.

AB  - Killian's (antrochoanal) polyp is a unilateral nasal polypoid lesion of the maxillary sinus especially affecting children and young adults with unilateral nasal obstruction, pus discharge, and headache. Although its etiology is unclear, chronic inflammation, autoreactivity, allergies, and viral infections are implicated in its formation and development, causing nasal tissue remodeling. In this context, we isolated and cultured mesenchymal stem cells from surgical biopsies of three patients with Killian nasal polyp (KNP-MSCs) while healthy nasal tissue (HNT-MSCs) was used as control. Our results demonstrated that KNP-MSCs exhibited reduced cell proliferation compared to HNT-MSCs, and migrated less than the control, showing a partial epithelial phenotype with low mRNA levels of I-CAM and a significant increase of E-cad. Subsequently, both MSCs were induced to osteoblastic or adipocyte differentiation for up to 20 days. KNP-MSCs underwent to differentiate into osteoblasts but exhibited reduced ALP activity and calcium deposits and low mRNA levels of osteogenesis-associated genes compared to osteogenic induced-HNT-MSCs. Conversely, KNP-MSCs and HNT-MSCs have shown the same adipogenic differentiation potential, with a similar lipid droplet amount, adipocyte gene expression, and triacylglycerols content. Taken together, these results first demonstrated the cellular and molecular characterization of MSCs derived from the Killian nasal polyp.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the role and regulatory mechanisms of Ezrin in synovial vessels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synovial tissues were obtained from people with osteoarthritis people and patients with RA patients. We also used an antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) mice model by using Freund's adjuvant injections. Ezrin expression was analysed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining in synovial vessels of patients with RA and AIA mice. We investigated the role of Ezrin on vascular endothelial cells and its regulatory mechanism in vivo and in vitro by adenoviral transfection technology. Our results suggest a role for the Ezrin protein in proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells in RA. We also demonstrate that Ezrin plays an important role in vascular endothelial cell migration and tube formation through regulation of the Hippo-yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. YAP, as a key protein, can further regulate the activity of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in vascular endothelial cells. In AIA mice experiments, we observed that the inhibition of Ezrin or of its downstream YAP pathway can affect synovial angiogenesis and may lead to progression of RA. In conclusion, Ezrin plays an important role in angiogenesis in the RA synovium by regulating YAP nuclear translocation and interacting with the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.

AB  - Brain injuries in automated vehicles during crash events are likely to include mechanisms of head impact in non-standard positions and postures (i.e., occupants not facing forward in an upright position). Federal regulations currently focus on impact conditions in primary planes of motion, such as frontal or rear impacts (sagittal plane of motion) or side impact (coronal plane of motion) and do not account for out of position occupants or non-standard postures. The objective of the present study was to develop and use the anatomically accurate brain finite element model to parametrically determine the injury metrics under different vectors with head rotation. A custom developed brain finite element model with anatomical accuracy and several anatomical regions defined was used to evaluate whole-brain strain as well as regional brain strain. Cumulative Strain Damage Measure (CSDM) at a threshold of 20% strain and the 95th percentile of the maximum principal strain (MPS95) were calculated for the whole brain and each brain region under multiple rotational directions. The model was exposed to a sinusoidal angular acceleration pulse of 5000 rad per second squared (rad/s(2-)) over 12.5 ms. The same pulse was used in the primary axes of motion and (lateral bending, flexion, extension, axial rotation) and combined axes representing oblique flexion and oblique extension. Whole brain CSDM20 was highest for lateral bending. Whole brain MPS95 was highest for axial rotation. The rCSDM20 was more susceptible to impact direction, with several brain regions having substantial accumulation of strain for oblique flexion and lateral bending. Comparatively, rMPS95 was more consistent across all rotation directions. The present study quantified the regional brain strain response under multiple rotational vectors identifying a high amount of variability in the accumulation of strain (i.e., CSDM20) in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain specifically. While there was a high amount of variability in the accumulation of strain for multiple regions, the maximum strain measured (i.e., MPS95) in the regions was more consistent.

AB  - beta II spectrin (beta 2SP) is encoded by Sptbn1 and is involved in the regulation of various cell functions. beta 2SP contributes to the formation of the myelin sheath, which may be related to the mechanism of neuropathy caused by demyelination. As one of the main features of cerebral ischemia, demyelination plays a key role in the mechanism of cerebral ischemia injury. Here, we showed that beta 2SP levels were increased, and this molecule interacted with TET2 after ischemic injury. Furthermore, we found that the level of TET2 was decreased in the nucleus when beta 2SP was knocked out after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and the level of 5hmC was reduced in the OGD+beta 2SP KO group. In contrast, the expression of beta 2SP did not change in TET2 KO mice. In addition, the 5hmC sequencing results revealed that beta 2SP can affect the level of 5hmC, the differentially hydroxymethylated region (DhMR) mainly related with the Calcium signalling pathway, cGMP-PKG signalling pathway, Wnt signalling pathway and Hippo signalling pathway. In summary, our results suggest that beta 2SP could regulate the gene 5hmC by interacted with TET2 and will become a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

AB  - The accumulation of amyloid-beta(1)(-)(4)(2) (A beta(1)(-)(4)(2)) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to intracellular calcium dysregulation and neuronal death. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), play a pivotal role in intracellular calcium release and homeostasis. In this study, we employed an in vitro model of AD using cultured rat hippocampal neurons treated with A beta(1)(-)(4)(2) to investigate the effects of dantrolene, a RyR antagonist, on calcium signaling and neuronal viability. Dantrolene significantly reduced basal cytosolic calcium levels and attenuated stimulus-induced calcium transients in response to depolarizing solution, electrical field stimulation, and caffeine application. These findings indicate that dantrolene stabilizes intracellular calcium signaling by limiting calcium release from ER stores. Furthermore, co-application of dantrolene with A beta(1)(-)(4)(2) increased neuronal survival from 26 to 76% and significantly reduced the proportions of apoptotic and necrotic cells. These results demonstrate that RyRs contribute to calcium overload and neurotoxicity under AD-like conditions and that dantrolene effectively counteracts A beta(1)(-)(4)(2)-induced calcium dysregulation. Altogether, our findings support the calcium hypothesis of AD and highlight dantrolene as a potential disease-modifying agent targeting ER-mediated calcium homeostasis.

AB  - The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a pleiotropic hormone very well known for its incretin effect in the glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion. However, GLP-1 is also produced in the brain, and it displays critical roles in neuroprotection by activating the GLP-1 receptor signaling pathways. GLP-1 enhances learning and memory in the hippocampus, promotes neurogenesis, decreases inflammation and apoptosis, modulates reward behavior, and reduces food intake. Its pharmacokinetics have been improved to enhance the peptide's half-life, enhancing exposure and time of action. The GLP-1 agonists are successfully in clinical use for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, obesity, and clinical evaluation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI) is significant, some studies have shown that it is related to mitochondrial respiratory chain homeostasis, but the specific mechanism is not clear. 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA) is a novel short-chain fatty acid with potential applications in the treatment of metabolic diseases because it can regulate mitochondrial disorders. Our aim was to explore a novel mechanism of action for 2-HIBA in the treatment of DCI in mitochondrial respiratory chain homeostasis. Methods: Metabolic substances and differentially active metabolic pathways in the serum of diseased mice were identified based on multi-omics analysis. The nanoLC-Obitrap-MS technology was utilized to detect the content of selected small molecules with differential metabolic activity in the hippocampus and mitochondria of mice to evaluate their permeability through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and outer mitochondrial membrane. A combination of behavioral, proteomic, and molecular biology approaches was used to explore specific regulatory mechanisms and identify potential pharmacological targets. Additionally, using techniques such as protein thermal shift, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), hydrolase stability, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, we demonstrated the direct binding effects of small molecule metabolites with protein targets. Results: 2-HIBA was found to directly ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in db/db mice by penetrating the bloodbrain barrier and reversing the decrease in the protein content of NADH dehydrogenase 3 (MT-ND3) in the hippocampus through direct binding to ND3. This action helps maintain the stability of NAD+/NADH and regulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain balance. Furthermore, a combined medication plant agonist of 2HIBA can enhance the expression of MT-ND3, thereby improving cognitive dysfunction in mice. Conclusion: MT-ND3 is a crucial target for improving diabetic cognitive dysfunction, and 2-HIBA can directly bind to the MT-ND3 protein to alleviate the functional impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in mice to treat DCI.

AB  - To investigate the impact mechanisms of vitamin D on inflammatory factors and neutrophil activity in preterm pregnant rats. 24 pregnant rats were selected as the research objects and randomly divided into control group, LPS group and LPS + VD group, with 8 rats in each group. On the second day of pregnancy, the LPS + VD group was injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/L vitamin D30.2 mL, and the LPS group and the control group were injected with the same amount of 0.9% NaCl twice a day. On the seventh day of pregnancy, the LPS group and the LPS + VD group were injected with 0.2 mL LPS into the tail vein to establish a preterm labor model induced by infection. The control group was injected with the same amount of physiological saline into the tail vein. Placental tissues from rats in the LPS + VD group and the LPS group were collected, and the expression levels of inflammatory factors TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, and VDBP were detected by immunohistochemistry. At the same time, serum IL-2 concentration was measured by ELISA and radioimmunoassay, the activity of neutrophils was evaluated by flow cytometry, and the expression of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway protein was detected by Western blot. Compared with the control group, the content of TNF-alpha, VDBP, and TGF-beta 1 in placenta in LPS group were higher than that in the control group (P < 5); Compared with the LPS group, the contents of TNF-alpha, BP and TGF-beta 1 in the LPS+VD group were significantly reduced,(P < 0.05); Compared with the control group, the serum IL-2 concentration in the LPS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05); Compared with the LPS group, the serum IL-2 concentration in the LPS + VD group decreased significantly (P < 0.05); Compared with the control group, the neutrophil ratio and absolute neutrophil value in the LPS group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05); Compared with the LPS group, the neutrophil ratio and absolute value of neutrophils decreased (P < 0.05); compared with the control group, the expression levels of YAP and P-YAP protein in the LPS group increased (P < 0.05); compared with the LPS group, the expression levels of YAP and P-YAP protein in the LPS + VD group decreased (P < 0.05). Vitamin D can improve the immune status of preterm pregnant mice by inhibiting the expression of placental inflammatory factors.

AB  - <bold>Introduction:</bold> Pubertal maturation is marked by significant changes in stress-induced hormonal responses mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with prepubertal male and female rats often exhibiting greater HPA reactivity compared to adult males and females. Though the implications of these changes are unclear, elevated stress responsiveness might contribute to the stress-related vulnerabilities often associated with puberty. <bold>Methods:</bold> The current experiments sought to determine whether differences in cellular activation, as measured by FOS immunohistochemistry, or excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit expression, as measured by qRT-PCR, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were associated with these noted pubertal shifts in stress reactivity in male and female rats. As the PVN is the key nucleus responsible for activating the hormonal stress response, we predicted greater cellular activation and higher expression levels of glutamate receptor subunits in the PVN of prepubertal males and females compared to their adult counterparts. <bold>Results:</bold> Our FOS data revealed that while prepubertal males showed greater stress-induced activation in the PVN than adult males, prepubertal females showed less activation than adult females. Moreover, many of the NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptor subunits measured, including Grin1, Grin2b, Gria1, Gria2, Grik1, and Grik2, had higher expression levels in adults, particularly in males. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Though not supporting our initial predictions, these data do indicate that age and stress influence the activation of the PVN and the expression of glutamate receptor subunits important in its function. These data also suggest that the effects of age and stress are different in males and females. Though still far from a clear understanding of what mechanism(s) mediate pubertal shift in stress reactivity, these data add to our growing understanding of how age, stress, and sex influence HPA function.

AB  - The Syngnathidae (seahorses and pipefishes) are a group of teleost fishes in which, uniquely, developing embryos are hosted throughout pregnancy by males, using a specialized brood pouch situated on the abdomen or tail. Seahorses have evolved the most advanced form of brood pouch, whereby zygotes and embryos are intimately connected to the host's circulatory system and also bathed in pouch fluid. The pouch is closed to the external environment and has to perform functions such as gaseous exchange, removal of waste and maintenance of appropriate osmotic conditions, much like the mammalian placenta. Fertilization of the oocytes occurs within the brood pouch, but unlike the mammalian situation the sperm transport mechanism from the ejaculatory duct towards the pouch is unclear, and the sperm: egg ratio (about 5:1) is possibly the least of any vertebrate. In this review, there is highlighting of the difficulty of elucidating the sperm transport mechanism, based on studies of Hippocampus kuda. The similarities between seahorse pouch function and the mammalian placenta have led to suggestions that the pouch provides important nutritional support for the developing embryos, supplementing the nutritional functions of the yolk sac provided by the oocytes. In this review, there is a description of the recent evidence in support of this hypothesis, and also emphasis, as in mammals, that embryonic development depends on nutritional support from the placenta-like pouch at important stages of the gestational period ("critical windows").

AB  - Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol derived from turmeric, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The current study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in the hippocampal subfields (CA1 and CA3) after exposure to cobalt (Co) and the impact of ERK protein. Twenty-eight albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups, each with seven randomly selected rats as follows: Control (distilled water), Cobalt (Co) only (40 mg/kg), 120 mg/kg or 240 mg/kg curcumin + Co (40 mg/kg). Treatment was via oral gavage for 28 days. We performed a biochemical investigation to determine the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha and IL-1 beta). Furthermore, we conducted an immunohistochemical evaluation to assess the expression of IBA1 by microglial cells and the immunoexpression of ERK protein in the hippocampus. Results revealed a significant (p<0.05) elevation in the tissue level of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta, an increase in the number of IBA1-positive microglia, and upregulation of ERK protein in the hippocampal subfields of the rats after exposure to cobalt-only. Nevertheless, pretreatment with curcumin restored these parameters to levels comparable to control. In conclusion, our results showed that curcumin abrogated the Co-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing the release of proinflammatory biomarkers, reducing microgliosis, and modulating the ERK/MAPK pathway.

AB  - In recent decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has rapidly increased, leading us to explore the complex underlying mechanisms. We identified the gene Phospholipase C Delta 3 (PLCD3) as a potential oncogene in TC by conducting the whole transcriptome sequencing. Our study is to understand the oncogenic role of PLCD3 in TC. We verified the overexpression of PLCD3 in TC from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus databases, and a locally validated cohort. Clinical correlation analysis showed that PLCD3 expression was related to histological type, T stage, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and disease stage. The high expression of PLCD3 could be a distinguishing factor for TC and its LNM. The biological function was examined using small interfering RNA-transfected TC cell lines. Silenced PLCD3 could inhibit colony formation, migration, and invasion ability and promote apoptosis of TC cell lines. PLCD3 silencing reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition but induced the apoptotic progress. Further exploration revealed that PLCD3 might be associated with critical genes of the Hippo pathway. The expressions of RHOA, YAP1/TAZ, and their downstream targets were decreased significantly when PLCD3 was down-regulated. YAP1 overexpression rescued the tumor-suppressive effect caused by PLCD3 silencing. This study demonstrates that PLCD3 is an oncogene that supports tumorigenesis and progression in TC, and PLCD3 may be a potential target gene for TC treatment.

AB  - Mild hypothermia (MH) is an effective measure to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. This study set out to investigate dynamic changes in urinary proteome due to MH in rats with cerebral I/R injury and explore the neuroprotective mechanisms of MH. A Pulsinelli's four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) rat model was used to mimic global cerebral I/R injury. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed to profile the urinary proteome of rats with/without MH (32 degrees C) treatment after I/R injury. Representative differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with MH were validated by western blotting in hippocampus. A total of 597 urinary proteins were identified, among which 119 demonstrated significant changes associated with MH. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of the DEPs revealed that MH significantly enriched in endopeptidase activity, inflammatory response, aging, response to oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, blood coagulation, and cell adhesion. Notably, changes in 12 DEPs were significantly reversed by MH treatment. Among them, 8 differential urinary proteins were previously reported to be closely associated with brain disease, including NP, FZD1, B2M, EPCR, ATRN, MB, CA1and VPS4A. Two representative proteins (FZD1, B2M) were further validated by western blotting in the hippocampus and the results were shown to be consistent with urinary proteomic analysis. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that urinary proteome can sensitively reflect pathophysiological changes in the brain, and appears to be the first study to explore the neuroprotective effects of MH by urinary proteomic analysis. FZD1 and B2M may be involved in the most fundamental molecular biological mechanisms of MH neuroprotection.Graphical Abstract In a 4-VO rat model, 119 urinary proteins demonstrated significant changes associated with MH. MH is enriched in endopeptidase activity, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, etc, and significantly reversed changes in 12 DEPs. FZD1 and B2M are thought to be involved in the most fundamental molecular biological mechanisms of MH neuroprotection.

AB  - This study investigates the therapeutic advantages of agomelatine in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a mouse model, with twenty healthy male SWR/J mice participating in the research. Many approaches were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments; these approaches included body weight analysis, evaluations of short-term memory, biomarker assessments, histopathological examinations, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results suggest that agomelatine treatment effectively countered the weight loss associated with AD. Importantly, agomelatine enhanced cognitive performance, as indicated by improved short-term memory in spatial recognition assessments; mice treated with agomelatine showed spontaneous alternation percentages comparable to controls, with statistically significant differences observed between AD and control groups (Dunn's post-hoc p = 0.0072). Analyses of biomarkers showed that agomelatine reduced the AD-induced elevation of acetylcholinesterase activity, interleukin-6 levels, and oxidative stress markers while increasing total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological assessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR spectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular structure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and preventing protein oxidation in the C = O spectral range, both of which are typically altered by AD pathology. These results emphasize the efficacy of agomelatine and support its consideration in mitigating symptoms associated with AD etiology.

AB  - The metazoan lifespan is determined in part by a complex signaling network that regulates energy metabolism and stress responses. Key signaling hubs in this network include insulin/IGF-1, AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins. The Hippo/Mammalian Ste20-like Kinase1 (MST1) pathway has been reported to maintain lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, but its role has not been studied in higher metazoans. In this study, we report that overexpression of Hpo, the MST1 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, decreased lifespan with concomitant changes in lipid metabolism and aging-associated gene expression, while RNAi Hpo depletion increased lifespan. These effects were mediated primarily by Hpo-induced transcriptional activation of the RNA-binding protein maternal expression at 31B (Me31b)/RCK, resulting in stabilization of mRNA-encoding a lipolytic hormone, Akh. In mouse adipocytes, Hpo/Mst1 mediated adipocyte differentiation, phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins such as Rck, decapping MRNA 2 (Dcp2), enhancer Of MRNA decapping 3 (Edc3), nucleolin (NCL), and glucagon mRNA stability by interacting with Rck. Decreased lifespan in Hpo-overexpressing Drosophila lines required expression of Me31b, but not DCP2, which was potentially mediated by recovering expression of lipid metabolic genes and formation of lipid droplets. Taken together, our findings suggest that Hpo/Mst1 plays a conserved role in longevity by regulating adipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism.

AB  - The efficacy of a ketogenic diet (KD) in controlling seizure has been shown in many experimental and clinical studies, however, its mechanism of action still needs further clarification. The major goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of the commercially available KD and caloric restriction (CR) on the hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) threshold in rats, and concomitant biochemical changes, specifically concerning the kynurenine pathway, in plasma and the hippocampus. As expected, the rats on the KD showed higher AD threshold accompanied by increased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate level compared to the control group and the CR rats. This group presented also lowered tryptophan and elevated kynurenic acid levels in plasma with similar changes in the hippocampus. Moreover, the KD rats showed decreased levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA) in plasma and the hippocampus. No regular biochemical changes were observed in the CR group. Our results are analogous to those detected after single administrations of fatty acids and valproic acid in our previous studies, specifically to an increase in the kynurenine pathway activity and changes in peripheral and central BCAA and AAA levels. This suggests that the anticonvulsant effect of the KD may be at least partially associated with those observed biochemical alternations.

AB  - It has been suggested that functional traits of the adult brain-all of which are established early in life-may affect the brain's susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results of our previous studies on senescence-accelerated OXYS rats, a model of sporadic AD, support this hypothesis. Here, to elucidate the molecular genetic nature of the aberrations revealed during brain maturation, we analyzed transcriptomes (RNA-seq data) of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of OXYS rats and Wistar (control) rats in the period of brain maturation critical for OXYS rats (ages P3 and P10; P: postnatal day). We found more than 1000 differentially expressed genes in both brain structures; functional analysis indicated reduced efficiency of the formation of neuronal contacts, presumably explained mainly by deficits of mitochondrial functions. Next, we compared differentially expressed genes in the rat PFC and hippocampus from infancy to the progressive stage of AD-like pathology (five ages in total). Three genes (Thoc3, Exosc8, and Smpd4) showed overexpression in both brain regions of OXYS rats throughout the lifespan. Thus, reduced efficiency of the formation of neural networks in the brain of OXYS rats in infancy likely contributes to the development of their AD-like pathology.

AB  - With the aging global population, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a significant social and economic burden, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) synbiotics, a combination of NMN, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CGMCC 1.16089, and lactulose, in mitigating AD pathology. APP/PS1 mice were supplemented with NMN synbiotics and compared against control groups. The effects on amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, intestinal histopathology, tight junction proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed. NMN synbiotics intervention significantly reduced A beta deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by 67% and 60%, respectively. It also ameliorated histopathological changes in the colon, reducing crypt depth and restoring goblet cell numbers. The expression of tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and ZO-1 was significantly upregulated, enhancing intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, NMN synbiotics decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and reduced ROS levels, indicative of attenuated oxidative stress. The reduction in A beta deposition, enhancement of intestinal barrier function, decrease in neuroinflammation, and alleviation of oxidative stress suggest that NMN synbiotics present a promising therapeutic intervention for AD by modulating multiple pathological pathways. Further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms, particularly the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, which may offer a novel target for AD treatment.

AB  - The involvement of consumption of high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet in cognitive impairment is attributed, at least in part, to the activation of astrocytes, which contributes to the development of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and subsequent cognitive deficits. This study aimed to assess the influence of melatonin on cognitive impairment and astrogliosis induced by the HCHF diet in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed an HCHF diet for eight weeks to induce obesity and metabolic syndrome. Subsequently, they received oral melatonin treatment for four weeks at doses of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg, alongside the HCHF diet. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Y-maze test, while the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and the number glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were assessed in the hippocampi and hypothalamus. The consumption of the HCHF diet resulted in weight gain, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, cognitive decline, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress damage, and astrogliosis in rats. Although melatonin treatment did not demonstrate beneficial effects on blood glucose and lipid metabolism, it improved the impaired working memory caused by the HCHF diet. Melatonin exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and lipid peroxidation while restored superoxide dismutase in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of HCHF diet-treated rats. These findings provide evidence that melatonin inhibits astrocyte activation, thereby attenuating inflammation and minimizing oxidative stress damage induced by the HCHF diet.

AB  - Age-related cognitive decline is the major cause of concern due to its 70% more incidence than dementia cases worldwide. Moreover, aging is also the major risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with progressive memory loss. Approx. 13 million people will have Alzheimer-related memory decline by 2050. Learning and memory is the fundamental process of brain functions. However, the mechanism for the same is still under investigation. Thus, it is critical to understand the process of memory consolidation in the brain and extrapolate its understanding to the memory decline mechanism. Research on learning and memory has identified several molecular signatures such as Protein kinase M zeta (PKM zeta), Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) crucial for the maintenance and stabilization of longterm memory in the brain. Interestingly, memory decline in AD has also been linked to the abnormality in expressing these memory-related molecular signatures. Hence, in the present consolidated review, we explored the role of these memory-related molecular signatures in long-term memory consolidation. Additionally, the effect of amyloid-beta toxicity on these molecular signatures is discussed in detail.

AB  - Background: Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a primary culprit of acute kidney injury. Neurodegeneration can result from I/R, but the mechanisms are still challenging. We studied the implications of bilateral renal I/R on brain and potential involvement of the oxidative stress (OS) driven extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ERK1/2, JNK) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3)/nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kappa B)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), and caspase-3 paths upregulation. We tested the impact of Nano-trimetazidine (Nano-TMZ) on these pathways being a target of its neuroprotective effects.
   Methods: Study groups; Sham, I/R, TMZ+I/R, and Nano-TMZ+I/R. Kidney functions, cognition, hippocampal OS markers, Gal-3, NF-kappa B, p65 and HMGB-1 gene expression, TNF-alpha level, t-JNK/p-JNK and t-ERK/p-ERK proteins, caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding protein-1 (Iba-1) were assessed.
   Results: Nano-TMZ averted renal I/R-induced hippocampal impairment by virtue of its anti: oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic properties.
   Conclusion: Nano-TMZ is more than anti-ischemic.

AB  - Menopause results in estrogen hormone deficiency which causes changes in brain morphology and cognitive impairments. The risk of breast and ovarian cancer increases with estrogen therapy. Thus, finding a substitute treatment option for women in menopause is necessary. In the current study, the impact of chronic sericin treatment (200 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, gavage) on memory process, oxidative stress markers, synaptic neurotransmission, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus (HIP) of ovariectomized (OVX) mice was examined and compared to the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (Es; 20 mu g/kg, s.c.). The results demonstrated that sericin and Es administration improved spatial and recognition memory of the OVX animals in the both Lashley III maze and novel object recognition tests. Moreover, sericin-treated OVX mice showed decreased ROS levels, increased endogenous antioxidant defense capacity, and decreased AChE activity in the HIP. Additionally, sericin and Es therapy up-regulated pre-and-post-synaptic protein markers and increased BDNF, CREB, and protein kinase A (PKA) protein expressions in the HIP of OVX mice. Overall, the activation of the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway by sericin can provide protection against OVX-induced cognitive dysfunction, making it a potential alternative for managing cognitive deficits in postmenopausal women.

AB  - In this study, the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and protective effects of ghrelin were investigated in a fat-fed streptozotocin (STZ) rat model and compared with metformin, diabetes and the healthy control groups. Histopathological evaluations were performed on H&E-stained pancreas and brain sections. Biochemical parameters were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood glucose levels were significantly decreased with ghrelin or metformin treatments than the diabetes group. STZ administration increased brain, renal and pancreatic IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and MDA while decreasing GPX, CAT, SOD, and NGF levels. Ghrelin increased renal GPX, CAT, NGF pancreatic GPX, SOD, CAT, NGF and brain SOD, NGF while it decreased renal, pancreatic and brain IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and MDA levels. Ghrelin reduced neuronal loss and degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and greatly ameliorated diabetes-related damage in pancreas. In conclusion, the data suggested that ghrelin is an effective candidate as a protectant for reducing the adverse effects of diabetes.

AB  - Current epidemiological and experimental studies have indicated the overlapping genetic foundation of epilepsy and depression. However, the detailed pleiotropic genetic etiology and neurobiological pathways have not been well understood, and there are many variants with underestimated effect on the comorbidity of the two diseases. Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of epilepsy (15,212 cases and 29,677 controls) and depression (170,756 cases and 329,443 controls) from large consortia, we assessed the integrated gene-based association with both diseases by Multimarker Analysis of Genomic Annotation (MAGMA) and Fisher's meta-analysis. On the one hand, shared genes with significantly altered transcripts in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets were considered as possible pleiotropic genes. On the other hand, the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on the gene lists with nominal significance in the gene-based association test of each disease. We identified a total of two pleiotropic genes (CD3G and SLCO3A1) with gene expression analysis validated and interpreted twenty-five common biological process supported with literature mining. This study indicates the potentially shared genes associated with both epilepsy and depression based on gene expression, meta-data analysis, and pathway enrichment strategy along with traditional GWAS and provides insights into the possible intersecting pathways that were not previously reported.

AB  - Our previous study has shown that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) promotes peripheral nerve regeneration and motor function recovery after spinal cord injury. KLF7 also participates in traumatic brain injury, but its regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, an HT22 cell model of traumatic brain injury was established by stretch injury and oxygen-glucose deprivation. These cells were then transfected with an adeno-associated virus carrying KLF7 (AAV-KLF7). The results revealed that, after stretch injury and oxygen-glucose deprivation, KLF7 greatly reduced apoptosis, activated caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase, downregulated the expression of the apoptotic markers B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3, and increased the expression of beta III-tubulin and the antiapoptotic marker Bcl-2. Furthermore, KLF7 overexpression upregulated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in HT22 cells treated by stretch injury and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that KLF7 directly participated in the phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, treatment with AG490, a selective inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3, weakened the protective effects of KLF7. A mouse controlled cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury was then established. At 30 minutes before modeling, AAV-KLF7 was injected into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. The protein and mRNA levels of KLF7 in the hippocampus were increased at 1 day after injury and recovered to normal levels at 3 days after injury. KLF7 reduced ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy, decreased the injured cortex volume, downregulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and increased the number of 5-bromo-2 ' -deoxyuridine-positive neurons and Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, KLF7 transfection greatly enhanced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. These results suggest that KLF7 may protect hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury through activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mudanjiang Medical University, China (approval No. mdjyxy-2018-0012) on March 6, 2018.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental illness. Decreased brain plasticity and dendritic fields have been consistently found in MDD patients and animal models; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that the deletion of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leads to depression-like behaviors in mice. Hippocampal RNA sequencing analysis of CIP2A knockout mice shows alterations in the PI3K-AKT pathway and central nervous system development. In primary neurons, CIP2A stimulates AKT activity and promotes dendritic development. Further analysis reveals that the effect of CIP2A in promoting dendritic development is dependent on PP2A-AKT signaling. In vivo, CIP2A deficiency-induced depression-like behaviors and impaired dendritic arborization are rescued by AKT activation. Decreased CIP2A expression and impaired dendrite branching are observed in a mouse model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Indicative of clinical relevance to humans, CIP2A expression is found decreased in transcriptomes from MDD patients. In conclusion, we discover a novel mechanism that CIP2A deficiency promotes depression through the regulation of PP2A-AKT signaling and dendritic arborization.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is characterized by cognitive decline due to reduced cerebral blood flow, although its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study shows that angiotensin II (AngII) elevates blood pressure, reduces hippocampal blood flow, and impairs synaptic and cognitive function, which correlates with increased TGF-beta 1 levels. Overexpressing TGF-beta 1 in rats induces similar deficits, while its downregulation partially mitigates these effects, with the exception of hypoperfusion. Phosphorylation of Smad2/3, downstream of TGF-beta 1, is elevated in AngII-treated rats and TGF-beta 1-exposed neurons, and inhibiting Smad2/3 activation prevents synaptic damage. Additionally, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interacts more with the transcription factor Sp1 in hippocampal neurons of AngII-treated rats. Overexpression of Sp1 worsens synaptic and cognitive function, whereas Sp1 knockdown improves TGF-beta 1-induced impairments. These findings highlight TGF-beta 1 as a key mediator of AngII-induced cognitive deficits, beyond hypoperfusion, suggesting that targeting the TGF-beta 1/Smad2/3/Sp1 axis may offer therapeutic benefits for hypertension-related synaptic and cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - New neurones are generated throughout life in the mammalian brain in a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Since this phenomenon grants a high degree of neuroplasticity influencing learning and memory, identifying factors that regulate AHN may be important for ameliorating age-related cognitive decline. Calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to enhance AHN and improve memory, mediated by the stomach hormone, ghrelin. Intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary strategy offering more flexibility than conventional CR, has also been shown to promote aspects of AHN. The 5:2 diet is a popular form of IF; however, its effects on AHN are not well characterised. To address this, we quantified AHN in adolescent and adult wild-type and ghrelin-receptor-deficient mice following 6 weeks on a 5:2 diet. We report an age-related decline in neurogenic processes. However, the 5:2 diet does not increase AHN nor enhance memory performance, suggesting that this specific form of IF is ineffective in promoting brain plasticity to support learning.

AB  - Sevoflurane (Sev) is a widely applied anesthetic in clinical practice; however, it could induce neurotoxicity and lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of circHOMER1 in Sev-induced neurotoxicity and POCD. Sev treated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells and SD rats. RT-qPCR was used to detect the levels of circHOMER1 and miR-217. ELISA was employed to measure the levels of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Commercially available kits assessed the concentration of MDA and measured the activities LDH and SOD. The CCK-8 assay assessed cell viability. Flow cytometry analyzed cell apoptosis. The Morris water maze test evaluated the learning and cognitive abilities of the rats. Dual luciferase reporter assays and RIP experiments validated the targeted binding of circHOMER1 to miR-217. Sev treatment significantly reduces cell viability, increases apoptosis, stimulates inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, and induces learning and memory impairments in SD rats. Following exposure to Sev, the expression of circHOMER1 is markedly decreased, while overexpression of circHOMER1 can alleviate Sev-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and learning and memory deficits in rats. CircHOMER1 targets miR-217, and transfection of miR-217 antagonizes the neuroprotective effects of circHOMER1. This study demonstrated that circHOMER1 negatively regulated miR-217, thereby inhibiting Sev-induced neurotoxicity and learning and memory disorders.

AB  - Sargassum horneri, a brown seaweed, is known for its various health benefits; however, there are no reports on its effects on depression. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of S. horneri ethanol extract (SHE) in mice injected with corticosterone (CORT) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Behavioral tests were conducted, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and CORT levels were measured. A fluorometric monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme inhibition assay was performed. Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels were determined. Moreover, the ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was evaluated. Behavioral tests revealed that SHE has antidepressant effects by reducing immobility time and increasing time spent in open arms. Serum CRH, ACTH, and CORT levels decreased in the mice treated with SHE, as did the glucocorticoid-receptor expression in their brain tissues. SHE inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B activities. In addition, SHE increased levels of neurotransmitters. Furthermore, SHE activated the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest that SHE has antidepressant effects in CORT-injected mice, via the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and monoaminergic pathway, and through activation of the ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway. Thus, our study suggests that SHE may act as a natural antidepressant.

AB  - BackgroundDespite extensive global efforts, there is currently no effective remedy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). ObjectivesThis investigation aimed to examine the impact of vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR)/ATG16L1 signaling on memory in AD mice, as well as the levels of autophagy and inflammation in the hippocampus. ResultsAdministering cholecalciferol cholesterol emulsion (CCE), which serves as a precursor to 1,25-OH vitamin D3, through water feeding for a duration of 12 weeks demonstrated the ability to mitigate both short-term and long-term memory impairments in AD mice. CCE treatment reduced the deposition of TAU protein in the hippocampus, suppressed the phosphorylation of TAU Thr181 and 212, and significantly decreased A beta (1-40) levels. Moreover, CCE heightened hippocampal autophagy in AD mice, upregulated the expression of ATG16L1 and LC3B, and inhibited P62 expression. In addition, CCE supplementation attenuated hippocampal inflammation in AD mice by decreasing the levels of IL1 beta and TNF alpha and restoring the TOM1/IL1R1 pathway. The Luciferase reporter assay verified that the knockdown of VDR could impede the activation of the ATG16L1 promoter by vitamin D, and ChIP analysis confirmed that VDR could bind to the ATG16L1 promoter and exert its function. ConclusionCCE exhibits potential in safeguarding hippocampal neurons against AD-induced harm, stimulating autophagy, and suppressing inflammation. These effects may be regulated by VD/VDR/ATG16L1 signaling.

AB  - The liver has multiple functions that change throughout ontogeny. South American camelids (SAC) have unique characteristics related to adaptation to extreme environments and metabolism. However, the process of hepatic cell differentiation has not been studied in any SAC. We study the patterns of cell differentiation and proliferation in the liver of the alpaca at different times of the ontogeny, excluding the hematopoietic components. Immunohistochemical techniques were performed in 66 specimens, including embryos, fetuses, neonates and adults. Supplementary analyses were performed by lectinhistochemistry. The hepatocytic differentiation was performed by the identification of Hepatocyte (Clone: OCH1ES Dako (R)). It began in the specimens of 1.8-2.5 cm of crown to rump length (CRL), from Days 25-29 (ovulation = Day 0), continued during gestation and intensified towards its end. The cholangiocytic differentiation was performed by the identification of cytokeratin 7 (CK7, Dako (R)). It was manifested at the final of gestation (specimens of 28.4 cm CRL, from Day 223 onwards). Parenchymal cells underwent a process of gradual differentiation (differentiation of hepatocytes preceded that of cholangiocytes). Cell proliferation was observed along gestation using the nuclear proliferation antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67. Hepatic organogenesis in the alpacas shares similar differentiation and proliferation mechanisms with other altricial, but phylogenetically distant, species.

AB  - High doses bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) have resulted in a series of complications in spinal fusion. We previously established a polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) carrier system that reduces the therapeutic dose of BMP-2 in both rodent and porcine spinal fusion models. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and low dose BMP-2 delivered by PEC for bone regeneration in a porcine model of anterior lumbar interbody spinal fusion (ALIF) application. Six Yorkshire pigs underwent a tri-segmental (L2/L3; L3/L4; L4/L5) ALIF in four groups, namely: (a) BMSCs + 25 mu g BMP-2/PEC (n = 9), (b) 25 mu g BMP-2/PEC (n = 3), (c) BMSCs (n = 3), and (d) 50 mu g BMP-2/absorbable collagen sponge (n = 3). Fusion outcomes were evaluated by radiography, biomechanical testing, and histological analysis after 12 weeks. Mean radiographic scores at 12 weeks were 2.7, 2.0, 1.0, and 1.0 for Groups 1 to 4, respectively. mu-CT scanning, biomechanical evaluation, and histological analysis demonstrated solid fusion and successful bone regeneration in Group 1. In contrast, Group 2 showed inferior quality and slow rate of fusion, and Groups 3 and 4 failed to fuse any of the interbody spaces. There was no obvious evidence of seroma formation, implant rejection, or any other complications in all groups. The results suggest that the combination of BMSCs and low dose BMP-2/PEC could further lower down the effective dose of the BMP-2 and be used as a bone graft substitute in the large animal ALIF model.

AB  - Developmental arsenic exposure has been associated with cognitive deficits in epidemiological studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we establish a mouse model of developmental arsenic exposure exhibiting deficits of recognition and spatial memory in the offspring. These deficits are associated with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and abnormal expression of cognition-related genes in the hippocampus. Arsenic atoms directly bind to the cysteine-rich ADD domain of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), triggering ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation of DNMT3A in different cellular contexts. DNMT3A degradation leads to genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts but not in non-embryonic cell lines. Treatment with metformin, a first-line antidiabetic agent reported to increase DNA methylation, ameliorates the behavioral deficits and normalizes the aberrant expression of cognition-related genes and DNA methylation in the hippocampus of arsenic-exposed offspring. Our study establishes a DNA hypomethylation effect of developmental arsenic exposure and proposes a potential treatment against cognitive deficits in the offspring of pregnant women in arsenic-contaminated areas.

AB  - Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) is a ser/thr kinase, which plays a central role in centriole duplication during the cell cycle. PLK4 gene abnormalities are responsible for autosomal recessive chorioretinopathy-microcephaly syndrome and Seckel syndrome. In this study, we performed expression analyses of Plk4 by focusing on mouse brain development. Western blotting analyses revealed that Plk4 with a molecular mass of similar to 100 kDa was broadly expressed in adult mouse tissues with specific subcellular distribution. As to the central nervous system, Plk4 was expressed throughout the developmental process with drastic increase after P15, suggesting an essential role of Plk4 in differentiated neurons. In immunohistochemical analyses with mouse brain at embryonic day 14, Plk4 was detected dominantly at the cell-cell contact sites of neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone. Plk4 was then diffusely distributed in the cell body of cortical neurons at P7, while it was enriched in the neuropil as well as soma of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum at P30. Notably, biochemical fractionation analysis found an enrichment of Plk4 in the postsynaptic density fraction. Then, immunofluorescent analyses showed partial co-localization of Plk4 with excitatory synaptic markers, PSD95 and synaptophysin, in differentiated primary cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Plk4 takes part in the regulation of synaptic function in differentiated neurons. (c) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, "Long COVID") pose a significant global health challenge. The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the etiology of PASC, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, hy-percoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. We find that PASC are asso-ciated with serotonin reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced MAO-mediated se-rotonin turnover. Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a possible explanation for neurocog-nitive symptoms associated with viral persistence in Long COVID, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.

AB  - Thousand and one amino acid kinase 1 (TAOK1) is a sterile 20 family Serine/Threonine kinase linked to microtubule dynamics, checkpoint signaling, DNA damage response, and neurological functions. Molecular -level alterations of TAOK1 have been associated with neurodevelopment disorders and cancers. Despite their known involvement in physiological and pathophysiological processes, and as a core member of the hippo signaling pathway, the phosphoregulatory network of TAOK1 has not been visualized. Aimed to explore this network, we first analyzed the predominantly detected and differentially regulated TAOK1 phosphosites in global phosphoproteome datasets across diverse experimental conditions. Based on 709 qualitative and 210 quantitative differential cellular phosphoproteome datasets that were systematically assembled, we identified that phosphorylation at Ser421, Ser9, Ser965, and Ser445 predominantly represented TAOK1 in almost 75% of these datasets. Surprisingly, the functional role of all these phosphosites in TAOK1 remains unexplored. Hence, we employed a robust strategy to extract the phosphosites in proteins that significantly correlated in expression with predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. This led to the first categorization of the phosphosites including those in the currently known and predicted interactors, kinases, and substrates, that positively/negatively correlated with the expression status of each predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. Subsequently, we also analyzed the phosphosites in core proteins of the hippo signaling pathway. Based on the TAOK1 phosphoregulatory network analysis, we inferred the potential role of the predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. Especially, we propose pSer9 as an autophosphorylation and TAOK1 kinase activity -associated phosphosite and pS421, the most frequently detected phosphosite in TAOK1, as a significant regulatory phosphosite involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. Considering that the impact of all phosphosites that predominantly represent each kinase is essential for the efficient interpretation of global phosphoproteome datasets, we believe that the approach undertaken in this study is suitable to be extended to other kinases for accelerated research.

AB  - Plants protect themselves with a vast array of toxic secondary metabolites, yet most plants serve as food for insects. The evolutionary processes that allow herbivorous insects to resist plant defenses remain largely unknown. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional horizontal gene transfer event, the whitefly has acquired the plant-derived phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteflies to neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was confirmed by genetically transforming tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing the whiteflies' detoxification ability. These findings reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop protection.

AB  - KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) regulates levels of several neuronal mRNAs linked to nervous system development and function.
   The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) is an RNA-binding protein linked to decay of mRNAs with AU-rich elements. KHSRP was previously shown to destabilize Gap43 mRNA and decrease neurite growth in cultured embryonic neurons. Here, we have tested functions of KHSRP in vivo. We find upregulation of 1460 mRNAs in neocortex of adult Khsrp(-/-) mice, of which 527 bind to KHSRP with high specificity. These KHSRP targets are involved in pathways for neuronal morphology, axon guidance, neurotransmission and long-term memory. Khsrp(-/-) mice show increased axon growth and dendritic spine density in vivo. Neuronal cultures from Khsrp(-/-) mice show increased axon and dendrite growth and elevated KHSRP-target mRNAs, including subcellularly localized mRNAs. Furthermore, neuron-specific knockout of Khsrp confirms these are from neuron-intrinsic roles of KHSRP. Consistent with this, neurons in the hippocampus and infralimbic cortex of Khsrp(-/-) mice show elevations in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. The Khsrp(-/-) mice have deficits in trace conditioning and attention set-shifting tasks compared Khsrp(+/+) mice, indicating impaired prefrontal- and hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation with loss of KHSRP. Overall, these results indicate that deletion of KHSRP impairs neuronal development resulting in alterations in neuronal morphology and function by changing post-transcriptional control of neuronal gene expression.

AB  - Mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) activates mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in response to cytokines and stress stimuli. MLK3 is important for proliferation, migration, and invasion of different types of human tumor cells. We observed that endogenous MLK3 was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in immortalized ovarian epithelial (T80) and ovarian can-cer cells, and mutation of arginines 474 and 475 within a putative MLK3 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) resulted in exclusion of MLK3 from the nucleus. The large tumor suppressor (LATS) Ser/Thr kinase regulates cell proliferation, morphol-ogy, apoptosis, and mitotic exit in response to cell-cell contact. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of LATS1 increased nuclear, endogenous MLK3 in T80 cells. LATS1 phosphorylated MLK3 on Thr477, which is within the putative NLS, and LATS1 expression enhanced the association between MLK3 and the adapter protein 14-3-3'. Thr477 is essential for MLK3-14-3-3' association and MLK3 retention in the cytoplasm, and a T477A MLK3 mutant had predominantly nuclear localization and significantly increased invasiveness of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. This study identi-fied a novel link between the MAPK and Hippo/LATS1 signaling pathways. Our results reveal LATS1 as a novel regulator of MLK3 that controls MLK3 nuclear/cyto-plasmic localization and MLK3-dependent ovarian cancer cell invasion.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is a master antioxidant which primarily protects cells from oxidative stress. Clinical studies have found significant depletion of GSH from the hippocampus in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Significant depletion of GSH is considered an early diagnostic biomarker of AD. Postmortem studies have confirmed significant GSH depletion in hippocampal tissue in MCI patients. The stability of GSH in different microenvironments is essential to validate GSH as a reliable biomarker for AD. Accordingly, we have conducted longitudinal monitoring of GSH from various brain regions (frontal cortex (FC), parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex (OC), and cerebellum (CER)) from healthy subjects using MEshcher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) pulse sequence on a 3T scanner. Additionally, in vitro magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) assessments were conducted longitudinally using the same study protocol involving GSH supplement in a physiologically relevant phosphate buffer solution (PBS). We report that GSH within the brain microenvironment of a healthy person remains stable over time. GSH, however, is susceptible to oxidation over time in a phosphate buffer environment.

AB  - One of the most prevalent co-operative disorders is postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate SIRT3's impact on cognitive decline in aged mice under anesthesia. Adeno-associated virus SIRT3 vector (AAV-SIRT3) or empty vector (AAV-VEH) was injected into the hippocampal region of aged mice after sevoflurane induction in order to upregulate the expression of SIRT3. The expression levels of SIRT3, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and apoptotic factors in hippocampus tissues were identified by PCR, Western blotting, TUNEL staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the cognitive function of mice was assessed. The SIRT3 expression was downregulated in the hippocampal tissue of anesthetized mice. SIRT3 overexpression can improve the learning and memory ability, reduce the escape latency, and increase the residence time in the platform and platform crossing ability of mice. The overexpression of SIRT3 in hippocampus can reduce the oxidative stress response and inflammatory response induced by anesthesia in mice, increase the superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression level, and decrease the expression level of MDA and inflammatory factors in hippocampus. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression can also reduce anesthetic-induced hippocampal cell apoptosis. By reducing the hippocampus mitochondrial oxidative stress response, SIRT3 plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of POCD in mice and is a potential target for POCD treatment and diagnosis.

AB  - Neurogenesis is crucial during the human lifespan for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and normal function. The impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis in adults may lead to neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Miquelianin (quercetin-3-O-beta-d-glucuronide, Q3GA) is a constituent of the nuciferine leaf polyphenol extract (NLPE), and it has protective effects against neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined the effect of the NLPE on neurogenesis and the mechanisms underlying Q3GA on neurogenesis. We fed 24-week-old male C57BL/6 mice with 0.1 or 0.25% NLPE for 2 weeks. NLPE treatment increased small spindle-shaped stem cell numbers in the subgranular zone and the number of doublecortin (DCX)- and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)-expressing neurons. HT22, a hippocampal cell line, treated with Q3GA revealed significant neurite growth and upregulated TrkR and PI3K/Akt levels. The evidence from a model of retinoic acid-induced SH-SY5Y cell differentiation showed that Q3GA or NLPE increases neurite growth significantly. Taken together, the NLPE containing Q3GA to promote neurogenesis involving the upregulation of TrkR and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway might be potentiated as an alternative strategy for the treatment of neurodegeneration.

AB  - DNA lesions occur across the genome and constitute a threat to cell viability; however, damage at specific genomic loci has a relatively greater impact on overall genome stability. The ribosomal RNA gene repeats (rDNA) are emerging fragile sites. Recent progress in understanding how the rDNA damage response is organized has highlighted a key role of adaptor proteins. Here, we show that the scaffold tumor suppressor RASSF1A is recruited to rDNA breaks. RASSF1A recruitment to double-strand breaks is mediated by 53BP1 and depends on RASSF1A phosphorylation at Serine 131 by ATM kinase. Employing targeted rDNA damage, we uncover that RASSF1A recruitment promotes local ATM signaling. RASSF1A silencing, a common epigenetic event during malignant transformation, results in persistent breaks, rDNA copy number alterations and decreased cell viability. Overall, we identify a novel role for RASSF1A at rDNA break sites, provide mechanistic insight into how the DNA damage response is organized in a chromatin context, and provide further evidence for how silencing of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor contributes to genome instability.

AB  - Change in cell size may bring in profound impact to cell function and survival, hence the integrity of the organs consisting of those cells. Nevertheless, how cell size is regulated remains incompletely understood. We used the fluorescent zebrafish transgenic line Tg-GGH/LR that displays inducible folate deficiency (FD) and hepatomegaly upon FD induction as in vivo model. We found that FD caused hepatocytes enlargement and increased liver stiffness, which could not be prevented by nucleotides supplementations. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic pathway and Hippo signaling interactively participated in this FD-induced hepatocytic enlargement in a dual chronological and cooperative manner. FD also induced hepatic inflammation, which convenes a dialog of positive feedback loop between necroptotic and Hippo pathways. The increased MMP13 expression in response to FD elevated TNF alpha level and further aggravated the hepatocyte enlargement. Meanwhile, F-actin was circumferentially re-allocated at the edge under cell membrane in response to FD. Our results substantiate the interplay among intracellular folate status, pathways regulation, inflammatory responses, actin cytoskeleton and cell volume control, which can be best observed with in vivo platform. Our data also support the use of this Tg-GGH/LR transgenic line for the mechanistical and therapeutic research for the pathologic conditions related to cell size alteration.

AB  - Motivated by the recent synthesis of a new polymorph of germanium selenide (gamma-GeSe) with a honeycomb lattice and an astonishingly high conductivity (even higher than graphite), here we conduct a study on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic performance and electronic properties of gamma-GeSe with respect to the thickness effect from monolayer (1L) to trilayer (3L), along with the defect effect. The band structure of gamma-GeSe exhibits a camel's back-like structure near the Gamma point, existing for all the layers and in the presence of dilute Se vacancy and surface adsorbate like the Pt atom, and a narrow bandgap ranging from 0.544 eV for 1L to 0.252 eV for 3L. We find that pristine gamma-GeSe is electrocatalytically inert for all the layers with an endothermic uptake of hydrogen, as indicated by the calculated Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)). However, upon introduction of Se vacancies and surface Pt adsorbates, the HER performance is enhanced, with the HER activity of 1L gamma-GeSe surpassing those of bilayer (2L) and 3L gamma-GeSe. Moreover, an increase in defect concentration and thickness leads to a decrease in bandgap, developing semimetallic characteristics. With the absence of a transition element and solely s and p orbitals, semimetallic gamma-GeSe is unique and holds great promise as a support for fabricating a single atomic catalyst for HER, and our work offers valuable insights into the rational design of 2D electrocatalysts.

AB  - Lactulose, as a prebiotic, can be utilized by human gut microbiota and stimulate their growth. Although microbiota modulation has become an emerging approach to manage many diseases and can be achieved by the administration of prebiotics, fewer investigations have been carried out on the therapeutic mechanism of lactulose. Two trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were identified as having a neuroprotective effect in polyglutamine and Parkinson disease models. In this study, we examined lactulose and melibiose in a mouse primary hippocampal neuronal culture under the toxicity of oligomeric A beta(23-35). Lactulose was further tested in vivo because its effective concentration is lower than that of melibiose. Lactulose and trehalose were applied individually to mice before a bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of oligomeric A beta(23-35). The administration of lactulose and trehalose attenuated the short-term memory and the learning retrieval of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. From a pathological analysis, we found that the pretreatment of lactulose and trehalose decreased neuroinflammation and increased the levels of the autophagic pathways. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of both lactulose and trehalose are achieved through anti-inflammation and autophagy. In addition, lactulose was better than trehalose in the enhancement of the synaptic protein expression level in AD mice. Therefore, lactulose could potentially be developed into a preventive and/or therapeutic disaccharide for AD.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant and lethal brain tumor, is characterized by diffuse invasion into the brain and chemo-radiotherapy resistance resulting in poor prognosis. In this study, we examined the involvement of the cell adhesion molecule CD146/MCAM in regulating GBM aggressiveness. Analyses of GBM transcript expression databases revealed correlations of elevated CD146 levels with higher glioma grades, IDH-wildtype and unmethylated MGMT phenotypes, poor response to chemo-radiotherapy and worse overall survival. In a panel of GBM stem cells (GSCs) variable expression levels of CD146 were detected, which strongly increased upon adherent growth. CD146 was linked with mesenchymal transition since expression increased in TGF-ss-treated U-87MG cells. Ectopic overexpression of CD146/GFP in GG16 cells enhanced the mesenchymal phenotype and resulted in increased cell invasion. Conversely, GSC23-CD146 knockouts had decreased mesenchymal marker expression and reduced cell invasion in transwell and GBM-cortical assembloid assays. Moreover, using GSC23 xenografted zebrafish, we found that CD146 depletion resulted in more compact delineated tumor formation and reduced tumor cell dissemination. Stem cell marker expression and neurosphere formation assays showed that CD146 increased the stem cell potential of GSCs. Furthermore, CD146 mediated radioresistance by stimulating cell survival signaling through suppression of p53 expression and activation of NF-kappa B. Interestingly, CD146 was also identified as an inducer of the oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP). In conclusion, CD146 carries out various pro-tumorigenic roles in GBM involving its cell surface receptor function, which include the stimulation of mesenchymal and invasive properties, stemness, and radiotherapy resistance, thus providing an interesting target for therapy.

AB  - BackgroundZinc finger MIZ-type containing 2 (ZMIZ2) can function as a coactivator and participate in the progression of certain malignant tumors; however, its expression and underlying molecular mechanism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. In this study, we aim to analyze the expression of ZMIZ2 and its tumorigenic function in NSCLC, identifying its related factors.MethodsZMIZ2 expression in NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines was examined using immunohistochemistry and western blotting; its biological role was investigated using in vivo and in vitro assays. The association between ZMIZ2 and NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) was demonstrated using mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation experiments. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway (KEGG)-based enrichment analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted to verify the impact of ZMIZ2-SIRT1 combination on Hippo/Wnt pathways.ResultsZMIZ2 was highly expressed in NSCLC and positively associated with advanced pTNM staging, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival. Functional experiments revealed that ZMIZ2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of lung cancer cells-establishing its role as a promoter of oncogenes. Molecular mechanism studies identified SIRT1 as an assisted key factor interacting with ZMIZ2. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that ZMIZ2 is closely related to Wnt/Hippo pathways; ZMIZ2-SIRT1 interaction enhanced SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Direct downregulation of intranuclear beta-catenin and yes-associated protein (YAP) acetylation levels occurred independently of upstream proteins in Wnt/Hippo pathways; transcriptional activities of beta-catenin-transcription factor 4 (TCF4) and YAP-TEA domain family transcription factors (TEADs) were amplified.ConclusionsZMIZ2 promotes the malignant phenotype of lung cancer by regulating Wnt/Hippo pathways through SIRT1, providing an experimental basis for discovering novel biomarkers and developing tumor-targeted drugs.

AB  - Nitric oxide is a small gaseous molecule that plays important roles in the majority of biological functions. Impairments of NO-related pathways contribute to the majority of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mental disorders, such as schizophrenia. Cognitive decline is one of the most serious impairments accompanying both AD and schizophrenia. In the present study, the activities of NO donors, slow (spermine NONOate) or fast (DETANONOate) releasers, and selective inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase N(omega)-propyl-L-arginine (NPLA) were investigated in pharmacological models of schizophrenia and AD. Cognitive impairments were induced by administration of MK 801 or scopolamine and were measured in novel object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze tests. The compounds were investigated at doses of 0.05-0.5 mg/kg. The dose-dependent effectiveness of all the compounds was observed in the NOR test, while only the highest doses of spermine NONOate and NPLA were active in the Y maze test. DETANONOate was not active in the Y-maze test. The impact of the investigated compounds on motor coordination was tested at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg. Only NPLA at a dose of 1 mg/kg slightly disturbed motor coordination in animals.

AB  - Depression is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects millions of individuals all over the world, thus demanding special attention from researchers in order to investigate its effective remedies. Curcumin, along with its synthetic derivatives, is recognized for its incredible pharmacological activities. In this study, methyl, methoxy and chloro-substituent synthetic curcumin analogues C1-C3 were respectively tested for free radical-scavenging activity. Behavioral studies were performed using chemical-induced and swimming endurance tests as stress models, and forced swim tests (FSTs) and tail suspension tests (TSTs) as depression mice models. Biochemical examinations were performed after a scopolamine-induced stress model by decapitating the mice, and brain tissues were isolated for biochemical assessment of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The curcumin analogue C2 exhibited higher DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2 '-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulphonate) free radical-scavenging potential, having IC50 values of 45.18 mu g/mL and 62.31 mu g/mL, respectively, in comparison with reference curcumin and tocopherol. In the chemical-induced test, C2 (80.17%), C3 (72.79%) and C1 (51.85%) revealed higher antistress responses by significantly reducing the number of writhes, whereas the immobility time was significantly reduced by C2 and C3 in the swimming endurance test, indicating excellent antistress potential. Similarly, C2 and C3 significantly reduced the immobility times in FST and TST, demonstrating their antidepressant properties. The biomarkers study revealed that these compounds significantly enhanced hippocampus CAT, SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels in the scopolamine-induced stress mice model. These findings suggest the potential of curcumin analogues (C2 and C3) as antistress and antidepressant agents.

AB  - The nucleus accumbens shell is a critical node in reward circuitry, encoding environments associated with reward. Long-range inputs from the ventral hippocampus (ventral subiculum) to the nucleus accumbens shell have been identified, yet their precise molecular phenotype remains to be determined. Here we used retrograde tracing to identify the ventral subiculum as the brain region with the densest glutamatergic (VGluT1-Slc17a7) input to the shell. We then used circuit-directed translating ribosome affinity purification to examine the molecular characteristics of distinct glutamatergic (VGluT1, VGluT2-Slc17a6) ventral subiculum to nucleus accumbens shell projections. We immunoprecipitated translating ribosomes from this population of projection neurons and analysed molecular connectomic information using RNA sequencing. We found differential gene enrichment across both glutamatergic projection neuron subtypes. In VGluT1 projections, we found enrichment of Pfkl, a gene involved in glucose metabolism. In VGluT2 projections, we found a depletion of Sparcl1 and Dlg1, genes known to play a role in depression- and addiction-related behaviours. These findings highlight potential glutamatergic neuronal-projection-specific differences in ventral subiculum to nucleus accumbens shell projections. Together these data advance our understanding of the phenotype of a defined brain circuit.

AB  - The Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), as a specific indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma, exhibits a significant increase in expression. However, its upstream regulatory network remains enigmatic. Previous research has indicated a strong correlation between the Hippo pathway and the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is well established that the Activator Protein -1 (AP -1) frequently engages in interactions with the Hippo pathway. Thus, we attempt to prove whether Jun and Fos, a major member of the AP -1 family, are involved in the regulation of BORIS expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the existence of binding sites for Jun and Fos within the BORIS promoter. Through a series of overexpression and knockdown experiments, we corroborated that Jun and Fos have the capacity to augment BORIS expression, thereby fostering the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, Methylation-Specific PCR and Bisulfite Sequencing PCR assays revealed that Jun and Fos do not have a significant impact on the demethylation of the BORIS promoter. However, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments substantiated that Jun and Fos could directly bind to the BORIS promoter, thereby enhancing its transcription. In conclusion, these results suggest that Jun and Fos can promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by directly regulating the expression of BORIS. These findings may provide experimental evidence positioning BORIS as a novel target for the clinical intervention of hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation is a known risk factor for delirium, a cognitive impairment characterized by dysfunction of the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Although IL-6 is upregulated in mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and may contribute to delirium, it is not known whether the inhibition of systemic IL-6 mitigates delirium-relevant neuropathology. To histologically define neuropathological effects of IL-6 inhibition in an experimental VILI model, VILI was simulated in anesthetized adult mice using a 35 cc/kg tidal volume mechanical ventilation model. There were two control groups, as follow: 1) spontaneously breathing or 2) anesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 10 cc/kg tidal volume to distinguish effects of anesthesia from VILI. Two hours before inducing VILI, mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, or saline. Neuronal injury, stress, and inflammation were assessed using immunohistochemistry. CC3 (cleaved caspase-3), a neuronal apoptosis marker, was significantly increased in the frontal (P < 0.001) and hippocampal (P < 0.0001) brain regions and accompanied by significant increases in c-Fos and heat shock protein-90 in the frontal cortices of VILI mice compared with control mice (P < 0.001). These findings were not related to cerebral hypoxia, and there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal death. Frontal and hippocampal neuronal CC3 were significantly reduced with anti-IL-6 antibody (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively) compared with saline VILI mice. In summary, VILI induces potentially reversible neuronal injury and inflammation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is mitigated with systemic IL-6 inhibition. These data suggest a potentially novel neuroprotective role of systemic IL-6 inhibition that justifies further investigation.

AB  - Novel N-ethy-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavonols, myricetin alkaloids A-C (1-3), quercetin alkaloids A-C (4a, 4b, and 5), and kaempferol alkaloids A and B (6 and 7), were prepared from thermal reaction products of myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol & horbar;l-theanine, respectively. We used HPLC-ESI-HRMS/MS to detect 1-7 in 14 cultivars of green tea and found that they were all present in "Shuchazao," "Longjing 43", "Fudingdabai", and "Zhongcha 108" green teas. The structures of 1-4 and 6 were determined by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopies. These flavonol alkaloids along with their skeletal flavonols were assessed for anti-Alzheimer's disease effect based on molecular docking, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, and the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model. Compound 7 strongly binds to the protein amyloid beta (A beta(1-42)) through hydrogen bonds (BE: -9.5 kcal/mol, K-i: 114.3 nM). Compound 3 (100 mu M) is the strongest one in significantly extending the mean lifespan (13.4 +/- 0.5 d, 43.0% promotion), delaying the A beta(1-42)-induced paralysis (PT50: 40.7 +/- 1.9 h, 17.1% promotion), enhancing the locomotion (140.0% promotion at 48 h), and alleviating glutamic acid (Glu)-induced neurotoxicity (153.5% promotion at 48 h) of CL4176 worms (p < 0.0001).

AB  - Hypovolemia remains the leading cause of preventable death in trauma cases. Recent research has demonstrated that using noninvasive continuous waveforms rather than traditional vital signs improves accuracy in early detection of hypovolemia to assist in triage and resuscitation. This work evaluates random forest models trained on different subsets of data from a pig model (n = 6) of absolute (bleeding) and relative (nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation) progressive hypovolemia (to 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure) and resuscitation. Features for the models were derived from a multi-modal set of wearable sensors, comprised of the electrocardiogram (ECG), seismocardiogram (SCG) and reflective photoplethysmogram (RPPG) and were normalized to each subject.s baseline. The median RMSE between predicted and actual percent progression towards cardiovascular decompensation for the best model was 30.5% during the relative period, 16.8% during absolute and 22.1% during resuscitation. The least squares best fit line over the mean aggregated predictions had a slope of 0.65 and intercept of 12.3, with an R-2 value of 0.93. When transitioned to a binary classification problem to identify decompensation, this model achieved an AUROC of 0.80. This study: a) developed a global model incorporating ECG, SCG and RPPG features for estimating individual-specific decompensation from progressive relative and absolute hypovolemia and resuscitation; b) demonstrated SCG as the most important modality to predict decompensation; c) demonstrated efficacy of random forest models trained on different data subsets; and d) demonstrated adding training data from two discrete forms of hypovolemia increases prediction accuracy for the other form of hypovolemia and resuscitation.

AB  - Recent studies suggest the effects of DHA supplementation on human memory may differ between females and males during infancy, adolescence, and early adulthood, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. As a result, this study sought to examine the spatial memory and brain lipidomic profiles in female and male adolescent rats with or without a DHA-enriched diet that began perinatally with the supplementation of dams. Spatial learning and memory were examined in adolescent rats using the Morris Water Maze beginning at 6 weeks of age and animals were sacrificed at 7 weeks of age to permit isolation of brain tissue and blood samples. Behavioral testing showed that there was a significant diet x sex interaction for two key measures of spatial memory (distance to zone and time spent in the correct quadrant during the probe test), with female rats benefiting the most from DHA supplementation. Lipidomic analyses suggest levels of arachidonic acid (ARA) and n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) containing phospholipid species were lower in the hippocampus of DHA supplemented compared with control animals, and principal component analyses revealed a potential dietary treatment effect for hippocampal PUFA. Females fed DHA had slightly more PE P-18:0_22:6 and main-tained levels of PE 18:0_20:4 in the hippocampus in contrast with males fed DHA. Understanding how DHA supplementation during the perinatal and adolescent periods changes cognitive function in a sex-specific manner has important implications for determining the dietary requirements of DHA. This study adds to previous work highlighting the importance of DHA for spatial memory and provides evidence that further research needs to consider how DHA supplementation can cause sex -specific changes.

AB  - The downregulation of cannabinoid type-2 receptors (CB2R) have been reported in numerous diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The activation of CB2R has recently emerged as an important therapeutic target to mitigate myocardial injury. We examined whether CB2R activation can protect against isoproterenol (ISO)induced myocardial injury (MI) in rats. In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effect of ?-caryophyllene (BCP), a naturally occurring dietary cannabinoid in rat model of MI. Rats were pre- and cotreated with BCP (50 mg/kg, orally) twice daily for 10 days along with subcutaneous injection of ISO (85 mg/kg) at an interval of 24 h for two days (9th and 10th days). AM630 (1 mg/kg), a CB2 receptor antagonist, was injected intraperitoneal as a pharmacological challenge prior to BCP treatment to reveal CB2R-mediated cardioprotective mechanisms of BCP. Desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptor (?-AR) signaling, receptor phosphorylation and recruitment of adapter ?-arrestins were observed in ISO-induced MI in rats. ISO injections caused impaired cardiac function, elevated the levels of serum cardiac marker enzymes, and enhanced oxidative stress markers along with altered PI3K/Akt and NrF2/Keap1/HO-1 signaling pathways. ISO also promoted lysosomal dysfunction along with activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and TLR4-NF?B/MAPK signaling and triggered rise in proinflammatory cytokines. There was a concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction followed by the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated Hippo signaling and intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as altered autophagic flux/mTOR signaling in ISO-induced MI. Furthermore, ISO also triggered dyslipidemia evidenced by altered lipids, lipoproteins and lipid marker enzymes along with ionic homeostasis malfunction. However, treatment with BCP resulted in significant protective effects on all biochemical and molecular parameters analyzed. The cardioprotective effects were further strengthened by preservation of cardiomyocytes and cell organelles as observed in histopathological and ultrastructural studies. Interestingly, treatment with AM630, a CB2R antagonist was observed to abrogate the protective effects of BCP on the biochemical and molecular parameters except hyperlipidemia and ionic homeostasis in ISO-induced MI in rats. The present study findings demonstrate that BCP possess the potential to protect myocardium against ISO-induced MI in a CB2dependent and independent manner.

AB  - Aging increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's (PD and AD) which are potentially linked to increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Paracetamol (APAP) is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, its potential neuroprotective effects against age-related oxidative stress and neuroinflammation remain inadequately investigated. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether low-dose APAP could mitigate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging model. In our study, fifty adult male ICR mice were divided into five groups (n = 10). Except for the normal control group, all mice received D-gal subcutaneous injections (200 mg/kg) and were fed vehicle, 15 or 50 mg/kg APAP, or 100 mg/kg vitamin E daily for six weeks. After treatment, liver function was assessed by serum liver enzyme analysis. The liver and brain pathologies were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Brain oxidative stress was evaluated through malondialdehyde (MDA) measurement. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was used to determine levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, TGF-beta, and IL-10) and the oxidative stress marker, NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4). The study found no significant changes in serum liver enzymes or liver morphology among the experimental groups. However, the D-gal group exhibited increased neuronal cell loss, along with elevated levels of MDA and NOX4 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, D-gal mice showed elevated levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and TGF-beta, accompanied by decreased IL-10 levels. Notably, treatment with low-dose APAP and vitamin E mitigated neuronal cell loss, decreased MDA levels, and attenuated NOX4 expression induced by D-gal injection. Furthermore, low-dose APAP, particularly at 50 mg/kg, and vitamin E reversed the alterations in TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10 induced by D-gal, while TGF-beta was unaffected. We suggest that low-dose APAP exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities to protect against neurodegeneration in a mouse model of brain aging induced by chronic D-gal injection.

AB  - Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and asthma are mutually correlated with Type-2 inflammation. Dupilumab is effective in uncontrolled and relapsing CRSwNP. However, the precise characterization of Type-2 inflammation and the impact of previous surgery on clinical outcomes need clarification. Methods: We present a prospective observational study on a 38 CRSwNP-patient cohort, whose Type-2 endotype was confirmed after a multidisciplinary approach shared among ENTs, pneumologists and allergologists. Patients were treated with dupilumab and evaluated at 15 days and 1-3-6-12-18-24-30 months, focusing on clinical (VAS, nasal polyp score-NPS), radiological (Lund-Mackay) and quality of life (SNOT-22) parameters, as well olfactory function, asthma control, variation of Type-2 markers and number and extent (ACCESS score) of previous surgeries. Results: We confirmed the efficacy of dupilumab in total and sub-items VAS, NPS, SNOT-22 and sniffing score, as well as Lund-Mackay score improvements, observable and significant after 2 weeks of treatment (p < 0.0001) and long-lasting over 30 months. Good to excellent response criteria to biologic treatment at 6 months was observed in 30/32 patients. Comorbid asthma reached rapid control (p < 0.0001) and exhaled nitric oxide normalization was achieved. One single "not adequate" surgery showed a trend to milder improvement, as well as a higher ACCESS score to better olfactory outcome. Conclusions: The accurate selection of uncontrolled relapsing CRSwNP in terms of Type-2 endotyping by multidisciplinary approach can maximize dupilumab efficacy. The number and extent of previous surgeries may differentiate the response, although this effect is difficult to catch in real life. "Adequate" ESS surgery before dupilumab may drive mostly effective disease control.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe excessive and sole use of chemical fertilizers has been found to deteriorate tea quality components. Therefore, to explore the effects of rational application of combined organic and chemical fertilizers on tea growth and quality, a pot experiment was conducted with six treatments of rational and combined organic fertilizer (OF) and chemical fertilizer (CF) which were as follows: control (no fertilizer was applied), 0OF/CF100 (only CF was applied), 25OF/75CF (25% OF + 75% CF), 50CF/50OF (50% OF + 50% CF), 75OF/25CF (75% OF + 25% CF), and 100OF/0CF (only OF was applied). The biomass of tea plant, net photosynthetic rate, chloroplast ultrastructure, and tea quality components including tea polyphenols (TPs), flavonoids, sugars, catechins, caffeine, total amino acids (TAAs), chlorophyll pigments and TP/TAA were measured.RESULTSCompared to control, all fertilization treatments significantly improved tea growth, biomass, and quality components including soluble sugars, TAAs, catechins, caffeine, polyphenols and flavonoids in tea leaves. Among all fertilization treatments, 75OF/25CF and 50OF/50CF treatments had higher plant shoot biomass; 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments significantly improved chloroplast ultrastructure and increased net photosynthetic rate, and had higher TAAs, polyphenols, catechins and caffeine contents; while 75OF/25CF treatment had higher sugar content and lowest TP/TAA. The principal component analysis (PCA) further explored that 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments improved quality components in tea leaves in comparison to the application of only chemical fertilizers.CONCLUSIONThe 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments enhanced both tea growth and quality, which indicate that rational and combination of organic and chemical fertilization or organic management had high potential to improve tea growth and the production of high-yield and better-quality tea leaves.

AB  - Synaptic damage is a pathological hallmark of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACI). Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor has been implicated in regulating peripheral glucose homeostasis and exerting neuroprotective effects on central nervous system. This study investigated the possible roles of Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor in DACI, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic damage. We observed a significant reduction of Angiotensin-(1-7) levels in type 2 diabetic patients with mild cognitive impairment and diabetic cognitive impairment mice. Downregulation of Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor was associated with the decreased synaptic protein expressions in diabetic cognitive impairment mice, and high glucose-stimulated primary hippocampal neurons. Administration of the Mas agonist AVE 0991 into the hippocampus effectively ameliorated synaptic and memory dysfunctions in diabetic cognitive impairment mice. Inhibition of hippocampal neuronal Mas receptor aggravated synaptic damage. Mechanistically, we first elucidated that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) serves as a downstream synaptic function-related target gene of Mas receptor. Furthermore, we identified AKT/FOXO1 pathway as a critical downstream mediator of Mas receptor in modulating PACAP expression, with FOXO1 binding directly to the PACAP promoter region. In conclusion, Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor may modulate synaptic function-related target gene PACAP expression through AKT/FOXO1 pathway, thereby providing a deeper theoretical basis and molecular target for future DACI treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The color of green tea is an important quality indicator. In recent years, shading of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plants has been widely adopted for green tea production to enhance its green color and umami taste. In this study, we identified factors that influence green tea color by (i) examining variation in the chlorophyll content of fresh new tea shoots among cultivars, cropping seasons, and the degree of shading, (ii) investigating the rate of conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin during the tea manufacturing process, specifically with steaming duration, and (iii) analyzing the effects of the new tea shoot properties and the steaming process on colorimetric values of the steamed new tea shoots. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that three factors contributed to the rate of conversion of each chlorophyll type to pheophytin in steamed new tea shoots (ranked by importance): steaming duration > each chlorophyll type (chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b) content of fresh new tea shoots > pH. The colorimetric hue angle (h) value of steamed new tea shoots was influenced by four factors (ranked by importance): steaming duration > total chlorophyll (chlorophyll-a + chlorophyll-b) content in fresh new tea shoots > pH > chlorophyll-a/chlorophyll-b ratio in fresh new tea shoots. CONCLUSION: Differences in the color of new tea shoots can be explained by the aforementioned four factors. The findings will be useful for cultivar selection, and determining the appropriate degree of shading and steaming duration, to produce high-quality green teas with a good appearance.

AB  - Background: Increasing concerns about nutritional deficiency, food security, and sustainability have emphasized work on exploring alternative and sustainable sources of protein. In this study, an initiative to extract and utilize protein concentrates, and hydrolysates from sea buckthorn seed, otherwise a waste material, is undertaken. The effect of hydrolysis using various enzymes namely pepsin (pH 2.0 and 37 degrees C), trypsin (pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C), and protamex (pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C), for different time durations, namely, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, on the structural and functional properties of sea buckthorn seed protein concentrate (SSPC), was elucidated. Results: The emulsifying activity index and solubility of pepsin-hydrolysed SSPC increased significantly and were higher than those of trypsin and protamex hydrolysed SSPC samples. A Fourier transformation infrared study revealed that the enzyme hydrolysis treatment reduced the peak intensity in amide I, II, and III bands. A significant change was found in the beta-sheet, beta-turn and random coiling of the secondary structure of SSPC protein by enzymatic hydrolysis. The particle size ranged from 295.8 to 440, 388 to 713.6, 399 to 890 nm for pepsin, trypsin, and protamex, respectively. The microstructure of pepsin-treated samples showed a more porous and loose structure than native, trypsin and protamex. Antioxidant activity increased significantly for all the samples with enzyme treatments carried out for different periods. Conclusion: The results indicate that the protein-rich hydrolysates could create new opportunities for the development of effective techno-functional additives for use in a wide range of food formulations.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD), the second most common type of dementia, is attributed to lower cerebral blood flow. To date, there is still no available clinical treatment for VaD. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin (GAS) is known for its neuroprotective effects, but the role and mechanisms of action on VD remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the neuroprotective role and underlying mechanisms of GAS on chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated VaD rats and hypoxia-induced injury of HT22 cells. The study showed that GAS relieved learning and memory deficits, ameliorated hippocampus histological lesions in VaD rats. Additionally, GAS down-regulated LC3II/I, Beclin-1 levels and up-regulated P62 level in VaD rats and hypoxia-injured HT22 cells. Notably, GAS rescued the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins expression, which regulates autophagy. Mechanistic studies verify that YP-740, a PI3K agonist, significantly resulted in inhibition of excessive autophagy and apoptosis with no significant differences were observed in the YP-740 and GAS co-treatment. Meantime, we found that LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, substantially abolished GAS-mediated neuroprotection. These results revealed that the effects of GAS on VaD are related to stimulating PI3K/AKT pathway-mediated autophagy, suggesting a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for VaD.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Methadone is a centrally-acting synthetic opioid analgesic widely used in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) programs throughout the world. Given its neurotoxic effects, particularly on the hippocampus, this study aims to address the behavioral and histological alterations in the hippocampus associated with methadone administration. To do so, twenty-four adult male albino rats were randomized into two groups, methadone treatment and control. Methadone was administered subcutaneously (2.5-10 mg/kg) once a day for two consecutive weeks. A comparison was drawn with behavioral and structural changes recorded in the control group. The results showed that methadone administration interrupted spatial learning and memory function. Accordingly, treating rats with methadone not only induced cell death but also prompted the actuation of microgliosis, astrogliosis, and apoptotic biomarkers. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that treating rats with methadone decreased the complexity of astrocyte processes and the complexity of microglia processes. These findings suggest that methadone altered the special distribution of neurons. Also, a substantial increase was observed in the expression of TNF-alpha due to methadone. According to the findings, methadone administration exerts a neurodegenerative effect on the hippocampus via dysregulation of microgliosis, astrogliosis, apoptosis, and neuro-inflammation.

AB  - Alisol A, a triterpene isolated from Alisma Orientale, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and vascular protection. This study was designed to observe the effect of alisol A on cerebral ischemia (CI)-induced neurovascular dysfunction in the hippocampus and to further explore the potential mechanisms. The results showed that alisol A treatment improved the neurological deficits and cognitive impairment of CI mice. Alisol A reduced gliosis and improved neuronal/glial metabolism. Accordingly, alisol A inhibited inflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-1 beta induced by overactivation of astrocytes and microglia, thus protecting the neurovasculature. Furthermore, alisol A promoted the survival of neurons by decreasing the ratio of Bax/ Bcl-2, and protected brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) by upregulating the expression of ZO-1, Occludin and CD31. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) increased after treatment with alisol A. To explore the underlying mechanism, AKT was inhibited. As expected, the neurovascular protection of alisol A above was eliminated by AKT inhibition. The present study primarily suggested that alisol A could exert neurovascular protection in the hippocampus of CI mice by activating the AKT/GSK3 beta pathway and may potentially be used for the treatment of CI.

AB  - Place cells are hippocampal neurons encoding the position of an animal in space. Studies of place cells are essential to understanding the processing of information by neural networks of the brain. An important characteristic of place cell spike trains is phase precession. When an animal is running through the place field, the discharges of the place cells shift from the ascending phase of the theta rhythm through the minimum to the descending phase. The role of excitatory inputs to pyramidal neurons along the Schaffer collaterals and the perforant pathway in phase precession is described, but the role of local interneurons is poorly understood. Our goal is estimating of the contribution of field CA1 interneurons to the phase precession of place cells using mathematical methods. The CA1 field is chosen because it provides the largest set of experimental data required to build and verify the model. Our simulations discover optimal parameters of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the pyramidal neuron so that it generates a spike train with the effect of phase precession. The uniform inhibition of pyramidal neurons best explains the effect of phase precession. Among interneurons, axo-axonal neurons make the greatest contribution to the inhibition of pyramidal cells.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat is beneficial for cardiometabolic health. However, research that directly compares the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) is rare. The present 3-month, three-arm, randomized, controlled-feeding trial aimed to investigate the effects of n-6 PUFA- and MUFA-rich cooking oils on body weight and cardiometabolic profiles among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women at high cardiovascular risk. Ninety participants were recruited and randomly assigned to groups fed diets using n-6 PUFA-rich soybean oil (SO, n = 30), MUFA-rich olive oil (OO, n = 30), and MUFA-rich camellia seed oil (CSO, n = 30) as cooking oils considering traditional Chinese eating habits for 3 months. Participants were required to eat only the foods provided for lunch and dinner, and avoid intake of edible oils in breakfast. Body weight and cardiovascular profiles were measured at the baseline, middle, and end of the intervention, and group differences in changes of outcomes during intervention were examined by a linear mixed model. We found no significant difference in the changes of body weight among the SO group (mean change, 0.31 kg; 95% CI, -0.88 to 0.27), the OO group (mean change, -0.13 kg; 95% CI, -0.62 to 0.36), and the CSO group (mean change, -0.72 kg; 95% CI, -1.38 to -0.07). For secondary outcomes, the OO group showed a slight increase in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.03), while the CSO group showed greater reduction in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.02) when compared with the SO group. These results suggested that MUFA-rich OO and CSO exerted more favorable effects on cardiometabolic profiles among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women at high cardiovascular risk than the n-6 PUFA-rich SO.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a cause of serious morbidity and mortality in newborns. Dexpanthenol, which is metabolized into D-pantothenic acid, has antioxidant and other potentially therapeutic properties. We examined some effects of dexpanthenol on the brains of week-old rat pups with HIE induced by obstruction of the right carotid artery followed by keeping in 8% O2 for 2 hours. Dexpanthenol (500 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to 16 of 32 pups with HIE. Protein, DNA, and lipid oxidation degradation products were assayed and hippocampal and cortical cell apoptosis and neuronal cell numbers were evaluated in stained sections. Dexpanthenol application reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. TNF-alpha and IL-6 cytokine levels in HIE also decreased with dexpanthenol treatment. The numbers of caspase-3 positive cells in the dentate gyrus and CA1/CA2/CA3 regions of the hippocampus was lower, and apoptosis was decreased in the dexpanthenol-treated animals. These findings suggest possible clinical applications of dexpanthenol in human HIE.

AB  - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to counteract seizures when overexpressed or delivered into the brain in various animal models of epileptogenesis or chronic epilepsy. The mechanisms underlying this effect have not been investigated. We here demonstrate for the first time that GDNF enhances GABAergic inhibitory drive onto mouse pyramidal neurons by modulating postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors, particularly in perisomatic inhibitory synapses, by GFR alpha 1 mediated activation of the Ret receptor pathway. Other GDNF receptors, such as NCAM or Syndecan3, are not contributing to this effect. We observed similar alterations by GDNF in human hippocampal slices resected from epilepsy patients. These data indicate that GDNF may exert its seizure-suppressant action by enhancing GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the hippocampal network, thus counteracting the increased excitability of the epileptic brain. This new knowledge can contribute to the development of novel, more precise treatment strategies based on a GDNF gene therapy approach.

AB  - Chronic ethanol exposure (CEE), which can lead to neuroinflammation, is an increasing risk factor for depression disorder, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Recent observations have revealed the associations among psychiatric disorders, ethanol exposure and alterations of the gut microbiota. Here, we found that CEE induced depressive-like behavior, which could be alleviated by probiotics and transferred from donor to recipient mice by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Neuroinflammation and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were also observed in recipient mice. The downregulation of NLRP3 in the hippocampus mitigated CEE-induced depressive-like behavior and neuroinflammation but had no significant effect on FMT recipient mice. Moreover, elevated serum inflammatory factors in recipient mice showed a significant mediation effect between the gut microbiota and depressive-like behavior. Together, our study findings indicate that the gut microbiota contributes to both hippocampal NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation and depressive-like behavior induced by CEE, which may open avenues for potential interventions against CEE-associated psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and severe psychological and mental disorder resulting from experiences of serious trauma or stress and is suffered by many individuals. Previous studies have shown that pretreatment with sevoflurane is efficient in reducing the incidence of PTSD. However, we require a more comprehensive understanding of the specific mechanisms by which sevoflurane works. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been reported to be regulated by sevoflurane, and to improve patient cognition. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms of sevoflurane and the role of EZH2 in PTSD cases. We explored the effects of sevoflurane and EPZ-6438 (inhibitor of EZH2) on rat behavior, followed by an investigation of EZH2 mRNA and protein expression. The effects of sevoflurane and EZH2 on neuronal survival were assessed by western blotting and TUNEL staining, while western blotting was used to examine the expression of PSD95 and the AKT/mTOR proteins. Sevoflurane preconditioning restored EZH2 expression and significantly inhibited apoptosis by regulating phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Synaptic plasticity was also significantly improved. These results suggest that pretreatment with sevoflurane could play an important role in PTSD prevention by regulating EZH2 expression.

AB  - Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, mainly infects children and the immunocompromized and is responsible for a series of clinical manifestations, including cough, fever, rhinorrhoea, bronchiolitis and croup. HCoV-NL63, which was first isolated from a seven-month-old child in 2004, has led to infections worldwide and accounts for 10% of all respiratory illnesses caused by etiological agents. However, effective antivirals against HCoV-NL63 infection are currently unavailable. The HCoV-NL63 main protease (M-pro), also called 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), plays a vital role in mediating viral replication and transcription by catalyzing the cleavage of replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) into functional subunits. Moreover, M-pro is highly conserved among all coronaviruses, thus making it a prominent drug target for antiviral therapy. Here, four crystal structures of HCoV-NL63 M-pro in the apo form at different pH values are reported at resolutions of up to 1.78 angstrom. Comparison with M-pro from other human betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV reveals common and distinct structural features in different genera and extends knowledge of the diversity, function and evolution of coronaviruses.

AB  - Despite strong evidence supporting the important roles of both apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) and microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, the effects of microglia on neuronal APOE4-related AD pathogenesis remain elusive. To examine such effects, we utilized microglial depletion in a chimeric model with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons in mouse hippocampus. Specifically, we transplanted homozygous APOE4, isogenic APOE3, and APOE-knockout (APOE-KO) iPSC-derived human neurons into the hippocampus of human APOE3 or APOE4 knockin mice and then depleted microglia in half of the chimeric mice. We found that both neuronal APOE and microglial presence were important for the formation of Ab and tau pathologies in an APOE isoform-dependent manner (APOE4 > APOE3). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified two pro-inflammatory microglial subtypes with elevated MHC-II gene expression enriched in chimeric mice with human APOE4 neuron transplants. These findings highlight the concerted roles of neuronal APOE, especially APOE4, and microglia in AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common focal epilepsy. One-third of patients have drug refractory seizures and are left with suboptimal therapeutic options such as brain tissue-destructive surgery. Here, we report the development and characterization of a cell therapy alternative for drug-resistant MTLE, which is derived from a human embryonic stem cell line and comprises cryopreserved, post-mitotic, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) pallial-type GABAergic interneurons. Single-dose intrahippocampal delivery of the interneurons in a mouse model of chronic MTLE resulted in consistent mesiotemporal seizure suppression, with most animals becoming seizure-free and surviving longer. The grafted interneurons dispersed locally, functionally integrated, persisted long term, and significantly reduced dentate granule cell dispersion, a pathological hallmark of MTLE. These disease-modifying effects were dose-dependent, with a broad therapeutic range. No adverse effects were observed. These findings support an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05135091) for drug-resistant MTLE.

AB  - Aluminum is a common environmental neurotoxin. Aluminum ions can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in different brain regions, damage brain tissue, and cause cognitive impairment, but the molecular mechanism of aluminum neurotoxicity is not precise. This study investigated the effects of miR-204-5p, target gene EphB2, and downstream signaling pathway NMDAR-ERK-CREB-Arc on cognitive dysfunction induced by aluminum exposure. The results showed that the learning and memory of the rats were impaired in behavior. The accumulation of aluminum in the hippocampus resulted in the damage of nerve cell morphology in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The expression level of miR-204-5p was increased, and the mRNA and protein expressions of EphB2, NMDAR2B, ERK1/2, CREB, and Arc were decreased. The results indicated that the mechanism of impaired learning and memory induced by aluminum exposure might promote the expression of miR-204-5P and further inhibit the expression of the target gene EphB2 and its downstream signaling pathway NMDAR-ERK-CREB-Arc.

AB  - Dysfunction in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (H-PFC) circuit is a critical determinant of schizophrenia. Screening of pyridazinone-risperidone hybrids on this circuit revealed EGIS 11150 (S 36549). EGIS 11150 induced theta rhythm in hippocampal slice preparations in the stratum lacunosum molecular area of CA1, which was resistant to atropine and prazosin. EGIS 11150 enhanced H-PFC coherence, and increased the 8-9 Hz theta band of the EEG power spectrum (from 0.002 mg/kg i.p, at >30x lower doses than clozapine, and >100x for olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol). EGIS 11150 fully blocked the effects of phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine on EEG. Inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in H-PFC was blocked by platform stress, but was fully restored by EGIS 11150 (0.01 mg/kg i.p.), whereas clozapine (0.3 mg/kg ip) only partially restored LTP. EGIS 11150 has a unique electrophysiological profile, so phenotypical screening on H-PFC connectivity can reveal novel antipsychotics.

AB  - Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic disease, characterized by clinically notable polymorphism. Respiratory disease is the main factor that influences the disease outcome and prognosis of the patient with CF, bacterial infections being responsible for severe exacerbations and rhinosinusitis a difficult complication, besides lung disease. Aim: The aim of the paper was to present a case series of CF-associated nasal polyposis and our management experience, providing new data for nasal and sinus complications. Patients, Materials and Methods: Patients attending the National Cystic Fibrosis Center, Timisoara, Romania, were evaluated for nasal polyposis. Besides clinical examination, endoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) was performed for comprehensive evaluation. Patients with persistent symptoms or with complicated sinusitis underwent surgical approach. Results: Fourteen (18.18%) children were diagnosed with nasal polyposis and had surgery, with positive outcomes. One patient received Omalizumab for an associated, uncontrolled asthma with a subsequent substantial effect with the significant polyp reduction and lack of recurrence. Conclusions: Even if extremely difficult to manage, complicated nasal polyposis CF related might have an improved outcome and better life quality.

TI  - A chaperone-like function of FUS ensures TAZ condensate dynamics and transcriptional activation
T2  - NATURE CELL BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The Hippo pathway has important roles in organ development, tissue homeostasis and tumour growth. Its downstream effector TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes target gene expression through the formation of biomolecular condensates. However, the mechanisms that regulate the biophysical properties of TAZ condensates to enable Hippo signalling are not well understood. Here using chemical crosslinking combined with an unbiased proteomics approach, we show that FUS associates with TAZ condensates and exerts a chaperone-like effect to maintain their proper liquidity and robust transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, the low complexity sequence domain of FUS targets the coiled-coil domain of TAZ in a phosphorylation-regulated manner, which ensures the liquidity and dynamicity of TAZ condensates. In cells lacking FUS, TAZ condensates transition into gel-like or solid-like assembles with immobilized TAZ, which leads to reduced expression of target genes and inhibition of pro-tumorigenic activity. Thus, our findings identify a chaperone-like function of FUS in Hippo regulation and demonstrate that appropriate biophysical properties of transcriptional condensates are essential for gene activation.
   Shao et al. report that FUS interacts with the transcriptional coactivator TAZ, maintaining liquid-like properties of TAZ biomolecular condensates and enhancing TAZ transcriptional activity.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis using pectinase is critical for producing high-yield and quality sea buckthorn juice. This study determined the optimal temperature, time, and enzyme dosage combinations to guide manufacturers. A temperature of 60 degrees C, hydrolysis time of 3 h, and 0.3% enzyme dosage gave 64.1% juice yield-25% higher than without enzymes. Furthermore, monitoring physicochemical properties reveals enzyme impacts on composition. Higher dosages increase soluble solids up to 15% and soluble fiber content by 35% through cell wall breakdown. However, excessive amounts over 0.3% decrease yields. Pectin concentration also declines dose-dependently, falling by 91% at 0.4%, improving juice stability but needing modulation to retain viscosity. Electrochemical fingerprinting successfully differentiates process conditions, offering a rapid quality control tool. Its potential for commercial inline use during enzymatic treatment requires exploration. Overall, connecting optimized parameters to measured effects provides actionable insights for manufacturers to boost yields, determine enzyme impacts on nutrition/functionality, and introduce novel process analytical technology. Further investigations of health properties using these conditions could expand sea buckthorn juice functionality.

AB  - Neuro-inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction are associated with depression. Evidence shows that adipokines enter the brain from the circulation, which regulates depressive behaviors. Omentin-1 is a newly identified adipocytokine that has anti-inflammatory effects, but little is known about its role in neuroinflammation and mood-relevant behavior. Our results showed omentin-1 knockout mice (Omentin-1-/-) increased susceptibility to anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, which are associated with abnormalities of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and impaired BBB permeability. Moreover, omentin-1 depletion significantly increased hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 & beta;, TNF & alpha;, IL-6), caused microglial activation, inhibited hippocampus neurogenesis, and resulted in autophagy impairment by dysregulating ATG genes. Omentin-1 deficiency also sensitized mice to the behavioral changes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting that omentin-1 could rescue neuro-inflammation by acting as an anti-depressant. Our in vitro microglia cell culture data confirmed that recombinant omentin-1 suppresses microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression induced by LPS. Our study suggests that omentin-1 can be used as a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of depression by providing a barrier-promoting effect and an endogenous antiinflammatory balance to downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Many genes responsible for Malignant mesothelioma (MM) have been identified as tumor suppressor genes and it is difficult to target these genes directly at a molecular level. We searched for the gene which showed synthetic lethal phenotype with LATS2, one of the MM causative genes and one of the kinases in the Hippo pathway. Here we showed that knockdown of SMG6 results in synthetic lethality in LATS2-inactivated cells. We found that this synthetic lethality required the nuclear translocation of YAP1 and TAZ. Both are downstream factors of the Hippo pathway. We also demonstrated that this synthetic lethality did not require SMG6 in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) but in regulating telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activity. In addition, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDP) activity of TERT was required for this synthetic lethal phenotype. We confirmed the inhibitory effects of LATS2 and SMG6 on cell proliferation in vivo. The result suggests an interaction between the Hippo and TERT signaling pathways. We also propose that SMG6 and TERT are novel molecular target candidates for LATS2-inactivated cancers such as MM.

AB  - Increasing attention is being focused on the use of polypeptide-based N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists for the treatment of nervous system disorders. In our study on Achyranthes bidentata Blume, we identified an NMDA receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) antagonist that exerts distinct neuroprotective actions. This antagonist is a 33 amino acid peptide, named bidentatide, which contains three disulfide bridges that form a cysteine knot motif. We determined the neuroactive potential of bidentatide by evaluating its in vitro effects against NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity. The results showed that pretreating primary cultured hippocampal neurons with bidentatide prevented NMDA-induced cell death and apoptosis via multiple mechanisms that involved intracellular Ca2+ inhibition, NMDA current inhibition, and apoptosis-related protein expression regulation. These mechanisms were all dependent on bidentatide-induced inhibitory regulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors; thus, bidentatide may contribute to the development of neuroprotective agents that would likely possess the high selectivity and safety profiles inherent in peptide drugs.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is an important driver of Tau pathology, gliosis, and degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, the mechanisms underlying these APOE4-driven pathological effects remain elusive. Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched dis-ease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice. Thus, HMGB1 inhibitors represent a promising approach for treating APOE4-related AD.

AB  - Despite sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated greater widespread virulence and unique challenges to researchers aiming to study its pathogenicity in humans. The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. In this study, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2, by utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor as well as pseudotyped-virus infectivity assays. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, efficacy of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. We also look at the implications the mutations may have on virus transmissibility, host susceptibility, and the virus transmission path to humans. These critical determinants of virus-host interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.

AB  - Inhibiting a specific target in cancer cells and reducing unwanted side effects has become a promising strategy in pancreatic cancer treatment. MAP4K4 is associated with pancreatic cancer development and correlates with poor clinical outcomes. By phosphorylating MKK4, proteins associated with cell apoptosis and survival are translated. Therefore, inhibiting MAP4K4 activity in pancreatic tumours is a new therapeutic strategy. Herein, we performed a structure-based virtual screening to identify MAP4K4 inhibitors and discovered the compound F389-0746 with a potent inhibition (IC50 120.7 nM). The results of kinase profiling revealed that F389-0746 was highly selective to MAP4K4 and less likely to cause side effects. Results of in vitro experiments showed that F389-0746 significantly suppressed cancer cell growth and viability. Results of in vivo experiments showed that F389-0746 displayed comparable tumour growth inhibition with the group treated with gemcitabine. These findings suggest that F389-0746 has promising potential to be further developed as a novel pancreatic cancer treatment.

AB  - The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is the main route of calcium (Ca2+) entry into neuronal mitochondria. This channel has been linked to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and cell death under neurotoxic conditions, but its physiologic roles for normal brain function remain poorly understood. Despite high expression of MCU in excitatory hippocampal neurons, it is unknown whether this channel is required for learning and memory. Here, we genetically down-regulated the Mcu gene in dentate granule cells (DGCs) of the hippocampus and found that this manipulation increases the overall respiratory activity of mitochondrial complexes I and II, augmenting the generation of reactive oxygen species in the context of impaired electron transport chain. The metabolic remodeling of MCU-deficient neurons also involved changes in the expression of enzymes that participate in glycolysis and the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as the cellular antioxidant defenses. We found that MCU deficiency in DGCs does not change circadian rhythms, spontaneous exploratory behavior, or cognitive function in middle-aged mice (11-13 months old), when assessed with a food-motivated working memory test with three choices. DGC-targeted down-regulation of MCU significantly impairs reversal learning assessed with an 8-arm radial arm water maze but does not affect their ability to learn the task for the first time. Our results indicate that neuronal MCU plays an important physiologic role in memory formation and may be a potential therapeutic target to develop interventions aimed at improving cognitive function in aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain injury.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are key forms of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. LTP and LTD are believed to underlie the processes occurring during learning and memory. Search of mechanisms responsible for switching from LTP to LTD and vice versa is an important fundamental task. Protein synthesis blockers (PSB) are widely used in models of memory impairment and LTP suppression. Here, we found that blockade of serine/threonine phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) with the specific blockers, calyculin A (CalyA) or okadaic acid (OA), and simultaneous blockade of the protein translation by anisomycin or cycloheximide leads to a switch from PSB-impaired LTP to LTD. PP1/PP2Adependent LTD was extremely sensitive to the intensity of the test stimuli, whose increase restored the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) to the values corresponding to control LTP in the non treated slices. PP1/PP2A blockade affected the basal synaptic transmission, increasing the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) ratio, and restored the PSB-impaired PPF 3 h after tetanus. Prolonged exposure to anisomycin led to the NO synthesis increase (measured using fluorescent dye) both in the dendrites and somata of CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal layers. OA partially prevented the NO production in the CA1 dendrites, as well in the CA3 and DG somas. Direct measurements of changes in serine/threonine phosphatase (STPP) activity revealed importance of the PP1/PP2A-dependent component in the late LTP phase (L-LTP) in anisomycin-treated slices. Thus, serine/threonine phosphatases PP1/PP2A influence both basal synaptic transmission and stimulation-induced synaptic plasticity. ? 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selective macroautophagy/autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis through the lysosomal degradation of specific cellular proteins or organelles. The pro-survival effect of selective autophagy has been well-characterized, but the mechanism by which it drives cell death is still poorly understood. Here, we use a quantitative proteomic approach to identify HPCAL1 (hippocalcin like 1) as a novel autophagy receptor for the selective degradation of CDH2 (cadherin 2) during ferroptosis. HPCAL1-dependent CDH2 depletion increases susceptibility to ferroptotic death by reducing membrane tension and favoring lipid peroxidation. Site-directed mutagenesis aided by bioinformatic analyses revealed that the autophagic degradation of CDH2 requires PRKCQ (protein kinase C theta)-mediated HPCAL1 phosphorylation on Thr149, as well as a non-classical LC3-interacting region motif located between amino acids 46-51. An unbiased drug screening campaign involving 4208 small molecule compounds led to the identification of a ferroptosis inhibitor that suppressed HPCAL1 expression. The genetic or pharmacological inhibition of HPCAL1 prevented ferroptosis-induced tumor suppression and pancreatitis in suitable mouse models. These findings provide a framework for understanding how selective autophagy promotes ferroptotic cell death.

AB  - Background: Our previous study found that mouse embryonic neural stem cell (NSC)-derived exosomes (EXOs) regulated NSC differentiation via the miR-9/Hes1 axis. However, the effects of EXOs on brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) dysfunction via the miR-9/Hes1 axis remain unknown. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the effects of EXOs on BMEC proliferation, migration, and death via the miR-9/Hes1 axis. Methods: Immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8 assay, wound healing assay, calcein-acetoxymethyl/propidium iodide staining, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to determine the role and mechanism of EXOs on BMECs. Results: EXOs promoted BMEC proliferation and migration and reduced cell death under hypoxic conditions. The overexpression of miR-9 promoted BMEC proliferation and migration and reduced cell death under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, miR-9 downregulation inhibited BMEC proliferation and migration and also promoted cell death. Hes1 silencing ameliorated the effect of amtagomiR-9 on BMEC proliferation and migration and cell death. Hyperemic structures were observed in the regions of the hippocampus and cortex in hypoxia-induced mice. Meanwhile, EXO treatment improved cerebrovascular alterations. Conclusion: NSC-derived EXOs can promote BMEC proliferation and migration and reduce cell death via the miR-9/Hes1 axis under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, EXO therapeutic strategies could be considered for hypoxia-induced vascular injury.

AB  - 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic drug with a good anti-cancer effect on various types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer and breast cancer. However, previous studies have found that 5-FU could induce cognitive deficit in clinics. As ganoderic acid, isolated from Ganoderma lucidum, has a protective effect on neurons, this study investigated the effects of ganoderic acid (GA) against 5-FU-induced cognitive dysfunction with a series of behavioral tests and related indicators. Experimental results showed that GA significantly prevented the reduction of spatial and non-spatial memory in 5-FU-treated mice. In addition, GA not only ameliorated the damage to hippocampal neurons and mitochondrial structure, but also significantly improved abnormal protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis related marker PGC-1 alpha, and mitochondrial dynamics related markers MFN2, DRP1 and FIS1 in the hippocampi of 5-FU-treated mice. Moreover, GA could up-regulate the expression of neuronal survival and growth-related proteins, such as BDNF, p-ERK, p-CREB, p-Akt, p-GSK3 beta, Nrf2, p-mTOR, and p-S6, in the hippocampi of 5-FU-treated mice. These results suggest that GA could prevent cognitive dysfunction in mice treated with 5-FU via preventing mitochondrial impairment and enhancing neuronal survival and growth, which provide evidence for GA as a promising adjunctive therapy for chemotherapy related cognitive impairment in clinics.

AB  - The aim of the experiment was to test the effect of an elevated level of glucocorticoids on the mouse hippocampal transcriptome after 12 h of treatment with corticosterone that was administered during an active phase of the circadian cycle. Additionally, we also tested the circadian changes in gene expression and the decay time of transcriptomic response to corticosterone. Gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Obtained results show that transcriptomic responses to glucocorticoids are heterogeneous in terms of the decay time with some genes displaying persistent changes in expression during 9 h of rest. We have also found a considerable overlap between genes regulated by corticosterone and genes implicated previously in stress response. The examples of such genes are Acer2, Agt, Apod, Aqp4, Etnppl, Fabp7, Fam107a, Fjx1, Fmo2, Galnt15, Gjc2, Heph, Hes5, Htra1, Jdp2, Kif5a, Lfng, Lrg1, Mgp, Mt1, Pglyrp1, Pla2g3, Plin4, Pllp, Ptgds, Ptn, Slc2a1, Slco1c1, Sult1a1, Thbd and Txnip. This indicates that the applied model is a useful tool for the investigation of mechanisms underlying the stress response.

AB  - Hyperactivity of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in CA1 is an early event in Alzheimer's disease. However, factors accounting for the hyperactivity of CA1 PNs remain to be completely investigated. In the present study, we report that the serotonergic signaling is abnormal in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 mice. Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons in the median raphe nucleus (MRN) attenuates the activity of CA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice by regulating the intrinsic properties or inhibitory synaptic transmission of CA1 PNs through 5-HT3aR and/or 5-HT1aR. Furthermore, activating MRN 5-HT neu-rons improves memory in hAPP-J20 mice, and this effect is mediated by 5-HT3aR and 5-HT1aR. Direct acti-vation of 5-HT3aR and 5-HT1aR with their selective agonists also improves the memory of hAPP-J20 mice. Together, we identify the impaired 5-HT/5-HT3aR and/or 5-HT/5-HT1aR signaling as pathways contributing to the hyperexcitability of CA1 PNs and the impaired cognition in hAPP-J20 mice.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive degeneration of the function of the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system and the decline of cognition and memory abilities. The dysfunctions of the cognitive and memory battery are closely related to inhibitions of neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and brain-derived cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to associate with the cholinergic system and long-term potentiation. Vitis vinifera, the common grapevine, is viewed as the important dietary source of stilbenoids, particularly the widely-studied monomeric resveratrol to be used as a natural compound with wide-ranging therapeutic benefits on neurodegenerative diseases. Here we found that ampelopsin A is a major compound in V. vinifera and it has neuroprotective effects on experimental animals. Bath application of ampelopsin A (10 ng/mu L) restores the long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment induced by scopolamine (100 mu M) in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Based on these results, we administered the ampelopsin A (10 ng/mu L, three times a week) into the third ventricle of the brain in C57BL/6 mice for a month. Chronic administration of ampelopsin A into the brain ameliorated cognitive memory-behaviors in mice given scopolamine (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.). Studies of mice's hippocampi showed that the response of ampelopsin A was responsible for the restoration of the cholinergic deficits and molecular signal cascades via BDNF/CREB pathways. In conclusion, the central administration of ampelopsin A contributes to increasing neurocognitive and neuroprotective effects on intrinsic neuronal excitability and behaviors, partly through elevated BDNF/CREB-related signaling.

AB  - The general anesthesia associated with long-term cognitive impairment has been causing the concern of the whole society. In particular, repeated anesthetic exposures may affect executive function, processing speed, and fine motor skills, which all directly depended on the functions of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and axons. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. To investigate the spatial and temporal alterations in oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampus following repeated sevoflurane exposures (3%, for 2 h) from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P8, we used immunofluorescence, Western blot, and a battery of behavioral tests. As previously stated, we confirmed that early anesthetic exposures hampered both cognitive and motor performance during puberty in the rotarod and banes tests. Intriguingly, we discovered that the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) was immediately enhanced after general anesthesia in the CC and hippocampus from P8 to P32. From P8 through P15, the overall oligodendrocyte population remained constant. However, along with the structural myelin abnormalities, the matured oligodendrocytes statistically reduced in the CC (from P15) and hippocampus (from P32). Administration of clemastine, which could induce OPC differentiation and myelin formation, significantly increased matured oligodendrocytes and promoted myelination and cognition. Collectively, we first demonstrated the bi-directional influence of early sevoflurane exposures on oligodendrocyte maturation and proliferation, which contributes to the cognitive impairment induced by general anesthesia. These findings illustrated the dynamic changes in oligodendrocytes in the developing brain following anesthetic exposures, as well as possible therapeutic strategies for multiple general anesthesia associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome and strongly associated with disability, mortality and hospitalization. Frailty is commonly measured using the frailty index (FI), based on the accumulation of a number of health deficits during the life course. The mechanisms underlying FI are multifactorial and not well understood, but a genetic basis has been suggested with heritability estimates between 30 and 45%. Understanding the genetic determinants and biological mechanisms underpinning FI may help to delay or even prevent frailty. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of a frailty index in European descent UK Biobank participants (n = 164,610, 60-70 years) and Swedish TwinGene participants (n = 10,616, 41-87 years). FI calculation was based on 49 or 44 self-reported items on symptoms, disabilities and diagnosed diseases for UK Biobank and TwinGene, respectively. 14 loci were associated with the FI (p < 5*10(-8)). Many FI-associated loci have established associations with traits such as body mass index, cardiovascular disease, smoking, HLA proteins, depression and neuroticism; however, one appears to be novel. The estimated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of the FI was 11% (0.11, SE 0.005). In enrichment analysis, genes expressed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were significantly downregulated (adjusted p < 0.05). We also used Mendelian randomization to identify modifiable traits and exposures that may affect frailty risk, with a higher educational attainment genetic risk score being associated with a lower degree of frailty. Risk of frailty is influenced by many genetic factors, including well-known disease risk factors and mental health, with particular emphasis on pathways in the brain.

AB  - Nowadays, the consumer trend towards healthier food choices is unquestionable. Meat products enriched with nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants, are gaining much more interest among consumers. However, products are susceptible to quality deterioration and a short shelf-life of meat through lipid oxidation due to the lack of antioxidants in the meat. In this regard, the efficacy of dietary sea buckthorn leaves (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) together with Chromium on the nutritional quality of meat and lipid oxidative stability was investigated. An experiment (28 days long) was carried out on 90 Cobb 500 chickens assigned into three treatments: a control treatment based on corn and soybean meal, without Chromium (T0) and two treatments supplemented either with 0.00002% Chromium (T1) or with 0.00002% Chromium and 2% sea buckthorn leaves (T2). Dietary supplementation of SBL and Cr improved the PUFA/MUFA ratio, DHA concentration and decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio compared to the other treatments. Moreover, the breast and thigh meat belonging to T1 and T2 treatments showed a higher concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin, Fe and Zn and expressed a higher antioxidant capacity compared to those from T0. Furthermore, n-6 and n-3 PUFA deposited preferentially in the thigh meat rather than in the breast meat. The results from the study showed that dietary SBL and Cr significantly improved the fatty acid pattern and the oxidative stability of chicken breast meat, lowering the TBARS level after storage. In conclusion, SBL and Cr are promising dietary bioactive compounds with beneficial effects to obtain nutrient-enriched meat products.

AB  - A world-wide COVID-19 pandemic intensified strongly the studies of molecular mechanisms related to the coronaviruses. The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assemblypackaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses, RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.

AB  - Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent in recent years, but the genetic architecture remains unknown. We perform a multitrait analysis of genome-wide association study on NSSI, incorporating selfharm and suicide attempt. Common genetic variants account for 6.03% of NSSI variance. Three risk loci are associated with NSSI at 7q31.2 (rs62474683), DCC (rs4372758), and LCA5L/GET1/GET1-SH3BGR (rs2837022). Increased expression levels of GET1/SH3BGR in hippocampus relates to NSSI risk. Fine-mapping identifies seven likely causal variants, and colocalization with rs4281987 and rs2837022 evidences SH3BGR/ GET1 expression in hippocampus to NSSI. In an independent sample, polygenic risk score for NSSI is associated with children's NSSI behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt (odds ratios [ORs]: 1.14-1.37). Reduction in right temporal pole volume mediates NSSI genetic liability for children's NSSI behavior. Walking for pleasure and exercises like swimming and bowling reduces NSSI risk, whereas smoking increases it. This study elucidates the NSSI genetic basis and its impact on children's emotions, behavior, and brain structure.

AB  - Ciliates assemble numerous microtubular structures into complex cortical patterns. During ciliate division, the pattern is duplicated by intracellular segmentation that produces a tandem of daughter cells. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the induction and positioning of the division boundary involves two mutually antagonistic factors: posterior CdaA (cyclin E) and anterior CdaI (Hippo kinase). Here, we characterized the related cdaH-1 allele, which confers a pleiotropic patterning phenotype including an absence of the division boundary and an anterior-posterior mispositioning of the new oral apparatus. CdaH is a Fused or Stk36 kinase ortholog that localizes to multiple sites that correlate with the effects of its loss, including the division boundary and the new oral apparatus. CdaH acts downstream of CdaA to induce the division boundary and drives asymmetric cytokinesis at the tip of the posterior daughter. CdaH both maintains the anterior-posterior position of the new oral apparatus and interacts with CdaI to pattern ciliary rows within the oral apparatus. Thus, CdaH acts at multiple scales, from induction and positioning of structures on the cell -wide polarity axis to local organelle -level patterning.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by accumulation of amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta O) in the brain, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. Grandisin, a tetrahydrofuran neolignan, exhibits relevant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Interestingly, grandisin-based compounds were shown to prevent A beta O-induced neuronal death in vitro. However, no study has assessed the effect of these compounds on the AD animal model. This study focuses on a triazole grandisin analogue (TGA) synthesized using simplification and bioisosteric drug design, which resulted in improved potency and solubility compared with the parent compound. This study aimed to investigate the possible in vivo effects of TGA against A beta O-induced AD. Male C57/Bl6 mice underwent stereotaxic intracerebroventricular A beta O (90 mu M) or vehicle injections. 24 h after surgery, animals received intraperitoneal treatment with TGA (1 mg/kg) or vehicle, administered on a 14 day schedule. One day after treatment completion, a novel object recognition task (NORT) was performed. Memantine (10 mg/kg) was administered as a positive control. NORT retention sessions were performed on days 8 and 16 after A beta O injection. Immediately after retention sessions, animals were euthanized for cortex and hippocampus collection. Specimens were subjected to oxidative stress and cytokine analyses. TGA reduced the level of cortex/hippocampus lipoperoxidation and prevented cognitive impairment in A beta O-injected mice. Additionally, TGA reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in the hippocampus. By contrast, memantine failed to prevent cortex/hippocampus lipid peroxidation, recognition memory decline, and A beta O-induced increases in TNF and IFN-gamma levels in the hippocampus. Thus, memantine was unable to avoid the A beta O-induced persistent cognitive impairment. The results showed that TGA may prevent memory impairment by exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in A beta O-injected mice. Moreover, TGA exhibited a persistent neuroprotective effect compared to memantine, reflecting an innovative profile of this promising agent against neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is often reported in patients with post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome, but its underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein or its fragments are released from cells during infection, reaching different tissues, including the CNS, irrespective of the presence of the viral RNA. Here, we demonstrate that brain infusion of Spike protein in mice has a late impact on cognitive func-tion, recapitulating post-COVID-19 syndrome. We also show that neuroinflammation and hippocampal microgliosis mediate Spike-induced memory dysfunction via complement-dependent engulfment of synap-ses. Genetic or pharmacological blockage of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling protects animals against synapse elimination and memory dysfunction induced by Spike brain infusion. Accordingly, in a cohort of 86 patients who recovered from mild COVID-19, the genotype GG TLR4-2604G>A (rs10759931) is associated with poor cognitive outcome. These results identify TLR4 as a key target to investigate the long-term cogni-tive dysfunction after COVID-19 infection in humans and rodents.

AB  - Hippocampal sclerosis, the major neuropathological hallmark of temporal lobe epilepsy, is characterized by different patterns of neuronal loss. The mechanisms of cell-type-specific vulnerability and their progression and histopathological classification remain controversial. Using single-cell electrophysiology in vivo and immediate-early gene expression, we reveal that superficial CA1 pyramidal neurons are overactive in epileptic rodents. Bulk tissue and single-nucleus expression profiling disclose sublayer-specific transcriptomic signatures and robust microglial pro-inflammatory responses. Transcripts regulating neuronal processes such as voltage channels, synaptic signaling, and cell adhesion are deregulated differently by epilepsy across sublayers, whereas neurodegenerative signatures primarily involve superficial cells. Pseudotime analysis of gene expression in single nuclei and in situ validation reveal separated trajectories from health to epilepsy across cell types and identify a subset of superficial cells undergoing a later stage in neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that sublayer- and cell-type-specific changes associated with selective CA1 neuronal damage contribute to progression of hippocampal sclerosis.

AB  - Neuronal splicing regulator RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog 3 (NeuN/RbFox3), is expressed in postmitotic neurons and distributed heterogeneously in the cell. During excitotoxicity events caused by the excess glutamate, several alterations that culminate in neuronal death have been described. However, NeuN/RbFox3 organization and distribution are still unknown. Therefore, our objective was to analyze the nucleocytoplasmic distribution and organization of NeuN/RbFox3 in hippocampal and cortical neurons using an excitotoxicity model with monosodium glutamate salt (MSG). We used neonatal Wistar rats administered subcutaneously with 4 MSG mg/ kg during the postnatal day (PND) 1, 3, 5, and 7. The control group was rats without MSG administration. On 14 PND, the brain was removed, and coronal sections were used for immunodetection with the antibody NeuN, DAPI, and the propidium iodide staining for histological evaluation. The results indicate that in the control group, NeuN/RbFox3 was organized into macromolecular condensates inside and outside the nucleus, forming defined nuclear compartments. Additionally, NeuN/RbFox3 was distributed proximal to the nucleus in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the group treated with MSG, the distribution was diffuse and dispersed in the nucleus and cytoplasm without the formation of compartments in the nucleus. Our findings, which highlight the significant impact of MSG administration in the neonatal period on the distribution and organization of NeuN/ RbFox3 of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, offer a new perspective to investigate MSG alterations in the developmental brain.

AB  - Mitochondrial adaptation is important for stress resistance throughout life. Here we show that WDR23 loss results in an enrichment for genes regulated by nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), which coordinates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory functions, and an increased steady state level of several nuclear coded mitochondrial resident proteins in the brain. Wdr23KO also increases the endogenous levels of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and the relaxin-3 peptide (RLN3), both of which have established roles in mediating mitochondrial metabolic and oxidative stress responses. Taken together, these studies reveal an important role for WDR23 as a component of the mitochondrial homeostat in the murine brain.

AB  - Evidence acquired in the past years highlighted the high complexity of Neanderthal subsistence strategies in terms of the spectrum of exploited species (mammals, birds, aquatic resources). However, in many sites diet was mainly focused on the acquisition and processing of large and medium-sized ungulates. In these cases, the evaluation of killing profiles and skeletal frequencies has allowed to highlight behavioural variability among Mousterian populations living in different geographical areas. In the frame of these studies, zooarchaeology and taphonomy of the Middle Palaeolithic phases (MIS 4/MIS 3) from the external deposit of Grotta di Santa Croce (Apulia, southern Italy) are presented in this paper. Faunal assemblage is almost exclusively composed of horse and aurochs remains. The sample, which is not altered by carnivore activities, mainly consists of intensively fractured limb bone shafts and isolated teeth. Epiphyses, tarsal/carpal bones, and phalanges are quite rare, as well as unidentified spongy bone fragments. Analysis of tooth eruption and wear points to the exploitation of adult individuals, rather than juveniles and sub-adults. Body part profiles, as well as mortality ones point to a specific hunting behaviour that may reflect particular nutritional needs. The hypothesis of an intense exploitation of fats is discussed.

AB  - Camelina sativa (Camelina) is an oilseed crop that in recent years has gained importance due to its closeness to the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), its low agronomical requirements, and the ability to grow under temperate conditions. To explore all the agronomical and biotechnological possibilities of this crop, it is important to evaluate the usability of the molecular procedures currently available for plants. One of the main tools for plant genetic modification and genetic studies is stable plant transformation. In the case of Arabidopsis, as well as Camelina, floral dipping is the easiest and most used method, which is followed by a selection for stable transformants. Commonly used selection methods for Camelina involve Discosoma sp. red protein (DsRed) fluorescence screening. However, many widely used plant transformation vector systems, for example those used in Arabidopsis and grasses, rely on antibiotic resistance selection. In this study, we evaluated the usability of different antibiotics including kanamycin (Kan), hygromycin (Hyg) and BASTA, and propose optimised protocols for selecting T1 and subsequent generation Camelina transformants, as well as crossing of Camelina lines expressing different transgenes. Finally, we also showed that overexpression of genes encoding enzymes from the seco-iridoid pathway of Catharanthus roseus using Hyg or BASTA-based expression constructs could be successfully achieved in Camelina, demonstrating the potential of these methods for metabolic engineering. Overall, in this study we show an efficient way to sterilize seeds, handle and perform selection of Camelina for use with transformation vectors designed for Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate a successful method to cross Camelina sativa and provide qRT-PCR results to prove its effectiveness.

It has been widely used for the therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, dementia, anxiety, insomnia, and depression for several centuries in China. Aim of the study: This study aims to analyze differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the plasma exosomes of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and after the Chaihu-Longgu-Muli Decoction (CLMD) therapy and to explore the biomarkers of TLE and the potential targets of CLMD in treating TLE. Materials and methods: The plasma exosomes of normal people and patients with TLE before the treatment of oxcarbazepine (OXC) and combined treatment of OXC and CLMD (OXC.CLMD) were harvested. The exosomes were separated from plasma through ultracentrifugation and then identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and flow cytometry. The DEPs were analyzed by proteomics and then subjected to gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. The protein level of key genes was detected using Western blot. A lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy rat model was established and treated with OXC alone, OXC. CLMD, and CLMD alone (low dose and high dose). Neuronal injury in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) expression in the brain tissues were detected using H & E staining, Nissl staining, and Western blot. Results: The proteomic analysis showed several DEPs were present among plasma exosomes in the four groups; DEPs were enriched in epilepsy-related function and pathway. Four key proteins were screened, including RPL6, Nucleolin (NCL), Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), and Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Among them, RPL6, NCL, and LDHA protein levels were downregulated and APOA1 protein level was upregulated in the plasma exosomes of TLE patients. After OXC and OXC. CLMD treatment, the protein level of RPL6, NCL, and LDHA was increased, and the APOA1 protein level was decreased. Moreover, the RPL6 protein level was further elevated after OXC. CLMD treatment than that after OXC treatment. In the TLE rat model, neuronal degeneration and necrosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus increased and RPL6 expression level decreased. After the treatment with OXC, OXC. CLMD, and CLMD alone, the degeneration and necrosis of neurons decreased, and the RPL6 expression level was increased; RPL6 upregulation was remarkably obvious after CLMD treatment. Conclusions: RPL6, NCL, LDHA and APOA1 are the DEPs in the plasma exosomes of patients with TLE before and after therapy. RPL6 might be a potential biomarker of CLMD in treating TLE.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that cyclic aversive stimuli (time-specific footshocks) act as a nonphotic zeitgeber, shifting circadian behaviors to the daytime in nocturnal rodents through entrainment. It has remained untested whether diurnal species exhibit similar plasticity in behavioral timing. This study investigated whether antelope ground squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus, AGS), naturally diurnal rodents, shift activity timing in response to cyclic aversive stimuli delivered at specific phases of the light-dark (LD) cycle. We conducted two experiments with 20 AGS housed in custom cages featuring a safe nesting area and a separate foraging area rendered potentially aversive by unsignaled time-specific footshocks. In Experiment 1, animals were subjected to a 12:12 LD cycle. One group was exposed to a foraging area that produced footshocks during the light phase, and a control group with footshocks during the dark phase. In Experiment 2, under a 16:8 LD cycle, animals were divided into three groups, with footshock exposure either during the first or second half of the light phase or during the dark phase. Following treatments, animals were released into constant darkness (DD) to assess free-running rhythms. Contrary to findings in nocturnal rodents, AGS did not exhibit consistent complementary shifts to nocturnal activity as an avoidance of footshocks received during daytime. Most animals maintained diurnal activity, showing minor, and inconsistent phase adjustments. In Experiment 2, animals exposed to footshocks during part of the light phase also failed to reliably shift activity to the "safe" portion of the light phase. These findings show AGS do not substantially shift activity patterns in response to cyclic aversive stimuli and that a 24-h cyclic fear stimulus fails to override the LD cycle as a zeitgeber. This suggests a lack of plasticity in circadian behavior and highlights the importance of species-specific differences in response to potential nonphotic zeitgebers.

AB  - Astroglial cells are key players in the development and maintenance of neurons and neuronal networks. Astroglia express steroid hormone receptors and show rapid responses to hormonal manipulations. However, despite important sex differences in the cortex and hippocampus, few studies have examined sex differences in astroglial cells in telencephalic development. To characterize the cortical astroglial translatome in male and female mice across postnatal development, we use translating ribosome affinity purification together with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to phenotype astroglia at six developmental time points. Overall, we find two distinct astroglial phenotypes between early (P1-P7) and late development (P14-adult), independent of sex. We also find sex differences in gene expression patterns across development that peak at P7 and appear to result from males reaching a mature astroglial phenotype earlier than females. These developmental sex differences could have an impact on the construction of neuronal networks and windows of vulnerability to perturbations and disease.

AB  - Background: Fibrotic scar is a severe side effect of trabeculectomy, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes for glaucoma surgery. Accumulating evidence showed human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs) play an important role in fibrosis formation. We previously reported that the aqueous level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) was higher in the patients with primary angle closure glaucoma, which was associated with the failure of trabeculectomy. In this study, the potential effect and mechanism of SPARC in promoting fibrosis were explored by using HTFs.
   Methods: HTFs were employed in this study and examined under a phase-contrast microscope. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8. The expressions of SPARC-YAP/TAZ signaling and the fibrosis-related markers were examined with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation was conducted to further determined the variation of YAP and phosphorylated YAP. The differential gene expressions were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq), followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses.
   Results: Exogenous SPARC induced HTFs-myofibroblast transformation, as evidenced by the increased expression of alpha-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin in both protein and mRNA levels. SPARC knockdown decreased the expressions of the above genes in TGF-ss 2-treated HTFs. KEGG analysis showed that the Hippo signaling pathway was mostly enriched. SPARC treatment increased the expressions of YAP, TAZ, CTGF and CYR61 as well as enhanced YAP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, and decreased the phosphorylation of YAP and LAST1/2, which was reversed by SPARC knockdown. Knockdown of YAP1 decreased the fibrosis-related markers, such as alpha-SMA, collagen I and Fibronectin, in SPARC-treated HTFs.
   Conclusions: SPARC induced HTFs-myofibroblast transformation via activating YAP/TAZ signaling. Targeting SPARC-YAP/TAZ axis in HTFs might provide a novel strategy for inhibiting fibrosis formation after trabeculectomy.

AB  - Nasal polyps (NP) are benign mucosal outgrowths associated with chronic inflammation that can significantly reduce quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate changes in inflammation, oxidative stress, and trace element homeostasis in NP patients and to identify potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. A total of 22 patients with NP and 19 healthy individuals were included in the study. Serum levels of trace elements, including zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and selenium (Se), were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Biochemical parameters including white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), eosinophils (EO), hemoglobin (HGB), glucose, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were assessed, along with inflammatory indices such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Data were analyzed using classical statistical methods, including the Shapiro-Wilk test, independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and variable importance in projection (VIP) scoring were performed. In addition, machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression were employed. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret the most influential features of the best-performing model. Compared to controls, NP patients exhibited significantly higher levels of WBC, Cu, glucose, and NLR along with significantly lower levels of Zn, PLR and the Zn/Cu ratio. Specifically, the mean Zn level was 2130.974 +/- 3516.317 mu g/mL in the NP group versus 11,331.127 +/- 27,697.378 mu g/mL in controls (p = 0.018). Cu (AUC = 0.866), glucose (AUC = 0.777), and WBC (AUC = 0.748) showed strong discriminative power. OPLS-DA revealed clear group separation, highlighting Cu, Zn/Cu, glucose, Se, and PLR as high-impact variables. Optimized logistic regression achieved 100% classification accuracy, with SHAP analysis confirming Zn, Zn/Cu, Cu, and glucose as the most influential features. These preliminary findings suggest that inflammation, trace element imbalance, and metabolic alterations can be detected biochemically in NP patients. Parameters such as serum Zn and Cu levels, Zn/Cu ratio, glucose, and inflammatory indices may serve as promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. Further validation in larger and independent cohorts is warranted before clinical implementation.

AB  - Digestion is driven by digestive enzymes and digestive enzyme gene copy number can provide insights on the genomic underpinnings of dietary specialization. The "Adaptive Modulation Hypothesis" (AMH) proposes that digestive enzyme activity, which increases with increased gene copy number, should correlate with substrate quantity in the diet. To test the AMH and reveal some of the genetics of herbivory vs carnivory, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of Anoplarchus purpurescens, a carnivorous prickleback fish in the family Stichaeidae, and compared the gene copy number for key digestive enzymes to that of Cebidichthys violaceus, a herbivorous fish from the same family. A highly contiguous genome assembly of high quality (N50 = 10.6 Mb) was produced for A. purpurescens, using combined long-read and short-read technology, with an estimated 33,842 protein-coding genes. The digestive enzymes that we examined include pancreatic a-amylase, carboxyl ester lipase, alanyl aminopeptidase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Anoplarchus purpurescens had fewer copies of pancreatic a-amylase (carbohydrate digestion) than C. violaceus (1 vs. 3 copies). Moreover, A. purpurescens had one fewer copy of carboxyl ester lipase (plant lipid digestion) than C. violaceus (4 vs. 5). We observed an expansion in copy number for several protein digestion genes in A. purpurescens compared to C. violaceus, including trypsin (5 vs. 3) and total aminopeptidases (6 vs. 5). Collectively, these genomic differences coincide with measured digestive enzyme activities (phenotypes) in the two species and they support the AMH. Moreover, this genomic resource is now available to better understand fish biology and dietary specialization.

AB  - Sugarcane is the most important sugar crop, contributing >= 80% to total sugar production around the world. Spodoptera frugiperda is one of the main pests of sugarcane, potentially causing severe yield and sugar loss. The identification of key defense factors against S. frugiperda herbivory can provide targets for improving sugarcane resistance to insect pests by molecular breeding. In this work, we used one of the main sugarcane pests, S. frugiperda, as the tested insect to attack sugarcane. Integrated transcriptome and metabolomic analyses were performed to explore the changes in gene expression and metabolic processes that occurred in sugarcane leaf after continuous herbivory by S. frugiperda larvae for 72 h. The transcriptome analysis demonstrated that sugarcane pest herbivory enhanced several herbivory-induced responses, including carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolites and amino acid metabolism, plant hormone signaling transduction, pathogen responses, and transcription factors. Further metabolome analysis verified the inducement of specific metabolites of amino acids and secondary metabolites by insect herbivory. Finally, association analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome by the Pearson correlation coefficient method brought into focus the target defense genes against insect herbivory in sugarcane. These genes include amidase and lipoxygenase in amino acid metabolism, peroxidase in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pathogenesis-related protein 1 in plant hormone signal transduction.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a paroxysmal abnormal hypersynchronous electrical discharge characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Stress is the leading cause of neurodegeneration and can produce seizures that may lead to or aggravate epilepsy. Inflammation plays a vital role in epilepsy by modulating oxidative stress, and levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines including NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, and IL-1(3. Methods: Stress-induced changes in behavior were evaluated in mice by employing behavioral assessment tests such as an elevated plus maze, light-dark box, open field test, tail suspension test, Y-maze, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindled mice. Behavioral changes in all these paradigms including seizure score, latency, and frequency showed an increase in symptoms in PTZ (35 mg/kg) induced seizures in stressed mice (RS-PTZ) as compared to PTZ, Stress, and normal animals. Results: The Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results confirmed increased in serum cortisol levels. Histological examinations showed neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and cortex regions. The spectrophotometric evaluation showed an increase in oxidative stress by decreasing antioxidant production i.e. reduced glutathione, glutathione-s- s- transferase, and catalase (CAT), and increasing oxidant levels such as maloaldehyde and nitric oxide. Immunohistochemistry results showed increased expression of NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, and IL-1(3 in the cortex and hippocampus of mice brains. Conclusions: Results from the study conclude that stress increases the likelihood of eliciting an epileptic attack by increasing the level of reactive oxygen species and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Chilling stress threatens the yield and distribution pattern of global crops, including the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), one of the most important cash crops around the world. Circular RNA (circRNA) plays roles in regulating plant growth and biotic/abiotic stress responses. Understanding the evolutionary characteristics of circRNA and its feedbacks to chilling stress in the tea plant will help to elucidate the vital roles of circRNAs. In the current report, we systematically identified 2702 high-confidence circRNAs under chilling stress in the tea plant, and interestingly found that the generation of tea plant circRNAs was associated with the length of their flanking introns. Repetitive sequences annotation and DNA methylation analysis revealed that the longer flanking introns of circRNAs present more repetitive sequences and higher methylation levels, which suggested that repeat-elements-mediated DNA methylation might promote the circRNAs biogenesis in the tea plant. We further detected 250 differentially expressed circRNAs under chilling stress, which were functionally enriched in GO terms related to cold/stress responses. Constructing a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network discovered 139 differentially expressed circRNAs harboring potential miRNA binding sites, which further identified 14 circRNAs that might contribute to tea plant chilling responses. We further characterized a key circRNA, CSS-circFAB1, which was significantly induced under chilling stress. FISH and silencing experiments revealed that CSS-circFAB1 was potentially involved in chilling tolerance of the tea plant. Our study emphasizes the importance of circRNA and its preliminary role against low-temperature stress, providing new insights for tea plant cold tolerance breeding.

AB  - The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases play an important role in plant growth, development, and defense responses to abiotic stresses and pathogens. However, their roles in the resistance of plants to herbivorous insects remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated the rice gene OsJMJ715, which encodes a RING-domain containing protein, and investigated its role in rice resistance to brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens). OsJMJ715 is a nucleus-localized E3 ligase whose mRNA levels were upregulated by the infestation of gravid BPH females, mechanical wounding, and treatment with JA or ABA. Silencing OsJMJ715 enhanced BPH-elicited levels of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile as well as the amount of callose deposition in plants, which in turn increased the resistance of rice to BPH by reducing the feeding of BPH and the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsJMJ715 negative regulates the BPH-induced biosynthesis of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile and that BPH benefits by enhancing the expression of OsJMJ715.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, particularly those of subfamily B, are involved in cell detoxification, multidrug resistance, drug treatment pharmacodynamics, and also ecological adaptation. In this regard, ABCB transporters may play a decisive role in the co-evolution between plants and herbivores. Cardenolides, toxic steroid glycosides, are secondary plant metabolites that defend plants against herbivores by targeting their sodium-potassium ATPase. Despite their toxicity, several herbivorous insects such as the large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus) have evolved adaptations to tolerate cardenolides and sequester them for their own defense. We investigate the role of two ABCB transporters of O. fasciatus for the paracellular transport of cardenolides by docking simulations and ATPase assays. Cardenolide binding of OfABCB1 and OfABCB2 is predicted by docking simulations and calculated binding energies are compared with substrate specificities determined in ATPase assays. Both tested ABCB transporters showed activity upon exposure to cardenolides and Km values that agreed well with the predictions of our docking simulations. We conclude that docking simulations can help identify transporter binding regions and predict substrate specificity, as well as provide deeper insights into the structural basis of ABC transporter function.

AB  - Chemical elicitors can increase plant defense against herbivorous insects and pathogens. The use of synthetic chemical elicitors is likely to be an alternative to traditional pesticides for crop pest control. However, only a few synthetic chemicals are reported to protect plants by regulating signaling pathways, increasing the levels of defense metabolites and interfering with insect feeding. Here, we found that the exogenous application of a phenoxycarboxylic compound, 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA), can induce chemical defenses to protect rice plants from white-backed planthoppers (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera). Four-CPA was rapidly taken up by plant roots and degraded to 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Four-CPA treatment modulated the activity of peroxidase (POD) and directly induced the deposition of lignin-like polymers using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the electron acceptor. The polymers, which are thought to prevent the planthopper's stylet from reaching the phloem, were broken down by WBPH nymphs. Meanwhile, 4-CPA increased the levels of flavonoids and phenolamines (PAs). The increased flavonoids and PAs, together with the degradation product of the polymers, avoided nymphal feeding and prolonged the nymphal period for 1 day. These results indicate that 4-CPA has the potential to be used as a chemical elicitor to protect rice from planthoppers. Moreover, these findings also open a pathway for molecule structure design of phenoxycarboxylic compounds as chemical elicitors.

AB  - Ferritin possesses an immune function to defend against pathogen infection. To elucidate the immunity-protecting roles of ferritin from Ctenopharyngodon idellus (Ciferritin) against virus infection, the cDNA and promoter sequences of Ciferritin were determined, and the correlations between Ciferrtin expressions and promoter methylation levels were analyzed. In addition, the functional role of Ciferrtin on GCRV (grass carp reovirus) infection was assessed. The full-length cDNA of Ciferritin is 1053 bp, consists of a 531 bp open-reading frame, and encodes 176 amino acids. Ciferritin showed the highest sequence identity with the ferritin middle subunit of Mylopharyngodon piceus (93.56%), followed by the subunits of Megalobrama amblycephala and Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous. Ciferritin contains a conserved ferritin domain (interval: 10-94 aa), and the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and Rubrerythrin domain were also predicted. In the spleen and kidney, significantly higher Ciferritin expressions were observed at 6, 12, 24, or 168 h post GCRV infection than those in the PBS injection group (p < 0.05). The Ciferrtin expression level in the progeny of maternal-immunized grass carp was significantly higher than that in the progeny of common grass carp (p < 0.05). Ciferritin promoter methylation level in the progeny from common grass carp was 1.27 +/- 0.15, and in the progeny of the maternal-immunized group was 1.00 +/- 0.14. In addition, methylation levels of "CpG9" and "CpG10" loci were significantly lower in the progeny of maternal-immunized fish than those in the common group. Except for the "CpG5", methylation levels of all other detected "CpG" loci negatively correlated with Ciferritin expression levels. Furthermore, the total methylation level of "CpG1-10" negatively correlated with the Ciferritin expressions. The Ciferritin expression level was significantly up-regulated, and the VP7 protein levels were significantly reduced, at 24 h post GCRV infection in the Ciferritin over-expression cells (p < 0.05). The results from the present study provide sequence, epigenetic modification and expression, and anti-GCRV functional information of Ciferritin, which provide a basis for achieving resistance to GCRV in grass carp breeding.

AB  - Spider venom contains various peptides and proteins, which can be used for pharmacological applications. Finding novel therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases with the use of purified peptides and proteins, extracted from spiders can be greatly precious. Neurodegenerative diseases are rapidly developing and expanding all over the world. Excitotoxicity is a frequent condition amongst neuro-degenerative disorders. This harmful process is usually induced through hyper-activation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The omega-agatoxin-Aa4b is a selective and strong VGCCblocker. This study aimed to investigate the effects of this blocker on the NMDA-induced memory and learning defect in rats. For this purpose, nineteen spiders of the funnel-weaver Agelena orientalis species were collected. The extracted venom was lyophilized andpurified through gel-filtration chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis techniques. Subsequently, mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) was used for identification of this bio-active small protein. Afterward, the effect of the omega-agatoxin-Aa4b (2 & mu;g, intra-cornu ammonis-3 of the hippocampus) on the NMDA-induced learning and memory deficits in rats was evaluated. Learning and memory performances were evaluated by the use of passive avoidance test. For synaptic quantification and memory function the amount of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN ICYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN I (CaCdPKCYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN ICYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN I) gene expression was measured using the Real-time PCR technique. To compare the experimental groups, hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining of hippocampus tissues was performed. Our results rendered that the omega-Agatoxin-Aa4b treatment can ameliorate and reverse the learning and memory impairment caused by NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in rat hippocampus.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a complex neurological disease, and its occurrence and development are closely related to the autophagy signaling pathway. However, the mechanism by which electroacupuncture (EA) affects the regulation of autophagy has not been fully elucidated. TLE gene chip dataset GSE27166 and data from rats without epilepsy (n = 6) and rats with epilepsy (n = 6) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the TLE and control groups were identified with the online tool GEO2R. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to analyse the functional and pathway enrichment of genes in the most important modules. A rat model of TLE induced by lithium-pilocarpine treatment was established. EA treatment at DU20 and DU14 in TLE rats was performed for 2 weeks. Neuronal regeneration was determined using immunofluorescence staining. The protein levels of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy markers were detected through western blotting and immunohistochemistry. This study identified 1837 DEGs, including 798 upregulated genes and 1039 downregulated genes. GO enrichment and KEGG analyses were performed on DEGs and revealed functional enrichment mainly in the mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy-animal. Furthermore, the number of mature neurons was significantly increased upon coexpressing BrdU/NeuN in TLE rats treated with EA. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry results showed significantly decreased levels of the phosphorylated-AKT and p-mTOR in the hippocampal CA3 and DG regions of TLE rats with EA treatment. And increased p-ULK1/ULK1, LC3-II/LC3-I and p62 levels in TLE rats with EA stimulation. Therefore, this study suggested that EA promoted autophagy in hippocampal neurons during the onset of epilepsy by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to treat epilepsy.

AB  - Opioid addiction is a complicated and highly heritable brain disease. Dysfunction in dopaminergic signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of addictive disorders. Encoding a dopamine synthetase, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene has long been an interesting candidate in genetic association studies for opioid addiction. However, the mechanisms underlying associations of risk gene variants and opioid addiction remain unknown. In the present study, we first analyzed the association between TH gene variants and susceptibility and traits of heroin addiction in 801 patients with heroin addiction and 930 healthy controls. Methylation levels in the promoter region of the TH gene were detected and compared between the heroin addiction and healthy control groups. To reveal the potential mechanism of the association of TH gene variants and heroin addiction, correlations between the risk TH single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) for heroin addiction and the methylation and expression levels of the TH gene were examined. Our results demonstrated that SNP rs6356 was associated with susceptibility to heroin addiction. CpG TH_15 was hypermethylated in the heroin addiction group compared with the healthy control group. Notably, SNP rs6356 was correlated in an allele-specific manner with expression of the TH gene in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens but not with methylation levels of CpG TH_15. Our findings suggest that the eQTL rs6356 was associated with susceptibility to heroin addiction by potentially affecting the expression of the TH gene in brain regions in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, including the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens.

AB  - A new species of the genus Belebey (Bolosauridae), Be. shumovi sp. nov., is described from the Upper Kazanian Substage (Guadalupian) of European Russia based on elements of the upper jaw, a maxilla and two premaxillae. This is the largest known bolosaurid, the skull length of which could be estimated to be around 160 mm. In addition to its overall size, Be. shumovi differs from other species of the genus in the shape of the maxilla, maxillary teeth, and their distribution along the tooth row. The holotype of Be. shumovi (maxilla) exhibits marginal dentition at the earliest stage of the tooth replacement process. Computed tomography (CT) scan data indicate the presence of almost completely formed replacement teeth along the entire tooth row, confirming the hypothesis of a single-wave cycle of tooth replacement in bolosaurids. Based on the material studied, the tertiary dentine formation was discovered for the first time among fossil reptiles. The tertiary dentine is one of the most evident adaptations of bolosaurids to high-fibre herbivory and demonstrates uniformity of the protection mechanism of the pulp in tetrapod history throughout most of the Phanerozoic.

AB  - Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment that can change the course of allergic diseases. However, there has not been any research on metabolic reactions in relation to AIT with single or mixed allergens. In this study, patients with allergic rhinitis caused by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) and Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) were treated with single-mite (Der p) and double-mite (Der p:Der f = 1:1) subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), respectively. To compare the efficacy and the dynamic changes of inflammation-related single- and double-species mite subcutaneous immunotherapy (SM-SCIT and DM-SCIT), we performed visual analogue scale (VAS) score, rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) score and serum metabolomics in allergic rhinitis patients during SCIT. VAS and RQLQ score showed no significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments. A total of 57 metabolites were identified, among which downstream metabolites (5(S)-HETE (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), 8(S)-HETE, 11(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE and 11-hydro TXB2) in the omega-6-related arachidonic acid and linoleic acid pathway showed significant differences after approximately one year of treatment in SM-SCIT or DM-SCIT, and the changes of the above serum metabolic components were correlated with the magnitude of RQLQ improvement, respectively. Notably, 11(S)-HETE decreased more with SM-SCIT, and thus it could be used as a potential biomarker to distinguish the two treatment schemes. Both SM-SCIT and DM-SCIT have therapeutic effects on patients with allergic rhinitis, but there is no significant difference in efficacy between them. The reduction of inflammation-related metabolites proved the therapeutic effect, and potential biomarkers (arachidonic acid and its downstream metabolites) may distinguish the options of SCIT.

AB  - Research Questions: Does Progesterone primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol influence the microRNA expression profiles of granulosa cells of follicular fluid in infertile patients? Will adding progestins in the follicular phase affect follicular microenvironment?
   Design: This was a prospective study with granulosa cells collected from patients who received PPOS protocol (n = 15) and who received gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRH) antagonist protocol (n = 15). MicroRNA sequencing was set to find differently expressed microRNAs. The most significant statistically differential expressed miRNAs are chosen to be validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following by target genes prediction and enrichment analysis.
   Results: The microRNA sequencing found 24 up-regulated miRNAs and 37 down-regulated miRNA among which 10 microRNAs (miR-4697-5p, miR-6788-5p, miR-6869-5p, miR-4644, miR-199a-5p, miR-6801-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-4261, miR-199a-3p, miR-150-5p) can be detected in all sequencing samples and rank top enrichment scores in all microRNAs. The PCR validation showed that the down-regulation of miR-4261 and up-regulation of miR6869-5p were consistent with the sequencing results. Putative genes were identified to be confidently predictive. The enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched gene ontology terms involves cell proliferation and apoptosis and the most enriched pathway included Hippo signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. Conclusions: PPOS protocol could up-regulate the expression of miR-6869-5p and down-regulate the expression of miR-4261 in granulosa cells of follicular fluid in infertile patients which involves a lot of cellular and molecular mechanisms requiring follow-up studies.

AB  - CA1 and subiculum (SUB) connect the hippocampus to numerous output regions, Cells in both areas have place-specific firing fields, although they are more dispersed in SUB, Weak responses to head direction and running speed have been reported in both regions. However, how such information is encoded in CA1 and SUB and the resulting impact on downstream targets are poorly understood. Here, we estimate the tuning of simultaneously recorded CA1 and SUB cells to position, head direction, and speed. Individual neurons respond conjunctively to these covariates in both regions, but the degree of mixed representation is stronger in SUB, and more so during goal-directed spatial navigation than free foraging. Each navigational variable could be decoded with higher precision, from a similar number of neurons, in SUB than CA1. The findings point to a possible contribution of mixed-selective coding in SUB to efficient transmission of hippocampal representations to widespread brain regions.

AB  - Elderly patients are prone to cognitive impairment and memory loss after surgical operations. This perioperative cerebral damage, named postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), is profoundly affected by anesthesia. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is a widely-studied epigenetic modification to regulate gene expression; however, it has never been studied in POCD. In the present study, elderly POCD mouse models were constructed using sevoflurane, and we observed a compromised global m6A RNA methylation in the mice's hippocampuses compared with the control. Our RIP-Seq data suggested that 1244 genes (SOX2, SYN1, and BDNF) showed m6A RNA methylation in their 5'UTRs, which was significantly lower than that in the control; while only 56 genes (BACE1 and IL17A) showed m6A RNA methylation in their 5'UTRs, which was significantly higher than that in the control. Unexpectedly, m6A RNA methylation with significant differences in exons, introns, or 3'UTRs was observed in only few genes. Although we failed to find any differences in the expression of m6A-associated proteins, such as m6A "writers", "erasers", and "readers", between the sevoflurane treatment and control groups, RIP-qPCR assays indicated that the binding affinity of METTL3 on mRNA 5'UTRs was particularly weakened in target genes by sevoflurane. Finally, we found that phosphorylation of METTL3 could be reduced by sevoflurane because of the inactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Overall, our study determined that the inactivation of METTL3 in the mouse hippocampus, induced by sevoflurane-mediated MAPK/ERK suppression in vivo, resulted in a perturbation in m6A RNA methylation signals in the pathogenesis of POCD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) is widely used to predict AD using a deep learning model. However, the effects of noise and blurring on 18 F-FDG PET images were not considered. The performance of a classification model trained using raw, deblurred (by the fast total variation deblurring method), or denoised (by the median modified Wiener filter) F-18-FDG PET images without or with cropping around the limbic system area using a 3D deep convolutional neural network was investigated. The classification model trained using denoised whole-brain F-18-FDG PET images achieved classification performance (0.75/0.65/0.79/0.39 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively) higher than that with raw and deblurred F-18-FDG PET images. The classification model trained using cropped raw F-18-FDG PET images achieved higher performance (0.78/0.63/0.81/0.40 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC) than the whole-brain F-18-FDG PET images (0.72/0.32/0.71/0.10 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC, respectively). The F-18-FDG PET image deblurring and cropping (0.89/0.67/0.88/0.57 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC) procedures were the most helpful for improving performance. For this model, the right middle frontal, middle temporal, insula, and hippocampus areas were the most predictive of AD using the class activation map. Our findings demonstrate that F-18-FDG PET image preprocessing and cropping improves the explainability and potential clinical applicability of deep learning models.

AB  - Plants produce linalool to respond to biotic stress, but the linalool-induced early signal remains unclear. In wild-type Arabidopsis, plant resistance to diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) increased more strongly in a linalool-treated group than in an untreated control group. H2O2 and Ca2+, two important early signals that participated in biotic stress, burst after being treated with linalool in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells. Linalool treatment increased H2O2 and intracellular calcium concentrations in mesophyll cells, observed using a confocal microscope with laser scanning, and H2O2 signaling functions upstream of Ca2+ signaling by using inhibitors and mutants. Ca2+ efflux was detected using non-invasive micro-test technology (NMT), and Ca2+ efflux was also inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI (diphenyleneiodonium chloride) and in cells of the NADPH oxidase mutant rbohd. To restore intracellular calcium levels, Ca2+-ATPase was activated, and calmodulin 3 (CAM3) participated in Ca2+-ATPase activation. This result is consistent with the interaction between CAM7 and Ca2+-ATPase isoform 8 (ACA8). In addition, a yeast two-hybrid assay, firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay, and an in vitro pulldown assay showed that CAM3 interacts with the N-terminus of ACA8, and qRT-PCR showed that some JA-related genes and defense genes expressions were enhanced when treated with linalool in Arabidopsis leaves. This study reveals that linalool enhances H2O2 and intracellular calcium concentrations in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells; CAM3-ACA8 reduces intracellular calcium concentrations, allowing cells to resume their resting state. Additionally, JA-related genes and defense genes' expression may enhance plants' defense when treated with linalool.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neuroinflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, we reported that exposure to pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin causes hippocampal ER stress apoptosis, a reduction in neurogenesis, and learning deficits in adult male mice. Recently, we found that deltamethrin exposure also increases the markers of neuroinflammation in BV2 cells. Here, we investigated the potential mechanistic link between ER stress and neuroinflammation following exposure to deltamethrin. We found that repeated oral exposure to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg) for 30 days caused microglial activation and increased gene expressions and protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, gp91(phox), 4HNE, and iNOS in the hippocampus. These changes were preceded by the induction of ER stress as the protein levels of CHOP, ATF-4, and GRP78 were significantly increased in the hippocampus. To determine whether induction of ER stress triggers the inflammatory response, we performed an additional experiment with mouse microglial cell (MMC) line. MMCs were treated with 0-5 mu M deltamethrin for 24-48 h in the presence or absence of salubrinal, a pharmacological inhibitor of the ER stress factor eIF2 alpha. We found that salubrinal (50 mu M) prevented deltamethrin-induced ER stress, as indicated by decreased levels of CHOP and ATF-4, and attenuated the levels of GSH, 4-HNE, gp91(phox), iNOS, ROS, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in MMCs. Together, these results demonstrate that exposure to deltamethrin leads to ER stress-mediated neuroinflammation, which may subsequently contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in mice.

AB  - This paper reports a mammalian fauna collected from the excavation of Baolai cave, southeast of Bubing Basin, in 2004. The fauna mainly consists of extant species and only a few typical members of 'Ailuropoda-Stegodon fauna' (Stegodon, Ailuropoda and Rhinoceros). According to results of the U-series dating from flowstones overlying and below the fossil beds (54-24 Ka), the Baolai fauna represents the mammalian assemblage in the Late Pleistocene. Compared with the faunas of Middle and Late Pleistocene in southern China and Southeast Asia, extant species dominate the Baolai fauna, mostly consistent with modern fauna of southern China during the Holocene. Modern fauna emerged later in southern China than in Southeast Asia, presenting successive characteristics. Significant bias for small or tiny fossils in Baolai cave reveals a special taphonomic process. Baolai cave is located at the same horizontal level as Upper Wuyun cave and Ganxian cave which yield Middle Pleistocene deposits with mammalian fossils. However, the Baolai fauna is much younger. Based on the gnawing marks on tooth roots, rodents may be the main taphonomic agent, or the fossils were brought in by flow-water through the karstic system above.

AB  - The modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) activity has been reported to be implicated in the pathology of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Previous studies have demonstrated that Nrf2 is activated in the post-status epilepticus rat model; however, the spatiotemporal as well as cell type-specific expression of Nrf2 following brief epileptic seizures remains unclear. Here, we evaluated how an acute epileptic seizure affected the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes in the rats' cortex and the hippocampus up to 1 week following the induced seizure. We found that after a pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure, Nrf2 significantly increased at 24 h at the mRNA level and 3 h at the protein level in the cortex. In the hippocampus, the Nrf2 mRNA level peaked at 3 h after the seizure, and no significant changes were observed in the protein level. Interestingly, the mRNA level of Nrf2 downstream genes peaked at 3-6 h after seizure in both the cortex and the hippocampus. A significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 was observed in the neuronal population of CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, as well as in the cortex. Moreover, we observed no change in the co-localization of Nrf2 with astrocytes neither in the cortex nor in CA1 and CA3. Our results revealed that following a brief acute epileptic seizure, the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes is transiently increased and peaked at early timepoints after the seizure predominantly in the hippocampus, and this expression is restricted to the neuronal population.

AB  - Background: Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) underlines much of the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the existence of an endogenous neurogenic system that could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy has been controversial. BNN-20 is a synthetic, BDNF-mimicking, microneurotrophin that we previously showed to exhibit a pleiotropic neuroprotective effect on the dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc in the "weaver" mouse model of PD. Here, we assessed its potential effects on neurogenesis.
   Methods: We quantified total numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc of wild-type and "weaver" mice, with or without administration of BNN-20, and we employed BrdU labelling and intracerebroventricular injections of DiI to evaluate the existence of dopaminergic neurogenesis in the SNpc and to assess the origin of newborn dopaminergic neurons. The in vivo experiments were complemented by in vitro proliferation/differentiation assays of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the substantia nigra and the subependymal zone (SEZ) stem cell niche to further characterize the effects of BNN-20.
   Results: Our analysis revealed the existence of a low-rate turnover of dopaminergic neurons in the normal SNpc and showed, using three independent lines of experiments (stereologic cell counts, BrdU and DiI tracing), that the administration of BNN-20 leads to increased neurogenesis in the SNpc and to partial reversal of dopaminergic cell loss. The newly born dopaminergic neurons, that are partially originated from the SEZ, follow the typical nigral maturation pathway, expressing the transcription factor FoxA2. Importantly, the pro-cytogenic effects of BNN-20 were very strong in the SNpc, but were absent in other brain areas such as the cortex or the stem cell niche of the hippocampus. Moreover, although the in vitro assays showed that BNN-20 enhances the differentiation of NSCs towards glia and neurons, its in vivo administration stimulated only neurogenesis.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the existence of a neurogenic system in the SNpc that can be manipulated in order to regenerate the depleted dopaminergic cell population in the "weaver" PD mouse model. Microneurotrophin BNN-20 emerges as an excellent candidate for future PD cell replacement therapies, due to its area-specific, pro-neurogenic effects.

AB  - Laccase (LAC) plays important roles in different plant development and defense processes. In this study, we identified laccase genes (CsLACs) in Camellia sinensis cv 'Longjing43 & PRIME; cultivars, which were classified into six subclades. The expression patterns of CsLACs displayed significant spatiotemporal variations across different tissues and developmental stages. Most members in subclades II, IV and subclade I exhibited contrasting expression patterns during leaf development, consistent with a trade-off model for preferential expression in the early and late developmental stages. The extensive transcriptional changes of CsLACs under different phytohormone and herbivore treatment were observed and compared, with the expression of most genes in subclades I, II and III being downregulated but genes in subclades IV, V and VI being upregulated, suggesting a growth and defense trade-off model between these subclades. Taken together, our research reveal that CsLACs mediate multi-perspective trade-offs during tea plant development and defense processes and are involved in herbivore resistance in tea plants. More in-depth research of CsLACs upstream regulation and downstream targets mediating herbivore defense should be conducted in the future.

AB  - The chemical profiles of both Zygophyllum album (Z. album) aerial parts and roots extracts were evaluated with LC-ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Twenty-four compounds were detected. Among them, some are detected in both the aerial parts and the roots extracts, and others were detected in the aerial parts only. The detected compounds were mainly flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenes and other miscellaneous compounds. Such compounds contribute to the diverse pharmacological activities elicited by the Z. album species. This study aimed to elucidate the antiepileptic effect of Z. album aerial parts and roots crude extracts against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in mice. Male albino mice were divided into four groups, eight animals each. All groups, except the control group, were kindled with PTZ (35 mg/kg i.p.), once every alternate day for a total of 15 injections. One group was left untreated (PTZ group). The remaining two groups were treated prior to PTZ injection with either Z. album aerial parts or roots crude extract (400 mg/kg, orally). Pretreatment with either extract significantly reduced the seizure scores, partially reversed the histological changes in the cerebral cortex and exerted antioxidant/anti-inflammatory efficacy evinced by elevated hippocampal total antioxidant capacity and SOD and catalase activities, parallel to the decrement in MDA content, iNOS activity and the TXNIB/NLRP3 axis with a subsequent decrease in caspase 1 activation and a release of IL-1 beta and IL-18. Moreover, both Z. album extracts suppressed neuronal apoptosis via upregulating Bcl-2 expression and downregulating that of Bax, indicating their neuroprotective and antiepileptic potential. Importantly, the aerial parts extract elicited much more antiepileptic potential than the roots extract did.

AB  - El Cerro de los Batallones is one of the most important fossil sites of the Miocene. The quantity and preservation of its fossil remains have allowed us to describe many new mammal species. One of these is Hispanomys moralesi, a derived species of the Tribe Cricetodontini, a wide group of rodents with great importance in the faunal assemblage during the Miocene. Unlike most fossil micromammals in this fossil site, we have obtained skull remains that preserve never recorded anatomical structures in this time interval. Due to the fragility of the material, it could only be studied in detail using X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu-CT Scan). With this technique, we obtained three-dimensional models of 12 skulls of Hispanomys moralesi, in which different osteological parts have been described. In this way, we compared the morphological variation of the skull with other fossil cricetids and concluded that Batallones' species is an opisthodont rodent, with a relatively elongated rostrum, a robust base of zygomatic arches and big-sized tooth rows. Opisthodont incisor characterises omnivore and herbivore diets in rodents. Therefore, these new findings of Hispanomys moralesi could allow us to describe the dietary affinities of this extinct species.

AB  - Febrile seizures during early childhood may result in central nervous system developmental disorders. However, the specific mechanisms behind the impact of febrile seizures on the developing brain are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we employed a hyperthermic model of febrile seizures in 10-day-old rats and tracked their development over two months. Our objective was to determine the degree to which the properties of the hippocampal glutamatergic system are modified. We analyzed whether pyramidal glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus die after febrile seizures. Our findings indicate that there is a reduction in the number of neurons in various regions of the hippocampus in the first two days after seizures. The CA1 field showed the greatest susceptibility, and the reduction in the number of neurons in post-FS rats in this area appeared to be long-lasting. Electrophysiological studies indicate that febrile seizures cause a reduction in glutamatergic transmission, leading to decreased local field potential amplitude. This impairment could be attributable to diminished glutamate release probability as evidenced by decreases in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and increases in the paired-pulse ratio of synaptic responses. We also found higher threshold current causing hind limb extension in the maximal electroshock seizure threshold test of rats 2 months after febrile seizures compared to the control animals. Our research suggests that febrile seizures can impair glutamatergic transmission, which may protect against future seizures.

AB  - Hydroxyindoles are organic compounds characterized by a hydroxyl group attached to an indole ring. One notable example is 5-hydroxyindole, which can be found in humans, plants, and microorganisms. The structure of 5-hydroxyindole is integral to molecules such as melanin, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite). Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death driven by uncontrolled phospholipid peroxidation, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The impact of hydroxyindoles on ferroptosis remains largely unexplored. This study tests the hypothesis that different hydroxyindoles can modulate ferroptosis in neuronal cultures through specific structure-activity relationships. We used various pathway-specific inducers, including erastin, RSL3, and FINO2, to induce ferroptosis. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using calcein AM, MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide), and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release assays. Glutathione levels were measured with the monochlorobimane assay, and intracellular ATP (adenosine triphosphate) levels were quantified using the ATP-Glo (TM) Bioluminometric cell viability assay. We also performed the ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) assay to evaluate the radical-trapping antioxidant activity of the compounds. Our findings indicate that hydroxyindoles function as a class of ferroptosis inhibitors in cell cultures. Among the hydroxyindole analogs studied, 3-hydroxyindole emerged as the most potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in both HT-22 (mouse hippocampal neurons) and N27 (rat dopaminergic neurons) cell lines. In contrast, 5-hydroxyindole and its specific analogs, such as serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were found to be less effective in inhibiting ferroptosis in HT-22 cells. Further investigations into the underlying mechanisms revealed that hydroxyindoles inhibit ferroptosis through their intrinsic radical-trapping antioxidant activity. In conclusion, several hydroxyindole analogs, including 3-hydroxyindole, 6-hydroxyindole, and 7-hydroxyindole, have been identified as inhibitors of ferroptosis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for conditions involving neuronal loss caused by ferroptosis.

AB  - Crops experience herbivory by arthropods and microbial infections. In the interaction between plants and chewing herbivores, lepidopteran larval oral secretions (OS) and plant-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) trigger plant defense responses. However, the mechanisms underlying anti-herbivore defense, especially in monocots, have not been elucidated. The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) of Oryza sativa L. (rice) mediates cytoplasmic defense signaling in response to microbial pathogens and enhances disease resistance when overexpressed. Here, we investigated whether BSR1 contributes to anti-herbivore defense responses. BSR1 knockout suppressed rice responses triggered by OS from the chewing herbivore Mythimna loreyi Duponchel (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and peptidic DAMPs OsPeps, including the activation of genes required for biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs). BSR1-overexpressing rice plants exhibited hyperactivation of DP accumulation and ethylene signaling after treatment with simulated herbivory and acquired enhanced resistance to larval feeding. As the biological significance of herbivory-induced accumulation of rice DPs remains unexplained, their physiological activities in M. loreyi were analyzed. The addition of momilactone B, a rice DP, to the artificial diet suppressed the growth of M. loreyi larvae. Altogether, this study revealed that BSR1 and herbivory-induced rice DPs are involved in the defense against chewing insects, in addition to pathogens.

AB  - The present study was conducted to study the hematological indices of Marecha dromedary camel at Camel Breeding and Research Station (CBRS) Rakh Mahni in semi-intensive management system (SIMS). About 40 animals were used in two groups viz: 1st group (G1) of twenty calves (10 male and 10 female) and 2nd group (G2) of twenty adult animals (5 male and 15 female). The animals were kept in semi-open pens throughout the trial and fed with concentrate, gram straw and available jungle grazing/browsing. Twice a day watering was provided. The animals were dewormed and vaccinated regularly after 3 months according to farm routine practices. Hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC) counts, white blood cells (WBC) counts, granulocyte, lymphocytes, packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were determined. The Hb concentrations were found to be 14.15 +/- 0.12, 13.94 +/- 0.12 and 14.84 +/- 0.18, 14.07 +/- 0.10 g/dl for males and females of G1 and G2 respectively. The values of all parameters differed significantly among groups. There was sexual dimorphism for hematological values in all the parameters being higher in males. It was concluded that the achieved results could be used as a primary data baseline for future studies of this field.

AB  - The current study aimed to determine how palm date aqueous fruit extracts (AFE) affected the autistic-like behaviors brought on by valproic acid (VPA) injection, as well as any potential contributions from Sirt-1, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy. The pregnant Sprague Dawley females were treated with VPA at 12.5th gestation day and pregnant females and their offspring were treated with AFE orally at doses of 4 mg/Kg by gastric gavage for 45 days after birth. The elevated plus-T maze, water maze, and rotarod tests were used to examine autism-like behaviors. At the end of the study, the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase (HO-1), Sirt-1, caspase-3 (a marker of apoptosis), LC3 (a marker of autophagy), and NF kappa B (inflammatory cytokines) were evaluated along with the oxidative stress in brain tissues and the histological changes in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The neurobehavioral assessments significantly declined due to VPA, which also significantly increased oxidative stress in the brain tissues and significantly decreased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Additionally, VPA administration caused significant increase in the expression of caspase-3 in the cerebellar cortex, not in the hippocampus; LC3 and NF kappa B in the hippocampus, not in the cerebellar cortex; and significant reduction in the expression of Sirt-1 in the hippocampus, not in the cerebellum. On the other hand, AFE treatment significantly improved the neurobehavioral changes as well as it improved significantly the oxidative stress and the expression of LC3, NF kappa B, NrF2, HO-1, and Sirt-1 in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Conclusions: AFE administration might improve the autistic-like symptoms induced by VPA in rats via attenuation of the oxidative stress, upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1, Sirt-1 and LC3 expression with downregulation of caspase-3, and NF kappa B expression in the cerebellum and hippocampus.

AB  - Mastitis is a common disease in the dairy industry that causes huge economic losses worldwide. Exosomes (carrying proteins, miRNA, lncRNA, etc.) play a vital role in the regulation of immune response. lncRNA can play a variety of regulatory roles by combining with protein, RNA, and DNA. The expression of mRNA and lncRNA in exosomes derived from bovine mammary epithelial cells infected by S. aureus is rarely understood. To explore this issue, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on exosomes derived from S. aureus-infected and noninfected MAC-T cells. Analysis of the sequencing results showed that there were 186 differentially expressed genes, 431 differentially expressed mRNAs and 19 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the exosomes derived from S. aureus-infected and noninfected MAC-T cells. By predicting lncRNA target genes, it was found that 19 differentially expressed lncRNAs all acted on multiple mRNAs in cis and trans. GO analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes and lncRNA target genes played significant roles in such metabolism (reactive oxygen species metabolic processes), transmembrane transport, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and response to cytokines. KEGG enrichment indicated that lncRNA target genes gathered in the TNF pathway, Notch pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B pathway, Hippo pathway, p53 pathway, reactive oxygen species metabolic processes, and longevity regulating pathway. In summary, all data indicated that differentially expressed gene, mRNA, and lncRNA in transcriptional profiling of exosomes participated in bacterial invasion and adhesion, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis-related signaling pathway. The data obtained in this study would provide valuable resource for understanding the lncRNA information in exosomes derived from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells and conduced to the study of S. aureus infection in dairy cow mammary glands.

AB  - Both UV and blue light have been reported to regulate the biosynthesis of flavonoids in tea plants; however, the respective contributions of the corresponding regions of sunlight are unclear. Additionally, different tea cultivars may respond differently to altered light conditions. We investigated the responses of different cultivars ('Longjing 43', 'Zhongming 192', 'Wanghai 1', 'Jingning 1' and 'Zhonghuang 2') to the shade treatments (black and colored nets) regarding the biosynthesis of flavonoids. For all cultivars, flavonol glycosides showed higher sensitivity to light conditions compared with catechins. The levels of total flavonol glycosides in the young shoots of different tea cultivars decreased with the shade percentages of polyethylene nets increasing from 70% to 95%. Myricetin glycosides and quercetin glycosides were more sensitive to light conditions than kaempferol glycosides. The principal component analysis (PCA) result indicated that shade treatment greatly impacted the profiles of flavonoids in different tea samples based on the cultivar characteristics. UV is the crucial region of sunlight enhancing flavonol glycoside biosynthesis in tea shoots, which is also slight impacted by light quality according to the results of the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). This study clarified the contributions of different wavelength regions of sunlight in a field experiment, providing a potential direction for slightly bitter and astringent tea cultivar breeding and instructive guidance for practical field production of premium teas based on light regimes.

AB  - Neuron generation persists throughout life in the hippocampus but is altered in animal models of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, suggesting that disease-associated decline in cognitive and emotional hippocampal-dependent behaviours might be functionally linked with dysregulation of postnatal neurogenesis. Depletion of the adult neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPCs) pool and neurogenic decline have been recently described in mice expressing synaptic susceptibility genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASDs). To gain further insight into mechanisms regulating neurogenesis in mice carrying mutations in synaptic genes related to monogenic ASDs, we used the R451C Neuroligin3 knock-in (Nlgn3 KI) mouse, which is characterized by structural brain abnormalities, deficits in synaptic functions and reduced sociability. We show that the number of adult-born neurons, but not the size of the NSPC pool, was reduced in the ventral dentate gyrus in knock-in mice. Notably, this neurogenic decline was rescued by daily injecting mice with 10 mg/Kg of the antidepressant fluoxetine for 20 consecutive days. Sustained treatment also improved KI mice's sociability and increased the number of c-Fos active adult-born neurons, compared with vehicle-injected KI mice. Our study uncovers neurogenesis-mediated alterations in the brain of R451C KI mouse, showing that the R451C Nlgn3 mutation leads to lasting, albeit pharmacologically reversible, changes in the brain, affecting neuron formation in the adult hippocampus. Our results suggest that fluoxetine can ameliorate social behaviour in KI mice, at least in part, by rescuing adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which may be relevant for the pharmacological treatment of ASDs.

AB  - Willin/FRMD6 has been reported as a potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene in a series of genome-wide association and neuroimaging studies; however, the mechanisms underlying its potential role in AD pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate the direct effects of A beta on Willin/FRMD6 expression and position mitochondrial oxidative stress as a novel potential mechanism underlying the role of Willin/FRMD6 in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, using mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells and primary mouse neurons, we show that A beta induces downregulation of Willin/FRMD6 protein expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Willin/FRMD6 knockdown leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation, as well as upregulation of ERK1/2 signaling, both of which are reported to be key early features of AD pathogenesis. Importantly, increasing Willin/FRMD6 expression was able to rescue A beta-induced abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology, function, and energetics. Thus, enhancing Willin/FRMD6 expression holds potential as a therapeutic strategy for protecting against A beta-induced mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - Rat hippocampal neurons were isolated and divided into Normal, oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), OGD/R + DEX, OGD/R + NC mimic, OGD/R + miR-155 mimic and OGD/R + DEX + miR-155 mimic groups. In OGD/R group, LDH, ROS and MDA levels and apoptosis rate was increased, with up-regulations of miR-155, Cyt c and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, but decreases of SOD, GSH-Px and MMP levels, as well as down-regulations of p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2. As compared to the OGD/R group, parameters above in the OGD/R + DEX group were ameliorated evidently, while OGD/R + miR-155 mimic group manifested the opposite changes. Besides, miR-155 mimic could abolish the protective effect of DEX on the hippocampal neurons under OGD/R. DEX, via downregulating the expression of miR-155, could activate the ERK1/2 pathway, thereby mitigating the apoptosis and oxidative stress injury and increasing the MMP, thereby protecting hippocampal cells from OGD/R injury.

AB  - Salvia hispanica (chia) is a highly nutritious food source and has gained popularity due to its high omega-3 fatty acid content. Red spider mites are a serious problem in the production of S. hispanica. However, no study has been conducted to analyze the defensive response to the infestation of red spider mites in S. hispanica. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the defensive response of S. hispanica to red spider mites, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of S. hispanica when infested by red spider mites. In the comparative assessment of leaf transcriptomes, a total of 1743 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between control and mite-infested S. hispanica. From these, 1208 (69%) transcripts were upregulated and 535 (31%) were downregulated. The DEGs included transcription factors, defense hormones, and secondary metabolites that were either suppressed or activated in response to spider mite herbivory. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that plant secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates, and signaling pathways, including the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, may play an important role in the defense against red spider mites. This study provides novel insights into the defense response of S. hispanica to insect herbivory and could be a resource for the improvement of pest resistance in the chia.

AB  - Shuvosaurus inexpectatus is an edentulous poposauroid from the late Lacian or earliest Alaunian (Late Triassic) of western Texas, which had been identified primarily from three individuals. A complete repreparation and redescription of the Shuvosaurus cranial elements highlights many of the features that identify it as a poposauroid and a shuvosaurid. Cranial elements unique to Shuvosauridae include an edentulous jaw with a rhamphotheca groove indicating the presence of a beak, a secondary palate formed from the premaxillae and maxillae, and an elongated parabasisphenoid. Shuvosaurus cranial autapomorphies include the articulation of the squamosal and quadratojugal that forms a projection into the posterior edge of the lateral temporal fenestra, the presence of a triangular posterior process of the squamosal, and a basioccipital that is exposed between the exoccipitals, forming the ventral edge of the foramen magnum. In addition to the beak, Shuvosaurus also possessed an extremely large orbit indicating good eyesight, enlarged olfactory bulbs indicating an excellent sense of smell, and enlarged floccular lobes indicating that Shuvosaurus was highly active with good balance and highly developed gaze stabilisation. These cranial adaptations all suggest that Shuvosaurus was not only bipedal but also subsisted on an herbivorous diet.

AB  - Stem cells enter and exit quiescence as part of normal developmental programs and to maintain tissue homeostasis in adulthood. Although it is clear that stem cell intrinsic and extrinsic cues, local and systemic, regulate quiescence, it remains unclear whether intrinsic and extrinsic cues coordinate to control quiescence and how cue coordination is achieved. Here, we report that Notch signaling coordinates neuroblast intrinsic temporal programs with extrinsic nutrient cues to regulate quiescence in Drosophila. When Notch activity is reduced, quiescence is delayed or altogether bypassed, with some neuroblasts dividing continuously during the embryonic-to-larval transition. During embryogenesis before quiescence, neuroblasts express Notch and the Notch ligand Delta. After division, Delta is partitioned to adjacent GMC daughters where it transactivates Notch in neuroblasts. Over time, in response to intrinsic temporal cues and increasing numbers of Delta-expressing daughters, neuroblast Notch activity increases, leading to cell cycle exit and consequently, attenuation of Notch pathway activity. Quiescent neuroblasts have low to no active Notch, which is required for exit from quiescence in response to nutrient cues. Thus, Notch signaling coordinates proliferation versus quiescence decisions.

AB  - Cruciferous plants manufacture glucosinolates (GSLs) as special and important defense compounds against insects. However, how insect feeding induces glucosinolates in Brassica to mediate insect resistance, and how plants regulate the strength of anti-insect defense response during insect feeding, remains unclear. Here, mustard (Brassica juncea), a widely cultivated Brassica plant, and beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), an economically important polyphagous pest of many crops, were used to analyze the changes in GSLs and transcriptome of Brassica during insect feeding, thereby revealing the plant-insect interaction in Brassica plants. The results showed that the content of GSLs began to significantly increase after 48 h of herbivory by S. exigua, with sinigrin as the main component. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 8940 DEGs were identified in mustard challenged with beet armyworm larvae. The functional enrichment results revealed that the pathways related to the biosynthesis of glucosinolate and jasmonic acid were significantly enriched by upregulated DEGs, suggesting that mustard might provide a defense against herbivory by inducing JA biosynthesis and then promoting GSL accumulation. Surprisingly, genes regulating JA catabolism and inactivation were also activated, and both JA signaling repressors (JAZs and JAMs) and activators (MYCs and NACs) were upregulated during herbivory. Taken together, our results indicate that the accumulation of GSLs regulated by JA signaling, and the regulation of active and inactive JA compound conversion, as well as the activation of JA signaling repressors and activators, collectively control the anti-insect defense response and avoid over-stunted growth in mustard during insect feeding.

AB  - Cyst nematodes are important herbivorous pests in agriculture that obtain nutrients through specialized root structures termed syncytia. Syncytium initiation, development, and functioning are a research focus because syncytia are the primary interface for molecular interactions between the host plant and parasite. The small size and complex development (over approximately two weeks) of syncytia hinder precise analyses, therefore most studies have analyzed the transcriptome of infested whole-root systems or syncytia-containing root segments. Here, we describe an effective procedure to microdissect syncytia induced by Globodera rostochiensis from tomato roots and to analyze the syncytial proteome using mass spectrometry. As little as 15 mm(2) of 10-mu m-thick sections dissected from 30 syncytia enabled the identification of 100-200 proteins in each sample, indicating that mass-spectrometric methods currently in use achieved acceptable sensitivity for proteome profiling of microscopic samples of plant tissues (approximately 100 mu g). Among the identified proteins, 48 were specifically detected in syncytia and 7 in uninfected roots. The occurrence of approximately 50% of these proteins in syncytia was not correlated with transcript abundance estimated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis. The functional categories of these proteins confirmed that protein turnover, stress responses, and intracellular trafficking are important components of the proteome dynamics of developing syncytia.

AB  - Dragon's blood is a traditional Chinese medicine known for its wound hemostasis, blood circulation, and stasis properties. Recently, it has also been utilized in cosmetics, though its antioxidant capacity remains unclear. This study aims to stabilize the bioactivity of dragon's blood using various plant extracts. We evaluated single plant extracts and their combinations to identify the conditions that maintained the antioxidant capacity of dragon's blood the longest. Selected plants included Hibiscus sabdariffa, Clitoria ternatea, Hylocereus sp., Pandanus amaryllifolius, and Camellia sinensis. We used two sources of dragon's blood: Daemonorops draco and Dracaena cochinchinensis. Extraction conditions were optimized and antioxidant activity was assessed using the free radical scavenging ability of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), total anthocyanin concentration (TAC), total polyphenol content (TPC), the free radical scavenging activity of ABTS, and a ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The results showed that all plant extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity. Clitoria ternatea had the highest DPPH scavenging ability at 93.81%, with the best combination being green tea and Daemonorops draco at 92.57%. Clitoria ternatea had the highest TPC at 9921 mg GAE/100 g, with the best combination (green tea and Dracaena cochinchinensis) at 10500 mg GAE/100 g. ABTS activity was highest for green tea at 98.3%, with the best combination (Clitoria ternatea and Daemonorops draco) at 93.29%. The FRAP assay showed that green tea had the highest electron-donating potential at 3.85 mg/mL, with the best combination (Daemonorops draco and Dracaena cochinchinensis) at 3.71 mg/mL. This study advances our understanding of the antioxidant properties of these plants and the traditional Chinese medicine dragon's blood, enhancing the efficacy of dragon's blood in skincare and cosmetics. Moreover, the application of these extracts could rejuvenate local agriculture, impacting the skincare, cosmetics, and sustainable agriculture sectors.

AB  - The WW and C2 domain containing (WWC) protein family functions as scaffolds regulating cell proliferation and organ growth control through the Hippo signaling pathway. However, their pan-cancer dysregulation and mechanistic roles in signaling transduction have remained unclear. We performed integrated pan-cancer analyses of WWC family gene expression using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 33 different cancer types. Prognostic relevance was evaluated by survival analyses. WWC genetic alterations, DNA methylation, pathway activities, drug response, and tumor immunology were analyzed using online databases. Furthermore, we examined the functional roles of WWCs in lung cancer cells. We observed aberrant WWC expression in various cancers, which associated with patient prognosis. WWC hypermethylation occurred in many cancers and exhibited negative correlation with expression, alongside mutations linked to poor outcomes. Pathway analysis implicated WWCs as Hippo pathway scaffolds, while drug sensitivity analysis suggested associations with diverse chemotherapies. Additionally, pan-cancer analyses elucidated vital immunomodulatory roles for WWC through heterogeneous correlations with immune cell infiltrates, checkpoint molecules, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and chemokine pathways across cancers. Experimentally, WWCs suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while enhancing apoptosis and paclitaxel chemosensitivity. Mechanistically, WWCs bound large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2) kinases to stimulate phosphorylation cascades, thereby inhibiting nuclear translocation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) oncoprotein. Taken together, our multi-omics characterization provides comprehensive evidence for WWCs as putative tumor suppressors across cancers via Hippo pathway modulation. WWCs may serve as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in lung cancer.

AB  - Background Chronic stress increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the brain, which underlay cognitive and psychological problems. In addition to the anti-depressants, vitamin D is known to act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agent. This study investigates the specific effects of vitamin D in protecting hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) against chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha and decreasing the activation of anti-oxidative enzymes super oxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Methods and results Rats were exposed to CMS for 3 weeks. Two groups of rats received vitamin D (5 and 10 mu g/kg) and another received fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) along with CMS. Control groups were not exposed to CMS, but received treatments similar to CMS groups. Serum corticosterone and IL-6, TNF-alpha and SOD and GPx levels in the hippocampus and PFC were measured at the end of three weeks. CMS significantly increased corticosterone, IL-6, TNF-alpha and decreased SOD and GPx levels (P < 0.0001) in hippocampus and PFC. Vitamin D treatment reduced corticosterone levels (P < 0.01), increased SOD (P < 0.0001) and GPx (P < 0.01) and decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha (P < 0.0001) levels in the hippocampus and PFC compared to rats treated with vitamin D vehicle. Vitamin D-10 regulation of SOD and IL-6 levels was more effective than fluoxetine (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively, in hippocampus). Conclusion This study suggests that vitamin D effectively protects the key regions of the brain related to cognition and affective behavior, against the inflammation and oxidative stress caused by the chronic stress.

AB  - In this study, Balb/c mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and treated with Zhi-zi-chi Decoction (ZZCD). Using a hippocampal lipidomics approach that combined ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS with multivariate statistical techniques and targeted metabolic pathway analysis, we identified potential lipid metabolites and pathways associated with depression. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory analyses were conducted in the hippocampus of mice. The chromatograms revealed that most lipids of the same class eluted within the same time period. In the scatter plot, the control and CUMS groups were obviously separated, whereas the ZZCD-treated or fluoxetine-treated groups were positioned between them. In positive and negative ion modes, a comprehensive screening identified 130 differential lipid metabolites, which were classified into 5 groups and 17 types. ZZCD was hypothesized to have a certain call-back efficiency for some differential lipid metabolites. The study identified three target metabolic pathways with certain influence values: glycerophosphate metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. Although ZZCD's inhibitory effect on IL-6 was not significant, it demonstrated good therapeutic effects in reducing central system inflammation associated with IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The research suggested that the pathogenesis of depression might be closely related to lipid metabolism. ZZCD exhibited antidepressant effects by regulating endogenous lipid metabolism in CUMS mice.

AB  - Aristotle is often named as the first zoologist or biologist because of his writings on animals. Although Aristotle's major intention in these books was to illustrate his ideas of how knowledge and understanding might advance, at least one modern biologist (C. Darwin) has recognized Aristotle's depth and breadth as being of surviving merit. Of greater surprise is the ongoing attention that his works continue to receive, including publications in contemporary scientific journals. This review identifies 38 peer-reviewed papers on various topics from Aristotle's biological writings that have been published during the last 50 years. These papers are described according to content (genetics, population biology, anatomy, brain, movement), specific creatures (fish, scorpions, elephants, insects, birds), publication outlet, distribution over the fifty year period surveyed, and visible trends in the topics studied. It is concluded that, in the highly-competitive field of peer-reviewed scientific publication and citation, Aristotle's biology continues to excite the interest of scientists and remains salient to modern science itself.

AB  - Background: Estrogen deficiency causes mitochondrial defects that precede pathological changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the mouse model of postmenopause. The aim of this study was to investigate in such a mouse model whether and how estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) was involved in prevention of mitochondrial damage and protection of neurons in the hippocampus.Methods: A mouse model of postmenopausal AD was created by ovariectomizing female 3xTg-AD mice, some of which were subcutaneously injected for six weeks with the non-steroidal ER beta agonist diarylpropionitrile. ER beta expression in female C57BL/6J mice was knocked down using shRNA interference. The different groups of animals were compared in terms of cognitive function using the Y-maze test, new object recognition test, and Morris water maze test, expression of numerous proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as deposition of amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles. To complement these in vivo studies, we probed the effects of diarylpropionitrile on ER beta expression, apoptosis, and mitochondrial homeostasis in primary rat hippocampal neurons treated with amyloid beta.Results: ER beta knockdown in C57BL/6J mice produced cognitive impairment, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis by downregulating PGC-1 alpha, NRF1, mtTFA, and TOM20, and decreased mitophagy by downregulating Pink1, Parkin, and LC3B while upregulating PARIS and p62. ER beta knockdown promoted neuronal apoptosis by upregulating Cleaved-Caspase 9, Cleaved-Caspase 3, and Bax, while downregulating Bcl2 in hippocampus. Diarylpropionitrile mitigated cognitive decline in ovariectomized 3xTg-AD mice, which was associated with downregulation of BACE1, reduction of A beta deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and tau hyperphosphorylation, and upregulation of ER beta, increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, and decreases in apoptosis. The effects of diary-lpropionitrile in mice were recapitulated in A beta-injured primary rat hippocampal neurons.Conclusions: ER beta activation can support learning and memory and alleviate AD symptoms in the postmenopausal AD model, which may involve regulation of neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy via NRF1/PGC-1 alpha. This study supports further research on ER beta as a therapeutic target for postmenopausal women with AD.

AB  - Altered hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) activity may have significant consequences in the hippocampus, which mediates declarative memory, has limited vascularization, and is vulnerable to hypoxic insults. Previous studies have reported that neurovascular coupling is reduced in aged brains and that diseases which cause hypoxia increase with age, which may render the hippocampus susceptible to acute hypoxia. Most studies have investigated the actions of HIF-alpha in aging cortical structures, but few have focused on the role of HIF-alpha within aged hippocampus. This study tests the hypothesis that aging is associated with impaired hippocampal HIF-alpha activity. Dorsal hippocampal sections from mice aged 3, 9, 18, and 24 months were probed for the presence of HIF-alpha isoforms or their associated gene products using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fISH). A subset of each age was exposed to acute hypoxia (8% oxygen) for 3 h to investigate changes in the responsiveness of HIF-alpha to hypoxia. Basal mean intensity of fluorescently labeled HIF-1 alpha protein increases with age in the hippocampus, whereas HIF-2 alpha intensity only increases in the 24-month group. Acute hypoxic elevation of HIF-1 alpha is lost with aging and is reversed in the 24-month group. fISH reveals that glycolytic genes induced by HIF-1 alpha (lactose dehydrogenase-a, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) are lower in aged hippocampus than in 3-month hippocampus, and mRNA for monocarboxylate transporter 1, a lactose transporter, increases. These results indicate that lactate, used in neurotransmission, may be limited in aged hippocampus, concurrent with impaired HIF-alpha response to hypoxic events. Therefore, impaired HIF-alpha may contribute to age-associated cognitive decline during hypoxic events.

AB  - The size of tusks in proboscideans has numerous implications for their function, biology, ecology, and other aspects of both extant and extinct species. Yet, no prior studies have explored the relationship between the linear dimensions of tusks and their corresponding masses. Here, methods for estimating the masses of proboscidean tusks based on their length and circumference are introduced for the first time. Through extensive regression analysis on a large dataset of tusk dimensions and recorded masses, a robust regression equation was developed. Additionally, it was found that converting tusk volume to kilograms using the cylinder formula yielded highly accurate tusk mass estimates in proboscideans. Also, the potential average tusk sizes of living elephant species under optimal conditions, before the devastating impact of humans, were estimated. The upper incisors of proboscideans remained relatively small until the Late Miocene when tusk sizes comparable to those of living elephants first appeared. Mammoths, along with certain mammutids, stegodonts, and anancines, developed notably larger tusks relative to their body size compared to extant elephants. The largest tusks were identified in derived Plio-Pleistocene proboscideans within Mammuthus, Palaeoloxodon, and Mammutidae clades, with some species bearing tusks weighing above 200 kg per side. World record-sized tusks far surpassed this figure.

AB  - O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification occurring on serine/threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, mediated by the enzymes OGT and OGA which catalyze the addition or removal of the UDP-GlcNAc moieties, respectively. Structural changes brought by this modification lead to alternations of protein stability, protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation. Importantly, O-GlcNAcylation is a nutrient sensor by coupling nutrient sensing with cellular signaling. Elevated levels of OGT and O-GlcNAc have been reported in a variety of cancers and has been linked to regulation of multiple cancer signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the most recent findings on the role of O-GlcNAcylation as a metabolic sensor in signaling pathways and immune response in cancer.

AB  - Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI), a key enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, plays an important role in plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stresses and pathogen infections. However, whether and how PGI modulates herbivore-induced plant defenses remain largely unknown. The Brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is a devastating insect pest of rice, causing significant damage to rice plants through feeding, oviposition, and disease transmission, resulting in great yield losses. Here, we isolated a rice cytosolic PGI gene, OsPGI1c, which is ubiquitously expressed in rice plants; the highest transcript levels are found in leaves, outer leaf sheaths, and seeds. The expression of OsPGI1c was induced by infestation by gravid females of the BPH, mechanical wounding, and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA). Overexpressing OsPGI1c in rice (oePGI) enhanced both the masses of plant shoots and roots and basal levels of trehalose; however, when infested by gravid BPH females for 2 days, trehalose levels were significantly lower in oePGI plants than in wild-type (WT) plants. Additionally, the overexpression of OsPGI1c increased the BPH-induced levels of JA, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, and abscisic acid, but decreased the levels of ethylene and H2O2. Bioassays revealed that gravid BPH females preferred WT plants over oePGI plants for laying eggs; moreover, BPH eggs exhibited lower hatching rates and required longer developmental durations on oePGI plants than WT plants. These results indicate that OsPGI1c positively modulates both rice growth and BPH resistance.

AB  - Plants produce volatile organic compounds that are important in communication and defense. While studies have largely focused on volatiles emitted from aboveground plant parts upon exposure to biotic or abiotic stresses, volatile emissions from roots upon aboveground stress are less studied. Here, we investigated if tomato plants under insect herbivore attack exhibited a different root volatilome than non-stressed plants, and whether this was influenced by the plant's genetic background. To this end, we analyzed one domesticated and one wild tomato species, i.e., Solanum lycopersicum cv Moneymaker and Solanum pimpinellifolium, respectively, exposed to leaf herbivory by the insect Spodoptera exigua. Root volatiles were trapped with two sorbent materials, HiSorb and PDMS, at 24 h after exposure to insect stress. Our results revealed that differences in root volatilome were species-, stress-, and material-dependent. Upon leaf herbivory, the domesticated and wild tomato species showed different root volatile profiles. The wild species presented the largest change in root volatile compounds with an overall reduction in monoterpene emission under stress. Similarly, the domesticated species presented a slight reduction in monoterpene emission and an increased production of fatty-acid-derived volatiles under stress. Volatile profiles differed between the two sorbent materials, and both were required to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the root volatilome. Collectively, these results provide a strong basis to further unravel the impact of herbivory stress on systemic volatile emissions.

AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a receptor for WNT5A and related Wnt proteins, that play an important role during embryonic development by regulating cell migration, cell polarity, neural patterning, and organogenesis. ROR1 exerts these functions by transducing signals from the Wnt secreted gly-coproteins to the intracellular Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca++ pathways. Investigations in adult human cells, particu-larly cancer cells, have demonstrated that besides these two pathways, the WNT5A/ROR1 axis can activate a number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, NF-Kappa B, STAT3, and Hippo pathways. Moreover, ROR1 is aberrantly expressed in cancer and was associated with tumor progression and poor survival by pro-moting cell proliferation, survival, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and metastasis. Consequently, numerous therapeutic tools to target ROR1 are currently being evaluated in cancer patients. In this review, we will provide a detailed description of the signaling pathways regulated by ROR1 in cancer and their impact in tumor progression.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a common organophosphorus insecticide. It is associated with negative consequences such as neurotoxicity and reproductive injury. This study aimed to observe the ability of olive leaf extract to attenuate chlorpyrifos toxicity, which induced neuro- and reproductive toxicity in male albino rats. Olive leaf extract (OLE) exhibits potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. Twenty-two mature male rats were divided into four groups: control (saline), CPF (9 mg/kg), OLE (150 mg/kg), and CPF + OLE. Treatment was administered orally for 80 days. The CPF significantly reduced serum sex hormones, sperm counts and motility, high oxidants (MDA), and depleted antioxidants (GSH, SOD, TAC) in the brain and testes homogenate; additionally, it decreased serum AChE and brain neurotransmitters, increased Bax, decreased Bcl-2, and boosted caspase-3 immune expression in neural and testicular cells. Immunological expression of Ki 67 in the cerebrum, cerebellum, choroid plexus, and hippocampus was reduced, and alpha-SMA in testicular tissue also decreased. Histopathological findings were consistent with the above impacts. OLE co-administration significantly normalized all these abnormalities. OLE showed significant protection against neural and reproductive damage caused by CPF.

AB  - The mother's thyroid hormone status during gestation and the first few months after delivery can play a crucial role in maturation during the brain development of the child. Transient abnormalities in thyroid function at birth indicate developmental and cognitive disorders in adulthood. Choline supplementation during gestation and the perinatal period in rats causes long-lasting memory improvement in the offspring. However, it remains unclear whether choline is able to restore the deficits in rats with maternal hypothyroidism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of choline supplementation on the alteration of cognitive-behavioral function, long-term potentiation (LTP), and morphological changes as well as apoptosis in pre-pubertal offspring rats. To induce hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was added to the drinking water from the 6th day of gestation to the 21st postnatal day (PND). Choline treatment was started twice a day on the first day of the gestation until PND 21 via gavage. LTP recording and Morris water maze (MWM) test were conducted at PND 28. Then, the rats were sacrificed to assess their brains. The results revealed that developmental thyroid hormone deficiency impaired spatial learning and memory and reduced LTP (both: P < 0.001). Choline treatment alleviated LTP (P < 0.001), as well as learning and memory deficits (P < 0.01) in both male and female hypothyroid rats. However, no significant changes were observed in the number of caspase-3 stained cells in choline-receiving hypothyroid groups. The results revealed that developmental thyroid hormone deficiency impaired spatial learning and memory and reduced LTP. Choline treatment alleviated LTP, as well as learning and memory deficits in both male and female hypothyroid rats.

AB  - Although radiotherapy (RT) is the preferred treatment for elderly patients with brain tumors, certain negative effects can't be ignored. Fortunately, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) presents with a promising potential for the treatment of neurological diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of PRP on neuroinflammation, emotional disorder and cognitive dysfunction induced by RT in aged rats. Firstly, whole brain RT (WBRT) model was established by whole brain irradiation with 10 Gy of 6-MeV electron beam in rats. Next, twenty 20-month-old female SD rats were divided into four groups (sham group, PRP group, WBRT group, and WBRT + PRP group) according different treatments. After that, the cognitive dysfunction and depression-like behavior of rats were examined by novel object recognition test (NORT), Morris water maze test (MWM), open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM). Besides, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of microglial marker protein Iba-1 in rat hippocampus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-18, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in rat hippocampus; real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot to measure the levels of neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor (TrkB), and nerve growth factor (NGF) in rat hippocampus; and western blot also to observe the protein expression levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and IL-1 beta in rat hippocampus. After experiments, some results obtained were shown as follows. PRP could significantly improve learning and memory ability and depression-like behavior, increase the level of neurotrophic factors, inhibit the activation of microglia and decrease the level of pro-inflammatory factors in WBRT rats. In addition, PRP significantly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. To sum up, PRP can ameliorate neuroinflammation, emotional disorder and cognitive dysfunction induced by RT in aged rats, and the mechanism may be related to its inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

AB  - In the present study, the influence of topographic and mechanical cues on neuronal growth cones (NGCs) and network directionality in 3D-engineered cell culture models is explored. Two-photon polymerization (2PP) is employed to fabricate nanopillar arrays featuring tunable effective shear modulus. Large variations in mechanical properties are obtained by altering the aspect ratio of the nanostructures. The nanopillar arrays are seeded with different neuronal cell lines, including neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), I(3)Neurons, and primary hippocampal neurons. All cell types exhibit preferential orientations according to the nanopillar topology, as shown by neurites creating a high number of oriented orthogonal networks. Furthermore, the differentiation and maturation of NPCs are affected by the topographic and mechanical properties of the nanopillars, as shown by the expression of the mature neuronal marker Synapsin I. Lastly, NGCs are influenced by effective shear modulus in terms of spreading area, and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is employed to assess the cytoskeleton organization at nanometric resolution. The developed approach, involving laser-assisted 3D microfabrication, neuro-mechanobiology, and super-resolution microscopy, paves the way for prospective comparative studies on the evolution of neuronal networks and NGCs in healthy and diseased (e.g., neurodegenerative) conditions.

AB  - Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a key enzyme in animal fat metabolism and is involved in the rate-limiting step of catalyzing the decomposition of fat and cholesterol. It also plays an important regulatory role in maintaining seminiferous epithelial structure, androgen synthesis and primordial germ cell differentiation. We previously reported that HSL is involved the synthesis of steroids in Bactrian camels, although it is unclear what role it plays in testicular development. The present study was conducted to characterize the biological function and expression pattern of the HSL gene in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis and the development of testis in Bactrian camels. We analyzed cloning of the cDNA sequence of the HSL gene of Bactrian camels by RT-PCR, as well as the structural features of HSL proteins, using bioinformatics software, such as ProtParam, TMHMM, Signal P 4.1, SOPMA and MEGA 7.0. We used qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining to clarify the expression pattern of HSL in the HPG axis and testis of two-week-old (2W), two-year-old (2Y), four-year-old (4Y) and six-year-old (6Y) Bactrian camels. According to sequence analysis, the coding sequence (CDS) region of the HSL gene is 648 bp in length and encodes 204 amino acids. According to bioinformatics analysis, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of Bactrian camel HSL are most similar to those of Camelus pacos and Camelus dromedarius, with the lowest sequence similarity with Mus musculus. In adult Bactrian camel HPG axis tissues, both HSL mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in the testis than in other tissues (hypothalamus, pituitary and pineal tissues) (p < 0.05). The expression of mRNA in the testis increased with age and was the highest in six-year-old testis (p < 0.01). The protein expression levels of HSL in 2Y and 6Y testis were clearly higher than in 2W and 4Y testis tissues (p < 0.01). Immunofluorescence results indicate that the HSL protein was mainly localized in the germ cells, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells from Bactrian camel testis, and strong positive signals were detected in epididymal epithelial cells, basal cells, spermatocytes and smooth muscle cells, with partially expression in hypothalamic glial cells, pituitary suspensory cells and pineal cells. According to the results of gene ontology (GO) analysis enrichment, HSL indirectly regulates the anabolism of steroid hormones through interactions with various targets. Therefore, we conclude that the HSL gene may be associated with the development and reproduction of Bactrian camels in different stages of maturity, and these results will contribute to further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of HSL in Bactrian camel reproduction.

AB  - Howenegg is an early Vallesian (MN9, 10.3 Ma) vertebrate locality in Hegau, Southwest Germany renowned for its preservation of complete mammalian skeletons, diverse invertebrate and plant fossils. We provide the first to be published photographic images of the Howenegg Hippotherium primigenium skulls, mandibles and dentitions for describing critical character states used to define hipparion species. We compare these states to those for North American Cormohipparion occidentale, Turkish Cormohipparion sinapensis Algerian 'Cormohipparion' africanum, Austrian Pannonian C Hippotherium sp., Austrian locality Inzersdorf Hippotherium primigenium, the China type specimens of Hippotherium weihoense and 'Hipparion' chiai, and Moldovan Cremohipparion moldavicum. Also provided are univariate statistical comparisons of cranial-dental characters and Log10 ratio analyses of third metapodials dimensions to better evaluate taxonomic comparisons and define the genetic pool from which Old World hipparions are derived. We concur with previous authors that North American Cormohipparion is the likely source of first occurring Old World hipparions offering alternatives of Cormohipparion occidentale or Cormohipparion quinni as the most closely related species for the Old World Cormohipparion Datum. We find that the best evidence for the chronology of the Cormohipparion Datum suggests and age of 11.4-11.0 Ma, or 11.2-11.1 Ma rather than the 11.5 Ma datum recently alleged for China.

AB  - Axon regeneration in response to injury has been documented in many animals over several hundred years. In contrast, how neurons respond to dendrite injury has been examined only in the last decade. So far, dendrite regeneration after injury has been documented in invertebrate model systems, but has not been assayed in a vertebrate. In this study, we use zebrafish motor neurons to track neurons after dendrite injury. We address two major gaps in our knowledge of dendrite regeneration: 1) whether post-synaptic dendrites can regenerate and 2) whether vertebrate dendrites can regenerate. We find that motor neurons survive laser microsurgery to remove one or all dendrites. Outgrowth of new dendrites typically initiated one to three days after injury, and a new, stable dendrite arbor was in place by five days after injury. We conclude that zebrafish motor neurons have the capacity to regenerate a new dendrite arbor.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) undergoes postweaning developmental changes partially linked to GABAergic circuit maturation. Endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) acting on its VPAC(1) receptor strongly influences LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS), an effect dependent on GABAergic transmission. Although VPAC(1) receptor levels are developmentally regulated during embryogenesis, their variation along postweaning development is unknown, as is the VPAC(1) modulation of LTP or its relation to hippocampal GABAergic circuit maturation. As such, we investigated how VPAC(1) modulation of LTP adjusts from weaning to adulthood along with GABAergic circuit maturation. As described, LTP induced by mild TBS (5 bursts, 4 pulses delivered at 100 Hz) was increasingly greater from weaning to adulthood. The influence of the VPAC(1) receptor antagonist PG 97-269 (100 nM) on TBS-induced LTP was much larger in juvenile (3-week-old) than in young adult (6-7-week-old) or adult (12-week-old) rats. This effect was not associated with a developmental decrease in synaptic VPAC(1) receptor levels. However, an increase in pre and post-synaptic GABAergic synaptic markers suggests an increase in the number of GABAergic synaptic contacts that is more prominent than the one observed in glutamatergic connections during this period. Conversely, endogenous VPAC(2) receptor activation did not significantly influence TBS-induced LTP. VPAC(2) receptor levels enhance pronouncedly during postweaning development, but not at synaptic sites. Given the involvement of VIP interneurons in several aspects of hippocampal-dependent learning, neurodevelopmental disorders, and epilepsy, this could provide important insights into the role of VIP modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity during normal and altered brain development potentially contributing to epileptogenesis.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Dynamic changes in components from colostrum to mature milk occur in any mammal. However, the time it takes to reach the mature milk stage differs between taxa and species, as do the final concentrations of all the components. The white rhinoceros belongs to the family Perissodactyla, of which the milk and milk metabolome of the domesticated Equidae have been studied to some detail. Metabolomic information on the colostrum and milk of the Rhinocerotidae is lacking. Methods: Colostrum and milk were obtained from seven white rhinoceroses. Of note is that it was their first parturition and all followed the same diet, two factors known to affect colostrum composition and its changes during early lactation in domesticated mammals. Milk serum was prepared by the ultrafiltration of the milk samples. Untargeted 1N NMR spectra were processed with Topspin 3.2, calibration was carried out according to the alanine signal and the identification of signals was carried out with Chenomx and assignments in the literature. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using MetaboAnalyst 6.0. Results: The changes in the metabolites were followed during the first 7 days of lactation as well as on day 20. The amounts of amino acids and their derivatives, organic acids and lipid metabolites decreased over lactation, while carbohydrates and their derivatives increased. The colostrum phase ended on day 2, while the transition to mature milk seemed to be complete by day 7. From day 3 to 7, galactose metabolism and tyrosine metabolism were uprated. Of interest is the presence of the oligosaccharide 3 '-sialyllactose on days 3 and 4 of lactation. Conclusions: Mainly the content of carbohydrates increased over lactation, specifically lactose. The 3 '-sialyllactose content peaked on days 3 and 4 of lactation. The colostrum phase ended on day 2. The mature milk stage was reached by day 7. The galactose metabolism and tyrosine metabolism were uprated after day 3 of lactation.

AB  - Bilirubin, an endogenous metabolite with many significant physiological roles, particularly anti-inflammatory properties, shows great promise as a treatment for inflammatory diseases. However, the binding targets and downstream signaling mechanisms of bilirubin remain unclear. Here, by using quantitative phosphorylation proteomics and several powerful chemical biology techniques such as the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), molecular docking, and MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), it is identified and confirmed that with-no-lysine (K) kinase 1 (WNK1) is the primary target of bilirubin at physiological concentrations. Bilirubin binds to the kinase domain of WNK1, activating its kinase activity and increasing the intracellular chloride ion concentration via the downstream SPAK/OSR1-KCC2 pathway in neurons. Manipulating endogenous bilirubin levels by deleting Blvra, the bilirubin synthesis enzyme, and Ugt1a1, its metabolic enzyme, significantly promotes and inhibits the activation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome, respectively, in mouse hippocampus. Similarly, exogenous bilirubin supplementation suppressed LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse hippocampus in a WNK1-dependent manner. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of WNK1 downstream signaling elucidated the broad biological roles of WNK1, notably its function in suppressing inflammation. The findings clarify the direct targets and signaling mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of bilirubin and pave the way for exploring its novel functions.

AB  - Achieving high target cell avidity in combination with cell selectivity are fundamental, but largely unachieved goals in the development of biomedical nanoparticle systems, which are intricately linked to the quantity of targeting functionalities on their surface. Viruses, regarded as almost ideal role models for nanoparticle design, are evolutionary optimized, so that they cope with this challenge bearing an extremely low number of spikes, and thus binding domains, on their surface. In comparison, nanoparticles are usually equipped with more than an order of magnitude more ligands. It is therefore obvious that one key factor for increasing nanoparticle efficiency in terms of avidity and selectivity lies in optimizing their ligand number. A first step along this way is to know how many ligands per nanoparticle are involved in specific binding with target cell receptors. This question is addressed experimentally for a block copolymer nanoparticle model system. The data confirm that only a fraction of the nanoparticle ligands is involved in the binding processes: with a total ligand valency of 29 ligands/100 nm2 surface area a maximum 5.3 ligands/100 nm2 are involved in specific receptor binding. This corresponds to an average number of 251 binding ligands per nanoparticle, a number that can be rationalized within the biological context of the model system.

AB  - In adult insects, as in vertebrates, the gut epithelium is a highly regenerative tissue that can renew itself rapidly in response to changing inputs from nutrition, the gut microbiota, ingested toxins, and signals from other organs. Because of its cellular and genetic similarities to the mammalian intestine, and its relevance as a target for the control of insect pests and disease vectors, many researchers have used insect intestines to address fundamental questions about stem cell functions during tissue maintenance and regeneration. In Drosophila, where most of the experimental work has been performed, not only are intestinal cell types and behaviors well characterized, but numerous cell signaling interactions have been detailed that mediate gut epithelial regeneration. A prevailing model for regenerative responses in the insect gut invokes stress sensing by damaged enterocytes (ECs) as a principal source for signaling that activates the division of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the growth and differentiation of their progeny. However, extant data also reveal alternative mechanisms for regeneration that involve ISC-intrinsic functions, active culling of healthy epithelial cells, enhanced EC growth, and even cytoplasmic shedding by infected ECs. This article reviews current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in gut regeneration in several insect models (Drosophila and Aedes of the order Diptera, and several Lepidoptera).

AB  - The RNA binding protein LIN28 directly modulates the stability and translation of target mRNAs independently of Let-7; however, the key downstream targets of LIN28 in this process are largely unknown. Here, we revealed that Hippo signaling effector YAP1 functioned as a key downstream regulator of LIN28 to modulate the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties and tumor progressions in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). LIN28 was overexpressed in BC tissues and cell lines, and significantly correlated with poorer overall survivals in patients. Ectopic LIN28 expression enhanced, while knockdown of LIN28A inhibited the CSC-like properties, cell growth and invasive phenotypes of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated LIN28 overexpression significantly induced the expressions of YAP1 downstream genes, while reduced the transcripts of YAP1 upstream kinases, such as MST1/2 and LATS1/2, and knockdown of LIN28A exhibited the opposite effects. Furthermore, constitutive activation of YAP1 in LIN28 knockdown TNBC cells could rescue the cell growth and invasive phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, instead of the dependence of Let-7, LIN28 recruited RNA binding protein MSI2 in a manner dependent on the LIN28 CSD domain and MSI2 RRM domain, to directly induce the mRNA decay of YAP1 upstream kinases, leading to the inhibition of Hippo pathway and activation of YAP1, which eventually gave rise to increased CSC populations, enhanced tumor cell growth and invasive phenotypes. Accordingly, co-upregulations of LIN28 and MSI2 in TNBC tissues were strongly associated with YAP1 protein level and tumor malignance. Taken together, our findings unravel a novel LIN28/MSI2-YAP1 regulatory axis to induce the CSC-like properties, tumor growth and metastasis, independently of Let-7, which may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a subset of TNBC with LIN28 overexpression.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most relevant parameters for the regulation of intracellular processes. Measuring localized subcellular temperature gradients is fundamental for a deeper understanding of cell function, such as the genesis of action potentials, and cell metabolism. Notwithstanding several proposed techniques, at the moment detection of temperature fluctuations at the subcellular level still represents an ongoing challenge. Here, for the first time, temperature variations (1 degrees C) associated with potentiation and inhibition of neuronal firing is detected, by exploiting a nanoscale thermometer based on optically detected magnetic resonance in nanodiamonds. The results demonstrate that nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds provide a tool for assessing various levels of neuronal spiking activity, since they are suitable for monitoring different temperature variations, respectively, associated with the spontaneous firing of hippocampal neurons, the disinhibition of GABAergic transmission and the silencing of the network. Conjugated with the high sensitivity of this technique (in perspective sensitive to < 0.1 degrees C variations), nanodiamonds pave the way to a systematic study of the generation of localized temperature gradients under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, they prompt further studies explaining in detail the physiological mechanism originating this effect.

AB  - 6-Shogaol is one of the main active phenolic components of ginger and has neuroprotective effects by protecting brain against the oxidative stress and regulate the levels of neurotrophic factors. The objective of the present study was to verify the effect of 6-shogaol on neurochemical parameters in offspring after maternal immune activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Twelve pregnant Wistar rats received 100 mu g/kg of LPS or saline solution on the gestational day 9.5. Male offspring participated in the study and from the postnatal days (PND) 30 and 55, respectively, they were supplemented with 6-shogaol or saline solution, by gavage at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, orally for 5 days. In PND 37 and 62, analysis of kinase signaling regulated by extracellular signal 1/2 (ERK 1/2), levels of neurotrophic factor derived from the brain (BDNF), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lipid and protein oxidative damage was evaluated by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), respectively, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was performed in the hippocampus. Prenatal exposure to LPS significantly decreased ERK and BDNF levels in PND 37 and 62, increased NSE levels and lipid damage in rats in PND 37, and increased 3-NT level in rats in PND 62. With treatment using 6-shogaol, an increase in ERK and BDNF levels was identified in PND 37 and 62 and a reduction in HNE and MPO activity in rats in PND 37 and 62, respectively. 6-Shogaol positively increased markers of neuronal growth, plasticity and synaptic activity and reduced oxidative damage in the hippocampus in an animal model of autism by maternal immune activation.

AB  - Aberrant expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158) has been reported to be inextricably linked to a variety of diseases affecting the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, intraocular pressure, and glioma, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive due to a lack of biological and pharmacological tools to elaborate its preferential cellular distribution and molecular interaction network. To assess the cellular localization, expression, and function of GPR158, we generated an epitope-tagged GPR158 mouse model (GPR158(Tag)) that exhibited normal motor, cognitive, and social behavior, no deficiencies in social memory, and no anxiety-like behavior compared to C57BL/6J control mice at P60. Using immunofluorescence, we found that GPR158(+) cells were distributed in several brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and caudate putamen. Next, using the cerebral cortex of the adult GPR158(Tag) mice as a representative region, we found that GPR158 was only expressed in neurons, and not in microglia, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes. Remarkably, the majority of GPR158 was enriched in Camk2a(+) neurons whilst limited expression was found in PV+ interneurons. Concomitant 3D co-localization analysis revealed that GPR158 was mainly distributed in the postsynaptic membrane, but with a small portion in the presynaptic membrane. Lastly, via mass spectrometry analysis, we identified proteins that may interact with GPR158, and the relevant enrichment pathways were consistent with the immunofluorescence findings. RNA-seq analysis of the cerebral cortex of the GPR158(-/-) mice showed that GPR158 and its putative interacting proteins are involved in the chloride channel complex and synaptic vesicle membrane composition. Using these GPR158(Tag) mice, we were able to accurately label GPR158 and uncover its fundamental function in synaptic vesicle function and memory. Thus, this model will be a useful tool for subsequent biological, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies related to GPR158.

However, there is a lack of clear pathological relationship between the brain and bone in the current understanding. Here, it is found that young osteocyte, the most abundant cells in bone, secretes extracellular vesicles (OCYYoung-EVs) to ameliorate cognitive impairment and the pathogenesis of AD in APP/PS1 mice and model cells. These benefits of OCYYoung-EVs are diminished in aged osteocyte-derived EVs (OCYAged-EVs). Based on the self-constructed OCY-EVs tracer transgenic mouse models and the in vivo fluorescent imaging system, OCY-EVs have been observed to be transported to the brain under physiological and pathological conditions. In the hippocampal administration of A beta 40 induced young AD model mice, the intramedullary injection of Rab27a-shRNA adenovirus inhibits OCYYoung-EVs secretion from bone and aggravates cognitive impairment. Proteomic quantitative analysis reveals that OCYYoung-EVs, compared to OCYAged-EVs, enrich multiple protective factors of AD pathway. The study uncovers the role of OCY-EV as a regulator of brain health, suggesting a novel mechanism in bone-brain communication.

AB  - Photobiomodulation (PBM) has received attention due to its potential for improving tissue function and enhancing regeneration in stroke. A lightweight, compact, and simple system of miniaturized electronic devices consisting of packaged light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that incorporates a flexible substrate for in vivo brain PBM in a mouse model is developed. Using this device platform, the preventive and therapeutic effects of PBM affixed to the exposed skull of mice in the photothrombosis and middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model are evaluated. Among the wavelength range of 630, 850, and 940 nm LED array, the PBM with 630-nm LED array is proved to be the most effective for reducing the infarction volume and neurological impairment after ischemic stroke. Moreover, the PBM with 630 nm LED array remarkably improves the capability of spatial learning and memory in the chronic poststroke phase, attenuates AIM2 inflammasome activation and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis, and modulates microglial polarization in the hippocampus and cortex 7 days following ischemic stroke. Thus, PBM may prevent tissue and functional damage in acute ischemic injury, thereby attenuating the development of cognitive impairment after stroke.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal, rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease of uncertain etiology, clinically characterized by various combinations of Levodopa unresponsive parkinsonism, cerebellar, autonomic and motor dysfunctions. The morphological hallmark of this alpha-synucleinopathy is the deposition of aberrant alpha-synuclein in both glia, mainly oligodendroglia (glial cytoplasmic inclusions /GCIs/) and neurons, associated with glioneuronal degeneration of the striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar and many other neuronal systems. Typical phenotypes are MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and a cerebellar variant (MSA-C) with olivocerebellar atrophy. However, MSA can present with a wider range of clinical and pathological features than previously thought. In addition to rare combined or "mixed" MSA, there is a broad spectrum of atypical MSA variants, such as those with a different age at onset and disease duration, "minimal change" or prodromal forms, MSA variants with Lewy body disease or severe hippocampal pathology, rare forms with an unusual tau pathology or spinal myoclonus, an increasing number of MSA cases with cognitive impairment/dementia, rare familial forms, and questionable conjugal MSA. These variants that do not fit into the current classification of MSA are a major challenge for the diagnosis of this unique proteinopathy. Although the clinical diagnostic accuracy and differential diagnosis of MSA have improved by using combined biomarkers, its distinction from clinically similar extrapyramidal disorders with other pathologies and etiologies may be difficult. These aspects should be taken into consideration when revising the current diagnostic criteria. This appears important given that disease-modifying treatment strategies for this hitherto incurable disorder are under investigation.

AB  - Amyloid beta (A beta) plays a major role in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded A beta causes oxidative stress and inflammatory damage leading to apoptotic cell death. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in treating neurodegenerative diseases by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. We examined the neuroprotective effect of formulated CHM Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang, made of Paeonia lactiflora and Glycyrrhiza uralensis at 1:1 ratio) in AD cell and mouse models. In A beta-GFP SH-SY5Y cells, SG-Tang reduced A beta aggregation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as improved neurite outgrowth. When the A beta-GFP-expressing cells were stimulated with conditioned medium from interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated HMC3 microglia, SG-Tang suppressed expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) and 3 (NLRP3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6, attenuated caspase-1 activity and ROS production, and promoted neurite outgrowth. In streptozocin-induced hyperglycemic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, SG-Tang also reduced expressions of NLRP1, NLRP3, A beta and Tau in hippocampus and cortex, as well as improved working and spatial memories in Y maze and Morris water maze. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of SG-Tang in treating AD by moderating neuroinflammation.

AB  - Anesthetics-induced disruption of dentate neurogenesis in the young brain is strongly suggested to contribute to delayed neurocognitive deficit. In postnatal rodents, the neurogenesis of the dentate gyrus (DG) is sequentially derived from the secondary dentate matrix, tertiary dentate matrix and subgranular zone (SGZ). However, the effects of anesthetics on the dentate neurogenesis derived from specific sites are poorly understood. To trace the new cells generated from the postnatal secondary dentate matrix, peak stage of the tertiary dentate matrix and early stage of the SGZ after isoflurane exposure, mice at postnatal day 1 (P1), P7 and P31 were injected with BrdU at 12 h before the exposure. We found that isoflurane exposure significantly reduced the numbers of proliferating cells (1 day old), immature granule cells (21 days old) or mature granule cells (42 days old) derived from the peak stage of the tertiary dentate matrix and postnatal secondary dentate matrix, but not from the SGZ. Quantitative assessment of BrdU-/BrdU+NeuN-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 level in the DG indicated that the reduction was correlated with cell loss rather than neuronal differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 & beta; pathway enriched by mRNA-sequencing is a requirement for the isofluraneinduced loss of 1-day-old proliferating cells generated from the tertiary dentate matrix. In addition, this study demonstrated that P1 and P7 mice, but not P31 mice exposure to isoflurane resulted in subsequent deficits in performance of the tasks of the Morris Water Maze.

AB  - Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) has been confirmed to be related to the pathogenesis of tumors. However, the potential impact of GPNMB on the progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is unclear. In this study, the expression levels of GPNMB and Yes-associated protein (YAP) were analyzed using qRT-PCT and Western blot assay. Cell counting kit-8, EdU, and flow cytometry assays were used to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of DLBCL cells. A nude mice xenograft model was established for in vivo research. Results showed that GPNMB and YAP1 were upregulated in DLBCL cell lines. Knockdown of GPNMB inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in DLBCL cells. Additionally, the expression levels of YAP1 and the downstream effector of Hippo pathway (c-myc) were markedly decreased when GPNMB was knocked down. Moreover, knockdown of GPNMB inhibited the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin protein, which could be abolished by YAP1 overexpression. Simultaneously, the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GPNMB knockdown could be reversed by YAP1 overexpression or LiCl (the activator of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway). Furthermore, the mice xenograft model confirmed that inhibition of GPNMB restrained the tumorigenesis of DLBCL in vivo. In conclusion, GPNMB could partly activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by targeting YAP1, so as to participate in tumorigenesis of DLBCL.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-associated cognitive dysfunction significantly disturbs patients' quality of life and will to live. However, its underlying mechanism is as yet unknown. Recent researches indicate that blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is responsible for early cognitive dysfunction. Microglia might participate in remodeling of BBB-associated tight junction and regulating BBB integrity. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether microglia activation and BBB injury involve in PTSD-associated cognitive dysfunction. Hence, we established an animal model of PTSD, single prolonged stress (SPS), and investigated permeability changes in the hippocampus and further explored the effects of microglia on BBB remodeling. The Y maze was used to assess the changes of cognitive function. The sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) assay and western blotting analysis were employed to detect BBB integrity changes. Minocycline was administered to inhibit microglial activation. Immunofluorescence stains were used to assess the activation states in microglia. The results showed that SPS-exposed rats exhibited poorer cognitive performance, higher passage of NaFlu, and lower expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin 5) in the hippocampus on the day after SPS, but no difference on the 7th day. Inhibition of microglial activation by minocycline attenuated poor cognitive performance and BBB impairment including the extravasation of NaFlu and protein levels of the tight junction. Taken together, the present study indicates that BBB impairment may underlie the shared pathological basis of PTSD and cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Activation of the YAP-TEAD transcriptional complex drives the growth of several cancer types and is a key resistance mechanism to targeted therapies. Accordingly, a host of pharmacological inhibitors to TEAD family paralogs have been developed, yet little is known as to the resistance mechanisms that might arise against this emerging therapeutic class. Here, we report that genetic augmentation of de novo coenzyme A biosynthesis desensitizes YAP-dependent cancer cells to treatment with TEAD inhibitors, an effect driven by increased levels of palmitoyl-CoA that outcompete drug for engagement of the lipid-binding pocket. This work uncovers a potential therapeutic resistance mechanism to TEAD palmitoylation site inhibition with implications for future combinatorial treatments in the clinic.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway is an important regulator of lineage segregation (trophectoderm and inner cell mass) during blastocyst formation in the mouse embryos. However, the role and regulation of Hippo signaling pathway components during bovine embryonic development is not completely understood. This study was thus designed to interpret the roles of Hippo cell signaling pathway components using two different yet specific chemical inhibitors (Cerivastatin and XMU-MP-1). A significant decrease in the blastocyst rates were observed on treatment with Cerivastatin and XMU-MP-1 inhibitors for the treatment groups, in comparison to the control groups. At the 8-cell stage, a significant decrease was observed in the gene expression and nuclear protein localization of YAP1 (Yes Associated Protein 1) and pYAP1 components of Hippo signaling pathway. However, no such effect of Cerivastatin treatment was observed on the localization of TAZ at this cell stage. On the contrary, during bovine blastocyst formation a significant decrease in the gene expression and nuclear localization of both YAP1 and TAZ suggest differences in the regulation of these components at 8-cell and blastocyst stages of embryonic development. Furthermore, XMU-MP-1 mediated chemical inhibition of Mst1 at the blastocyst stage also suggests differences in the regulation of Yap1 and Taz components of Hippo signaling pathway. Overall, this study indicates novel differences in the regulation of Hippo signaling transcript levels and protein localization between the 8-cell and blastocyst stages of bovine preimplantation embryonic development.

AB  - Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine are inevitable to be ingested together in the process of drinking green tea. This study used Caenorhabditis elegans as an organism model to examine whether the binding of EGCG and caffeine could influence the fat-reduction effect. The results revealed that EGCG significantly reduced the Nile Red fluorescence intensity and the triglyceride/protein ratio of the C. elegans obesity model by 14.7% and 16.5%, respectively, while the effect of caffeine was not significant. Moreover, the degree of reduction in fluorescence intensity and triglyceride/protein ratio by EGCG + caffeine was comparable to that of EGCG. In the exploration of underlying mechanism, we found that EGCG and EGCG + caffeine treatments had no influence on food intake and energy expenditure of C. elegans. Their fat-reduction effects were dependent on the regulation of lipogenesis, as shown by the decreased expression of the sbp-1, fat-7, and daf-16 genes.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the gelation properties of sodium caseinate prepared from camel milk casein micelles, and to confirm the effect of casein monomer composition on the acid-induced gels. The storage modulus of acid-induced gels from sodium caseinate improved by 21.87 times compared to camel milk. The firmness and WHC of camel milk acid gels were significantly increased from 8.74 f 0.32 g to 21.3 f 1.14 g and from 21.39 f 1.03 % to 73.84 f 2.08 %, respectively, as the casein changed from micelles into sodium caseinate. The network structure of camel sodium caseinate acid gels constituting of smaller casein clusters was denser than that of camel milk. These results suggested that casein monomer composition of camel milk casein was not the main reason for the failure to form acid gels. Our study provided new insights into the acid gelation of camel milk, showing the alternative way to solve the texture defects of camel yogurt products.

AB  - Growing evidence has revealed the potential risk of ambient particulate matter (PM) causing chronic toxic influence on the nervous system of humans; however, it remains unclear whether PM could exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD). PM2.5 possesses complex physicochemical properties and can trigger various chronic toxicological responses, which potentially correlate with the aggravation of AD pathogenesis. Herein, PM2.5 was found to be able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglial cells (BV2) through multiple approaches, leading to the release of ASC specks, which could accelerate A beta aggregation and promote neuronal apoptosis. After intranasal exposure to PM2.5 for 13 weeks, the hippocampus region of APP/PS1 mice showed the ASC speck release and A beta aggregation. In addition, the high concentration of PM2.5 could cause a marked neuronal hypocellularity and spatial memory ability deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These results suggest the intense correlation between PM2.5 and AD based on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe complication of sepsis and the leading cause of mortality. Although the role of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in stabilizing pulmonary homeostasis is well established, the effects of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) on AMs remain largely unknown. In this study, an investigation was conducted to map the miRNA and protein expression profiles of EVs derived from septic plasma. Notably, EV-based panels (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-223-3p, OLFM4, and LCN2) have been found to be associated with the severity or prognosis of sepsis, with promising AUC values. Moreover, the levels of LCN2, miR-122-5p, and miR-223-3p were identified as independent predictors of septic ARDS. The in vitro coculture results revealed that the effects of LPS-EVs from the plasma of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI), which carry pro-inflammatory EVs, were partly mediated by miR-223-3p, as evidenced by the promotion of inflammation, autophagy and ferroptosis in AMs. Mechanistically, the upregulation of miR-223-3p in LPS-EVs triggers autophagy and ferroptosis in AMs by activating Hippo signaling via the targeting of MEF2C. In vivo, the inhibition of miR-223-3p effectively mitigated LPS-EV-induced inflammation and AM death in the lungs, as well as histological lesions. Overall, miR-223-3p in LPS-EVs contributes to sepsis-induced ALI by priming AMs for autophagy and ferroptosis through the MEF2C/Hippo signaling pathway. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of plasma-AM interaction in sepsis-induced ALI, offering a plausible strategy for assessing septic progression and treating lung injury.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 10%. alpha-Enolase (ENO1) is a junction channel protein involved in tumor cell apoptosis and chemoresistance. However, the role of ENO1 in PC remains unclear. The expression and prognosis of ENO1 levels were determined in PC using public databases based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets. Cell viability, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), autophagy, apoptosis, and autophagy markers were examined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transmission electron microscope, flow cytometry assays, and immunoblot, respectively. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and TCGA data sets, we found that ENO1 was significantly enriched in PC tumor tissues, and high expression levels of ENO1 were associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Whereas ENO1 silencing suppressed proliferation, autophagy, and induced cell apoptosis in PC cells, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, knockdown of ENO1 enhanced cellular cytotoxicity of gemcitabine (GEM), as well as reducing the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway in vitro. YAP1 promoted autophagy and protected PC cells from GEM-induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, YAP1 overexpression attenuated the inhibition effects of ENO1 silencing. Our results suggest that ENO1 overexpression promotes cell growth and tumor progression by increasing the expression of YAP1 in PC. Further studies are required to understand the detailed mechanisms between ENO1 and YAP1 in PC.

AB  - BackgroundThe prevalence of depression in women is approximately twice that in men. Differences in androgens levels between men and women, due to gonadal differences, may be associated with the development of depression, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.MethodsWe evaluated the depressive phenotypes of female mice following low-dose androgen treatment using a variety of behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological experiments. The mRNA profile of hippocampal tissues from female mice treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was constructed through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed on the differentially expressed genes. The expression changes of candidate differential genes were verified in hippocampal tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Moreover, the mechanism of action of the DHEA-regulated differential gene (Avpr1a), which is involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, was determined in vitro.ResultsChronic DHEA treatment resulted in a distinct antidepressant phenotype and significantly enhanced neuronal excitability of the ventral hippocampal region of female mice. RNA-seq identified the crucial differentially expressed gene, Avpr1a. In vitro experiments showed that DHEA reduced levels of the AVP system. Additionally, ChIP-PCR experiments revealed that Avpr1a directly targets androgen receptor (AR). Cell function experiments demonstrated that DHEA can inhibit AVPR1a expression through AR in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect can be reversed by the androgen receptor antagonist (Flutamide).ConclusionAndrogens (DHEA) exert antidepressant effects by inhibiting the binding of Avpr1a to AR. The Avpr1a gene may serve as a new target for the treatment of depression in women.

TI  - The global-capitalist elephant in the room: how resilient peacebuilding hinders substantive transformation and undermines long-term peace prospects
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA  - English
AB  - This article reviews critical responses to recent academic debates on resilience and peacebuilding, with a focus on approaches that question the underlying logics of resilient peacebuilding in fundamental ways. It argues that, while resilience in peacebuilding lends agency and new policy direction to peacebuilding actors, enabling them to uphold the image of active global governance, this also helps to legitimize the existence and reproduction of dominant global-capitalist structures and practices that undermine long-term peacebuilding and give rise to risks of conflict and environmental disasters in the first place. We argue that this process hinders transformation away from an infinite growth economy by focusing on imminent systemic risks and solutions while ignoring potential normative-theoretical and practical-experiential alternatives to the global-capitalist frameworks at the heart of the problem.

AB  - This study aimed to prepare micro/nanocrystalline cellulose-loaded naringin (NAR) tablets and evaluate their neuro-protective/therapeutic potentials in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Micro/nanocellulose was prepared from different agro-wastes, and the different cellulose preparations were then used to formulate eight oral tablets of naringin micro/nanoparticles by direct compression. AD-like symptoms were induced in adult male Sprague Dawley rats by co-administration of 150 mg/kg AlCl3 and 300 mg/kg D-galactose (oral administration/one week), and NAR tablets were assessed for neuroprotective/therapeutic potentials in terms of behavioral changes, levels of neurodegenerative and inflammatory markers, brain redox status, neurotransmitter tones, and cortex/ hippocampus histopathological alterations. NAR treatments have significantly reversed the neurotoxic effect of AlCl3 as demonstrated by improved spatial and cognitive memory functions and promoted antioxidant defense mechanisms in treated AD animals. Also, the neurodegeneration was markedly restrained as reflected by marked histopathological enhancement, and prevention/amelioration of neuropsychiatric disorders, besides the restor-ative effect on dysregulated neurotransmitters tone. Both NAR tablet forms showed an overall higher amelio-rative effect compared to the DPZ reference drug. The formulated tablets represent promising neuroprotective/ therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The present study evaluated the antiseizure and neuroprotective effects of sodium houttuyfonate (SH), a derivative of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (H. cordata), in a kainic acid (KA)- induced seizure rat model and its underlying mechanism. Sprague Dawley rats were administered normal saline, SH (50 or 100 mg/kg), or carbamazepine (300 mg/kg) by oral gavage for seven consecutive days before the intraperitoneal administration of KA (15 mg/kg). SH showed antiseizure effects at a dose of 100 mg/kg; it prolonged seizure latency and decreased seizure scores. SH also significantly decreased neuronal loss in the hippocampi of KA-treated rats, which was associated with the prevention of glutamate level increase, the upregulation of glutamate reuptake-associated proteins (excitatory amino acid transporters 1-3), glutamate metabolism enzyme glutamine synthetase, the downregulation of the glutamate synthesis enzyme glutaminase, and significant alterations in the expression of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor) receptor subunits in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the effects of SH were similar to those of the antiseizure drug carbamazepine. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that SH has antiseizure effects on KA-induced seizures, possibly through the prevention of glutamatergic alterations. Our findings suggest that SH is a potential alternative treatment that may prevent seizures by preserving the normal glutamatergic system.

AB  - Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (Csrp2) has emerged as a key factor in controlling the phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. The phenotypic transition of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) is a pivotal step in developing airway remodeling during the onset of asthma. However, whether Csrp2 mediates the phenotypic transition of ASMCs in airway remodeling during asthma onset is undetermined. This work aimed to address the link between Csrp2 and the phenotypic transition of ASMCs evoked by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB in vitro. The overexpression or silencing of Csrp2 in ASMCs was achieved through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The expression of mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time-PCR. Protein levels were determined through Western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was detected by EdU assay and Calcein AM assays. Cell cycle distribution was assessed via fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. Cell migration was evaluated using the scratch-wound assay. The transcriptional activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was measured using the luciferase reporter assay. A decline in Csrp2 level occurred in PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs. Increasing Csrp2 expression repressed the PDGF-BB-evoked proliferation and migration of ASMCs. Moreover, increasing Csrp2 expression impeded the phenotypic change of PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs from a contractile phenotype into a synthetic/proliferative phenotype. On the contrary, the opposite effects were observed in Csrp2-silenced ASMCs. The activity of YAP/TAZ was elevated in PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs, which was weakened by Csrp2 overexpression or enhanced by Csrp2 silencing. The YAP/TAZ activator could reverse Csrp2-overexpression-mediated suppression of the PDGF-BB-evoked phenotypic switching of ASMCs, while the YAP/TAZ suppressor could dimmish Csrp2-silencing-mediated enhancement on PDGF-BB-evoked phenotypic switching of ASMCs. In summary, Csrp2 serves as a determinant for the phenotypic switching of ASMCs. Increasing Csrp2 is able to impede PDGF-BB-evoked phenotypic change of ASMCs from a synthetic phenotype into a synthetic/proliferative phenotype through the effects on YAP/TAZ. This work implies that Csrp2 may be a key player in airway remodeling during the onset of asthma.
   This study reported that Csrp2 plays a crucial role in the phenotypic transition of ASMCs. Overexpression of Crsp2 repressed the phenotypic change of PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs from a contractile phenotype into a synthetic/proliferative phenotype through inhibition of YAP/TAZ. Given that the phenotypic transformation of ASMCs plays a critical role in the development of airway remodeling in asthma, the Crsp2-regulated YAP/TAZ pathway may represent a critical mechanism for the pathogenesis of asthma. Therefore, therapeutic approaches target and promote Csrp2 expression may have potential applications in treatment of asthma in the future.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is characterized by impairments in cerebral blood flow (CBF), endothelial function and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. These processes are all physiologically regulated by the nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cGMP signaling pathway. Additionally, cGMP signaling plays an important role in long-term potentiation (LTP) underlying memory formation. Therefore, targeting the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway may be a therapeutic strategy for treating VCI. Hence, in this study we investigated whether sGC stimulator vericiguat has potential as a cognitive enhancer. The effects of vericiguat on long-term memory were measured in rats using an object location task. Due to the low brain-penetrance of vericiguat found in this study, it was investigated whether in the absence of BBB limitations, vericiguat enhanced hippocampal plasticity using an ex vivo memory acquisition-like chemical LTP model. Finally, peripheral effects were measured by means of blood pressure and cerebral blood volume. Vericiguat successfully enhanced long-term memory and increased hippocampal plasticity via enhanced translocation of oc-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors to the cell membrane, while blood pressure and cerebral blood volume were unaltered. Although the memory enhancing effects in this study are likely due to peripheral effects on the cerebral microvasculature, sGC stimulation may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating VCI, especially when BBB integrity is reduced.

AB  - International learning opportunities for students are sometimes framed as merely tourist experiences. Yet, short-term study abroad programs have the potential to significantly impact students' understanding of themselves as global citizens and contributors to conservation and sustainability efforts. In this study, we investigated a workshop bringing university students together with local farmers to design deterrents for keeping elephants out of farmers' fields in northern Botswana. With faculty mentors, students from four universities collectively designed and built prototypes of locally-feasible solutions that could mitigate human-elephant conflict in the Okavango Delta region. We present students' perceptions, experiences, and learning during and resulting from the workshop, including the differences between students' expectations prior to the workshop and the actual experience, and the qualities of global citizenship gained by partnering students with local people. Findings reveal the workshop's successes include workshop attendees' cross-cultural collaboration, applications of design-thinking and problem-solving to address local challenges in relevant ways, important cultural learning experiences for all participants, and co-created prototypes of machines and devices for local farmers to test and implement.

AB  - Patients with monoallelic bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) mutations showed intellectual disability. The hippocampus has essential roles in learning and memory. Our previous work indicated that Brpf1 was specifically and strongly expressed in the hippocampus from the perinatal period to adulthood. We hypothesized that mouse Brpf1 plays critical roles in the morphology and function of hippocampal neurons, and its deficiency leads to learning and memory deficits. To test this, we performed immunofluorescence, whole-cell patch clamp, and mRNA-Seq on shBrpf1-infected primary cultured hippocampal neurons to study the effect of Brpf1 knockdown on neuronal morphology, electrophysiological characteristics, and gene regulation. In addition, we performed stereotactic injection into adult mouse hippocampus to knock down Brpf1 in vivo and examined the learning and memory ability by Morris water maze. We found that mild knockdown of Brpf1 reduced mEPSC frequency of cultured hippocampal neurons, before any significant changes of dendritic morphology showed. We also found that Brpf1 mild knockdown in the hippocampus showed a decreasing trend on the spatial learning and memory ability of mice. Finally, mRNA-Seq analyses showed that genes related to learning, memory, and synaptic transmission (such as C1ql1, Gpr17, Htr1d, Glra1, Cxcl10, and Grin2a) were dysregulated upon Brpf1 knockdown. Our results showed that Brpf1 mild knockdown attenuated hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced spatial learning and memory ability, which helps explain the symptoms of patients with BRPF1 mutations.</p>

AB  - Rhinoviruses (RVs) are major causes of the common cold, but they can also trigger exacerbations of asthma. More than 160 different RV strains exist and can be classified into three genetic species (RV-A, RV-B and RV-C) which bind to different receptors on human cells including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or the cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3). Epitopes located in the RV capsid have mainly been determined for RV2, a minor-group RV-A strain binding to LDLR, and for RV14, a major-group RV-B strain binding to ICAM-1. In order to study epitopes involved in the neutralization of RV89, an ICAM-1-binding RV-A strain which is highly different from RV2 and RV14 in terms of receptor specificity and sequence, respectively, we analyzed the specificity and epitopes of a highly neutralizing antiserum using recombinantly produced RV89 capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4), recombinant fragments and synthetic overlapping peptides thereof. We found that the antiserum which neutralized in vitro RV89 infection up to a dilution of 1:24,000 reacted with the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 but not with VP3 and VP4. The neutralizing antibodies recognized recombinant fragments comprising approximately 100 amino acids of the N- and C-terminus of VP1 and the middle part of VP2, in particular, three peptides which, according to molecular modeling based on the three-dimensional structure of RV16, were surface-exposed on the viral capsid. Two recombinant fusion proteins containing the identified peptides fused to hepatitis B (HBV)-derived preS as a carrier protein induced upon immunization of rabbits antibodies capable of neutralizing in vitro RV89 infections. Interestingly, the virus-neutralizing epitopes determined for RV89 corresponded to those determined for minor-group RV2 binding to LDL and major-group RV14 belonging to the RV-B species, which are highly different from RV89. Our results indicate that highly different RV strains, even when reacting with different receptors, seem to engage similar parts of their capsid in the infection process. These results may be important for the design of active and passive immunization strategies for RV.
