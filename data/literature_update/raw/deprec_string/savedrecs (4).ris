AB  - This study highlights the potential of grass-legume intercropping systems in enhancing soil carbon sequestration and cycling nutrients, providing ecological support for sustainable agriculture. This study evaluated the chemical composition and root biomass of signal grass (Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk) pasture grown in monoculture or intercropped with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Belmonte) under different row spacings (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 cm), 4-5 years after establishment. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replicates under intermittent sheep grazing. Results (p < 0.05) indicated that root biomass was higher in the intercropped pastures (6752 to 11,167 kg OM ha(-1)) than in the monoculture (3696 kg OM ha(-1)). Carbon (C) and N stored in root biomass were also influenced by the row spacings, with narrower spacings, particularly 40 cm (1282 kg C ha(-1)) and 50 cm (1424 kg C ha(-1)), showing higher C storage than in the monoculture (509 kg C ha(-1)). Similarly, the 40 cm (122 kg N ha(-1)) and 50 cm (138 kg N ha(-1)) spacings showed higher N accumulation in root biomass than the monoculture (38.9 kg N ha(-1)). These spacing also reduced C/N and lignin/ADIN ratios, which enhanced nitrogen cycling efficiency. Based on these results, 40 and 50 cm spacings are recommended for intercropped pastures, as they optimize C and N accumulation and nutrient cycling, and support sustainable pasture management.

AB  - Leizhou goats can be classified into tall and short types based on their size and habits. The tall Leizhou goats are well-suited for grazing management due to their robust physique, while the dwarf types are smaller, grow rapidly, and are more appropriate for feeding management systems. In this study, whole-genome resequencing was conducted to identify genomic variants in 15 Tall-legged (TL) and 15 Short-legged (SL) Leizhou goats, yielding 8,641,229 high-quality SNPs in the Leizhou goat genome. Phylogenetic tree and principal component analyses revealed obvious genetic differentiation between the two groups. Fst and theta pi analyses identified 420 genes in the TL group and 804 genes in the SL group. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated that the phosphatidylinositol signaling system is associated with growth and development. Additionally, Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) analysis identified eight genes linked to leg length, including B4GALT7 and NR1D1. Notably, the NC_030818.1 (g.53666634T > C) variant was significantly associated with leg length traits, where the CC genotype was linked to shorter legs and the TT genotype to longer legs. This study identifies candidate genes and molecular markers, serving as a reference point for breeding and genetic improvement efforts in Leizhou goats and other goat breeds.

AB  - The costs of production for high density protein and the impacts food production have on the environment are becoming increasingly important issues in animal agriculture. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of novel thermal profiles including a Thermal Efficiency Index (TEI) on the ability to identify efficient animals in a fraction of the time and at a significantly lower cost of conventional feed station and performance technology. Three hundred and fourty four high performance Duroc sires from a genetic nucleus herd were used in the study. The animals were monitored for feed consumption and growth performance using conventional feed station technology for a 72 day period. Animals were monitored in these stations between approximately 50 kg and 130 kg live body weight. An infrared thermal scan was performed on the animals at the end of the performance test by collecting automated dorsal thermal images and using these biometrics to measure both bio-surveillance values and a thermal phenotypic profile including the TEI (mean dorsal temperature /body weight (0.75)). The thermal profile values were significantly correlated (r = 0.40, P < 0.0001) with a current industry best practice for performance in Residual Intake and Gain (RIG). The data from the current study suggest these rapid, real time, cost effective values for TEI constitute a useful precision farming tool for the animal industries to reduce the cost of production and green house gas (GHG) impact for high density protein production.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a pervasive environmental contaminant, elicits adverse effects on sperm functions, including sperm motility and capacitation status. However, the specific mechanisms by which PFOA disrupts sperm functions during capacitation remain poorly elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the PFOA-induced inhibition of sperm motility and capacitation in boar spermatozoa by focusing on Ras-related (Rab) proteins, which regulate membrane trafficking and play key roles in male sperm development, acrosome formation, and the acrosome reaction. Results showed significant reductions in sperm motility and various kinematic parameters following PFOA exposure. Correlation analysis revealed that Rab14 was positively correlated with dance mean (DNM) and negatively correlated with wobble (WOB), indicating that PFOA might affect sperm motility through Rab14 and potentially lead to reduced pregnancy rates. Differences in Rab25 were positively correlated with differences in total motility (MOT), progressive motility (PRG), linearity (LIN), and mean angular displacement (MAD), suggesting that PFOA might influence sperm motility by altering Rab25. Differences in Rab34 were positively correlated with differences in acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, implicating its role in the acrosome reaction. These findings provided insights into the molecular mechanism of PFOA-induced reproductive toxicity and highlighted the function of Rab proteins as biomarkers for the assessment of the effects of similar environmental toxins on male fertility.

AB  - The threat to sheep welfare of heat stress when pastured outdoors in the summer, particularly without access to shade, has been underinvestigated. This may be of importance not only in hot climates, but also during the summer months in cooler climates. This study considered whether, in the moderately warm conditions of a northern European summer, sheep will access shade of they have access to it, and if sheep with no access to shade in a northern European summer show behaviours indicative of poor welfare, including measures of panting scores and other indicators of heat stress. There were twelve sheep in each of the groups, the control group (NS) or the treatment group with the possibility to access shade (SH). Respiration rates and panting scores were recorded for each sheep in each group twice each day. Other behaviours were also recorded at the individual animal level. In the SH group, the numbers of sheep in the shaded areas were also noted. Climatic data on observation days was collected. Respiration rates were significantly higher at higher panting scores (p < 0.001). Higher panting scores were recorded for NS sheep than for SH sheep (p < 0.001), as were breath intensities (p < 0.001). The behaviour of open mouth with tongue extended was not observed in the SH group but was observed in the NS group. SH sheep ruminated more (p = 0.011) than the NS sheep, while NS sheep stood panting more than the SH sheep (p = 0.001). Indicators of heat stress, respiration rates and panting scores, were more strongly correlated to air temperature and weather conditions in the NS group compared to the SH group, and these were significant. The number of animals observed to be in the shade in the SH group was positively correlated with air temperature. Panting score can therefore be used as a reliable measure for estimating respiration rate and heat stress in sheep. Sheep, even in northern Europe, can suffer from heat stress, particularly when given no access to shade, and shade from the sun should be provided for sheep at pasture.

AB  - The calcium-calcineurin and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathways play crucial roles in fungal development, pathogenicity, and in responses to various environmental stresses. However, interaction of these pathways in regulating fungicide sensitivity remains largely unknown in phytopathogenic fungi. In this study, we investigated the function of the calcium-calcineurin signalling pathway in Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight. Inhibitors of Ca2+ and calcineurin enhanced antifungal activity of tebuconazole (an azole fungicide) against F. graminearum. Deletion of the putative downstream transcription factor FgCrz1 resulted in significantly increased sensitivity of F. graminearum to tebuconazole. FgCrz1-GFP was translocated to the nucleus upon tebuconazole treatment in a calcineurin-dependent manner. In addition, deletion of FgCrz1 increased the phosphorylation of FgHog1 in response to tebuconazole. Moreover, the calcium-calcineurin and HOG signalling pathways exhibited synergistic effect in regulating pathogenicity and sensitivity of F. graminearum to tebuco-nazole and multiple other stresses. RNA-seq data revealed that FgCrz1 regulated expression of a set of non-CYP51 genes that are associated with tebuconazole sensitivity, including multidrug transporters, membrane lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, and cell wall organization. Our findings demonstrate that the calcium-calcineurin and HOG pathways act coordinately to orchestrate tebuconazole sensitivity and pathogenicity in F. graminearum, which may provide novel insights in management of Fusarium disease.

AB  - The Srivilliputhur Elephant Reserve is one of India's 32 elephant reserves. It is home to wild elephants as well as other wildlife. This study aims to document the fodder plants and foraging behaviour of elephants in the Srivilliputhur Elephant Reserve. Elephants in the Srivilliputhur Elephant Reserve consumed 61 plant species from 25 different families. In the current study, the majority of the fodder plants of Asian Elephants belonged to the families of Fabaceae, Poaceae, and Malvaceae. Elephants were found to feed more frequently on trees (66%), followed by shrubs (16%), herbs (9%), and climbers (6%). It was observed that the elephants ate both the browsing tree and grazing grass species during the wet season, but browsing tree species dominated during the dry season.

AB  - Parental environments have profound consequences for offspring fitness through transgenerational transmission of resources and epigenetic factors. Locomotor activity is a functional trait of considerable ecological importance, as it determines the ability of animals to find food and mates and to disperse to more favourable environments. Although there have been studies demonstrating that animals can plastically increase their locomotor capacity in response to nutritionally stressful environments, it remains largely unexplored whether and how parental diet can adjust offspring locomotor capacity and its related traits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the parental intake of a nutritionally suboptimal diet would induce hyperactivity in the offspring and that this transgenerational effect could lead to improved offspring performance in an insect herbivore, the bean bug (Riptortus pedestris Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae). We compared the locomotor activity, metabolic phenotype and performance traits of two groups of R. pedestris nymphs born to parents raised on soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr, Fabaceae; standard diet] or peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L., Fabaceae; high-fat diet). Despite being smaller at birth, the offspring of peanut-fed parents moved faster and more frequently than those of soybean-fed parents during their early development. The newly hatched offspring born to peanut-fed parents had higher relative energy reserves in somatic tissues than those born to soybean-fed parents, indicating that differential parental provisioning could underpin this parental effect on offspring locomotor activity. Possibly through increased foraging activity, the hyperactive offspring of peanut-fed parents grew faster into heavier adults than the offspring of soybean-fed parents, implying that parentally induced increase in offspring locomotor activity is adaptive. This study provides experimental evidence for diet-mediated transgenerational plasticity of locomotor activity in invertebrates and sheds novel insights into the role of parental diet history in shaping offspring phenotype.

AB  - Molybdenum (Mo) and cadmium (Cd), well-defined hazardous pollutants in the environment, exhibit potential toxic effects on liver tissues by inducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. This study aims to investigate the role of the Sam50-MICOS-ATAD3-mtDNA axis in mediating the inflammatory response in liver inflammation induced by co-exposure to Mo and Cd in sheep, as well as the protective effects of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC). The findings indicated that co-exposure to Mo and Cd induced cellular degeneration, rupture of hepatic mitochondrial membranes and mitochondrial dysfunction that was accompanied by the levels of ATP, SDH and GSH-Px reduced in the sheep liver tissue. Furthermore, the co-exposure downregulated the expression levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins (Sam50, MICOS and ATAD3) and degree of co-localization between Sam50 and Mic60. In addition, co-exposure to Mo and Cd elicited an increase in mtDNA content and promoted the upregulation of inflammation-related factor levels, which resulted in an augmentation of TNF-alpha, CRP, and IL-18 contents. However, OPC alleviated the above changes induced by the combination of Mo and Cd. In conclusion, co-exposure to Mo and Cd decreases mtDNA stability by disrupting the Sam50-MICOS-ATAD3 axis, thereby inducing liver inflammation in sheep.

AB  - An experiment in the field was performed to assess the impacts of simple compost, vermicompost, and NP fertilizer application on the morpho-physiological, biochemical, and yield characteristics of wheat in order to optimize nutrient needs. All the estimation was performed relying on various parameters viz. plant height, leaf area, N, P, K contents of leaf, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, membrane stability index, relative water contents, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic rate, osmotic potential, water potential, canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, total tillers of crop, length of spike, per spike spikelets number, grains numbers per spike, weight of 1000 grains, economic yield, biological yield and harvest index of wheat. The vermicompost application alone increased growth and productivity, but combining vermicompost with chemical fertilizer is highly desirable for wheat production. It was concluded from this study that 50% vermicompost (produced from FYM, rice and wheat straw) mixed with 50% recommended fertilizers showed excellent results. While, 25% vermicompost (produced from rice straw, wheat straw and cow dung) and 25% compost (produced from cow manure, rice straw and wheat straw) mixed with 50% recommended fertilizers showed intermediate results whereas, compost (produced from cow manure, rice straw and wheat straw) and control (recommended fertilizers) showed minimum results in wheat crop and soil fertility decreased in T0 treatment.

AB  - A new path for rhinoceros (rhino) conservation is needed. Recent data signal the alarming impact of poaching on populations in Africa's rhino stronghold, the state-run Kruger National Park (South Africa), which today supports one quarter the rhinos than a decade ago. We aggregated African rhino population data, highlighting the growing role of private and community rhino custodians, who likely now conserve >50% of Africa's rhinos. Their contribution has been enabled by a supportive policy and economic environment, but this arrangement is becoming more difficult to sustain as costs associated with protecting rhinos skyrocket and revenue-generating options become insufficient. Some privately held rhino populations are small or intensively managed, raising questions about their conservation value. As the role of private and community custodianship becomes increasingly central to the protection of Africa's remaining rhinos, its resilience must be strengthened through implementation of adaptive policies that incentivize rhino conservation. We outline policy pathways to provide an enabling environment for rhino conservation beyond state parks.

AB  - Simple Summary The transition period is largely marked by a decline in dry matter intake (DMI) that often leads to a negative energy balance (NEB) which, along with exaggerated insulin resistance (IR), increasing the mobilization of body fat reserves, leads to higher blood non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and/or beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) concentrations. These confounding factors adversely affect animal health and lactation performance. This study evaluated the impact of pre- and post-partum berberine (BBR) supplementation as a novel approach to the regulation of nutritional metabolism in transition dairy goats. In summary, BBR supplementation (2 and 4 g/d) elevated the DMI and energy balance (EB) in pre- and post-partum goats, as well as enhancing liver activity indices, showing the potential of the new therapeutic strategy in the prevention of metabolic dysfunction in transition dairy goats and in attaining an improved lactation performance as well as health. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the alleviating effects of the isoquinoline alkaloid berberine (BBR) on the energy balance (EB), glucose and insulin metabolism, and liver functionality in transition dairy goats, as reflected by blood metabolites and enzymes. Twenty-four primiparous Saanen goats were randomly allocated to four groups. Goats in each group received, ad libitum, the same basal diet during the pre- and post-partum periods of evaluation. Goats received daily0, 1, 2, or 4 g BBR (coded as CON, BBR1, BBR2, and BBR4, respectively). Dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were recorded daily. Blood samples were collected on days -21, -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, and 21 relative to kidding, and individual body condition scores (BCSs) were also recorded. Supplementation with either BBR2 or BBR4 increased (p < 0.05) pre- and post-partum DMI, increasing (p < 0.05) the intakes of net energy for lactating and metabolizable proteins. BBR2 and BBR4 increased (p < 0.05) post-partum milk production as well as fat-corrected milk (FCM), energy-corrected milk (ECM), and feed efficiency, indicating the alleviating effect of BBR on the negative energy balance (NEB) in transition goats. The daily ingestion of either 2 or 4 g BBR reduced (p < 0.05) plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased (p < 0.05) the dynamic change in the liver activity index (LAI) and liver functionality index (LFI), implying its hepatoprotective effect on transition goats. Overall, the results suggest that BBR supplementation of at least 2 g/d may help to ameliorate insulin resistance (IR) and fat metabolism disorders initiated by the NEB in transition dairy goats.

AB  - One molluscan autapomorphy is the radula, the organ used for feeding. Here, for the first time, the performance and failure of taenioglossan radular teeth were tested in a biomechanical experiment which in turn allowed building hypotheses about tooth functionalities. Shear load was applied to tooth cusps with a force transducer until structural failure occurred, the broken area was measured, and finally breaking stress was calculated. These experiments were carried out under dry and wet conditions. Our results show that certain tooth types can resist higher stresses and are rather specialised to loosen food items from a surface, whereas other teeth can only gather food particles. The experiments additionally illustrate the high influence of the water content on the resulting breaking stress. When wet teeth were tested, their ductility and ability to avoid being fractured by an obstacle increased. Their flexibility also allowed them support from teeth of adjacent tooth rows, which made the whole system less prone to failure. Our results were compared with the previous data on the mechanical properties and feeding simulations. This study provides a keystone for further comparative studies aiming at connecting diversity of radulae with their possible adaptations to the ingesta.

AB  - Invasive species often dominate new environments and alter ecosystem diversity and function. Two key mechanisms proposed to explain this success are the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH), which suggests that invasive species escape their natural enemies, and the Novel Weapons Hypothesis (NWH), which posits that they possess unique biochemical traits that give them a competitive advantage over native species. Here, we tested the induced defense responses in a highly invasive plant, Sphagneticola trilobata, against the pathogenic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani) and a lace bug herbivore (Corythucha marmorata). The endogenous contents of five hormones: Jasmonic acid (JA), Ethylene (ET), Salicylic acid (SA), Abscisic acid (ABA), and Gibberellic acid (GA) after treatment with either pathogen or herbivore showed higher hormone levels against pathogen and lower levels against herbivore. Further, expression analyses with 17 (nine JA and eight ET pathway) genes were tested against each pathogen and herbivore treatment. In particular, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) branch of the JA pathway is induced for necrotrophic pathogen. Whereas, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein (MYC2) branch is induced for herbivore. The differential hormone levels and expression between treatments could be due to different mode of infection mechanisms used by the fungus (necrotrophy) and an insect (piercing and sucking). Specifically, S. trilobata enhance defenses in the invaded area, and these defenses differ between responses to a pathogen and herbivore. Furthermore, our study further confirms that S. trilobata do not reduce their investment in defenses due to a lack of enemies. It may be an adaptation mechanism to fine-tune their defense mechanism while encountering multiple stresses during invasion process of S. trilobata, particularly against local natural enemies.

AB  - Dioecious plants can exhibit sexual dimorphism across a suite of plant traits, including susceptibility to herbivory and secondary chemistry. One hypothesis is that because of greater costs of reproduction in females, males should grow faster and invest less in defense, resulting in male-biased herbivory. Indeed, a series of articles and a prominent meta-analysis have established male-biased herbivory as a rule. However, more recent reviews have raised questions about how general the pattern is, citing the low breadth of taxon sampling. The literature on this topic has not been formally quantified by meta-analysis in over 15 years. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of studies that measured sex bias in either herbivory and/or secondary defense in 71 dioecious plant species. We added 58 observations of herbivory and 41 of secondary chemistry to the original. We control for nonindependence of effects from the same study and taxonomic group to address critiques of earlier studies. For secondary chemistry, we found no support for any consistent difference between male and female plants. For herbivory, results are directionally similar to earlier reports, although not statistically significant once we accounted for taxonomic group and study. We also found that earlier studies reported stronger male bias than more recent studies. We discuss our results in light of the decline effect, where the magnitude of a described effect declines as the number of observations increases, and consider whether the data sets exhibit signs of evidence of the type(s) of biases that can result in declining effect sizes over time.

AB  - In 2005, 3 wildlife underpasses were installed on a section of U.S. Highway 64 in Washington County, North Carolina, USA, with a 3 m tall, chain link exclusion fence passing under the road and extending >= 800 m from each underpass in both directions and parallel to the highway. Over time, the fencing developed gaps, potentially reducing the efficacy of the underpasses. From 2019 to 2021 we monitored wildlife activity using passive infrared cameras at the underpasses and 15 gaps in the fencing. Our goals were to determine differences in species' use of the fence gaps vs. underpasses and what factors influence wildlife gap-use behaviors. Wildlife gap-use behaviors were species-specific. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and black bears (Ursus americanus) had >50% of their observed events using the underpasses, while canids, aquatic mammals, rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus and S. palustris), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) were detected >50% of their events using the gaps. All species/taxonomic groups were observed using the gaps in the fencing. When detected below the underpasses, all taxonomic groups except aquatic mammals were observed on the outside, or roadside, side of the fence. We regressed species, season, year, gap size, gap distance from underpass, and frequency a species was walking parallel to the fence to the proportion of events a species was observed on the roadside of the fence with the highway. Our regression model (F 9,947 = 16.23, P < 0.001) indicated that groups used the gaps at different rates. We observed approximately a 19% decrease in gap use between 2019 and 2021. Additionally, the percentage of events where animals were observed walking parallel to the fence on the safe side-without passing through the gap-was positively correlated with gap use at 0.03. Animals tended to use gaps associated with underpasses that had wider horizontal clearances as opposed to gaps near underpasses with narrower horizontal clearances. Similarly, animals used gaps that had taller vertical clearances more than gaps with shorter vertical clearances. Wildlife exclusion fence maintenance is often neglected, and post-construction studies generally focus on crossing structures. When fencing is left unattended, gaps can develop, creating the potential for more wildlife-vehicle collisions. Our study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and maintenance of wildlife crossings and fencing designs, emphasizing their implications for effective and safe animal movement.

In addition T. gondii and Brucella spp. are of public health concern because of their zoonotic potentials. In Egypt and other countries, toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, and brucellosis are three well-known etiological agents of infectious abortion in many farm animals including sheep and goats. Inaccurate diagnosis of the abortion cause results in great economic losses because of application of inappropriate control measures. In the current study, we provided the first report on the comparative seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis, neosporosis and brucellosis in sheep and goats in Egypt based on antibody detection. We found that the overall seroprevalence rate was the highest for T. gondii. Nevertheless, only antibodies to Brucella spp. were associated with recent abortion in sheep and goats. Our study provides solid data on the existence of abortifacient agents in the common small ruminants in Egypt. Accordingly, these data can be exploited in developing more efficient control policies against such serious infections. Toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, and brucellosis are devastating diseases causing infectious abortion and, therefore, substantial economic losses in farm animals. Toxoplasmosis and neosporosis are caused by the intracellular protozoan parasites Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and Neospora caninum (N. caninum), respectively. Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by numerous Brucella species in multiple hosts. Toxoplasmosis and brucellosis are also considered foodborne zoonotic diseases. In the current study, specific antibodies to T. gondii and N. caninum, in addition to those to Brucella spp., were detected to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological situation for these three pathogens. Sheep and goat sera from Egypt (n = 360) of animals with and without a history of abortion were tested using commercial ELISAs. Seropositivity rates of 46.1%, 11.9%, and 8.6% for T. gondii, N. caninum, and Brucella spp., respectively, were revealed. Mixed infections with T. gondii and Brucella spp. (4.4%), T. gondii and N. caninum (4.2%), N. caninum and Brucella spp. (1.4%), and even some triple infections (0.6%) have been observed. Animals with a history of abortion had a significantly higher seroprevalence for Brucella spp. infection than those without abortion (12.6%; 28/222 vs. 2.2%; 3/138) (p = 0.0005; Odds ratio = 1.9-21.8), while none of the other pathogens showed a similar effect. This result suggests brucellosis as a possible cause of abortion in the study population. However, the high seroprevalence for T. gondii and N. caninum revealed in our study warrants further investigations.

AB  - The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to public health. Antimicrobials are used in animal production and human medicine, which contribute to the circulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Wildlife can be reservoirs of pathogens and resistant bacteria. Furthermore, anthropogenic pressure can influence their resistome. This work aimed to study the AMR of the faecal microbiome of red deer, one of the most important game species in Europe. To this end, a high-throughput qPCR approach was employed to screen a high number of ARGs and the antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria was determined. Several genes that confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics were identified, with the most abundant being tetracycline ARGs. Other genes were also present that are considered current and future threats to human health, and some of these were relatively abundant. Multidrug-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were isolated, although the overall level of antibiotic resistance was low. These results highlight the pressing need to know the origin and transmission of AMR in wildlife. Thus, and considering the One Health concept, studies such as this one shows the need for surveillance programs to prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains and ARGs.

AB  - The Canyon of Caprera (Mediterranean Sea) hosts high biodiversity, including threatened filter-feeding vertebrates such as the basking shark and fin whale. Due to their elusive nature, mobility and conservation status, direct contaminant assessment in these species is often challenging. To address this limitation, the present study focuses on zooplankton, an essential prey and bioindicator, to indirectly assess the levels of persistent organic pollutants and trace elements (TEs) in their feeding grounds. This approach provides a noninvasive method to estimate potential pollutant exposure in vulnerable megafauna and to evaluate the associated risks of pollutant transfer through the food web. Zooplankton samples accumulated mean PCB and DDT levels of 31.3 +/- 17.5 ng g-1 and 19.8 +/- 15.3 ng g-1 dry weight (dw), respectively. Regarding TEs, zooplankton exhibited high levels of essential TEs (e.g., Fe 778 +/- 640 mg kg-1 dw), while nonessential TEs were found in lower concentrations (e.g., Hg 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1 dw). Potential daily pollutant intake by the filter-feeding species was estimated using published zooplankton consumption rates, highlighting a significant pathway for contaminant transfer. Zooplankton contaminant levels exceeded the Environmental Quality Standard for Hg and the Maximum Allowable Limits established for foodstuff for Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, suggesting potential risk for the aquatic environment, with implications for zooplankton feeders. These results demonstrate the utility of zooplankton as a noninvasive proxy for contaminant exposure in threatened marine megafauna and highlight the importance of monitoring pollution in key Mediterranean habitats.

AB  - Simple Summary Indigenous communities are a large resource of increasingly endangered, traditionally used medicinal plants and the associated ecological knowledge, which needs to be documented quickly as the base to establish sustainable livelihoods and healthcare systems. Through the interaction of indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and the surrounding environment, these communities have developed their livelihoods over time. In this study, we tried to obtain an in-depth understanding of ethnomedicinal, cultural, and ritual perspectives on plant diversity in the Ladakh region and evaluated how the wild flora of Ladakh could improve local livelihoods and alleviate poverty. By surveying and applying open- and close-ended semi-structured interviews and group discussions in three communities, we documented 105 ethnobotanically important plants belonging to 39 families. The Balti and Brokpa ethnic groups showed greater similarity, whereas the least overlap in plant use was observed between Beda and Brokpa. Plants common to all cultures were mostly used for medicinal applications, while some were also used for religious purposes in the two major religions (Islam and Buddhism). A total of 37 species were shared by all cultures (Balti, Brokpa, and Beda). The cluster analysis elucidated three major clusters of different ethnobotanical usage. The first cluster included food and medicinal plants, the second included clusters of dye and flavor plants, and the third included plants used for fragrance, oil, fuel wood, and fodder. Plant parts were collected based on their availability in distinct pheno-phases according to the Tibetan traditional calendar. This study's findings revealed that plants provide tangible economic benefits to indigenous communities, in addition to aiding in the treatment of various ailments. Sustainable use and management of wild resources can help improve livelihoods and food security and alleviate poverty. The nomadic pastoral indigenous communities of the Ladakhi people share roots with Tibetan culture in terms of food, clothing, religion, festivals, and habits, and rely widely on plant resources for survival and livelihood. This survey was conducted during 2019-2021 to document the indigenous knowledge about plant resources of the Balti, Beda, and Brokpa communities of the Ladakh region, trans-Himalayas. Open- and close-ended semi-structured interviews (N = 184) and group discussions (N = 17) were used to collect the data. Quantitative data was further analyzed using various statistical tools. A total of 105 plant species belonging to 82 genera and 39 families were used as medicine, fuel wood, fragrance, oil, food, flavor, fodder, decoration, and dye. Among these, medicinal use was most prevalent, with 70% of use reports, followed by fodder and fuel wood. Leaves (27%) were the most preferred plant part used, followed by roots and flowers. The principal component analysis revealed five clusters of ethnobotanical usage, i.e., food, medicine, fuel wood, fodder, and fragrance, oil, dye, and flavor. The maximum number of plant species used was reported by the Brokpa, while the Beda reported the minimum number of plant species uses. Delphinium brunonianum, Waldheimia tomentosa, and Juniperus indica played a significant role in the cultural and religious ritual aspects, whereas Allium przewalskianum, Waldheimia tomentosa, Juniperus indica, and Hippophae rhamnoides were commonly used as a livelihood source among Ladakhi communities.
   The local people collected most plants (65%) for self-consumption, while the rest (35%) were sold in markets as a source of income. The sustainable utilization and management of plant resources by local people is a strategy to boost livelihoods and food security and alleviate poverty.

AB  - Plant-herbivore coevolutionary interactions have led to a range of plant defenses that minimize insect damage and a suite of counter adaptations that allow herbivores to feed on defended plants. Consuming plant secondary compounds results in herbivore growth and developmental costs but can have beneficial effects such as deterrence or harm of parasitoid enemies. Therefore, the role of secondary compounds on herbivore fitness must be considered in the context of the abundance and level of harm from natural enemies and the costs herbivores incur feeding on plant secondary compounds. In this study, I combined field measurements of Cotesia congregata wasp parasitism pressure with detailed measurements of the costs of plant secondary compounds across developmental stages in the herbivore host, Manduca sexta. I show that C. congregata parasitoids exert large negative selective pressures, killing 31%-57% of M. sexta larvae in the field. Manduca sexta developed fastest during instars most at risk for parasitoid oviposition but growth was slowed by consumption of plant secondary compounds. The negative effects of consuming plant secondary compounds as larvae influenced adult size traits but there were no immune, survival, or fecundity costs. These results suggest that developmental costs experienced by M. sexta herbivores consuming defensive compounds are minor in comparison to the strong negative survival pressures from abundant parasitoid enemies.

AB  - To date, the determination of sulfonamide metabolites in animal-derived food has universal disadvantages of low throughput and no integrated metabolites involved. In this study, a powerful and reliable strategy for high-throughput screening of sulfonamide metabolites in goat meat was proposed based on an aqueous two-phase separation procedure (ATPS) combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap). Noncovalent interactions including van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic effect were determined to be staple interactions between the sulfonamide metabolites and sheep serum albumin by fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking technology, and an 80% acetonitrile-water solution/(NH4)(2)SO4 was used as ATPS in order to release combined sulfonamide metabolites and minimize the influence of sheep serum albumin. Sulfonamide metabolites in the matrix were screened based on a mechanism of mass natural loss and core structure followed by identification combined with the pharmacokinetic. The developed strategy was validated according to EU standard 2002/657/EC with CC alpha ranging from 0.07 to 0.98 mu g kg(-1), accuracy recovery with 84-107%, and RSDs lower than 8.9%. Eighty seven goat meat samples were used for determination of 26 sulfonamides and 8 potential metabolites. On the basis of the established innovative process, this study has successfully implemented the comprehensive detection of sulfonamide metabolites, including N-4-acetylated substitution, N-4-hydroxylation, 4-nitroso, azo dimers, oxidized nitro, N-4 monoglucose conjugation, beta-D-glucuronide, and N-4-aminobenzenesulfonyl metabolites, which were shown to undergo oxidation, hydrogenation, sulfation, glucuronidation, glucosylation, and O-aminomethylation.

AB  - Simple Summary Footrot is an infectious hoof disease in sheep, caused by the bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus. The antigentic variation of the fimbrial proteins resulted in the description of up to ten serogroups (A-I and M). Vaccines against footrot target these fimbrial variants. Commercial vaccines are covering nine serogroups but have low efficacy compared to vaccines based on two serogroups. Therefore, our study investigated the prevalence and distribution of the nine serogroups A-I in German sheep flocks with the aim to detect the predominant serogroups guiding optimized vaccines based on two serogroups. Serogroup A was most common in our study, followed by serogroups B, H and C. More than one-third of the animals showed more than one serogroup. In flocks, we found, on average, 3.10 serogroups in a range of one to six. The nine serogroups were widely distributed across the flocks, with 50 different combinations across the 83 flocks investigated. The lack of two predominant serogroups in Germany impairs the nationwide protection against footrot by the usage of more efficient vaccines based on two serogroups and requires tailor-made flock-specific vaccines. Footrot is one of the major causes of lameness in sheep and leads to decreased animal welfare and high economic losses. The causative agent is the Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus. The prevalence of D. nodosus in 207 sheep flocks across Germany was 42.9%. Based on the sequence variation in the type IV fimbrial gene fimA, D. nodosus can be subdivided into ten serogroups (A-I and M). There are commercially available vaccines covering nine serogroups, but the efficacy is low compared to bivalent vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of serogroups in Germany at the flock and animal levels. In total, we detected at least one serogroup in 819 samples out of 969 D. nodosus-positive samples from 83 flocks using serogroup-specific singleplex PCR for the serogroups A-I. Serogroup A was most prevalent at the animal level, followed by serogroups B, H and C. At the flock level, serogroups A and B had the highest prevalence, each with 64%, but only 40% of flocks had both. The average number of serogroups per animal was 1.42 (range one to five) and, per flock, 3.10 (range one to six). The serogrouping showed within-flock specific clusters but were widely distributed, with 50 different combinations across the flocks. The factors associated with the number of serogroups per animal and single serogroups were the load of D. nodosus, footrot score, sheep breed and flock. Our results indicate that efficient vaccination programs would benefit from tailor-made flock-specific vaccines and regular monitoring of circulating serotypes in the flock to be able to adjust vaccine formulations for nationwide progressive control of footrot in Germany.

AB  - Goats raised on pastures are seldom handled except for purposes such as weighing and providing veterinary care. Regular positive interactions with human caretakers have been reported to attenuate fear and stress responses to routine human handling; however, this has not been adequately studied in meat goats. This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of habituation to handling on behavioral, physiological, and metabolomic responses in goats when subjected to routine handling. Seventy-two male (uncastrated) Spanish goats (6 mo; BW = 25.2 +/- 0.37 kg) were randomly allocated to one of two treatment (Trt) groups: (i) regularly handled by stroking the back of each goat before feeding time for 90 days (handled: H) or (ii) not subjected to handling during the same period, but all other conditions were the same (non-handled: NH). After the 90-day habituation period, the goats were subjected to an arena test in the presence of an observer. Immediately after the test, the goats were subjected to routine veterinary exams that involved blood sampling (0 min) and measuring heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), and body weight (BW). Blood samples were also collected after the veterinary exam (20 min) to determine physiological and metabolomic responses. Data from the arena test were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U Test, and blood physiological responses were analyzed using MIXED procedures in SAS with sampling time (Time) as a repeated measure. Unpaired t-tests showed that the increase in BW was higher in the H goats (p < 0.01) compared to the NH goats over the 90 d habituation period. The approach distance from the observer (p < 0.05) and frequency of urination (p < 0.05) were greater in the NH goats during the arena test. HR (p < 0.01) and RR (p < 0.01) were higher in the NH group compared to the H group. Plasma cortisol concentrations were higher at 20 min than at 0 min (p < 0.05), while epinephrine (p < 0.05), metanephrine, normetanephrine, phenylethylamine, and 5-methoxytryptamine concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in the NH goats than in the H goats. A targeted metabolomics analysis showed that six of the eight affected amino acids were lower (p < 0.05), and six of the seven affected phosphatidylcholines were higher (p < 0.05) in the NH goats compared to the H goats. The results show that habituation reduces fear and stress responses to routine handling, in addition to increasing BW, which can improve the welfare of meat goats.

AB  - Camelina (C. sativa L. Crantz) is a promising biofuel crop with high potential for cultivation on marginal soils. In this work, seed yields have been modelled to assess suitable areas based on experimental field trials, meteorological data from the Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) gridded agro-meteorological in Europe, soil properties from LUCAS, topography and land cover. Potential yields for Camelina-Barley rotation (CAMBAR) were modelled for the past 20 years using the mechanistic crop growth model ARMOSA that can estimate quantitatively several soil and water parameters and future forcing scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using the generation model HadGEM2-ES. The term marginal land is found in the literature to indicate unused agriculture land such as abandoned, underused, degraded and fallow. In this work, marginality is considered the economic feasibility of cultivation, which aims to identifying land where cost effective agricultural production is not possible under a given set of conditions. Marginal lands were identified when the average Camelina seed yield from the crop growth modelling was lower than average in European countries based on a comprehensive literature assessment. The analysis was targeted at regions with a predominantly Mediterranean climate. Simulation by the mechanistic crop model was carried out on a 25 km grid for soil texture, soil carbon average stock, slope and aspect found in the MARS agricultural area mask. Spatial data and subsequent editing and processing of each simulation were allocated to a 500 m spatial resolution via a Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The study area covers around 500,000 km2. The CAMBAR scenario obtained an average yield of 2468 kg ha-1 yr-1, with standard deviation (+- 641) due to fluctuations for extreme weather patterns. Regarding soil organic carbon (SOC), CAMBAR showed an increase of + 43 kg ha-1 yr-1, which aligns with other studies carried out in Mediterranean or continental climates under crop rotation with minimum tillage and straw retention. The results of the present scenarios showed a slight increase in SOC stock (0.1-0.15 % yr-1). In regions with sufficient precipitation throughout the crop cycle, the increase of SOC is lower than the entire study area average, and in few cases, the SOC stock was drastically decreased. However, the model shows that SOC stock can increase when Camelina is introduced in rotation with cereals in areas with high desertification risk. In Spain, in the regions of Castilla La Mancha, Castilla y Le & PRIME;on and Comunidad de Madrid accounting for 40% of the total area of investigation in Spain, equivalent to an area of 88,233 km2, the SOC increase was + 188, + 255 and + 236 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The results of this work constitute a key contribution to policy development at the sub-national, national and EU level, through the investigation of low LUC/ILUC biofuel from marginal areas before these are lost due to land degradation processes and other anthropogenic impacts. Mapping the marginal areas is fundamental to showing potential for producing advanced biofuel crops.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of two dietary regimens, characterized by different forage-to-concentrate ratios, on feed intake, milk yield and composition, as well as economic and environmental sustainability in lactating buffalo cows. Group H was fed a high-forage diet, while Group L was fed a diet with a lower forage-to-concentrate ratio. Despite a lower energy value (Unit for Feed Lactation: UFL 0.89 vs. 0.91), the diet of group H met the animals' nutritional requirements, with similar dry matter intake (DMI) and body condition scores observed in both groups. While there was no significant difference in milk yield, protein, and lactose, group H exhibited significantly higher milk fat content and an enhanced fatty acid profile, characterized by increased oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids have been linked to potential health benefits in humans, including anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and anticarcinogenic effects. From an economic perspective, the H group's diet was found to be more cost-effective, resulting in EUR 0.46 savings per head per day and a higher yield of mozzarella cheese. From an environmental perspective, the high-forage diet reduced reliance on imported concentrates and irrigation-dependent crops, aligning with sustainable development goals. In conclusion, increasing the forage content in buffalo diets has been demonstrated to support animal performance, improve milk quality, reduce environmental impact, and enhance economic returns for producers.

AB  - This study investigates the non-invasive monitoring of the endocrine ovarian activities of captive female golden takins (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi) based on long-term fecal sex steroid hormone metabolite dynamics. Fecal progesterone (P4) metabolite dynamics were monitored in nine females for 0.5-15 years between 2004 and 2022. Fecal estradiol-17 beta (E-2) and estrone (E-1) metabolites were measured during certain estrous cycles, and fecal E1 metabolite concentrations were measured during all gestation periods. The breeding season of the captive animals was mainly between May and December, and they were polyestrous animals whose breeding season begins during the long-day period. The onset of the breeding season occurred slightly earlier as age increased. The mean age (+/- SD) at puberty based on fecal P4 metabolite dynamics was 4.1 +/- 2.9 years. The first conception ages ranged from 2.3-10.2 years. The mean estrous cycle period ( +/- SEM) was 25.4 +/- 1.1 days, and mounting and mating occurred in periods of low fecal P4 metabolite levels during the breeding season. The mean gestation period ( +/- SD) from the estimated mating date to the calving date was 253.9 +/- 5.7 days, and the fecal P4 metabolite distribution during pregnancy was bimodal. Fecal estrone metabolite levels gradually increased 21 weeks before delivery, peaked during the week of delivery, and then markedly decreased in the first week after delivery. Estrus resumed in the first April-August period after delivery (mean +/- SD; 103.5 +/- 40.9 days) or in May of the year after delivery (421.0 +/- 16.5 days). This study revealed that the estrous cycle and pregnancy of female golden takins can be determined by fecal progesterone metabolite dynamics and that fecal estrone metabolite dynamics increases toward parturition and are useful for predicting the date of delivery. This endocrinological information is important for planned breeding efforts for the golden takins.

AB  - The substantial decline in elephant population, primarily caused by human-elephant conflict, necessitates the proactive engagement of conservationists to devise and implement effective monitoring strategies. Monitoring elephants is essential for gaining insights into their movements and ensuring the preservation of habitat corridors. Conservationists have increasingly shifted towards adopting passive acoustic monitoring as an affordable and non-invasive method for determining the spatial distribution of wild elephants through acoustic localization. The main challenge with remote sensing techniques like passive acoustic monitoring is the time-consuming data analysis, which hinders real-time tracking of elephant whereabouts. To address this issue, the study presents Eloc-Web, a web application that visualizes real-time elephant locations using elephant vocalizations recorded by acoustic sensors in the wild, which utilize machine learning to classify the captured audio. Eloc-Web has taken into account the uncertainties associated with classifying captured audio using machine learning models. This ensures that the potential uncertainty of whether the captured sound truly belongs to an elephant is appropriately considered during the visualization process. By following the user-centered design process, the study integrates expert knowledge from elephant ecologists to inform the design and functionality of the application, ensuring its relevance and usability. Eloc-Web, assessed through the System Usability Scale, ranked it in the top 10% of scores, demonstrating above-average user experience and promising potential in assisting elephant ecologists in studying and conserving elephant populations with real-time data visualization.

AB  - Integrated and monoculture freshwater aquaculture systems are often regarded as important reservoirs for an-timicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and antimicrobial resistance bacteria (ARBs), yet only a few studies have assessed differences in the antimicrobial resistome and antibiotic residues between aquaculture modes. In this study, a metagenomic approach was used to comprehensively explore the dynamic patterns and potential transmission mechanisms of ARGs in ducks, human workers, fish, water and sediments during the transition from an integrated to a monoculture freshwater aquaculture mode and to investigate the associations of ARGs with potential hosts in microbial communities using network analysis and a binning approach. The re-sults showed that the abundance and diversity of ARGs were higher under integrated fish-du ck farming than in single fish ponds. During the transition from an integrated to a monoculture aquaculture farm, ARGs in workers and sediments were not easily removed. However, ARGs in the aquatic environment underwent reg-ular changes. In addition, duck manure was probably the most dominant source of ARGs in the duck farm en-vironment. Network analysis indicated that Escherichia spp. were the most dominant hosts of ARGs. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that in water samples, the bacterial community played an important role in the ARG profile. In addition, we identified a potential risk of the presence of highly virulent and antimicrobial-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in workers. These results help assess the risk of ARG transmis-sion in integrated and monoculture aquaculture farms and suggest that we should strengthen the monitoring of long-term resistance in integrated aquaculture environments.

AB  - Our aim was to study post-fire perceptions of selected mitigation strategies for wildland fire-induced risks proposed in a previous scientific study for the communities situated within the forested areas. Consequently, we considered engaging relevant professionals in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB), Alberta who experienced the costliest wildland fire occurrences in Canadian history known as the 2016 Horse River Fire (HRF). To meet our goal, we formulated a questionnaire based on the scientific evidence presented in a previous study and conducted a structured survey. Our results revealed that 24 professionals participated in the survey during the June 2020-April 2021 period, providing a 32% response rate. We observed that a high percentage of the participants agreed (i.e., between 63% and 80%) with the proposed wildland fire-induced risk mitigation strategies, including the presence of no to little vegetation in the 30 m buffer zone from the wildland-urban interface (WUI), extending the 30 m buffer zone to 70 m from the WUI, constructing a 70 m width ring road around the communities, and parking lots of the social infrastructures in the fringe of the communities encountering to the forest. We also found other views, including the use of non-combustible and fire-resistant construction materials, and developing the 70 m buffer zone as a recreational space.

AB  - Insect herbivory may influence arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonisation by changing plant chemistry, and these effects can vary from negative to positive. Yet the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated AM fungal colonization of Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) after exposing its seedlings to four different foliar-feeding insects at two levels of herbivory. We then examined the potential role of induced carbon allocation and secondary metabolites, particularly flavonoids, in AM fungal colonization. Light herbivory (ca. 10% leaf area removed) promoted early colonization by AM fungi whereas heavy herbivory (ca. 60% leaf area removed) decreased it. Root flavonoids were increased (in the short-term) under light herbivory but decreased under heavy herbivory. Further, herbivore-induced changes to root flavonoids were positively correlated with those of AM fungal colonisation. Moreover, quercitrin, one of the root-secreted flavonoids, could mediate these AM fungal responses. Surprisingly, however, AM fungal colonization was not correlated with herbivore-induced carbon allocation in roots or root exudates. We show that AM fungal responses to insect herbivory are at least partially flavonoid-based and depend on herbivory intensity. Our work highlights the importance of secondary metabolites rather than carbon allocation in interactions between above-ground herbivory and below-ground mycorrhiza.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The rapid specialization of livestock production contributes to spatially decoupled crop and livestock production. Relinking croplands and livestock to promote wastes and by-products exchange has been suggested to provide opportunities for sustainable intensification of agriculture systems. However, the environmental and economic performances of such crop-livestock systems remain highly context specific and unclear. This study proposed an emergy-LCA-based framework to study the GHG mitigation and ecological and economic benefits of the integrated crop planting and livestock feeding systems, by taking wheat maize rotation-swine systems (WMRS), tea-swine systems (TS) and citrus alfalfa intercropping-swine systems (CAIS) as the empirical cases. The results showed the three case modes can generally promote GHG mitigation and ecological and economic benefits. CAIS had the lowest carbon footprint per kcal product (0.12 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)), followed by TS (0.61 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)) and MWRS (0.66 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)). The significant difference in this indicator can be attributed to their different upstream input and manure management. Due to the lower dependence on purchased resources, CAIS also had the best performance on emergy-based sustainability and economic benefits. Based on our results, the policy implications, including promoting wastes and by-products exchange, choosing reasonable manure treatment mode and conducting systematic planning have been suggested to provide opportunities for GHG mitigation and sustainable intensification of agro-systems.

AB  - Granulosa cells (GCs) play a crucial role in follicular development and atresia. Previous studies have showed that GCs in the form of monolayer influenced in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes. However, the effects of GCs in the form of conditioned medium and monolayer on IVM and development competence of buffalo oocytes remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the impacts of GC-conditioned medium (GCCM) and monolayer GC on maturation efficiency and embryo development of buffalo oocytes after parthenogenetic activation (PA). Our results showed that GCCM that was collected on day 2 and added to IVM medium at a 20% proportional level (2 days and 20%) exerted significant negative effects on IVM rate (41.6% vs. 44.5%), but significantly enhanced embryo development (oocyte cleavage, 81.3% vs. 69.3%; blastocyst formation, 36.3% vs. 29.3%) of buffalo oocytes after PA compared with the control group. Furthermore, monolayer GC significantly reduced both maturation efficiency (40.2% vs. 44.5%) and embryo development (oocyte cleavage, 60.6% vs. 69.3%; blastocyst formation, 20.6% vs. 29.3%) of buffalo oocytes after PA compared to the control group. Our study indicated that GCs in the form of GCCM (2 days and 20%) and monolayer GC had different effects on IVM and subsequent parthenogenetic development of buffalo oocytes.

AB  - Numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of environmentally based control methods to suppress populations of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say), but few of these estimated the cost of control. We estimated costs for a range of tick control methods (including habitat management, deer exclusion or population reduction, broadcast of acaricides, and use of host-targeted acaricides) implemented singly or in combination and applied to a model community comprising 320 residential properties and parklands. Using the high end for cost ranges, tick control based on a single method was estimated to have mean annual costs per household in the model community ranging from $132 for treating only forest ecotone with a broadcast synthetic acaricide to kill host-seeking ticks (or $404 for treating all residential forested habitat) to >$2,000 for deployment of bait boxes (SELECT TCS) across all residential tick habitat to treat rodents topically with acaricide to kill infesting ticks. Combining different sets of multiple methods in an integrated tick management program placed the annual cost between $508 and 3,192 annually per household in the model community, underscoring the disconnect between what people in Lyme disease endemic areas say they are willing to pay for tick control (not more than $100-150 annually) and the actual costs for tick control. Additional barriers to implementing community-based tick management programs within residential communities are discussed.

AB  - Members of the fungal order Diaporthales are sac fungi that include plant pathogens (the notorious chestnut blight fungus), as well as saprobes and endophytes, and are capable of colonizing a wide variety of substrates in different ecosystems, habitats, and hosts worldwide. However, many Diaporthales species remain unidentified, and various inconsistencies within its taxonomic category remain to be resolved. Here, we aimed to identify and classify new species of Diaporthales by using combined morphological and molecular characterization and coupling this information to expand our current phylogenetic understanding of this order. Fungal samples were obtained from dead branches and diseasedleaves of Camellia (Theaceae) and Castanopsis (Fagaceae) in Fujian Province, China. Based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogenetic analyses derived from the combined nucleotide sequences of loci of the internal transcribed spacer regions with the intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), the 28S large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU), the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1), the partial beta-tubulin gene (tub2), and partial RNA polymerase II second-largest subunit gene (rpb2), three new species of Diaporthales were identified and characterized. They are as follows: Chrysofolia camelliae sp. nov., Dendrostoma castanopsidis sp. nov., and Pseudoplagiostoma wuyishanense sp. nov. They are described and illustrated. This study extends our understanding of species diversity within the Diaporthales.

AB  - Wildlife movements within a landscape are influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and, as human-modified landscapes continue to expand, the risks associated with encountering people. For Asian elephants Elephas maximus, human-dominated landscapes can be a risky but also rewarding habitat. When elephants share space with people, negative human-elephant interactions are common, sometimes resulting in injuries or deaths of both people and elephants. We monitored elephant movements in and out of a forest reserve in central Sri Lanka to test four predictions regarding elephant behaviour: (1) visits to agricultural areas occur at times of the year when crops are plentiful, (2) elephants exploit these areas by night to avoid interactions with people, (3) increased nocturnal illumination reduces use of agricultural areas, and (4) males make greater use of anthropogenic food sources than family groups. Analysis of camera-trap data confirmed that elephants visited human-dominated areas mostly at night. The frequency of such incursions was not influenced by moon phase for males, but there was a weak effect of moon phase for family groups. Males moved more frequently into human-dominated landscapes than family groups, and their movements showed a distinct seasonal pattern, peaking at times of rice and fruit harvest. Our findings suggest that elephants primarily venture into human-dominated areas to consume crops. Encouraging farmers in areas frequented by elephants to adapt land-use practices (e.g. guarding crops, fencing villages, planting orange/citrus fences) and establish early warning systems could help limit the damage caused by elephants.

AB  - The aim of this study was to confirm the type of protandry adopted by M. rhizophorae and to describe the size at which sex change occurs in order to test predictions of sex allocation theory. The reproductive output also was investigated, based on fecundity and embryo volume. Specimens were collected cohabiting burrows built by mud shrimps Upogebia omissa in an estuary region in the northeast of Brazil. The body size (carapace length, CL) and sex of the shrimps were recorded. Observations were made developmental stages of the embryos, fecundity, and embryo volume. A total of 204 M. rhizophorae individuals was sampled, of which 170 (83.3%) male phase (MP) and 34 (16.7%) female phase (FP) individuals. The body size (mean +/- SD) of the individuals in the MP was smaller than in the FP: 3.91 +/- 0.78 and 6.18 +/- 0.52 mm CL, respectively. The size at which 50% of the shrimps changed to FP (CL50) was 5.62 +/- 0.01 mm CL. Reproductive output (fecundity and embryo volume) increased linearly with shrimp body size. An increase in embryo size during development and the loss of embryos during final stage of development were recorded. In this study, the behaviour exhibited by M. rhizophorae (share a burrow with another shrimp species) was recorded for the first time, expanding knowledge about the ecology of this semi-terrestrial shrimp. Our results indicate the adoption of strict protandric hermaphroditism by M. rhizophorae. Our study supports the prediction of sex allocation theory that sex ratio is significantly biased towards the first-sex in sequential hermaphrodites. We also found evidence of possible trade-offs between the size in which the sex change occurs and the reproductive strategy exhibited by M. rhizophorae.

AB  - The formation of sheep (Ovis aries) breeds is influenced by different ecological environments and populations with different living habits, resulting in the development of germplasm resources with stable genetic key agronomic traits. Thus, investigating the genetic mechanisms behind various agronomic traits can enhance the conservation and utilization of diverse sheep breeds. Here, we explored the sheep variome and selection signatures using the Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip (600 K SNPs) from 23 sheep breeds, comprising a total of 1215 sheep. The genetic mechanisms of wool quality and tail morphology were analyzed by selective sweep and genome-wide association study. Based on the results of within-population selective sweep analysis, we performed gene network analysis and divided them into 6 gene communities. We identified genetic regions containing genes linked to sheep wool and tail, which have been and may continue to be important targets for breeding and selection. Furthermore, our results revealed the expression profiles of genes in these regions across different biological systems. Our study provides insights into categorizing sheep breeds into distinct gene communities, as well as references for constructing genetic network pathways related to key agronomic traits in sheep and other domestic animals.

AB  - The origins of agriculture in East Asia can be distinguished between rice agriculture in southern China and millet agriculture (foxtail and broomcorn millet) in the north. In the Longshan peri- od (c. 4300-3800 cal BP), with the northward expansion of rice farming, a mixed rice-millet agricul- tural area was established in the Central Plains of China, which was also in the core area of the estab- lishment of the early state. The interaction between these two agricultural traditions is significant as a backdrop for the emergence of the Erlitou civilization, although the specifics of this cultural contact remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a multiple-isotope analysis to investigate the relationship between dietary diversity and human mobility at the Haojiatai site in Henan Province, where previous studies suggest that C4 millet farmers and C3 hunter-gatherer-fishers coexisted in this place. In addition to assessing carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of bone collagen, the results of nitrogen isotope ratios of individual amino acids suggested that the C3-diet group primarily relied on terrestrial resources such as rice and wild herbivores but also showed a slight influence of C4 food signature. Meanwhile, the C4- diet group was also influenced by C3 foods (wild herbivores and plants) and aquatic animals. Oxygen and strontium isotope ratios indicated that although there is no evidence of long-distance migrations, it does suggest an interaction with the core area of the Central Plains. C3-diet individuals likely originat- ed from non-local regions. A considerable number of C4 millet farmers also appeared to have migrated from the surrounding area as well. The high mobility observed among populations of the Longshan culture implies a connection between the emergence of civilization and increased human mobility.

AB  - With the widespread adoption of agricultural cultivation technologies, the continuous accumulation of micro- plastics (MPs) in agroecosystems poses a major threat to the growth, development, yield, and food chains in crops. To evaluate how polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) affect the food chains in potatoes, we simulated polluted field environments by treating potted potatoes with PE-MPs and by studying an herbivore ( Leptinotarsa decemlineata) ) and its predator ( Arma chinensis) ) within this system. The herbivore was exposed to potato leaves from plants treated with different PE-MPs particle sizes for 15 days. The effects of PE-MPs on potato growth and yield, as well as their impact on L. decemlineata and the potential predation ability of A. chinensis, , were evaluated. We found that: 1) Adding PE-MPs to the soil not only prolonged the emergence time of potato plants but also reduced plant height and stem diameter, ultimately reducing potato yield. 2) Potato plants exposed to PE-MPs led to a significant decrease in the survival rate and vitality of L. decemlineata adults. 3) Arma chinensis were more likely to prey on PE-MPs-exposed L. decemlineata, , however, A. chinensis were also affected, with a noticeable increase in mortality. These results suggest that PE-MPs have a bottom-up negative impact on crop-pest-natural enemy systems, which may affect the balance of the food chain, providing new insights for the risk assessment and toxicity of microplastics on terrestrial food chains.

AB  - Simple Summary The objective of this study was to examine the effect of L-carnitine on the growth and subsequent nuclear maturation of buffalo growing oocytes in vitro. Oocyte-granulosa cell complexes (OGCs) were collected from early antral follicles of slaughtered buffaloes and cultured in in vitro growth (IVG) medium with the supplementation of different concentrations (0, 1.25, 1.875 or 2.5 mM) of L-carnitine for 6 days. The results showed that L-carnitine increased the diameter of buffalo oocytes in vitro. L-carnitine also enhanced the antrum-like structure formation and prevented the degeneration of buffalo oocytes in culture. Furthermore, L-carnitine-treated oocytes showed a higher rate of nuclear maturation up to the metaphase II (MII) stage and a lower rate of degeneration. In conclusion, L-carnitine enhances the growth, prevents degeneration, promotes the formation of antrum-like structures and supports nuclear maturation of buffalo oocytes in vitro. This study aimed to determine the effect of L-carnitine on the growth and subsequent nuclear maturation of buffalo small growing oocytes (92-108 mu m in diameter) in vitro. Oocyte-granulosa cell complexes (OGCs) were dissected from early antral follicles of slaughtered buffaloes and cultured in in vitro growth (IVG) medium with the supplementation of different concentrations (0, 1.25, 1.875 or 2.5 mM) of L-carnitine for 6 days. The results revealed that L-carnitine increased the diameter of buffalo oocytes in vitro. The degeneration rate was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in 2.5 mM of L-carnitine-treated oocytes (10%) than others (55%, 45% and 32.5% in 0, 1.25 and 1.875 mM of L-carnitine-supplemented groups, respectively). The OGCs showed antrum-like structures significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the 2.5 mM of L-carnitine group (74.0%) than the 0- and 1.25-mM groups (34.6% and 38.1%, respectively). Furthermore, in vitro grown oocytes were placed in in vitro maturation (IVM) medium for 24 h to examine meiotic competence of in vitro grown oocytes with L-carnitine. The L-carnitine (1.875 and 2.5 mM) treated oocytes showed a higher rate of nuclear maturation up to the metaphase II (MII) stage and a lower rate of degeneration. In conclusion, L-carnitine enhances the growth, prevents degeneration, promotes the formation of antrum-like structures and supports nuclear maturation of buffalo oocytes in vitro.

AB  - Avian species were historically thought to have a very limited sense of smell. However, recent studies suggest that odor plays an important role in many areas of avian life, including foraging and navigation. It has been shown that insectivorous birds can interact in a tritrophic fashion with plants and their herbivores by cuing in on herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), important signaling compounds released by plants in response to herbivorous damage. This phenomenon has been observed in a number of plant species, including complex HIPV blends in corn (Zea mays). However, in other species, simpler single-compound HIPVs can act as phytohormones, causing the release of additional HIPVs, and have also been shown to be attractive to birds. Here we test if 2 single-compound general HIPVs, methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate, attract avian predators to insect prey on corn plants using clay caterpillar models. We observed appreciable levels of bird attacks on our models across 10 experimental sites. However, we did not observe any difference between HIPV and control treatments. Interestingly, we did find that several weather variables, including wind speed and temperature, were significant or near significant predictors of avian predation activity, respectively. Together with previous studies, our results add to a nuanced picture of how birds may be using HIPVs to locate insect prey. Additionally, the potential for birds to act as a natural form of biocontrol in agricultural settings may be affected by physical location and local climate.

AB  - The diesters of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid), or phthalates, are multifunctional chemicals used in personal care products, medications, and plastics. Phthalate metabolites are also found in human milk and infant formula. However, their impact on intestinal development and microbiota composition in early life is understudied. Herein, the effect of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on growth, intestinal morphology, enzyme activity, and microbiota composition was assessed. Piglets (two-day-old, n = 24) were randomized to receive either 20 mg (DEHP20) or 200 mg (DEHP200)/kg body weight (BW)/day in corn oil. A control group (CON, 0 mg phthalate) received the same volume of corn oil as DEHP200. After 21 days, tissue and urine samples were collected. DEHP did not affect weight gain. Urinary DEHP metabolite concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Jejunal villus length was significantly shorter in the DEHP200 than CON and DEHP20, while villus area was smaller in DEHP200 than DEHP20 but not CON. Crypt depth and area were higher in DEHP200 than DEHP20, but neither differed from CON. Additionally, jejunal sucrase activity was higher in the DEHP200 than CON. Bacterial alpha diversity differed significantly between DEHP groups and CON in the ascending colon, while beta diversity revealed significant differences between DEHP200 and CON and DEHP20. The abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Romboutsia, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, Odoribacter, and Sphaerochaeta, among others, differed in DEHP-exposed vs. CON animals. Thus, daily exposure to phthalates during infancy changes the villus structure and disaccharidase activity in the small intestine and these changes may be modulated by the colonic bacterial community.

AB  - The public health challenge posed by tick-borne disease (TBD) has increased efforts to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of ticks and associated pathogens to better focus tick control strategies and personal protection measures. We describe variability in nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say and Amblyomma americanum (L.) density derived from daily drag sampling at a single location in New Jersey over 4 yr and explore how observed differences in daily collections might affect the estimation of acarological risk. We found significant variability in the density of host-seeking nymphs that could suggest substantially different rates of human-tick encounters depending on sampling date, habitat, and ambient weather conditions. The spatial and temporal variability in the distribution of 2 sympatric tick species with different host preferences and questing strategies, suggests that to produce results that are comparable among sites across the area sampled, surveillance efforts may be limited to shorter collection seasons, fewer sites or less sampling effort (fewer plots or fewer visits) per site, and a geographic scope that minimizes the potential temporal and spatial biases indicated here. Our results illustrate that evaluation of models of tick distribution or relative acarological risk based on surveillance data requires a full description of the diversity of habitats sampled and the conditions under which sampling is performed. The array of factors that affect tick host-seeking and that could bias interpretation of sampling results emphasizes the need to standardize sampling protocols and for more caution when interpreting tick sampling data collected over large temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In some countries like Spain and France, contagious agalactia (CA) is a highly relevant issue. CA is a mycoplasmosis affecting small ruminants and it is associated with a relevant economic impact on dairy. The poor efficacy of vaccines and their inability to prevent disease transmission is conducive to the use of antibiotics to control CA. However, only a few groups of antimicrobial agents are effective against these species, and selecting an adequate antimicrobial agent following the categorization of antibiotics made by the different international organisms (European Medicine Agency, World Health Organization) in veterinary medicine becomes a difficult task. The PK/PD approach is a useful tool to guide veterinarians on the appropriate targets through a rational selection of the best dose regimen of antimicrobial agents. In this study, marbofloxacin pharmacokinetics was studied after three routes of administration with two long-acting formulations. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values of Mycoplasma agalactia isolated from goats affected by CA in Spain were calculated. The results show that systemic exposure achieved in lactating goats following these formulations provides rate of drug release that could be adequate to maintain effective plasma concentrations against M. agalactiae. The PK/PD analysis by Monte Carlo simulation showed that a dosage regimen from 8.47 to 11.57 mg/kg every 24 h could effectively treat goats affected by CA.
   Contagious agalactia is a mycoplasmosis affecting small ruminants that have become an important issue in many countries. However, PK/PD studies of antibiotics to treat this problem in lactating goats affected by Mycoplasma (M.) agalactiae, the main CA-causing mycoplasma are almost non-existent. The aims of this study were to evaluate the plasma and milk disposition of marbofloxacin in lactating goats after intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC) and subcutaneous poloxamer P407 formulations with and without carboxy-methylcellulose (SC-P407-CMC and SC-P407) administration. Marbofloxacin concentrations were analysed by the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of M. agalactiae field isolates from mastitic goat's milk were used to calculate surrogate markers of efficacy. Terminal half-lives of marbofloxacin after IV, SC, SC-P407 and SC-P407-CMC administration were 7.12, 6.57, 13.92 and 12.19 h in plasma, and the half-lives of elimination of marbofloxacin in milk were 7.22, 7.16, 9.30 and 7.74 h after IV, SC, SC-P407 and SC-P407-CMC administration, respectively. Marbofloxacin penetration from the blood into the milk was extensive, with Area Under the Curve (AUC(milk)/AUC(plasma)) ratios ranged 1.04-1.23, and maximum concentrations (Cmax-milk/Cmax-plasma) ratios ranged 0.72-1.20. The PK/PD surrogate markers of efficacy fAUC24/MIC and the Monte Carlo simulation show that marbofloxacin ratio (fAUC(24)/MIC > 125) using a 90% of target attainment rate (TAR) need a dose regimen between 8.4 mg/kg (SC) and 11.57 mg/kg (P407CMC) and should be adequate to treat contagious agalactia in lactating goats.

AB  - Over the past decades, the global population has significantly increased, resulting in high demand for food. China, the largest sheep-producing country, has experienced 20 rapid expansions in its sheep industry, which has caused environmental consequences. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the ecological consequences of the sheep production system. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the energy consumption of the existing production system and identify optimization opportunities to reduce its environmental impacts. Our results demonstrate that sheep production can decrease total energy consumption by 9.82% using optimization. Food production was reported as a critical factor in environmental impact, responsible for 69%. However, the optimized approach led to a decrease of 4,677.64 MJ in energy consumption in sheep production compared to the initial state. The findings of this study showcase the possibility of decreasing energy usage and lessening greenhouse gas (GHG) discharges in sheep farming by implementing optimization strategies.

AB  - The ethnographic mission to Armenia carried out by the NHASA International Associated Laboratory (LIA France-Armenia) was established to observe the pastoral practices of Yezidi and Armenian herders in a territory affected by the 1988 earthquake, the collapse of the USSR and the period of independence, and the NagornoKarabakh conflict. The political and geographical stakes prevailing in this country at the beginning of the 21st century describe a drunkenness of statehood, a culture of mobility, the persistence of the family plot among Armenian villagers, inherited from the Soviet Union, and finally, a geographical situation of double enclavement characterized by the absence of a coastline, and 80% of the border line blocked by its Turkish-speaking neighbours. In this context, we wanted to study the mobility practices of herds and men in their seasonal movements in search of grass or in the systems of guarding, but also those related to commercial routes, from collection to import and export movements.
   The results show several strong points. First, In the midst of the global crisis of pastoral communities and pastoralism, Armenia offers an exception: rich high pastures that are not exploited due to historical events and cultural and geopolitical circumstances. The possibility of expanding its pastoral domain in a context where it is shrinking everywhere else is one of the strong points of our survey. While sedentarization is becoming the norm in many pastoralist communities, Armenia offers an example of herders taking the road backwards, moving towards semi-nomadism.
   There are two types of pastoralism in Armenia: ?nearby? and ?remove?, which could be described as ?patriotic?. They both respond to a territorial injunction (the protection of the integrity of the national territory) and have as their underlying aim the fixation of the population of the Armenian state in the countryside, in marginal zones and in territories occupied before the crisis of Nagorno-Karabakh by Azeris.
   Large mobile pastoralism, called ?remove?, could be described as ?opportunism?. This pastoralism is favoured by a culture of mobility, a geographical promiscuity but also by the expansion and challenges of the meat market in the Middle East and the GCC (including the Iran-Saudi Arabia rivalry), the status quo maintained by Russia on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and at least by the climate crisis. It offers the example of informal transnational transhumance, but also of possible future relocated transhumance. This pastoralism is affected by the workings of globalisation (professional mobility and transnational multilateral issues), but also by fundamental movements. Intensive livestock farming, the marketing of live animals and the health risks associated with their transport and slaughter are increasingly criticized throughout the world. The continuation of extensive livestock farming, the construction of standard slaughterhouses and the development of the chilled meat market are preparing Armenia for this paradigm shift.
   The ?nearby? village pastoralism with its system of collective guarding, probably inherited from the plot system during collectivism, offers a good example of management of common property. It is a form of social resilience in the face of economic, emotional and psychological shocks due to the multiple crises of today?s world. It is also a strong reminder of the centuries-old pluriactivity of the people of mountains and their tendency to have a double life.
   Multi-activity becomes a response as much as an injunction to ensure both the means of subsistence, but also a network that constitutes in this context a purse of opportunity.

AB  - The endogenous endocannabinoid-like compound N-arachidonoyl-L-serine (ARA-S) facilitates activation of the human Kv7.1/KCNE1 channel and shortens a prolonged action potential duration and QT interval in guinea pig hearts. Hence, ARA-S is interesting to study further in cardiac models to explore the functional impact of such Kv7.1/KCNE1-mediated effects. To guide which animal models would be suitable for assessing ARA-S effects, and to aid interpretation of findings in different experimental models, it is useful to know whether Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels from relevant species respond similarly to ARA-S. To this end, we used the two-electrode voltage clamp technique to compare the effects of ARA-S on Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels from guinea pig, rabbit, and human Kv7.1/KCNE1, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We found that the activation of Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels from all tested species was facilitated by ARA-S, seen as a concentration-dependent shift in the voltage-dependence of channel opening and increase in current amplitude and conductance over a broad voltage range. The rabbit channel displayed quantitatively similar effects as the human channel, whereas the guinea pig channel responded with more prominent increase in current amplitude and maximal conductance. This study suggests that rabbit and guinea pig models are both suitable for studying ARA-S effects mediated via Kv7.1/KCNE1.

AB  - Simple Summary: Animals exhibit their internal and external stimuli through changing behavior. Therefore, people intrinsically used animal physical activities as an indicator to determine their health and welfare status. A deep-learning-based pig posture and locomotion activity detection and tracking algorithm were designed to measure those behavior changes in an experimental pig barn at different greenhouse gas (GHG) levels. The naturally occurring GHGs in the livestock were elevated by closing ventilators for an hour in the morning, during the day, and at nighttime. Additionally, the corresponding pig posture and locomotion activity were measured before, during, and after an hour of treatment. With the increase in GHG concentration, the pigs became less active, increasing their lateral-lying posture duration. In addition, standing, sternal-lying, and walking activities were decreased with the increment in GHG levels. Therefore, monitoring and tracking pigs' physical behaviors using a simple RGB camera and a deep-learning object detection model, coupled with a real-time tracking algorithm, would effectively monitor the individual pigs' health and welfare.Pig behavior is an integral part of health and welfare management, as pigs usually reflect their inner emotions through behavior change. The livestock environment plays a key role in pigs' health and wellbeing. A poor farm environment increases the toxic GHGs, which might deteriorate pigs' health and welfare. In this study a computer-vision-based automatic monitoring and tracking model was proposed to detect pigs' short-term physical activities in the compromised environment. The ventilators of the livestock barn were closed for an hour, three times in a day (07:00-08:00, 13:00-14:00, and 20:00-21:00) to create a compromised environment, which increases the GHGs level significantly. The corresponding pig activities were observed before, during, and after an hour of the treatment. Two widely used object detection models (YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN) were trained and compared their performances in terms of pig localization and posture detection. The YOLOv4, which outperformed the Faster R-CNN model, was coupled with a Deep-SORT tracking algorithm to detect and track the pig activities. The results revealed that the pigs became more inactive with the increase in GHG concentration, reducing their standing and walking activities. Moreover, the pigs shortened their sternal-lying posture, increasing the lateral lying posture duration at higher GHG concentration. The high detection accuracy (mAP: 98.67%) and tracking accuracy (MOTA: 93.86% and MOTP: 82.41%) signify the models' efficacy in the monitoring and tracking of pigs' physical activities non-invasively.

AB  - Increasing competition for space and resources at the agriculture-conservation interface poses critical challenges to wildlife conservation, often intensifying human-wildlife conflicts throughout the globe, including Kenya. With approximately 70 % of Kenya's wildlife residing outside protected areas, land conversion for agriculture exacerbates human-wildlife conflicts, particularly involving African elephants (Loxodonta africana). Taita Taveta County in Kenya represents a hotspot for human-elephant conflict, where these incidents undermine both conservation efforts and livelihoods. This study assesses multiple distribution model algorithms and ensemble models, using Kenya Wildlife Service incident data and ten geospatial variables, to predict human-elephant conflicts in the county. The study extends the spatial pattern analysis to the comprehensive comparison of outputs, such as probability and risk maps, thus filling a critical gap by offering an innovative framework for human-elephant conflict modeling. Probability maps were reclassified into risk maps, and landscape metrics were derived to evaluate the spatial patterns of conflict risk. Results highlight that the ensemble model demonstrated superior consistency, predictive accuracy, and provided a more balanced representation of human-elephant conflict risk compared to single-algorithm models. The analysis identified proximity to houses and crops as key conflict predictors, with high-risk zones concentrated near human settlements and low-risk zones confined to protected areas. This study proposes that landscape metrics can further enhance the evaluation of risk map performance. By integrating ensemble modelling and landscape metrics, this research provides policymakers with actionable tools to balance human needs with conservation priorities, fostering sustainable human-elephant coexistence in Taita Taveta County and beyond.

AB  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) populations in Poland are characterized by low productivity, which is why their reproductive potential was investigated. The presence of corpora lutea (CL) on the ovaries of females hunted in autumn and winter in the years 2015 and 2016 was assessed. Most animals were post-rut and most often had multiple ovulations. However, in early autumn 2015, 60% of the females had no CL. Therefore, they did not participate in mating at the turn of July/August. Those that did ovulate were found to have one CL. In late autumn, 97% of the females were post-rut, mostly with twin ovulations. This confirmed the occurrence of a late autumn rut. This phenomenon had been suggested in studies but not confirmed. In contrast, almost 100% of roe deer ovulated in summer in 2016. It was hypothesized that the reason for the low mating activity of roe deer in the summer of 2015 was heat stress and limited food resources. The summer was exceptionally hot, with many days in July and August when temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. The heat combined with low rainfall led to extreme drought. Meanwhile, July and August are the months of mating activity for roe deer. The late autumn rut allowed the roe deer-a monoestrous species-to limit the consequences of a decrease in mating activity or fertility during the hot summer. Global warming may affect roe deer reproduction, so climatic conditions should be considered in population studies, not only in terms of food availability.

AB  - Phylliidae are herbivorous insects exhibiting impressive cryptic masquerade and are colloquially called "walking leaves". They imitate angiosperm leaves and their eggs often resemble plant seeds structurally and in some cases functionally. Despite overall morphological similarity of adult Phylliidae, their eggs reveal a significant diversity in overall shape and exochorionic surface features. Previous studies have shown that the eggs of most Phylliidae possess a specialised attachment mechanism with hierarchical exochorionic fan-like structures (pinnae), which are mantled by a film of an adhesive secretion (glue). The folded pinnae and glue respond to water contact, with the fibrous pinnae expanding and the glue being capable of reversible liquefaction. In general, the eggs of phylliids appear to exhibit varying structures that were suggested to represent specific adaptations to the different environments the eggs are deposited in. Here, we investigated the diversity of phylliid eggs and the functional morphology of their exochorionic structure. Based on the examination of all phylliid taxa for which the eggs are known, we were able to characterise eleven different morphological types. We explored the adhesiveness of these different egg morphotypes and experimentally compared the attachment performance on a broad range of substrates with different surface roughness, surface chemistry and tested whether the adhesion is replicable after detachment in multiple cycles. Furthermore, we used molecular phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary history of different egg types and their adhesive systems within this lineage, based on 53 phylliid taxa. Our results suggest that the egg morphology is congruent with the phylogenetic relationships within Phylliidae. The morphological differences are likely caused by adaptations to the specific environmental requirements for the particular clades, as the egg morphology has an influence on the performance regarding the surface roughness. Furthermore, we show that different pinnae and the adhesive glue evolved convergently in different species. While the evolution of the Phylliidae in general appears to be non-adaptive judging on the strong similarity of the adults and nymphs of most species, the eggs represent a stage with complex and rather diverse functional adaptations including mechanisms for both fixation and dispersal of the eggs.

AB  - Large species that are isolated for thousands of years on islands often evolve extreme degrees of dwarfism. Very little is known about physiological processes that accompany such extreme transitions in extinct dwarf species. We tested whether physiological cycles of bone maintenance (remodelling) in dwarf adult hippopotamuses correlate with insularity-driven body mass shifts that may occur due to variables such as ecological release from predation pressure and change in access to resources. We hypothesised that hippopotamuses with the smallest body size should show higher values of osteocyte lacunae, proxies for osteoblast proliferation during cycles of remodelling, when compared to relatively larger dwarf forms, as well as much larger mainland common hippopotamuses. We examined 20 ribs from three extinct Pleistocene Hippopotamus species spanning a gradient in body size: H. minor (similar to 132 kg, Cyprus), H. creutzburgi (similar to 398 kg, Crete), and H. antiquus (similar to 3200 kg, mainland Greece). Ribs were selected because they reflect bone metabolic rates that are not completely clouded by factors such as biomechanics. Densities of osteocyte lacunae (Ot.Dn) were examined in 864 individual secondary osteons observed in histology sections. We found the highest average Ot.Dn in the H. minor ribs, intermediate Ot.Dn in the H. creutzburgi ribs, and the lowest Ot.Dn in the H. antiquus ribs. It appears that Ot.Dn distinctly separated these three species, possibly signifying a gradient in bone remodelling such that bone tissue optimises maintenance in the face of insularity-driven reduction of body size. We discuss hippopotamus rib bone microstructure and the utility of Ot.Dn in palaeontological analyses for elucidating intricate biological processes occurring in bone of insular fossil mammals.

AB  - To investigate the effect of fertilization on Pb content in vegetables, pepper was planted in L(16)4(5 )(the 5 influencing factors are fertilizers (N, P, K), organic fertilizers (sheep manure) and Pb2+; the 4 levels are blank, low, medium and high; a total of 16 treatments) pot orthogonal experiment. The effects of fertilizers on the growth and Pb content in various parts of pepper under Pb stress were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The Pb content in pepper fruit ranged from 0.011 mg.kg(-1) to 0.085 mg.kg(-1), which did not exceed the limit value (0.1 mg.kg(-1)) in the National Standard for Food Safety-Limit of Contaminants in Food (GB2762-2017); (2) The effect order of fertilization on pepper fruit weight was P2O5 > sheep manure > N > K2O; The horizontal combination of factors that promoted the maximum fruit weight of pepper was N (0.15 g.kg(-1)), P2O5 (0.225 g.kg(-1)), K2O (0.15 g.kg(-1)) and sheep manure (9 g.kg(-1)); (3) The order of fertilizer effects on Pb content in pepper fruit was Pb2+ > K2O > N = sheep manure > P2O5; the factor level combination that resulted in the maximum Pb content in pepper fruits was N (0.15 g.kg(-1)), P2O5 (0 g.kg(-1)), K2O (0.45 g.kg(-1)), sheep manure (6 g.kg(-1)) and Pb2+ (350 mg.kg(-1)); (4) Based on the soil fertility characteristics of Urumqi, the recommended optimal fertilizer application rate was: high phosphorus fertilizerP(2)O(5 ) (495 kg.hm(-2)), low-level potassium fertilizer K2O (330 kg.hm(-2)), medium-level nitrogen fertilizer N (660 kg.hm(-2)) (or low-level nitrogen fertilizer N (330 kg.hm(-2)) + high-level organic manure sheep manure (19,800 kg.hm(-2)), which can achieve high yield while ensuring that the Pb content in the fruits does not exceed the standard. Strengthening control of effective and reasonable fertilization methods in Urumqi agricultural land is helpful to reduce the Pb content in vegetables.

AB  - The successful establishment of endometrial receptivity is a key factor in ensuring the fertility of ewes and their economic benefits. Hu sheep have attracted attention due to their high fecundity and year-round estrus. In this study, we found that in the luteal phase, the uterine gland density, uterine coefficient, and number of uterine caruncles of high-fertility Hu sheep were higher than those of low-fertility Hu sheep. Thousands of differentially expressed genes were identified in the endometrium of Hu sheep with different fertility potential using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Several genes involved in endometrial receptivity were screened using bioinformatics analysis. The qRT-PCR analysis further revealed the differential expression of cAMP reactive element binding protein-1 (CREB1) in the Hu sheep endometrium during the estrous cycle. Functionally, our results suggested that CREB1 significantly affected the expression level of endometrial receptivity marker genes, promoted cell proliferation by facilitating the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase, and inhibited cell apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, we observed a negative linear correlation between miR-134-5p and CREB1 in the endometrium. In addition, CREB1 overexpression prevented the negative effect of miR-134-5p on endometrial stromal cell (ESC) growth. Taken together, these data indicated that CREB1 was regulated by miR-134-5p and may promote the establishment of uterine receptivity by regulating the function of ESCs. Moreover, this study provides new theoretical references for identifying candidate genes associated with fertility.

AB  - The study of fish movement patterns in freshwater ecosystems remains a major focus of contemporary research. Small freshwater fish are known to migrate between tributaries and mainstems at different stages of their life history, helping to avoid local extinctions and maintain genetic diversity. However, fitting small fish species with telemetry equipment is difficult, making it challenging to track their detailed migration history via conventional methods. We evaluated the suitability of otolith isotope analysis for verifying the migration histories of small fish species inhabiting small tributaries. In this study, we compared the Sr-87/Sr-86 values in stream water and the otoliths of two fish species (Nipponocypris temminckii and Rhinogobius flumineus) inhabiting small streams. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the stream waters within the study area displayed considerable variation among tributaries. Our findings indicate that only N. temminckii has high dispersal ability, showing movement between tributaries or between tributaries and the mainstem in some locations. In contrast, such movement was not generally observed for R. flumineus. These results show the potential of Sr-87/Sr-86 as a tool for estimating the migration patterns of small fishes that inhabit small tributaries.

AB  - Our knowledge on many necrophilous dipterans was limited for a long time mainly due to taxonomic issues. Therefore, findings on the sex-related associations with pig carcasses in Dryomyzidae, Fanniidae, Muscidae, and Piophilidae are presented. Moreover, the effectiveness of pitfall traps and sweep nets in fly sampling were compared, since the correct method of collecting insects is critical for the development and application of entomological tools for forensic purposes. The trapped numbers of all species differed significantly in respect to both sexes. The sex ratios were strongly female-biased in most species of Muscidae and in Fanniidae. More females were also collected in Piophilidae, but the proportion of males was higher when compared to muscids. Within Dryomyzidae, the sex ratio differed according to species. Only Dryomyza flaveola (Fabricius, 1794) (Diptera: Dryomyzidae) and Muscina pascuorum (Meigen, 1826) (Diptera: Muscidae) had male-biased sex ratios. Differences in residency patterns between sexes in Stearibia nigriceps (Meigen, 1826) (Diptera: Piophilidae), Liopiophila varipes (Meigen, 1830) (Diptera: Piophilidae), and D. flaveola were statistically insignificant. All studied species were recorded for each sampling method. The effect of the sampling method on the number of individuals was statistically significant for all dipterans but Piophilidae. Pitfall traps outcompeted the aerial sweep net in representing Dryomyzidae and Muscidae, whereas both methods were almost equally effective in the collection of Piophilidae. A varied effectiveness of sampling methods was observed in Fanniidae. The sampling method significantly affected the determination of the appearance time of flies on carcasses, but the effect of species and sampling method was insignificant. Implications for forensic entomology are discussed.

AB  - Escape from native range enemies can give invasive species a competitive edge according to the enemy-release hypothesis. While more commonly associated with predators and herbivores, release from belowground microbial antagonists has been recently demonstrated to benefit invasive plants. Biogeographic variation in dominance and comparisons of soil communities suggest that invasive European Phragmites australis may have also benefitted from belowground enemy release in North America (NA). Here we examine the effects of native range (Europe) versus introduced range (NA) soil communities on European and North American P. australis using a reciprocal inoculation seedling growth experiment. Contrary to the enemy-release hypothesis, we found that North American P. australis was sensitive to soil community origin in that the seedlings grown in European soil communities had higher total biomass than seedlings grown in North American soil communities. This pattern was not observed in the European P. australis seedlings which had similar biomass when grown with North American or European soil communities. Notably, North American P. australis had higher biomass than European P. australis regardless of which soil community it was grown in, suggesting a growth-defense tradeoff. Though the relative abundance of mutualists and pathogens composition did not differ between the two ranges, an indicator analysis revealed that mutualistic fungi and bacteria were key components of European soil communities but not in North American communities. Interestingly, North American soil communities had lower beta diversity than European communities suggesting higher levels of community conservation among North American populations. This research represents the first evidence of growth-defense trade-offs in North American P. australis and offers a novel mechanism in understanding the invasion of P. australis in NA.

AB  - The traditional healers of different parts of India use goat urine for the treatment of tuberculosis. On the basis of ethnomedicinal claims, two plant species namely Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides and Carica papaya were extracted with raw (fresh) and photo-activated goat urine as a menstruum. The present study reports the in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the leaf extracts of H. sibthorpioides and C. papaya against Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 700084 /Mc2155 strain). It was observed that the photo-activated goat urine and raw goat urine leaf extracts could inhibit M. smegmatis. Among all the four extracts, the extract of C. papaya using photo-activated goat urine showed the highest antimycobacterial activity against M. smegmatis.

AB  - The comparability of methods applied to environmental DNA (eDNA) samples across laboratories remains a significant challenge for biodiversity monitoring on a global scale. Performance differences between protocols can jeopardize effective conservation strategies across regions and focal species. To address potential discrepancies amongst four international partners within a collaborative eDNA initiative, an inter-laboratory comparison (i.e., ring test) was conducted to compare efficiencies of established DNA extraction methodologies based on 39 eDNA samples. Each laboratory contributed eight to eleven samples collected throughout the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea near sperm whales, porbeagle sharks, basking sharks, bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins. After lysis, aliquots were exchanged between laboratories before subsequent DNA extraction using each facility's preferred method. Extracts were returned to the lysates'respective laboratories of origin for measurements of total DNA concentration, as well as quantitative PCR using three novel species-specific assays for marine megafauna. Our findings revealed similar concentrations of total DNA, yet a significant reduction in extraction performance for targeted qPCR reactions by one laboratory, who has therefore modified their extraction method to be used for the remainder of this project. Overall, detection success differed based on the target taxa with sharks being less often detected (and at lower concentrations) than marine mammals. Significant interaction effects were found between combinations of laboratories and species, suggesting a link between extraction protocols and variable environmental conditions. Our study serves as a foundational step towards establishing reproducible practices that are crucial for the success of multinational eDNA projects to enable comparable results.

AB  - Animal manures are reported as good substitutes for chemical fertilizers to mobilize soil phosphorus (P). However, the mechanisms on how different types of manures regulate microbial biomass involved in P mobilization remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a two-year field experiment to investigate variations in soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and P (MBP) and P fractions after 30% animal manures substitution (pig manure (PM), chicken manure (CM), and dairy manure (DM)) in paddy soil. Furthermore, a 30-day incubation experiment was used to explore the mechanisms of soil P transformation induced by 100% manures addition. Two-year field experiment results showed that, compared to the chemical NPK fertilizer, 30% manure substitution didn't influence rice and wheat yields significantly but decreased soil total P loss from runoff by 3.2%. However, 30% manure substitution significantly enhanced MBC and MBP by 11.3-18.4% and 57.1-81.2%, respectively, which also promoted the transformation of moderately labile P (M-P) to labile P (L-P). Moreover, the incubation experiment also convinced that all manures caused higher MBC than chemical P fertilizer. Meanwhile, compared to the no P fertilizer, manures increased L-P and organic P by 2.7%-14.7% and 6.4%-20.0%, respectively. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil MBC/MBP ratio was the main factor to soil L-P and M-P, indicating that animal manures can improve soil microbial abundance and thus promote M-P to L-P in soil. Among three animal manures, PM could improve the mobilization potential of P mostly, due to the highest C source activity by C-13 NMR analysis. Our study indicated that animal manures especially PM can be considered as a good candidate for agricultural P management in paddy soils because of their capacity to promote soil P transformation.

AB  - Simple Summary The bighorn sheep is a species of great ecological, cultural, economic, and social importance in Mexico. However, the current sheep population status in the state of Baja California has been unknown since 2010. The objective of this research was to update information on the abundance, distribution, and population structure of bighorn sheep in Baja California through an aerial survey. The flight was conducted in 2021, and 456 bighorn sheep were observed, resulting in an estimated 1697 +/- 80 animals. The observation rate was 16 sheep recorded per hour of flight, and the ram:ewe:lamb ratio was 62:100:19. A statistical comparisons of these results with previous those of aerial surveys, which began in 1992, indicate that the Baja California bighorn sheep population has been stable for twenty-nine years, in contrast to other areas of the species' range, where the sheep population increased during the same period. Given these results, Baja California authorities should consider modifying the current bighorn sheep conservation strategy to increase the species' population in the state.Abstract The bighorn sheep in Mexico is classified as at-risk by the Mexican federal government. In the state of Baja California, wild sheep can be observed throughout the length of the state from the USA-Mexico border south to the Agua de Soda mountain range. This research aimed to document the historical trend of the bighorn population based on aerial surveys conducted in 1992, 1995, 1999, 2010, and 2021, and the abundance, distribution, and structure of bighorn sheep populations in Baja California, based on an aerial survey conducted from 8-14 November 2021, covering thirteen mountain ranges. The estimated sheep population in 2021 was based on the number of individuals observed; the sightability of the animals; the area sampled; and the total area of habitat available. In 30.5 flight hours, 456 bighorn sheep were observed, with an estimated population of 1697 +/- 80 individuals. The observation rate was 16 sheep sighted per hour of flight, and the ram:ewe:lamb ratio was 62:100:19. When the results of the 2021 flight were compared to the results of the previous aerial surveys, there was a large variation between the data, which was related to the lack of consistency between the sampling designs used in each study. Nevertheless, a statistical test of the results of aerial surveys conducted in the state suggest that the Baja California bighorn sheep population remained stable between 1992 and 2021. This study highlights the need to standardize wild sheep aerial surveys by defining flight paths and establishing a consistent duration of flights. On the other hand, Baja California authorities should consider modifying the current conservation strategy for bighorn sheep to increase the species' population in the state by initiating community-based wildlife conservation programs in rural communities.

AB  - To improve the bioavailability of yak by-products, novel antioxidant peptides were prepared and identified from yak skin hydrolysate. The results showed that the ultrafiltration fraction of a molecular weight of less than 1 kDa had the strongest free radical scavenging activity. A total of 219 novel peptides were identified by mass spectrometry and five antioxidant peptides were screened based on molecular docking with Keap1 (LMGPR, GFDGD, FGFDGDF, GHNGLDGL, and GPAGPQGPR). These peptides may bind with Keap1 competitively and exert antioxidant effects by activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway. After synthesis, FGFDGDF showed a better free radical scavenging ability and protective effect on H2O2-induced oxidative damage of HepG2 cells among these peptides. The pretreatment of peptides could enhance the activity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes and reduce the level of malondialdehyde and IL-8. This study provides a scientific basis for the application of yak skin peptide as a novel antioxidant in functional food.

AB  - Investment of plants in defensive and leaf nutritional quality traits may vary with plant ontogeny and the availability of soil nutrients. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ontogeny and soil fertilization on leaf traits of the Brazilian cerrado tree Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae). Leaf defense traits (total phenolics, condensed and hydrolysable tannins, the number of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and the concentration of glucose, sucrose, fructose and total sugar in the extrafloral nectar) and leaf nutritional quality traits (water content, macronutrients, micronutrients and N:P and C:N ratios) were measured in 60 seedlings and 13 reproductive adults that grew in areas with previous P and Ca fertilization over eight years and in neighboring control plots in a Cerrado area in Distrito Federal, Brazil. Sampling was carried out three years after the last application of fertilizer. We found a strong effect of ontogeny on leaf traits: leaves of adult plants were more chemically defended and lower in nutritional quality than those of seedlings. Fertilization modified leaf nutritional quality traits in adults and seedlings, and defense traits in seedlings, increasing the number of EFNs on leaves, total phenolics and condensed tannins. In summary, adult plants of S. adstringens were poor in nutrients and invested more in phenolics and tannins than seedlings, all consistent with plant apparency theory. In contrast, seedlings were much more flexible in their defensive phenotype, with fertilization increasing allocation to total phenolics, condensed tannins and EFN production. This latter result suggests an ability of seedlings to take advantage of very local variation in resources that might increase the likelihood of surviving this vulnerable stage in the life cycle.

AB  - Contextual fear conditioning is a behavioral paradigm used to assess hippocampal-dependent memory in experimental animals. Perception of the context depends on activation of a distinct population of neurons in the hippocampus and in hippocampal-related areas that process discrete aspects of context perception. In the absence of any putatively associated cue, the context becomes the salient element that may warn of an upcoming aversive event; and in particular conditions, animals generalize this warning to any new or similar context. In this study we evaluated the effects of the number of sessions, the number of unconditioned stimuli per acquisition session and the distribution of extinction sessions to assess fear acquisition and extinction and determine under which conditions generalization occurred in adult, male rats. We observed that the organization and spacing of sessions were relevant factors in the acquisition and extinction of contextual fear memories. Extinction occurred with significantly greater robustness when sessions were spread over two days. Furthermore, results indicated that exposure to a single 0.3 mA, 0.5 s footshock in two different sessions could produce context-specific fear, while more acquisition sessions or more footshocks within a single session produced a generalization of the fear response to a new context. Notably, when generalization occurred, successive re-exposure to the generalized context produced extinction in a similar way to the paired exposure. Together, the present findings identify clear procedural and behavioral parameters amenable to neural systems analysis of three clinically relevant outcomes of contextual fear conditioning, i.e., memory acquisition, storage and extinction.

AB  - Simple Summary There is a wide variety of insects in the suborder Heteroptera (true bugs), with various feeding habits and living habitats. Microbes that live inside insect guts play critical roles in aspects of host nutrition, physiology, and behavior. However, most studies have focused on herbivorous stink bugs of the infraorder Pentatomomorpha and the gut microbiota associated with the megadiverse heteropteran lineages, and the implications of ecological and diet variance have been less studied. Here, we investigated the gut microbial biodiversity of 30 species of true bugs representative of different ecological niches and diets. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes dominated all samples. True bugs that live in aquatic environments had a variety of bacterial taxa that were not present in their terrestrial counterparts. Carnivorous true bugs had distinct gut microbiomes compared to herbivorous species. In particular, assassin bugs of the family Reduviidae had a characteristic gut microbiota consisting mainly of Enterococcus and different species of Proteobacteria, implying a specific association between the gut bacteria and the host. These findings reveal that the environmental habitats and diets synergistically contributed to the diversity of the gut bacterial community of true bugs. Insects are generally associated with gut bacterial communities that benefit the hosts with respect to diet digestion, limiting resource supplementation, pathogen defense, and ecological niche expansion. Heteroptera (true bugs) represent one of the largest and most diverse insect lineages and comprise species consuming different diets and inhabiting various ecological niches, even including underwater. However, the bacterial symbiotic associations have been characterized for those basically restricted to herbivorous stink bugs of the infraorder Pentatomomorpha. The gut microbiota associated with the megadiverse heteropteran lineages and the implications of ecological and diet variance remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted a bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the gut microbiota across 30 species of true bugs representative of different ecological niches and diets. It was revealed that Proteobacteria and Firmicute were the predominant bacterial phyla. Environmental habitats and diets synergistically contributed to the diversity of the gut bacterial community of true bugs. True bugs living in aquatic environments harbored multiple bacterial taxa that were not present in their terrestrial counterparts. Carnivorous true bugs possessed distinct gut microbiota compared to phytophagous species. Particularly, assassin bugs of the family Reduviidae possessed a characterized gut microbiota predominantly composed of one Enterococcus with different Proteobacteria, implying a specific association between the gut bacteria and host. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of the comprehensive surveillance of gut microbiota association with true bugs for understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning insect-bacteria symbiosis.

AB  - The Sciuridae family is generally referred to as herbivorous and occasionally omnivorous. Although sciurids are known to opportunistically feed on carcasses of other vertebrates (including cannibalism), the active predation on vertebrates is presumably rare. Here, we present a case of a European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) catching and eating a young Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) accompanied by photographic evidence. This is the first documented observation of bird-killing behavior in this endangered rodent. The incident happened at the end of spring (beginning of June) when the plant proteins are still scarce. At this time of the season, the ground squirrels are exhausted by reproduction efforts and need highly energetic food in order to recover.

AB  - The mid-Pliocene Upper Laetolil Beds at Laetoli in northern Tanzania have produced a rich diversity of fossil vertebrates, including the remains and traces of the early hominin, Australopithecus afarensis. The fauna from the older Lower Laetolil Beds, dating from 3.8Ma to older than 4.3Ma, has not previously been the subject of detailed analysis. This study, based on renewed palaeontological investigations, provides the first systematic account of the fauna, along with a brief synthesis of the geology and palaeoecology. Forty species of mammals are recorded from the Lower Laetolil Beds, dominated by bovids, equids, rhinocerotids, and proboscideans, in addition to reptiles, birds, and invertebrates. The mammal fauna is very similar to that from the Upper Laetolil Beds, and to a lesser extent to the Upper Ndolanya Beds, indicating a high degree of faunal continuity and provinciality in the Laetoli area during much of the Pliocene. Evidence indicates that the palaeoecology of the Lower Laetolil Beds was predominantly dry open woodlands-shrublands-grasslands, but dense woodlands and forests were present on the lower slopes of the nearby Satiman volcano. Water was more abundant than in the Upper Laetolil Beds, with seasonal rivers, marshes and shallow lakes bordered by riparian woodland.

AB  - Simple Summary Comprehensive individual health assessments are required following reintroduction to enhance ex situ species conservation. Diet directly affects the health of wildlife, which can be monitored by fecal microbe analysis. In this study, the association between the gut microbiota and the dietary components of a wild Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) population was evaluated. It was shown through 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing that the gut microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with Psychrobacillus accounting for the largest proportion at the genus level. Microscope observations showed that the relative density of Nymphoides peltata in the fecal matter was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes. This study provides in-depth insight into the relationship between dietary composition and gut microbiota of wild E. davidianus, which offers guidance for the reintroduction of this endangered species to its historical habitat in China.Abstract Reintroduction has been successful in re-establishing several endangered wild animals in their historical habitats, including Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). Continuous monitoring of reintroduced individuals is essential for improving the sustainability of ex situ conservation efforts. Despite an increased recognition of the significance of the gut microbiome for animal health, the correlation between diet and the gut microbiome in E. davidianus is unclear. In this study, 15 fresh fecal samples of E. davidianus were collected from Tianjin Qilihai Wetland and the association between dietary and gut microbiota composition was evaluated. Microscopic observations showed that Nymphoides peltata [relative density (RD = 0.3514), Phragmites australis (RD = 0.2662), Setaria viridis (RD = 0.1211), and Typha orientalis (RD = 0.1085) were the main dietary plants in the fecal samples. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing showed a predominance of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and the genus Psychrobacillus (26.53%) in the gut microbiota. The RD of N. peltata was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.005) and the genus UCG-005 (p = 0.024). This study indicates a close association between food digestion and nutrient intake, providing basic monitoring data for the full reintroduction and recovery of wild E. davidianus.

AB  - Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only large mammal species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The most of the studies in yak remain confined for the main contributor of meat, which requires a good understanding of muscle growth. Matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 are widely expressed in mammal tissues they mainly degrade collagen in the extracellular matrix for muscle development. However, the influence of MMPs on yak muscle remains unclear. Hence, we assessed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and related factors with ages in Maiwa yak for study the correlation between MMPs expression and yak muscle growth. The mRNA expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-14, and collagen III increased with age, except collagen I by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, muscle fiber diameter increased with age, whereas the density decreased, which showed that fiber grew thicker with age using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Interestingly, MMP and collagen expression significantly decreased with age using western blotting. Pearson correlation method showed that both mRNA and protein expression of MMP-14 and collagen were strongly correlated with muscle fiber growth, but MMP-2 protein and MMP-9 mRNA expression were moderately correlated with muscle fiber growth. Overall, the expression of MMPs and collagen significantly changed with age, which means that MMPs and their function related genes could correlate with Maiwa yak muscle fiber growth.

AB  - Koalas are arboreal herbivorous marsupials, endemic to Australia. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the number of koalas declined dramatically due to hunting for their furs. In addition, anthropogenic activities have further decimated their available habitat, and decreased population numbers. Here, we utilize 37 historic and 25 modern genomes sampled from across their historic and present geographic range, to gain insights into how their population structure and genetic diversity have changed across time; assess the genetic consequences of the period of intense hunting, and the current genetic status of this iconic Australian species. Our analyses reveal how genome-wide heterozygosity has decreased through time and unveil previously uncharacterized mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear genotypes in the historic dataset, which are absent from today's koala populations.

AB  - Plants defend themselves chemically against herbivory through secondary metabolites and phytohormones. Few studies have investigated how constitutive variation in secondary metabolites contributes to systemic herbivory response. We hypothesized that plants with lower constitutive defenses would induce a stronger phytohormone response to spatially separated herbivory than plants with high constitutive defense. We used growth chamber bioassays to investigate how aboveground herbivory by Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata, CPB) and belowground herbivory by northern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla, RKN) altered phytohormones and glycoalkaloids in roots and shoots of two lines of wild potato (Solanum chacoense). These lines had different constitutive levels of chemical defense, particularly leptine glycoalkaloids, which are only present in aboveground tissues. We also determined how these differences influenced the preference and performance of CPB. The susceptible wild potato line responded to aboveground damage by CPB through induction of jasmonic acid (JA) and OPDA. However, when challenged by both RKN and CPB, the susceptible line retained high levels of JA, but not OPDA. Beetles gained more mass after feeding on the susceptible line compared to the resistant line, but were not affected by nematode presence. Belowground, JA, JA-Isoleucine, and OPDA were higher in the resistant line compared to the susceptible line, and some compounds demonstrated response to local herbivory. In contrast, the susceptible line did not induce phytohormone defenses belowground. These findings allow us to predict that constitutive level of defense may influence the threshold of herbivory that may lead to plant-mediated effects on spatially separated herbivores.

AB  - Tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is an important edible oil woody plant with a planting area over 3,800,000 hectares in southern China. Species of Diaporthe inhabit a wide range of plant hosts as plant pathogens, endophytes and saprobes. Here, we conducted an extensive field survey in Hainan Province to identify and characterise Diaporthe species associated with tea-oil leaf spots. As a result, eight isolates of Diaporthe were obtained from symptomatic C. oleifera leaves. These isolates were studied, based on morphological and phylogenetic analyses of partial ITS, cal, his3, tef1 and tub2 gene regions. Two new Diaporthe species (D. hainanensis and D. pseudofoliicola) were proposed and described herein.

AB  - FLK West (Bed II, Olduvai Gorge) contains the oldest association of Acheulian stone tools and exploitation of fauna (including megafauna) by hominins in the Pleistocene. Recently, the FLK West paleolandscape has been intensively studied, unveiling a spatial association between archaeological materials and hydrothermal resources. A new type of landscape use by hominins has also been documented around the area where the penecontemporaneous FLK West and HWK site complex were formed, resulting in an array of habitats spanning thousands of square meters covered with large amounts of lithic artefacts. Here, we show how the intensive use of certain environments by hominins resulted in these "megasites", in which hominins engaged in a variety of activities, complementary to those performed at discrete archaeological clusters like FLK West. Despite using these habitats redundantly as quarries, hominins performed extensive core reduction of several types of raw materials indicating a dexterity and careful planning undocumented in earlier periods. Here, we also show how palaeoecological reconstructions must be based on fine-scale geological analyses, given the palimpsestic nature of both geological and anthropogenic processes. The research reported here also uncovered an additional unknown source of metamorphic rocks for hominins at Olduvai, which questions a large part of previous modeling based on hominin provisioning exclusively at Naibor Soit. We also show that the manufacture of handaxes was slightly older than documented at FLK West and that they occur in isolation on the landscape in addition to being clustered at sites. This implies that at the beginning of the Acheulian, hominins were not only using and discarding handaxes at specific loci, but they also transported these tools for various activities across the landscape as part of their strategized adaptation to those environments. The occurrence of these intensively-used megasites hints at some territorial behaviors by early Acheulian hominins.

AB  - Simple Summary Intensive farming in the modern pig industry has resulted in an increase in phosphorus pollution, which is a major environmental concern. The dietary intake of phosphorus is primarily employed for the growth and metabolism of pig bones. Dietary strategies to improve bone growth can be utilized to optimize the utilization of dietary phosphorus and reduce its release into the environment. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that alpha-ketoglutarate, an intermediate metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, improves osteogenesis in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation would have a positive effect on bone growth, and thereby improve the utilization of dietary phosphorus and calcium in piglets. In the present study, we found that dietary alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation improves bone growth, such as bone density, length, and weight in piglets. Of note, our study further demonstrated that alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation improves the apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of phosphorus and calcium in piglets' diets. Our findings may provide a nutritional strategy for diminishing phosphorus pollution originating from the pig industry. Phosphorus (P) pollution from modern swine production is a major environmental problem. Dietary interventions to promote bone growth can improve the utilization of dietary P, and thereby reduce its emission. Recent in vitro studies have shown that alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) exerts a pro-osteogenic effect on osteoblast cells. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AKG supplementation on bone growth, P and Ca digestion, and the gut microbial profile in piglets. Thirty-two piglets were randomly assigned into two dietary groups. The piglets were fed a basic diet containing 10 g/kg AKG or 10 g/kg maize starch (control) for 28 days. On days 21-28, titanium dioxide was used as an indicator to determine the apparent digestibility of P. AKG supplementation improved the bone mineral density, length, weight, and geometrical and strength properties of the femur and tibia. Furthermore, AKG supplementation increased apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of P. Colonic microbiota analysis results showed that AKG supplementation increased alpha-diversity and beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum, and decreased nitrogen fixation and chemoheterotrophy. Together, AKG supplementation improves bone growth, the utilization of dietary P, and the colonic microbial profile, which may provide a nutritional strategy for diminishing P pollution originating from the pig industry.

AB  - Dechlorane plus (DP) is a potential persistent organic pollutant and its distribution in various tissues and organs of terrestrial organisms is currently unknown. DP concentrations in sheep tissues were determined in this study. The DP concentrations in the tissues decreased in the following order: abdominal fat > liver > stomach > heart > outer tenderloin > lung > hind leg meat > kidney > small intestine > tail fat > spleen > brain. Apart from brain and fat, anti-DP is enriched more readily than syn-DP in sheep tissues, but syn-DP is more readily enriched in brain and abdominal fat. The factors influencing DP distributions in sheep tissues were assessed by determining the DP to sheep serum albumin binding forces, binding types, and binding sites by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that anti-DP more readily binds to sheep serum albumin than does syn-DP. Therefore, sheep serum albumin will more readily transport anti-DP than syn-DP to sheep tissues, and anti-DP will be enriched more than syn-DP in the tissues. The molecular diameter of DP is the main factor affecting DP concentrations in sheep brain and fat because of the blood-brain barrier and because the main source of DP to abdominal fat is dermal contact.

AB  - Variation in forage quality is a key dimension of herbivore resource partitioning, but the main determinants of such variation across environmental gradients remain poorly understood. It is especially unclear how much variation in plant nutrient contents and stoichiometry is driven by plant species turnover versus by intraspecific variation across sites. We investigated variation in forage quality across nine sites along a key environmental gradient of increasing rainfall and decreasing soil fertility in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We compared leaf elemental contents of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na) and three nutrient ratios (N:P, Ca:P, and K:Na) between sites, between species within the same site, and between sites within the same species. Site-average N, P, and K leaf contents decreased with increasing rainfall and decreasing soil fertility. The decline in N and K was primarily associated with species turnover, with their contents remaining relatively stable within species. The decline in P was associated with a combination of species turnover and intraspecific variation, with intraspecific P content decreasing strongly with increasing rainfall (decreasing soil fertility) across sites. Variation in site-average Ca, Mg, and Na leaf contents did not significantly correlate with rainfall or soil fertility and was mainly explained by species turnover between sites. Comparing leaf nutrient content and ratios to literature-derived nutritional requirements for large herbivores suggests that Na is severely limiting in this ecosystem. K seems sufficient everywhere, and the other elements are moderately limiting. If Serengeti herbivores rely on plants for their nutrient intake and are nutrient-limited, these results suggest herbivores with high N, Ca, or Mg requirements should optimize their diet by selecting particular species, relatively independent of sites. Herbivores with a high P requirement can instead best select particular sites, relatively independent of plant species. To obtain sufficient Na, herbivores can target particular species at particular sites. Thus, resource partitioning among Serengeti herbivores may occur at different levels for different elements. Interspecific variation in herbivore nutrient requirements would then drive resource partitioning both across sites (for P and Na) and between plant species (N, Ca, Mg, and Na).

AB  - Knowledge of animal diet is an important part of many fundamental and applied ecological studies. The use of DNA-based methods to identify food remains in stomach contents or faeces has now been applied to study the diet of a wide range of animal species from crustaceans and insects to antelope and whales. In this chapter, we present a brief history of the research field and outline how dietary DNA metabarcoding (i.e. the simultaneous identification of species through amplification of DNA markers and high-throughput sequencing of food DNA in diet samples) is employed to study the diet of animals. Moreover, we identify important technical challenges that researchers may face when carrying out a dietary DNA metabarcoding study, such as unique sampling considerations and dominance of non-target DNA. We also highlight some of the critical questions that need to be considered during study design and data interpretation. Based on our experiences, we describe a few studies that illustrate the diversity of approaches and ecological questions that can be addressed. Overall, we hope to provide a clear view of the complexities associated with this approach as well as a sense of excitement around the large number of opportunities that exist in using DNA metabarcoding to study animal diet.

AB  - Increases in atmospheric CO2 have led to more CO2 entering the world's oceans, decreasing the pH in a process called 'ocean acidification'. Low pH has been linked to impacts on macroalgal growth and stress, which can alter palatability to herbivores. Two common and ecologically important macroalgal species from the western Antarctic Peninsula, the unpalatable Desmarestia menziesii and the palatable Palmaria decipiens, were maintained under three pH treatments: ambient (pH 8.1), near future (7.7) and distant future (7.3) for 52 days and 18 days, respectively. Discs of P. decipiens or artificial foods containing extracts of D. menziesii from each treatment were presented to the amphipod Gondogeneia antarctica in feeding choice experiments. Additionally, G. antarctica exposed to the different treatments for 55 days were used in a feeding assay with untreated P. decipiens. For D. menziesii, extracts from the ambient treatment were eaten significantly more by weight than the other treatments. Similarly, P. decipiens discs from the ambient and pH 7.7 treatments were eaten more than those from the pH 7.3 treatment. There was no significant difference in the consumption by treated G. antarctica. These results suggest that ocean acidification may decrease the palatability of these macroalgae to consumers but not alter consumption by G. antarctica.

AB  - Bovicola caprae is an important obligate ectoparasite of goats worldwide including India. The present study aimed at the molecular confirmation, phylogenetics and population structure analyses of B. caprae infesting goats of three different agro-climatic locations in India, by targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genetic marker. The phylogenetic tree exhibited the presence of two different lineages of B. caprae. The sequences generated herein clustered in lineage 2 along with the GenBank (TM) archived sequences from China and Iran. The sequences generated herein also showed the circulation of sub-lineages of B. caprae in India based on the analysis of pairwise genetic distances between sequences and median-joining haplotype network. The population structure analyses revealed low nucleotide (0.00353 +/- 0.00291 and 0.02694 +/- 0.00363) and high haplotype (0.667 +/- 0.314 and 0.618 +/- 0.104) diversities for the present study isolates as well as for the complete dataset, respectively, which evinced a recent demographic expansion. High genetic differentiation (F-ST value = 0.97826) and low gene flow (N-m = 0.00556) were also recorded in the different lineages/populations. In conclusion, the present study addressed the research gap and provided the first insight into the phylogenetics of the goat louse B. caprae and highlighted the circulation of sub-lineages of the ectoparasite in India.

AB  - Simple Summary Embryonic mortality (EM) is one of the leading causes of infertility in modern breeding. This results in a reduction in reproductive performance, significant economic losses and can affect the environmental impact. The introduction of intensive breeding systems and the selection of high-production animals have accentuated EM, also in buffalo. This study aimed to verify if GnRH treatment at 35 days after artificial insemination of subjects identified at risk of embryonic mortality on the basis of pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) levels, could reduce EM in buffalo. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of GnRH administrated at day 35 after artificial insemination (AI) on the reproductive performance of buffalo cows. In ten buffalo farms in the period January-February, 481 buffalo cows were subjected to estrus synchronization protocol and fixed-time artificial insemination (Ovsynch-TAI program). Radioimmunoassays (RIA) for pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) were used to detect pregnancy at day 28 after AI (cut-off value: >= 1 ng/mL). Among pregnant subjects, those with PAG values between 1 and 2.5 ng/mL were considered at risk of embryonic mortality (EM) and were assigned into two groups: treated (T; n = 57) control (C; n = 57). Treated buffaloes received 0.01 mg of buserelin acetate intramuscularly on day 35 after AI, whereas control buffaloes received no treatment. The pregnancy diagnosis was confirmed at day 60 through PAGs level and rectal palpation. The treatment with GnRH had a significant effect (p < 0.001) in reducing EM. Between days 28 and 60 after AI, the animals that experienced EM were only 2/57 in the T group, while were 13/57 in the C group. Moreover, GnRH treatment produced a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the PAG concentration between day 28 and day 60. Administration of GnRH at day 35 after AI in animals considered at risk of low embryo survival based on PAG levels allowed a reduction in pregnancy losses and improved the pregnancy rate during low-breeding season in buffalo.

AB  - Although fisheries bycatch is the greatest threat to many migratory marine megafauna, it remains unclear how population exposure to bycatch varies across the global range of threatened species. Such assessments across multiple populations are crucial for understanding variation in impacts and for identifying the management bodies responsible for reducing bycatch. Here, we combine extensive biologging data from white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) populations (representing >98% of their global breeding population) with pelagic and demersal longline and trawl fishing effort to map the global distribution and fisheries-overlap hotspots for the most bycaught seabird in the Southern Hemisphere. We tracked the year-round movements of 132 adults in 2006-2018 and examined spatial overlap among seven populations comprising three genetically distinct groupings (metapopulations). Foraging areas during the nonbreeding season were more concentrated than during breeding, with birds from all populations migrating to continental shelf or upwelling zones, but with low spatial overlap among metapopulations. Fisheries overlap differed more among than within metapopulations, underlining that these should be considered separate management units. Overlap with pelagic longline fisheries was greatest for Indian Ocean populations, and from the fleets of South Africa, Japan, Taiwan, and Spain, off southern Africa and in the High Seas. Overlap with demersal longline and trawl fisheries was greatest for Indian and Atlantic Ocean populations, within the Exclusive Economic Zones of South Africa, Namibia, and Argentina, and with the South Korean demersal longline fleet in the High Seas. The high overlap with South Korean longliners in the southwest Atlantic Ocean is of particular concern as demersal fishing in this region is not covered by any Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO). We also identified fisheries-overlap hotspots within RFMOs where there are no seabird-bycatch mitigation requirements (1.5%-53.1% of total overlap within the area of competence of each RFMO), or where current mitigation regulations need to be strengthened. Our recommendations are that management bodies target the high-priority fisheries we have identified for improved bycatch monitoring, mandatory best-practice bycatch mitigation, and close monitoring of compliance, given the conservation concerns for white-chinned petrels and other threatened seabirds.

AB  - For half a century, biologists considered trees as particularly apparent to their enemies. But why then do some trees escape herbivorous enemies by bursting buds either too early or too late, leading to phenological mismatch? We hypothesize that such mismatches occur on trees that are unapparent in time - those that burst buds 'discreetly' (slowly) and unpredictably (inconsistently across years), and are difficult to access (host trees among non-hosts). We studied herbivores on oaks in western France. We for the first-time characterized phenology matching of an entire guild of herbivores, early spring ectophagous caterpillars (45 species). We examined whether, on a given date, caterpillars have a large body size and impact (herbivory), and whether this size or impact are largest on trees that burst buds earliest. Furthermore, we distinguished the contributions of within-guild sorting of species and within-population selection of individuals to phenology matching, we investigated whether present phenology matching was determined during past generations by testing if caterpillars from trees with early-maturing foliage pupate early, even when transferred into a common garden. We found that caterpillar size and herbivory impact in the field and pupation date in the lab generally matched leaf phenology in the field. Such phenology matching was consistently observed at the intraspecific level but was less evident at the interspecific level. Together this indicates that phenology matching is mainly driven by past within-population selection rather than present, within-guild sorting. Furthermore, herbivores size and impact were most constrained by late bursting of host trees if these trees burst buds slowly and unpredictably and are difficult to access. We suggest that, during the assembly of early-spring herbivore guilds, trees can best constrain development of herbivore populations by late budburst and remaining unapparent in time - bursting buds discreetly, unpredictably across years, or in inaccessible neighbourhoods.

AB  - Phytosterols are natural compounds found in all higher plants that have a wide variety of roles in plant growth regulation and stress tolerance. The phytosterol composition can also influence the development and reproductive rate of strict herbivorous insects and other important agronomic traits such as temperature and drought tolerance in plants. In this study, we analysed the phytosterol composition in 18 Brassica napus (Rapeseed/canola) cultivars and 20 accessions belonging to 10 related wild Brassicaceae species to explore diverse and novel phytosterol profiles. Plants were grown in a controlled phytotron environment and their phytosterols were analysed using a saponification extraction method followed by GC-MS from the leaf samples. The B. napus cultivars showed slight diversity in eight phytosterols (>0.02%) due to the genotypic effect, whereas the wild accessions showed significant variability in their phytosterol profiles. Of interest, a number of wild accessions were found with high levels of campesterol (HIN20, HIN23, HUN27, HIN30, SARS2, and UPM6563), stigmasterol (UPM6813, UPM6563, ALBA17, and ALBA2), and isofucosterol (SARS12, SAR6, and DMU2). These changes in individual phytosterols, or ratios of phytosterols, can have a significant implication in plant tolerance to abiotic stress and plant insect resistance properties, which can be used in breeding for crop improvement.

AB  - Validated predictions of wildlife population density would be very useful for managers of overabundant wildlife and their effects on biodiversity. In this study such predictions were generated by modelling population dynamics of 18 non-culled populations of Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) across small biodiversity conservation reserves in Canberra. Predictions were validated using three analyses of independent, out-of-sample, data from 11 populations which were non-culled or culled. Association (analysis 1) showed observed and predicted densities were significantly positively correlated (R2 = 0.79, P = 0.045, n = 5) with unbiased slope and y intercept for non-culled populations, though observed and predicted densities of culled populations were unrelated (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.24, n = 6). Coverage (analysis 2) showed predicted densities were within the 95% confidence interval of observed densities in five of five non-culled populations and four of six culled populations, with one underestimate and one overestimate in the latter group. Bias (analysis 3) showed the mean bias (=observed - predicted) was 0.18 (+/- 0.23 SE) kangaroos/ha for non-culled and 0.08 (+/- 0.23 SE) for culled populations. The results have been used to adjust kangaroo management approaches in Canberra as part of adaptive management.

AB  - This study presents the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from the tooth enamel of 57 sheep and goat specimens, in order to explore animal mobility in the Middle and Late Bronze Age society of the Balearic Islands (Naviform period). Seven archaeological sites from Mallorca and Menorca located in different biotopes and with different functionalities were selected. The results provide some of the first data on the geographic range of meat provisioning at each site. In addition, several present-day leaves, as well as tooth dentine and bones were analysed to assess local strontium isotopic ratios in different geological layers existing in the Balearic Islands. The results suggest that most caprines were sourced from the neighbouring areas of each site, but also suggest a correlation between strontium isotope variability and site function: domestic settlements and sites related with maritime exchanges had significantly more variability compared to fortified sites. In addition, the ritual cave of Cova del Camp del Bisbe had the highest diversity of strontium isotopic ratios, thus suggesting that caprines were brought here from a variety of different locations.

AB  - Introduction: One Health is a multifaceted approach increasingly used to explore climate-driven public health challenges; however, it is often lacking the expertise of local people who are most connected to and affected by these challenges. Our goal was to explore how nomadic herders in a conservation area (Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia) understand the issues of interconnectedness of environmental, animal, and human health through Foot-and-Mouth Disease of ungulates and climate change. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study of 104 nomadic herders in Dornogobi, Mongolia, using a questionnaire with 11 open-ended questions which were translated into English for analyses and coding using NVivo. The questions explored herders' perceptions and experiences on the linkages between human wellbeing, environmental factors, and outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease of ungulated animals, which is occurring more frequently in Mongolia. Results: Pasture degradation was the factor herders most linked to animal, human, and environmental health and climate change. The herders displayed adept understanding of One Health concepts. The herders' responses throughout the survey revealed a cycle where climate change contributes to landscape degradation, declining animal health, and human socioeconomic consequences. Discussion: Mongolia's rich tradition of herding and generational linkages to natural resources provide a unique, holistic approach to understanding the effects of climate change and landscape degradation on disease transmission and human well-being. Conclusion: Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities should be actively engaged through leadership and input in formulating transdisciplinary strategies to combat climate change and its effects on animal and human health.

AB  - The continuous increase in ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) concentrations in pig barns is primarily driven by the expansion of pig farming, which significantly contributes to the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the NH3 and CH4 concentrations based on daily activities, pig physiological parameters such as body mass (BM) and feed intake (FI), and various growing phases of pigs. Two independent experiments were carried out in two pig barns across 2022 and 2023. Both barns were equipped with biological and environmental management sensors (BEMS) and livestock environment management sensors (LEMS) to monitor the pigs' daily activities, indoor air temperature (IT), relative humidity (IRH), and NH3 and CH4 concentrations. The results of the study revealed that BM and FI had a strong positive correlation with NH3 (r > 0.84 with BM and r >= 0.85 with FI) and CH4 (r > 0.83 with BM and r >= 0.81 with FI) concentrations during both study periods. Moreover, it was observed that NH3 and CH4 concentrations were lowest in growing phase 1 (G1) and highest in growing phase 4 (G4). Additionally, it was found that the NH3 and CH4 concentrations were highest during the morning defecation (7 AM - 8 AM) and lowest during sleeping at night (9 PM- 7 AM) activity time. In conclusion, these findings provide crucial insights into the patterns of NH3 and CH4 concentrations in pig barns, which are valuable for improving pig production practices and environmental management strategies.

AB  - The present paper describes new fossil materials (skull and some postcranial elements) collected in November 2020 in Engrunado cave in Nova Redencao municipality, Bahia, Brazil. This material was attributed to a sub-adult specimen of Smilodon populator Lund, 1842, estimated to be 17-18 months old and with a body mass of 185 kg when it died. Based on its body mass, this individual could have hunted animals with a typical and maximum potential prey body mass of 302 and 1004 kg, respectively. Furthermore, it may have had a high dietary niche overlap with adult specimens of S. populator and other large carnivorans, such as Panthera onca (Linnaeus, 1758), probably hunting different species to avoid competition with them.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of stocking density in the pen and lairage time before slaughter on blood stress indicators, skin lesions, and pork meat quality traits. A total of 1920 immunocastrated male pigs were shipped to a slaughterhouse. In order to maintain the proposed stocking densities, 72 pigs out of the 1920 animals were removed across loads from the experiment. The remaining 1848 pigs were randomly assigned to two different stocking densities in the lairage pen (0.42 m(2)/100 kg and 0.66 m(2)/100 kg) and two lairage times (2 h and 6 h). A total of 360 pigs were selected for the analysis of exsanguination blood glucose, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol concentration, hematocrit percentage, and carcass skin lesion scores, whereas meat quality was assessed in 240 loin muscles. Except for blood hematocrit percentage, the interaction stocking density x lairage pen had no effect on any parameter (p > 0.10). When compared to a lower stocking density (0.66 m(2)/100 kg), pigs kept at a higher stocking density (0.42 m(2)/100 kg) tended to present lower blood LDH concentrations (p = 0.06) and higher blood cortisol concentrations (p = 0.08) at slaughter and had greater carcass skin lesion scores (p < 0.001) and drier (lower drip loss) loin muscles (p = 0.04). Increased blood hematocrit percentage was found in pigs kept in lairage at a higher stocking density for 6 h when compared with the other lairage conditions (p < 0.01). Overall, stocking density, in particular when it was high, influenced more pigs' stress conditions at slaughter and carcass and meat quality than the time spent in lairage.

AB  - A total of sixty crossbred ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) pigs with an initial body weight of 46.34 +/- 0.13 kg were randomly assigned to four treatments under thermoneutral (TN, 22 degrees C) or heat-stress (HS, 31 degrees C) conditions for 54 d trial (Phase 1: 0-26 d; Phase 2: 27-54 d): a control diet (16% CP in phase 1, 14% CP in phase 2) under TN (PC), a control diet under HS (NC), a low crude protein (LCP) diet (14% CP in phase 1, 12% CP in phase 2) under HS (LCP) and an LCP diet with increased crystalline AA (an increase in 5% in Lys, Met, Thr and Trp based on calculated SID AA) (LCP5) under HS. Experimental treatments consisted of five replicate pens, with three pigs per pen. The results showed that HS reduced (p < 0.05) growth performance and nutrient digestibility compared to TN. However, LCP5 improved (p < 0.05) growth performance and nutrient digestibility compared to other HS groups. Heat stress adversely affected (p < 0.05) intestinal morphology, gut integrity and serum oxidative markers, but these effects were alleviated (p < 0.05) by LCP5 supplementation. Notably, LCP5 improved (p < 0.05) the production of butyric acids among short-chain fatty acid production and decreased (p < 0.05) proteobacteria and Spirochaetota in phylum in feces. These findings highlight the potential of LCP diets supplemented with crystalline AA as an effective nutritional strategy to mitigate the negative effects of HS on pigs, enhancing their performance, gut health and overall welfare in high-temperature environments.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate environmental impacts within farm boundaries in broiler production systems in Turkey. There have been calculated on three-stage assessing environmental impacts: carbon footprint and water footprint. The objectives were evaluated by taking into account 1 kg of chicken meat of the functional unit. Using three different methods (real-time gas concentration, Tier 1 approach, and life cycle assessment) the carbon footprint was evaluated. We obtained an average of 2.9 kg CO2/functional unit for the carbon footprint using measured gas concentration data. Accordingly, with the Tier 1 method developed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it has been shown that 5.1 kg CO2 equivalent carbon footprint per functional unit occurs in the broiler farms. Based on the life cycle assessment, the emissions were 3 kg CO2 equivalent per functional unit. The second stage of the study was the determination of water footprints in broiler production systems. The water footprint of farms was evaluated with SimaPro 8.2 software. According to the results, 0.003 m(3) water/functional unit was obtained by considering the drinking water and using water amount in the production.

AB  - In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for artificial insemination (AI) centers to procure high-quality bedding materials. The aim of this study was to investigate influences of bedding materials on selected environmental and welfare-related aspects in breeding boars. Including seasonal changes, two trial runs were conducted in winter (T1) and summer (T2) to compare five deep-litter bedding materials (wood shavings (WS), hemp straw (HS), linen straw (LS), spelt husks (SH), and regional wood shavings (RWS)). The cleanliness of the boar pens was visually assessed at the end of T1 and T2 using a 4-point scale (1 = >75%, 2 = 75-51%, 3 = 50-25%, and 4 = <25% clean surface). Simultaneously, a body position score for each boar was assessed (1 = lying on flank, 2 = lying on belly, 3 = sitting, and 4 = standing). Temperatures of bedding at 5 cm and 15 cm depth were determined using a thermometric probe at week 6 and 16 after initial bedding replacement. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were measured at the same time. Simultaneously, fecal samples were collected and analyzed for oocysts in T1. To include flies as a health hazard and nuisance, sticky traps were evaluated in T2. Generalized linear mixed models and a two-way ANOVA were calculated for the statistical evaluation of observations. Cleanliness evaluation showed differences among bedding materials in T1 (P = 0.004) but not in T2 (P > 0.05). There were no differences in the body position score among the materials. WS and RWS were generally cooler at the start of T1 and T2. The greatest difference of 7 degrees C in means was detected between RWS and SH at the start of T2 and 15 cm depth (P < 0.001). Oocyst counts revealed no difference among bedding materials in T1. In T2, fly numbers differed for time of bedding period and for the interaction term between time of bedding period and material (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results demonstrate clear differences between materials in terms of temperature, cleanliness of pens (T1), and partially fly burden (T2). Considering heat is a great stressor for most animals, we favor wooden materials as deep-litter bedding for AI boars compared to others due to lower heat development during the bedding period. Moreover, we recommend avoiding replacement of deep-litter bedding during hot summer months in AI centers to reduce excessive heat development.

AB  - Cosmopolitan agricultural herbivorous pests are provided with a wide range of potential hosts. Therefore, they have high carrying capacity, and can cause extremely severe damage in agroecosystems. Understanding the ecological mechanisms of their population dynamics, especially as they relate to large-scale meteorological variations and geographical landscape influences, can help us to reveal how they became such important pests. The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, is a typical example of a significant pest distributed on a large scale, which is capable of damaging fruit trees of economic value such as peach, apple, pear, etc. This pest not only occurs in China, but exists on all continents except Antarctica. In order to prevent major pests and diseases, a system of plant protection has been established gradually in peach orchards within the Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System in China (CARS) since 2009. In the system, we collected the monitoring data of G. molesta by using pheromone traps at 17 experimental stations, and then used the corresponding climate data (temperature and precipitation) to explore the link between climate factors using mixed models. The results show that both monthly mean temperature and precipitation had a significant positive correlation with the occurrence of G. molesta. Therefore, global warming with higher levels of precipitation may favor G. molesta, allowing it to outperform other potential pests at the population level in peach orchards, on a large scale.

AB  - Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the beta-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

AB  - Compared with their free-ranging counterparts, wild animals in captivity experience different conditions with lasting physiological and behavioural effects. Although shifts in gene expression are expected to occur upstream of these phenotypes, we found no previous gene expression comparisons of captive versus free-ranging mammals. We assessed gene expression profiles of three brain regions (cortex, olfactory bulb and hippocampus) of wild shrews (Sorex araneus) compared with shrews kept in captivity for two months and undertook sample dropout to examine robustness given limited sample sizes. Consistent with captivity effects, we found hundreds of differentially expressed genes in all three brain regions, 104 overlapping across all three, that enriched pathways associated with neurodegenerative disease, oxidative phosphorylation and genes encoding ribosomal proteins. In the shrew, transcriptomic changes detected under captivity resemble responses in several human pathologies, including major depressive disorder and neurodegeneration. While interpretations of individual genes are tempered by small sample sizes, we propose captivity influences brain gene expression and function and can confound analyses of natural processes in wild individuals under captive conditions.

AB  - Promoting play behaviour could enhance pig welfare in intensive production systems. Play is associated with positive emotions, and regular play opportunities may positively alter pigs' affective states. The affective state of pigs can be indirectly assessed through a behavioural test that determines an optimistic or pessimistic cognitive bias (CB). This study explored whether grow-finish pigs reared with intermittent play promotion over nine weeks exhibited more optimistic CB compared to conventionally-housed pigs. A subsample of 18 pigs was selected from three treatments (6 pigs/treatment): i) Control (CON), ii) Novelty (NOV), and iii) Play pen (PLP). Play was promoted 3x/week with novel objects provided either in a home pen (NOV, 1 m2/pig) or a larger playpen (PLP, 2.9 m2/pig). At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained to approach a 'hot spot' (GO/correct) with a positive sound cue (POS) reinforced with a positive reward or avoid it (NO-GO/correct) with a negative sound cue (NEG) reinforced with a negative experience. Afterwards, all pigs' CB was assessed using an ambiguous sound cue (AMB) in two tests (CBT) and GO/optimistic and NO-GO/pessimistic responses were recorded. In training, 66 % of NOV and PLP pigs successfully trained for CBT, while 0 % of CON pigs did (p = 0.036, Fisher's exact). During testing, the proportion of optimistic responses to the AMB cue exhibited by pigs in trained NOV and PLP treatment groups did not differ from pigs in untrained CON group in CBT 1 (p = 0.751, Kruskal-Wallis) and CBT 2 (p = 0.595). For the POS cue, the proportion of correct responses of trained NOV and PLP treatment pigs was higher compared to pigs from untrained CON group in CBT 1 (at a tendency, p = 0.075) and CBT 2 (p = 0.011). Pigs from the three treatment groups did not differ in their proportions of correct responses to the NEG cue in either CBT. The pig-level proportion of fearful/aggressive behavioural reactions to the negative experience tended to be higher in CON compared to trained and untrained play (PLY) pigs (p = 0.072, Mann-Whitney). Four PLY pigs and one CON pig showed a bold reaction to the negative experience. Results suggest that rearing pigs in a more stimulating environment with play opportunities improves trainability and learning, possibly due to reduced fear. Due to collinearity between treatment and successful training, no conclusions can be drawn about the effect of play promotion on the pigs' affective states. Future studies should refine CBT methods to enhance understanding of the relationship between play and affective states in pigs.

AB  - Bohor reedbuck is a medium-sized, even-toed ungulate species endemic to Africa. Its population is gradually declining, and an estimation of Meta populations is required to determine its current population status and as an input for conservation action. To this end, this study aimed to investigate this species' population size and diurnal activity patterns in the compound of Alage Agricultural College, Central rift valley of Ethiopia. A total count was conducted to determine the population size of Bohor reedbuck by dividing the study area into different blocks. Continuous focal animal observations were used to collect data on activity patterns by recording group activities with five minutes intervals. The results revealed that the mean population size of Bohor reedbuck counted during the study period was 51.4 +/- 8.55 (SE) with a density of 1.74 per km(2). Females formed the dominant group in the population. From the mean total population size of Bohor reedbucks, 47.42% were adults. The mean group size of Bohor reedbuck was 3.16 +/- 0.053 (SE). Feeding (n = 366, 45.81%) was the dominant mean diurnal activity pattern of Bohor reedbuck, followed by Resting (n = 255, 31.91%), whereas grooming (n = 28, 3.51%) was the least performed activity. There was a significant difference between the diurnal activities performed by Bohor reedbuck (P < 0.05). The studied compound is an important refuge for this species, and minimum management interference can increase the population size of Bohor reedbuck in the area.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis of C-13 and N-15 has been widely used to provide information regarding short- or long-term animal dietary composition as affected by changes in land or ecological system use. In complex mixed-crop-livestock systems, rangeland biomass, crop residues, and feedstuff contribute to livestock diets with high seasonal variations. Particularly in the Limpopo province, South Africa, livestock feed supply varies considerably throughout the year leading to regular feed gaps. Hence, to estimate livestock diet composition in relation to these variations, we analyzed the stable isotopes of C and N of tail hair and feces samples across free-ranging beef cattle in distinct agroecological zones (AEZs) and farm types. Here, farm types were structured according to mixed-crop-livestock farms and livestock-only farms. We found that farm types did not influence the delta C-13 of feces and hair (P > 0.05), but AEZ had a strong effect on delta C-13 patterns (P < 0.01). The contribution of C-3-C-4 plants in the diet varied considerably across farm types and AEZ (P < 0.01). The delta N-15 values indicated nutritional stress, probably due to low protein concentrations in feed (e.g., rangeland biomass, crop residues) irrespective of AEZ and farm types. In general, cattle exposed to arid conditions (drier AEZ) had significantly decreased delta C-13 values and increased delta N-15 values that could potentially be linked to feed gaps. Moreover, the results from the present study indicate that delta C-13 of feces and hair samples are more meaningful predictors of cattle diet than delta N-15 as affected by different farm practices. Therefore, stable isotope analyses potentially have an important role in helping improve the understanding of seasonal shifts in livestock diet intake in diverse production systems.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - (1) Background: Hair growth can function as an indicator of an animal's health and nutritional status, furnishing a valuable means for early diagnosis and timely modifications to management practices, and is influenced by hormones, the immune system, and the levels of minerals within the animal's body. (2) Methods: In this study, a total of 81 yaks were selected and divided into three groups according to their ages (1-2 years, 3-4 years, 5-6 years), and the concentrations of melatonin, dihydrotestosterone, IgA, IgG, and IgM in their blood serum and the levels of Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, and P in both their blood serum and hair were detected. (3) Results: The levels of melatonin and dihydrotestosterone in yaks aged 1-2 years were significantly higher than those of other age groups (p < 0.001). In addition, the concentration of melatonin in male yaks was markedly greater than that in female yaks (p < 0.05). When it came to immunoglobulins, the IgA level in 1-2-year-old yaks was strikingly higher than those in yaks aged 3-4 years and 5-6 years (p < 0.05). In terms of mineral elements, the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron in the blood serum of 1-2-year-old and 5-6-year-old yaks were significantly elevated compared to those in 3-4-year-old yaks. However, there was no notable difference between the 1-2-year-old and 5-6-year-old groups. The correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between DHT and the levels of melatonin and IgA in yaks. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between IgA and IgG, as well as between IgA and the levels of Fe, Mg, and Ca. It is likely that they jointly regulate the hair growth and immune processes of yaks. (4) Conclusions: There are positive correlations among melatonin, dihydrotestosterone, and IgA in the blood serum and the content of Fe and Mg in the hair to varying degrees, implying these indicators may jointly regulate yak hair growth and immune status. These research findings provide data support for applied research into evaluating the overall health status of yaks through the growth status of hair or by measuring the mineral content in hair in a non-invasive way.

AB  - In recent years, nutritional interventions for different psychiatric diseases have gained increasing attention, such as the ketogenic diet (KD). This has led to positive effects in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, addiction, autism or epilepsy. The neurobiological mechanisms through which these effects are induced and the effects in cognition still warrant investigation, and considering that other high-fat diets (HFD) can lead to cognitive disturbances that may affect the results achieved, the main aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of a KD to determine whether it can induce such cognitive effects. A total of 30 OF1 male mice were employed to establish the behavioral profile of mice fed a KD by testing anxiety behavior (Elevated Plus Maze), locomotor activity (Open Field), learning (Hebb Williams Maze), and memory (Passive Avoidance Test). The results revealed that the KD did not affect locomotor activity, memory or hippocampal-dependent learning, as similar results were obtained with mice on a standard diet, albeit with increased anxiety behavior. We conclude that a KD is a promising nutritional approach to apply in research studies, given that it does not cause cognitive alterations.

AB  - Premise: In many species, seed size influences individual fitness, but its heritability is low, impeding its evolution. In heterogeneous environments, even if heritability of seed size is low, genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for seed size may provide the opportunity for selection, but this possibility has rarely been investigated in wild species. The evolutionary trajectory of seed size depends on whether additive, maternal, or non-additive genetic variance dominates; moreover, the expression of any of these sources of variance may be environment-dependent, reflecting genetic variation in plasticity. In this study, we examined these sources of variation in seed size and their response to drought in Dithyrea californica.
   Methods: We used a diallel design to estimate variance components for seed size in three greenhouse-raised populations sampled from California and northern Mexico. We replicated diallels in two watering treatments to examine genetic parameters and genotype x environment interactions affecting seed size. We estimated general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability, reciprocal effects (RGCA and RSCA), and their interactions with water availability, and we sought evidence that sexual conflict influences seed size.
   Results: Norms of reaction revealed genetic variation in plasticity for seed size in each population. Seed size in D. californica is determined by the combination of watering treatment, GCA and RGCA; parental identity and water availability do not consistently affect seed size, and we detected no evidence for sexual conflict.
   Conclusions: Multiple sources of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for seed size have the potential to influence its evolutionary trajectory in heterogenous environments.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress disrupts offspring behavior and cognitiveabilities not only in the first but also in subsequent generations.Various stress factors that affect fathers before conception canalso exert a similar transgenerational effect on the offspring phenotype.The aim of the study was to reveal the transgenerational effectof prenatal stress on female Wistar rats during gestational days 15-19on memory and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2)gene expression in the brain of male and female offspring, as wellas the effect of additional stress exposure within the stress-restress paradigmin prenatally stressed male rats prior to mating with intact femaleson memory and Igf2 expressionin the brain of their offspring of both sexes. We demonstrated thatprenatally stressed males and their F1 male descendants showed improvedmemory in the passive avoidance test and increased Igf2 expression in the hippocampusand cerebral cortex. F1 female descendants of prenatally stressedmales, on the contrary, showed a decrease both in the duration ofmemory retention and in hippocampal and neocortical Igf2 expression. Additional stressexposure of prenatally stressed males prior to mating with intactfemales worsened memory and decreased the duration of its retention,as well as reduced Igf2 expressionin the brain of the offspring of both sexes. We concluded that thetransgenerational effects of prenatal stress on memory and Igf2 brain expression depend on thesex of the offspring, while prenatal stress per se contributes tomemory impairment and a decrease in Igf2 expressionin the offspring brain provided that such males were additionallystressed prior to mating.

AB  - Many of the waterbird species are generally thought to be threatened mainly or at least partly by over hunting. This paper provides novel information on the causal factors that lead to hunting and illegal trade of waterhen Amaurornis phoenicurus in a remote villages of district Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Data were collected by adopting a mix scientific approach including Participants' observations, interviews and structured questionnaire. Our results showed that the local villagers of the remote area of district Mardan were the active observers of trapping, over hunting and trading of waterhen in the study area. The structured interviews with locals revealed striking facts about ongoing hunting and illegal trade by hunters and traders. The two tribes namely Ottomankhail of district Swabi and Mamund of district Buner were identified to be involved in illegal trafficking and trading of waterhen from the study area. The locals revealed that traders and hunters entered the area through two main routes of Sarmalang and Narangi. The hunters and traders of the neighboring districts visit the study area throughout the year, in heavy monsoon rain and even at night. The locals revealed that the local hunters used variety of trapping and hunting tools including traditional traps made up of clothes, smaller pinch traps and bamboo cages, air rifles, shotguns (single and double barrel) and sometimes for full entertainment Kalashnikovs were also used for the killing of medium-sized and large mammals (golden jackal and wild boar) in the study area. Summer appeared to be the best season for hunting. The interviews with locals revealed that the main purpose of trading and hunting of waterhen includes hunting for entertainment purpose, high economic value of waterhen meat in black market, use as a food item and medicine and game hunting. The local politicians, criminal groups and village headmen provide cover to hunters and traders that enable them to continue illegal trade in black market. The ground survey shows that waterhen is facing extreme threats from hunting and illegal trading. The government wildlife department is less equipped to tackle the hunters in the area. We outline a strategic plan for conservation of birds, other wild animals and their habitats.

AB  - Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2), recently detected in the western United States, has the potential to cause mass mortality events in wild rabbit and hare populations. Currently, few management strategies exist other than vaccination. We developed a spatially explicit model of RHDV2 for a population of riparian brush rabbits (Sylvilagus bachmani riparius), a subspecies of brush rabbit classified as endangered in the United States, on a subsection of the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge. The goal of our model was to provide guidance regarding vaccination strategies for an endangered rabbit species. Our model predicts that increased interactions between rabbits (a proxy for landscape connectivity) and disease transmission rates among susceptible hosts (individual brush rabbits and conspecifics) have the greatest influence on the outcome of a potential vaccination campaign. Our model projects that across a range of parameter estimates (given an RHDV2 incursion), the median estimated population size with a 0%-10% vaccination rate after 1 year is 538 rabbits (95% Confidence Interval [C.I.] 69-1235), approximately 36% of the expected size of the study population of 1470 rabbits without an RHDV2 introduction. With a 10%-20%, 20%-30%, or 30%-40% vaccination rate, the median estimated population size increased to 628 rabbits (95% C.I. 130-1298), 723 rabbits (95% C.I. 198-1317), and 774 rabbits (95% C.I. 228-1410), respectively. These estimates represent 43%, 49%, and 53% of the expected population size without an RHDV2 introduction. Overall, a 1% increase in vaccination rate was associated with a six rabbit (95% C.I. 5-7) increase in total remaining population size. This result is dependent on assumptions regarding environmental transmission, home range size (and contact rates of rabbits). Given the relatively short lifespan of rabbits and the potential need for boosters, vaccination programs are most likely to be successful for small target populations where relatively high vaccination rates can be maintained.

AB  - Yeast complexes in the composting process of cow dung prepared to fertilize the soil for growing vegetables and fruits were studied. The average abundance of yeasts changed during the four temperature stages of the composting process. The highest abundance of yeasts, 1.38 x 104 cfu/g, was observed in the second stage of heating from 20 to 40 & DEG;C; the lowest was studied in the stage with the highest temperature (65 & DEG;C), 1.68 x 103 cfu/g. A total of 19 yeast species were observed and identified: 11 ascomycetes and 8 basidiomycetes, belonging to five subphyla of Fungi: Saccharomycotina (10), Pezizomycotina (1), Agaricomycotina (5), Pucciniomycotina (2), and Ustilaginomycotina (1). The greatest diversity of yeasts was found in the initial (20 & DEG;C) and second (heating up to 40 & DEG;C) temperature stages of composting (Aureobasidium pullulans (yeast-like fungus), Candida parapsilosis, Candida saitoana, Candida santamariae, Candida tropicalis, Curvibasidium cygneicollum, Cutaneotrichosporon moniliforme, Debaryomyces fabryi, Debaryomyces hansenii, Filobasidium magnum, Kazachstania sp., Moesziomyces bullatus, Naganishia globosa, Papiliotrema flavescens, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Scheffersomyces insectosa, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Vanrija musci), and the lowest in the stage of maximum heating (65 & DEG;C) (C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, Cyberlindnera jadinii).The opportunistic yeasts C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis were obtained not only in the initial, second and third temperature stages of the composting process, but also in mature compost in the final stage prepared for soil application. This study shows that the cow dung, used in the farm studied did not meet the microbiological safety criteria. The reduction of opportunistic yeast species was not achieved with the composting method used. The likelihood of these species entering agricultural products via compost and soil and developing as endophytes in the internal tissues of fruits is very high. Since some strains of opportunistic Candida species from cow dung exhibited virulent characteristics (they produced hydrolytic enzymes and were resistant to antifungal compounds), additional phenotypic and genetic studies of the compost strains and their comparison with clinical isolates should be pursued.& COPY; 2023 British Mycological Society.

AB  - The Yangtze River Delta white goat is a unique goat species that can produce superior-quality brush hair. The formation of superior-quality brush hair cannot occur without goat hair follicle stem cell differentiation. However, knowledge regarding the regulatory role of miR-149-5p in hair follicle stem cell differentiation is limited. Here, we found that miR-149-5p is widely expressed in the tissues of Yangtze River Delta white goats, but its expression in the skin tissue of superior-quality brush hair goats is high compared to normal- quality goats. The functional studies showed that miR-149-5p overexpression markedly facilitated hair follicle stem cell differentiation, whereas inhibiting miR-149-5p inhibited hair follicle stem cell differentiation. These results more clearly elucidate the regulatory role of miR-149-5p in hair follicle stem cell growth.

AB  - Global warming has added to concerns regarding declining male fertility due to high temperatures. As a metabolite of arginine, putrescine improves gut health and promotes testicular development in boar; however, its action in improving semen quality under heat stress is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effect of putrescine on the semen quality of boars in a heat stress model. Results showed that putrescine ameliorated the heat stressinduced decline in semen quality and testosterone levels in boars, confirmed by sperm viability, immobility rate, and apoptosis levels. Fecal microbial 16S rRNA sequencing showed that heat stress induces intestinal microecological dysregulation triggering an increase in the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and reducing boar semen quality. A negative correlation between the Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group and LPS-binding protein (LBP) levels was observed. The Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group was reduced significantly under heat stress, and its relative abundance significantly increased after putrescine diet, which reduced both LPS and LBP in the serum of heat-stressed boars. Heat stress also affected plasma amino acid metabolism, and the regulation of plasma metabolism by putrescine can be attributed to its effects on LPS and the LBP owing to the significantly correlation of both with multiple plasma differential metabolites. Putrescine is thus considered to inhibit the increased serum LPS by acting on intestinal microorganisms, particularly by increasing the relative abundance of the Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, and further modulate plasma amino acid metabolism to improve the semen quality in heat-stressed boars.

AB  - A total of 297 wolf skulls from the collection of the Central Forest State Biosphere Reserve were studied for the presence of injuries. Of these, 129 (43.4 +/- 2.9%) skulls had traumas of various origins or a deformed sagittal crest. Aside from the sagittal crest, the rate of traumas was 32.3 +/- 2.7%. Based on the causes of origin, the traumas were divided into three groups: those received when hunting moose, as a result of aggressive intraspecific contacts, and accidental. Complicated fractures of dental crowns predominate among accidental traumas. Moose hunting traumas and intraspecific aggression are more common in subadult wolves than in adults, this being explicable by the elimination of injured animals. The incidence of accidental traumas, on the other hand, was increased with age. The level of traumas serves as a population characteristic indicating tension in the predator-prey system and the degree of intraspecific aggression.

AB  - Studies using nonhost plant odors to deter insect pests and protect host plants have reported mixed results. Moreover, how adjacent nonhost plants affect the ability of insect herbivores to locate hosts is unclear. We examined the effects of location of two nonhost rosemary plants (Rosmarinus officinalis) relative to a host peanut plant (Arachis hypogaea) under fixed wind direction on the host-finding ability (number of eggs laid) of Spodoptera exigua. We then correlated the effects with the degree of odor mixing between the host and nonhost plants. Subsequently, we investigated whether row orientation affects the ability of insects to find hosts. The degree of odor mixing between host and nonhost plants was greater when the rosemary plants were upwind and downwind than when they were crosswind from the peanut plants. Closer plant spacing resulted in more odor mixing. The number of eggs laid on peanut plants was reduced when the degree of odor mixing was high. When rosemary plants were replaced with odorless plastic plants, the odorless plants upwind and downwind from the peanut plant were also associated with fewer eggs laid. In the field, significantly fewer eggs were laid on peanut plants when the row orientation was perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. Nonhost rosemary plant location relative to the host plant significantly affected the host-finding ability of S. exigua by influencing the degree of odor mixing between host and nonhost plants and by physical barrier effects of nonhost plants. Our results may provide insights for future pest management strategies.

AB  - Background In ecosystems influenced by strong seasonal variation in insolation, the fitness of diverse taxa depends on seasonal movements to track resources along latitudinal or elevational gradients. Deep pelagic ecosystems, where sunlight is extremely limited, represent Earth's largest habitable space and yet ecosystem phenology and effective animal movement strategies in these systems are little understood. Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) provide a valuable acoustic window into this world: the echolocation clicks they produce while foraging in the deep sea are the loudest known biological sounds on Earth and convey detailed information about their behavior. Methods We analyze seven years of continuous passive acoustic observations from the Central California Current System, using automated methods to identify both presence and demographic information from sperm whale echolocation clicks. By integrating empirical results with individual-level movement simulations, we test hypotheses about the movement strategies underlying sperm whales' long-distance movements in the Northeast Pacific. Results We detect foraging sperm whales of all demographic groups year-round in the Central California Current System, but also identify significant seasonality in frequency of presence. Among several previously hypothesized movement strategies for this population, empirical acoustic observations most closely match simulated results from a population undertaking a "seasonal resource-tracking migration", in which individuals move to track moderate seasonal-latitudinal variation in resource availability. Discussion Our findings provide evidence for seasonal movements in this cryptic top predator of the deep sea. We posit that these seasonal movements are likely driven by tracking of deep-sea resources, based on several lines of evidence: (1) seasonal-latitudinal patterns in foraging sperm whale detection across the Northeast Pacific; (2) lack of demographic variation in seasonality of presence; and (3) the match between simulations of seasonal resource-tracking migration and empirical results. We show that sperm whales likely track oceanographic seasonality in a manner similar to many surface ocean predators, but with dampened seasonal-latitudinal movement patterns. These findings shed light on the drivers of sperm whales' long-distance movements and the shrouded phenology of the deep-sea ecosystems in which they forage.

AB  - Simple Summary The gut microbiota are involved in the metabolism of nutrients, and the growth and development of pig is strongly influenced by the gut microbiome. To maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier and promote the digestion and absorption of nutrients and other physiological activities, it is beneficial if the host has a stable gut microbial community. The composition of the gut microbiota is influenced by many factors, such as genetic and environmental factors, and it changes with age. Throughout pig growth and development, the porcine gut microbiota constantly changes in composition. This study investigated the regulation of growth and development of body weight and body size index. We further examined changes in gut microbiota during early and finishing growth stages in Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. Results showed that the microbiota of Landrace and Yorkshire pigs were more similar compared with Duroc pigs. There were significant differences in gut microbiota in the early and late growth stages. This study underlines the longitudinal variation in breed and lateral variation in age in gut microbiota. The gut microbiota affects the metabolism, health and growth rate of pigs. Understanding the characteristics of gut microbiota of different pig breeds at each growth stage will enable the design of individualized feeding strategies. The present study aimed to compare the growth curves and development patterns of pigs of three different breeds (Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire) using the mathematical models Gompertz, Logistic, Von Bertalanffy and Richards. For Duroc pigs, the Gompertz model showed the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.9974). In contrast, the best models for Landrace and Yorkshire pigs were Richards (R-2 = 0.9986) and Von Bertalanffy (R-2 = 0.9977), respectively. Path analysis showed that body length (path coefficient = 0.507) and chest circumference (path coefficient = 0.532) contributed more significantly to the body weight of pigs at the early growth stage, while hip circumference (path coefficient = 0.312) had a greater influence on pig body weight in the late growth stage. Moreover, the composition of the gut microbiota of pigs at two growth stages (60 kg of body weight in the early growth stage and 120 kg in the finishing stage) was studied using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Variations in gut microbiota composition of pigs at different growth stages were observed. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of annotated metagenomes revealed that protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism pathways were significantly enriched in pigs at the early growth stage, which may be related to nutritional requirements of pigs during this stage. This study confirmed longitudinal variation in the gut microbiota of pigs pertaining to age as well as lateral variation related to pig breed. The present findings expand the current understanding of the variations in swine gut microbiota during production stages.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hCG injection on Day 3, 4 or 5 post-induction of ovulation on corpus luteum (CL) function in llamas and then, to evaluate its effect on pregnant animals. After induction of ovulation with buserelin (Day 0), llamas were randomly assigned to one of four groups: hCG3 (n = 5), hCG4 (n = 5), hCG5 (n = 5) or control (n = 5), receiving an injection of 750 IU of hCG on Day 3, 4 or 5 or 1.5 ml of saline solution, respectively. All females were examined by transrectal doppler ultrasonography, every other day from Day 6 until Day 12. Blood samples for P4 determination were collected daily from Day 2 to Day 8 and every other day until Day 12. Llamas with hCG4 showed higher plasma P4 concentration on Day 10, higher AUC and plasma P4 remained above 1 ng ml-1 for more days than the control group. Based on these results, Study 2 was performed. Llamas were mated and randomly divided in "Treated" (n = 10) and "Control" (n = 10) group, receiving an injection of 750 IU of hCG or saline solution on Day 4 post-induction of ovulation, respectively. Doppler ultrasonography and blood collection for P4 evaluation were also performed daily, from Day 6 until Day 16 post mating. Plasma P4 concentration post-mating tended to be greater in pregnant treated llamas than in non-treated pregnant females. These results suggest that hCG administration on Day 4 has a luteotropic effect.

AB  - In this study, the heat resistance of S. aureus in goats' raw milk subjected to thermisation temperatures was characterised through tests at various temperatures and modelling the survival curves using the Weibull model, through a two-step and an omnibus approach, which can model a full dataset covering all experimental conditions in one step. The fitting capacity of the secondary models obtained from the two-step approach was reasonable (adj. R-2 > 0.639) and both demonstrated the negative linear effects of temperature on root chi (p = 0.0004) and root beta (p = 0.017). The fitting capacity of the omnibus model was more satisfactory (adj. R-2 = 0.996) and also hinted at the negative linear effect of temperature on root chi (p < 0.0001), with the added advantage that, in this model, random effects can be used to account for the variability in the parameters. Our study estimated the significant inactivation parameters and established a model capable of predicting S. aureus behaviour at various temperatures. This information is useful to create time-temperature tables to reach target log reductions of S. aureus in goats' raw milk to be used by artisanal cheesemakers; hence providing an opportunity to increase the microbiological safety of cheeses made from unpasteurised milk.

AB  - Many marine herbivorous fishes harbour diverse microbial communities in the hindgut that can play important roles in host health and nutrition. Kyphosus sydneyanus is a temperate marine herbivorous fish that feeds predominantly on brown seaweeds. We employed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and gas chromatography to characterize microbial communities and their metabolites in different hindgut regions of six K. sydneyanus. Measurements were confined to three distal sections of the intestine, labelled III, IV and V from anterior to posterior. A total of 625 operational taxonomic units from 20 phyla and 123 genera were obtained. Bacteroidota, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the major phyla in mean relative abundance, which varied along the gut. Firmicutes (76%) was the most dominant group in section III, whereas Bacteroidota (69.3%) dominated section V. Total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration was highest in sections IV and V, confirming active fermentation in these two most distal sections. The abundance of Bacteroidota correlated with propionate concentration in section V, while Firmicutes positively correlated with formate in sections III and IV. Acetate levels were highest in sections IV and V, which correlated with abundance of Bacteroidota. Despite differences in gut microbial community composition, SCFA profiles were consistent between individual fish in the different hindgut regions of K. sydneyanus, although proportions of SCFAs differed among gut sections. These findings demonstrate functional compartmentalization of the hindgut microbial community, highlighting the need for regional sampling when interpreting overall microbiome function. These results support previous work suggesting that hindgut microbiota in marine herbivorous fish are important to nutrition in some host species by converting dietary carbohydrates into metabolically useful SCFAs.

AB  - Wildlife agencies in North America desire to incorporate broader public interests into decision-making so they can realize the principle of governing wildlife in the public trust. Public satisfaction is a key component of good governance but evaluating satisfaction with wildlife management focuses on traditional user experiences rather than perceptions of agency performance. We draw from political science, business, and conservation social science to develop a multidimensional concept of satisfaction with wildlife management that includes agency performance, service quality, trust in the managing agency, and informational trust. We use data collected from a 2021 survey of Indiana residents to analyze the social and cognitive determinants of satisfaction with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) management. Quantile regression models revealed that respondents' acceptability of management methods and deer-related concerns most strongly affected performance and quality components, whereas respondent characteristics mostly affected trust components of the index. Future research should associate satisfaction with key variables we did not fully capture including perceived control, psychological distance, and norms of interaction between wildlife agencies and the public. Expanding agency conceptions of public satisfaction represents a critical step toward public trust thinking and the practice of good wildlife governance in North America.

AB  - Fipronil is widely used as a broad-spectrum insecticide in agriculture, urban environments, and veterinary medicine. Fipronil can enter aquatic ecosystems and spread to sediment and organic matter, representing a risk to non-target species. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of short-term (96 h) exposure to a low and realistic concentration of sediment-associated fipronil (4.2 mu g.kg(-1) of Regent (R) 800 WG) on myocardial contractility of armored catfish Hypostomus regain, a benthic fish species. Fipronil exposure induced increased inotropism and acceleration of contractile kinetics, although no alterations in the relative ventricular mass were observed. This better cardiac function was associated with an elevated expression and/or function of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and its marked contribution to contraction and relaxation, probably due to a stress-induced adrenergic stimulation. Ventricle strips of exposed fish also exhibited a faster relaxation and a higher cardiac pumping capacity, indicating that armored catfish were able to perform cardiac adjustments to face the exposure. However, a high energetic cost to maintain an increased cardiac performance can make fish more susceptible to other stressors, impairing developmental processes and/or survival. These findings highlight the need for regulations of emerging contaminants, such as fipronil, to ensure adequate protection of the aquatic system.

AB  - The dairy sheep sector is an important sector in semiarid and arid areas. So far, the environmental impact of sheep milk production in these areas is scarcely known. This study aimed to assess the environmental impact of milk production on three farms that differ in the breed reared, namely Sarda (S), Lacaune (L) and Massese (M), in Tuscany (a Mediterranean region in central Italy). The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was applied to calculate the environmental performance of the farms, and the following impact categories were studied: climate change, freshwater, marine and terrestrial eutrophication, acidification, water use and land use. The L farm showed the lowest values for most impact categories and the M farm the highest. These results can be attributed to the greater productivity and efficiency of the L breed compared to the other two. Only for water use did the M farm cause a lower impact, underscoring the importance of applying characterization factors at the sub-watershed level.

AB  - Plant resistance includes mechanical and chemical defenses that reduce herbivory, whereas plant tolerance reduces the fitness impact of herbivory. Because defenses are costly and investing in both resistance and tolerance may be superfluous, trade-offs among them are expected. In forest ecosystems, the mechanical strengthening of leaves is linked both to shade adaptation and antiherbivore defenses, but it also compromises resource uptake, therefore limiting regrowth following damage, suggesting a trade-off between mechanical defenses and tolerance. We tested for the resistance-tolerance trade-off across 11 common tree species in a temperate rainforest and explored mechanistic explanations by measuring chemical and mechanical defenses. Herbivory damage was negatively associated with leaf toughness and fiber content, whereas there was no significant relationship between herbivory and secondary metabolites (flavonols, gallic acid, tannins, and terpenoids). We detected a resistance-tolerance trade-off, as expected. We found a negative relationship between mechanical defenses and tolerance, estimated as the survival ratio between experimentally damaged and undamaged seedlings. Tolerance and secondary metabolites showed no significant association. Results suggest that selective forces other than herbivory acting on defensive traits can favor a resistance-tolerance trade-off. Therefore, plant adaptation to contrasting light environments may contribute to the evolution of resistance-tolerance trade-offs.

KW  - PATTERNS
AB  - Manas National Park (MNP) is located in the foothills of the Himalayas along the border between India and Bhutan. The original greater one-horned rhino population (Rhinoceros unicornis) of the Park was annihilated in the year 2000 by poaching. Less than a decade later, a new rhino population was reintroduced with the support of Indian Rhino Vision 2020, as part of a wider programme that included infrastructure (PWS). Post-release monitoring was carried out over a six-year period, from 2008-2013, during which 10 animals (three adult males, four adult females, and three calves) were monitored continuously, using radio telemetry to track collared animals, and direct observation to monitor their behaviour. The study period yielded 4,941 radio-tracked locations and 3,711 observations, which provided sex/age specific seasonal data on activity patterns, home ranges, association patterns, habitat preferences, and 'stray incidents' when animals wandered outside the Park boundaries. Some differences from behaviour patterns observed in high floodrisk areas such as KNP and PWS were attributable to MNP's slightly higher elevation that protects rhinos from annual river floods. Overall, however, the translocated rhinos did not exhibit significant differences in their behaviour and ranging patterns compared to wild rhino populations documented in previous studies. This suggests that the translocated rhinos were able to adapt effectively to their new environment. The first calf was born to a translocated adult female in 2011 and, by 2022, the population of rhinos in MNP was estimated at 50 individuals, including 38 calves born following the reintroduction. This study demonstrates the potential of well-managed translocation schemes to contribute to the recovery of endangered rhinos.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of adding corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) to the diet on the meat quality, chemical composition, fatty acid composition, and lipidomics profiling in the longissimus thoracis (LT) of finishing pigs. Twenty-four healthy crossbred pigs (average body weight 61.23 +/- 3.25 kg) were randomly divided into two groups with three replicates per group and four pigs per pen. The control group (CON) was fed a basal diet, and the DDGS group was fed an experimental diet with 30% DDGS. The results show that adding DDGS to the diet increases the yellowness (b*), chroma (C*), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) percentages, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) percentages and iodine value of LT (p < 0.05). Based on LC-ESI-MS/MS, 1456 lipids from 6 classes or 44 subclasses in LT were analyzed, and 50 differential lipids were observed. Triglyceride (TG) with C18:2n-6 side chains and ceramide alpha-hydroxy fatty acid-sphingosine (Cer-AS) contents increased significantly, and the decrease in multiple glycerophospholipids (GPs) content may be related to differences in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. Correlation analysis suggests that triglycerides with C18:2n-6 side chains may be one of the reasons for the changes in b* and C* values in the LT. In conclusion, feeding DDGS affects the meat quality and fatty acid composition and may affect the lipid profile in the LT of finishing pigs by regulating lipid metabolism.

AB  - Extant crocodilian jaws are subject to functional demands induced by feeding and hydrodynamics. However, the morphological and ecological diversity of extinct crocodile-line archosaurs is far greater than that of living crocodilians, featuring repeated convergence towards disparate ecologies including armoured herbivores, terrestrial macropredators and fully marine forms. Crocodile-line archosaurs, therefore, present a fascinating case study for morphological and functional divergence and convergence within a clade across a wide range of ecological scenarios. Here, we build performance landscapes of two-dimensional theoretical jaw shapes to investigate the influence of strength, speed and hydrodynamics in the morphological evolution of crocodile-line archosaur jaws, and test whether ecologically convergent lineages evolved similarly optimal jaw function. Most of the 243 sampled jaw morphologies occupy optimized regions of theoretical morphospace for either rotational efficiency, resistance to Von Mises stress, hydrodynamic efficiency or a trade-off between multiple functions, though some seemingly viable shapes remain unrealized. Jaw speed is optimized only in a narrow region of morphospace whereas many shapes possess optimal jaw strength, which may act as a minimum boundary rather than a strong driver for most taxa. This study highlights the usefulness of theoretical morphology in assessing functional optimality, and for investigating form-function relationships in diverse clades.

AB  - In this paper, we described fossils from six mammal taxa (Coendou magnus Cuvier, 1823; Nothrotherium maquinense (Lund, 1839); Tamandua tetradactyla (Linnaeus, 1758); Leopardus wiedii (Schinz, 1821); Didelphis sp.; and Dicotyles tajacu (Linnaeus, 1758)) found in Toca da Barriguda cave (Campo Formoso, Bahia, Brazil). To better understand the isotopic paleoecology of these taxa, AMS radiocarbon dating and carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses were performed. The radiocarbon ages indicate the occurrence of Condou magnus at 33,171-33,765 Cal yr BP, Tamandua tetradactyla at 43,944-44,496 Cal yr BP, Leopardus wiedii at 45,475-46,157 Cal yr BP, and Didelphis sp. at similar to 50,227 cal yr BP. Of these taxa, five were carnivorous/omnivorous, only Coendou magnus was herbivorous and lived in low-density forest and arboreal savanna habitats (delta C-13 = -12.8 parts per thousand to -8.4 parts per thousand; p(i)C(3) = 80-90%) during the late Pleistocene. An increase in a dry climate in the region between 50 cal kyr BP (delta O-18 = 27.1 parts per thousand) and 27 cal kyr BP (delta O-18 = 34.0 parts per thousand) was suggested based on the oxygen isotopic values found in the mammalian bone fossils, which presents similarity and good correlation with the oxygen isotopic values recorded in stalagmites from two caves in Brazil.

AB  - To clarify the improvement effect of organic fertilizer application on peanut continuous cropping obstacles, a field plot experiment was conducted in a plot that had been continuously cropped with peanut for 5 years. Equal amounts of nitrogen were applied to the plot using charcoal-based fertilizer (T2), pig manure compost (T3), and chicken manure compost (T4), while chemical fertilizer (T1) and no fertilizer (CK) were used as controls. The study investigated peanut agronomic traits, yield and its contributing factors, soil physical and chemical properties, and peanut leaf diseases. The results showed that all three types of organic fertilizers could significantly promote peanut growth, with the T3 performing the best. The main stem height, length of the first lateral branch, and number of branches per plant in the T3 were 31.45%, 21.28%, and 26.32% higher than those in the CK, respectively. There was no significant difference between the T2 and T4 s in terms of main stem height and number of branches per plant compared to the T3. In terms of yield and its contributing factors, the performance of organic fertilizers was significantly better than that of the T1 and CK s. Among them, the T3 had the highest yield, which was 36.81% and 22.07% higher than that of the CK and T1 s, respectively. There was no significant difference between the T4 and the T3. The T2 and T4 s had the highest hundred-pod weight, while the T3 and T4 s had the lowest number of pods per kilogram. There was no significant difference in hundred -kernel weight among the three types of organic fertilizers. In terms of soil physical and chemical properties, the application of organic fertilizers significantly increased soil pH, porosity, field water holding capacity, and decreased soil bulk density compared to chemical fertilizer and no-fertilizer s. There was no significant difference in these indicators among the organic fertilizer s. In terms of soil nutrient content, all fertilization s significantly increased the content of total nitrogen, alkaline nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium in the soil. Among them, the organic fertilizer treatments were significantly better than the chemical fertilizer in terms of total nitrogen and available phosphorus content. Additionally, organic fertilizer s significantly increased the soil organic carbon content, with the T2 having the highest organic carbon content, which was 20.56% higher than that of the CK. In terms of soil phenolic acid content, organic fertilizer s significantly reduced the content of vanillic acid and coumarin in the soil, with the lowest coumarin content observed in the T3 and T4 s. In terms of peanut leaf diseases, the disease index of peanut leaf spot and brown spot were significantly lower in the organic fertilizer s than in the no-fertilizer and chemical fertilizer s, but there was no significant difference between the different organic fertilizer s. After the comprehensive evaluation of the affiliation function method, it can be found that T4 can alleviate the continuous cropping obstacle to the greatest extent. The conclusion drawn from this study is that biochar-based fertilizer, pig manure compost, and chicken manure compost can all promote growth, increase yield, improve soil environmental quality, and provide certain disease prevention and control effects for peanut plants under continuous cropping obstacles. It is recommended to choose organic fertilizer for application in areas where peanut continuous cropping is more serious in a timely and site-specific manner.

AB  - A significant amount of fruit and vegetable wastes is generated annually in markets, supermarkets, restaurants and households. Anaerobic digestion allows their appropriate management and helps to complete the cycle of the circular economy as it converts wastes into resources: biogas, a renewable source of energy, and digestate, rich in nutrients of interest for agriculture. The aim of this study was to define the agronomic value of digestate from fruit and vegetable wastes. Two digestates from fruit and vegetable residues were used in incubation experiments for C and N mineralisation in the soil, and in a pot experiment with crops (cardoon and maize), to calculate their fertiliser potential in comparison with a mineral fertiliser. The digestate quickly mineralised in the soil and nitrification processes led to fast formation of NO3--N. However, increasing the digestate application rate enhanced N-immobilisation and reduced N-mineralisation in the soil. The addition of digestates to the soil resulted in adequate plant growth and nutrient composition, without any negative effects on the plants or soil. However, special attention should be paid to the salt accumulation in the soil for long-term digestate application. The nutrient recovery efficiency indicated that digestate could replace mineral fertiliser completely in cardoon crops and partially (44.5-82.6%) for maize, with an associated economic benefit. The salinity of the digestates limits their quality and their agricultural use to salt-sensitive crops should be limited.

AB  - Sect. Tuberculata, as one of the endemic plant groups in China, belongs to the genus Camellia of the Theaceae family and possesses significant economic and ecological value. Nevertheless, the characteristics of habitat distribution and the major eco-environmental variables affecting its suitability are poorly understood. In this study, using 65 occurrence records, along with 60 environmental factors, historical, present and future suitable habitats were estimated using MaxEnt modeling, and the important environmental variables affecting the geographical distribution of sect. Tuberculata were analyzed. The results indicate that the size of the its potential habitat area in the current climate was 1.05 x 10(5) km(2), and the highly suitable habitats were located in Guizhou, central-southern Sichuan, the Wuling Mountains in Chongqing, the Panjiang Basin, and southwestern Hunan. The highest probability of presence for it occurs at mean diurnal range (bio2) <= 7.83 degrees C, basic saturation (s_bs) <= 53.36%, temperature annual range (bio7) <= 27.49 degrees C, -7.75 degrees C < mean temperature of driest quarter (bio9) < 7.75 degrees C, annual UV-B seasonality (uvb2) <= 1.31 x 10(5) W/m(2), and mean UV-B of highest month (uvb3) <= 5089.61 W/m(2). In particular, bio2 is its most important environmental factor. During the historical period, the potential habitat area for sect. Tuberculata was severely fragmented; in contrast, the current period has a more concentrated habitat area. In the three future periods, the potential habitat area will change by varying degrees, depending on the aggressiveness of emissions reductions, and the increase in the potential habitat area was the largest in the SSP2.6 (Low-concentration greenhouse gas emissions) scenario. Although the SSP8.5 (High-concentration greenhouse gas emissions) scenario indicated an expansion in its habitat in the short term, its growth and development would be adversely affected in the long term. In the centroid analysis, the centroid of its potential habitat will shift from lower to higher latitudes in the northwest direction. The findings of our study will aid efforts to uncover its originsand geographic differentiation, conservation of unique germplasms, and forestry development and utilization.

AB  - Cervids are characterized by their greatest karyotypic diversity among mammals. A great diversity of chromosome numbers in notably similar morphological groups leads to the existence of several complexes of cryptic species and taxonomic uncertainties. Some deer lineages, such as those of Neotropical deer, stand out for a rapid chromosomal reorganization and intraspecific chromosome polymorphisms, which have not been properly explored yet. For that reason, we contribute to the study of deer karyotype diversity and taxonomy by producing and characterizing new molecular cytogenetic markers for the gray brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira), a deer species that retained the hypothetical ancestral karyotype of Cervidae. We used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones derived from the cattle genome (Bos taurus) as markers, which were hybridized on S. gouazoubira metaphase chromosomes. In total, we mapped 108 markers, encompassing all gray brocket deer chromosomes, except the Y chromosome. The detailed analysis of fluorescent in situ hybridization results showed 6 fissions and 1 fusion as interchromosomal rearrangements that have separated cattle and gray brocket deer karyotypes. Each group of BAC probes derived from bovine chromosome pairs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 showed hybridization signals on 2 different chromosomes, while pairs 28 and 26 are fused in tandem in a single acrocentric chromosome in S. gouazoubira. Furthermore, the BAC markers detected the occurrence of intrachromosomal rearrangements in the S. gouazoubira chromosomes homologous to pair 1 and the X chromosome of cattle. We present a karyotypic map of the 108 new markers, which will be of great importance for future karyotypic evolution studies in cervids and, consequently, help in their conservation and taxonomy resolution.

AB  - Levels of heavy metals and organic contaminants in main waters from China were reviewed from literature data to assess the ecological risks of pollutants for wetland birds and the biotransport of pollutants mediated by migratory wetland birds. Cr, Cu, and Pb and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dominated in sediments, with higher concentrations in rivers and estuaries than in lakes and seas. Plants are the main dietary sources of less hydrophobic organic pollutants, while sediment is the primary source of more hydrophobic PAHs in birds. The hazard index (HI) for birds was mainly contributed by mercury (Hg) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and ranked as piscivore > omnivore > herbivore. Pollutant exposure risks to birds depend on the biomagnification potential of pollutants, food items of birds, and pollution levels in habitats. Migratory birds are important biovectors of persistent and bioaccumulative pollutants that may serve as a vital geochemical cycling process in addition to atmospheric deposition. This study provided a comprehensive overview of water environment pollution in China and the potential risks for high trophic level wetland birds in aquatic ecosystems. The results also identified the pollution hotspots of wetland birds and habitats, which provide new insights into bird conservation and biodiversity protection.

AB  - Simple Summary: The development of the sheep industry plays an important role in increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen and promoting rural revitalization. Genetic improvement is the key to improving the competitiveness of the sheep industry. Tianhua mutton sheep, as China's first mutton fine wool sheep adapted to alpine pastures, have a key advantage over Gansu alpine fine wool sheep in terms of adaptive ability. In order to show the differences in rumen development and microbial structure between Tianhua mutton sheep and Gansu alpine fine wool sheep, the present study was conducted to comprehensively investigate the rumen of the two types of fine wool sheep by Hematoxylin Eosin (H&E) staining, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) assay, and full-length sequencing of 16S rRNA. The results showed that Tianhua mutton sheep had a better performance in the rumen volatile fatty acid content, rumen tissue development, and rumen microorganisms compared with Gansu alpine fine wool sheep, and this study provided a good theoretical explanation for the better adaptation of Tianhua mutton sheep to alpine pastures compared with Gansu alpine fine wool sheep. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the differences in rumen tissue morphology, volatile fatty acid content, and rumen microflora between Tianhua mutton sheep and Gansu alpine fine wool sheep under the same grazing conditions. Twelve 30-day-old lambs were randomly selected from two different flocks in Duolong Village and grazed together for a period of 150 days. The rumen tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and brought back to the laboratory for H&E staining, the volatile fatty acid content of the rumen contents was detected by gas chromatography, and the rumen flora structure was sequenced by full-length sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the PacBio sequencing platform. The acetic acid and total acid contents of the rumen contents of Tianhua mutton sheep were significantly higher than those of Gansu alpine fine wool sheep (p < 0.05). The rumen papillae height of Tianhua mutton sheep was significantly higher than that of Gansu alpine fine wool sheep (p < 0.05). The diversity and richness of the rumen flora of Tianhua mutton sheep were higher than those of Gansu alpine fine wool sheep, and Beta analysis showed that the microflora structure of the two fine wool sheep was significantly different. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated the rumen flora of Tianhua mutton sheep and Gansu alpine fine wool sheep. At the genus level, the dominant strains were Christensenellaceae_R_7_group and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group. LEfSe analysis showed that Prevotella was a highly abundant differential species in Tianhua mutton sheep and lachnospiraccac was a highly abundant differential species in Gansu alpine fine wool sheep. Finally, both the KEGG and COG databases showed that the enrichment of biometabolic pathways, such as replication and repair and translation, were significantly higher in Tianhua mutton sheep than in Gansu alpine fine wool sheep (p < 0.05). In general, there were some similarities between Tianhua mutton sheep and Gansu alpine fine wool sheep in the rumen tissue morphology, rumen fermentation ability, and rumen flora structure. However, Tianhua mutton sheep had a better performance in the rumen acetic acid content, rumen papillae height, and beneficial bacteria content. These differences may be one of the reasons why Tianhua mutton sheep are more suitable for growing in alpine pastoral areas than Gansu alpine fine wool sheep.

AB  - Substantial increases in global temperature are projected for the coming decades due to climate change. Considering that temperature has a strong influence on insect voltinism (i.e., number of generations per year), climate change may affect the population growth of insects, with potential consequences for food production. The southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania, is a multivoltine species native to the American tropics that causes severe damage to several crops. In this context, this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the voltinism of S. eridania in southern Brazil. Current and future daily temperature data were combined with non-linear and degree-day models to estimate the voltinism of this pest. Under current climate conditions, the voltinism of S. eridania ranged from 2.9 to 9.2 generations, with fewer cohorts in colder regions and more in warmer ones. A higher number of generations was predicted for the future climate scenarios evaluated, reaching up to 12.1 annual generations in certain regions by 2070. Most of the variation in voltinism was explained by location (87.7%) and by the interaction between location and mathematical model (3.0%). The degree-day model estimated an increase in the number of generations in the entire study area, while the non-linear model predicted a decrease in voltinism in the warmer regions under future climate change scenarios. Given these differences between the predictions provided by degree-day and non-linear models, the selection of the best method to be used in climate change studies should be carried out carefully, considering how species respond to temperature. A considerable increase in the number of generations of S. eridania was projected for most of the study area under the climate change scenarios evaluated, suggesting a possible rise in pest incidence levels in the coming decades.

AB  - In our experiment, the effect of electrical and CO2 stunning on pork meat quality attributes was studied. A total of thirty PIC337 female pigs were allocated to two equal groups which were stunned electrically (50 Hz, 210 V, 2.6 A, 15 s) or by CO2 (85 V% CO2, 15 V% O-2, 90 s) and slaughtered at a commercial slaughterhouse. For 24 h post mortem, the carcass m. gluteus medius (GM) was used to evaluate meat quality attributes such as pH, color, hardness, water holding capacity (WHC), and total pigment content, and meat classification was also carried out. The CO2 stunning resulted in muscle with significantly lower pH (p < 0.01) and poorer water holding capacity (p < 0.05) compared to electrical stunning. The GM of pigs stunned electrically showed significantly increased lightness (L*) and redness (a*) (p < 0.05) compared to CO2-stunned. The time course of development of rigor mortis was similar for both stunning methods. Pale, soft, exudative (PSE) or dark, firm, dry (DFD) meat defects were not observed. Based on total pigment content, stunning methods did not significantly affect the amount of removable blood.

AB  - This is the first paper to intensively examine the history of pinon nuts, the seeds of the pinon pine ( Pinus edulis), which Indigenous Americans have harvested in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest for millennia. The history of the pinon nut industry is reconstructed from its inception in the mid-19th century in the New Mexico Territory to its heyday in the early 20th century until consumption began to decline in the mid-20th century. Additionally, this paper provides some suggestions for reviving this iconic Southwestern American food. The commercial harvest of pinon nuts primarily involved Native and Mexican Americans. While the economic benefits of pinon nut harvesting were significant, the work was often dangerous, with reports of deaths due to exposure, accidents, and violence. Pinon nut production varied yearly due to the trees' masting behavior, where trees produce large seed crops intermittently. Although there was considerable interest in cultivation during the early 20th century, slow growth and delayed nut-bearing limited cultivation efforts. Pinon nuts were popular throughout the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gaining popularity, especially among immigrant communities in New York. In 1918, Fannie Spitz patented a pinon nut-shelling machine, significantly improving processing efficiency and impacting the industry by enabling quicker and more effective removal of kernels. Shelled pinon nuts were now sold for consumption out of hand and also for use in candy production. Farmers experimented with feeding hogs and chickens pinon nuts. However, this practice did not become widespread due to the availability of cheaper corn. Pinon wood was also valued for its use as firewood and in mining as props, though it had limited application as lumber for railroad ties. At the same time, smaller pinon trees gained popularity as Christmas trees. Pinon resin was chewed and also used medicinally in salves. By the mid-20th century, pinon nuts lost popularity to peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea), which were marketed more aggressively and produced in higher quantities at lower prices. The pinon industry has struggled with crop variability, low supply, and high prices. Still, it might be revived with improved marketing, working cooperatively and through the construction of a strategic reserve to ensure a steady supply of pinon nuts every year, through both good and bad harvests.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria is an important dominant bacterial community in the intestinal tract, which can regulate the intestinal environment and maintain the balance of intestinal flora. However, there are few studies on Tibetan pig lactic acid bacteria. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria from Tibetan pig feces, and to provide experimental materials for the development and utilization of Tibetan pig probiotics. Seventeen strains of Lactobacillus isolated from Tibetan pig manure were identified by physiology, biochemistry, 16S rRNA molecular biology and acid and bile salt tolerance tests. The results showed that, screened strain is Lactobacillus Roy's F1. Tibetan pig source Roy's Lactobacillus F1 showed the ability to grow maximum when the inoculation was 1%, the temperature 37 degree celsius and pH = 7. This strain depicted a strong tolerance for artificial gastric and intestinal juice. Roy's Lactobacillus F1 can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella. Lactobacillus reuteri F1 also showed a strong hydrophobicity and self-agglutination ability. It is sensitive to butamicane, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cefazolin, norfloxacin, cotrimoxazole and other antibiotics, and has resistance for ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and so on. In this study, one strain of Tibetan Porcine Lactobacillus was screened, obtained, and its biological characteristics were found good, which could provide reference and support for the development and utilization of Tibetan porcine probiotics.

AB  - The morphology and oxidation state of arsenic in its compounds affects the skin cell toxicity. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to explore the effects of two different arsenic compounds on the proliferation and survival of Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts. Based on MTT assay results, at 24 h, the proliferation concentration, critical concentration, and half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of sodium arsenite were 0.50, 5.00, and 45.66 mu mol/L, respectively. The corresponding values for dimethyl arsenic acid were 0.85, 1.00, and 38.68 mmol/L. Immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) assays showed that sodium arsenite promotes microtubule polymerization and increases MMP, while cells treated with dimethyl arsenic acid exhibited cytoskeletal collapse and decreased MMP. In the IC50 groups for both arsenic agents, the cytoskeletons collapsed, microtubules were gathered into bundles, and MMP was significantly decreased. Dimethyl arsenic acid had a stronger effect on MMP than sodium arsenite. Flow cytometry revealed a slightly lower occurrence of apoptosis in the sodium arsenite proliferation group, while it was slightly increased in the dimethyl arsenic acid proliferation group. Apoptosis was increased more significantly in the sodium arsenite IC50 group than in the dimethyl arsenic acid IC50 group. These results indicate that the differences in cell proliferation and cytotoxicity induced by inorganic and organic arsenic are related to their effects on cellular structures.

AB  - Carprofen can be used in the castration process of male goats due to its low side effects, long elimination half-life, and long-term effect. However, no studies were found on the pharmacokinetics and physiological efficacy of carprofen when employed for castration in male goats. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of xylazine (0.05 mg/kg, intramuscular) on the pharmacokinetics and physiological efficacy following intravenous administration of carprofen (4 mg/kg, intravenous) in male goat kids castrated using the burdizzo method. Thirty male Kilis goat kids (5-6 months and 18-30 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 6) as follows: healthy control (HC), castration control (CAST), castration+carprofen (CAST+CRP), castration+xylazine (CAST+XYL), and castration+xylazine+carprofen (CAST+XYL+CRP). Plasma concentrations of carprofen were analyzed via a non-compartmental method. Physiological parameters including serum cortisol, scrotal temperature, rectal temperature, and scrotal circumference were determined. Xylazine caused a decrease in the volume of distribution and clearance and an increase in the area under the curve of carprofen in CAST+XYL+CRP group (p < 0.05). The mean cortisol concentrations in CAST+CRP and CAST+XYL remained lower compared to CAST (p < 0.05). The mean cortisol concentrations in CAST+XYL+CRP were lower than in CAST+CRP and CAST+XYL (p < 0.05). In addition, the effect of carprofen administration alone on reducing the initial cortisol response to castration was observed from 6 to 48 h, while in combination with xylazine, it was observed immediately up to 48 h. No treatment differences were observed in rectal temperature, scrotal temperature, and scrotal circumference (p > 0.05). Xylazine caused an increase in plasma concentration and a decrease in clearance of carprofen after co-administration. However, when the effect of the combined administration of carprofen with xylazine on cortisol is evaluated, their combined use in castration process may be beneficial.

AB  - Simple Summary Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is a byproduct of bioethanol industry, and it contains crude protein of 25% to 31% and ether extract of 9% to 13%. DDGS produced from bioethanol industry in United States (US) are predominately low fat (3-5%). Nutritional profile of low-fat DDGS (LF-DDGS) showed that it is suitable feedstuff for livestock including goats and may reduce the production cost. However, there are limited studies on the effect of low-fat DDGS (LF-DDGS) in goats. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding different amounts of LF-DDGS on growth performance, growth efficiency, rumen fermentation, blood metabolites, and carcass characteristics of Kiko crossbred wether goats. The study was conducted for 84 days, feeding different amounts of LF-DDGS. The results suggest that up to 30% LF-DDGS can be included in diets of castrated male goats without affecting the growth performance and carcass characteristics. Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) produced in US are predominately low fat, as the economics favor separating as much oil as possible for sale as renewable diesel feedstock and also for use in swine and poultry feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding different amounts of low-fat DDGS (LF-DDGS) on growth performance, growth efficiency, rumen fermentation, blood metabolites, and carcass characteristics of Kiko crossbred wether goats. Twenty-four goats, 5-6 months of age, were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental diets (n = 6/diet), 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% LF-DDGS on an as-fed basis, and fed for 84 days. Data collected were analyzed using an orthogonal contrast test for equally spaced treatments. Average total gains, average daily gains, and gain-to-feed ratios were similar among the treatments (p > 0.05). Rumen acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations and acetate: propionate ratios were similar (p > 0.05) among treatments. There were no differences (p > 0.05) among treatments for dressing percentage, rib eye area, and backfat thickness. Findings suggest that at least up to 30% LF-DDGS can be included in diets of castrated male goats without affecting production performance and carcass characteristics.

AB  - Simple Summary As a pathogen of trichinellosis, Trichinella spiralis is a foodborne zoonotic nematode that can infect more than 100 species including mammals, birds, and reptiles. Pigs infected with T. spiralis are the primary host for disseminating it to humans. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed here to assess the prevalence of T. spiralis in domestic pigs in China. After considering 43 different studies, including a total sample size of 551,097 pigs, these results indicated that T. spiralis were still prevalent in some areas in China and the highest prevalence region was Guangxi. The meta-analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of T. spiralis in domestic pigs in China. The potential studies from seven databases (Pubmed, Web of science, Scopus, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang, CBM) were searched. I-2, Cochran's Q statistic and the funnel plot and Egger's test were used to assess heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. In this study, a total of 179 articles were captured in the initially screened. Of these, we finally obtained 39 significant articles (including 43 studies involving in 551,097 pigs) for the final analysis. We calculated using a random-effects model, and we found the overall infection rate was 0.04 (95% CI 0.03-0.06). The highest prevalence region was Guangxi. The funnel plot and Egger's test showed no publication bias in our meta-analysis. In addition, this high heterogeneity index was suggestive of potential variations which could be due to regions, quality scores, detection methods, publication years, or samplings. These results indicated that T. spiralis were still prevalent in some areas in China. This highlights the need for an increased focus on implementing affordable, appropriate control programs to reduce economic losses and T. spiralis infection in domestic pigs in China.

AB  - Trace elements found in sheep milk are present as inorganic ions and their salts as part of organic molecules such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. The chemical form of trace elements found in milk is important as it determines their absorption and biological utilisation in the intestine. In this study, trace element concentration and quality of sheep milk were evaluated in a total of 97 sheep milk samples collected from different regions (Erbil, Altunkopri, Makhmur, Qaraj, Kasnazan, Khabat, Taqtaq, Koysinjaq, Soran, Rawanduz and Sidakan) in the Iraqi Kurdish region during two seasons in April and September. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) was used to analyse the element content of the samples. The results in the samples collected in both periods showed that the mean values of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Pb, Cr, Fe, P, Se and Cu were 328.15 mu g mL-1, 1604.40 mu g mL-1, 805.8 mu g mL-1, 177.28 mu g mL-1, 0.38 mu g mL-1, 0.67 mu g mL-1, 3.15 mu g mL-1,0.08 mu g mL-1, 260.04 mu g mL-1, 0.06 mu g mL-1, and 3.83 mu g mL-1, respectively. The mean values for some quality parameters such as fat, density, lactose, total salt and protein of sheep milk samples collected in both periods were 6.47%, 1029.28 kg m-3, 4.44%, 9.01%, and 4.07%, respectively. Besides, the data obtained were evaluated by some chemometric techniques such as correlation, multicomponent analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA).

AB  - 1. Accurate and resource-efficient wildlife survey methodologies are crucial to informing biodiversity, wildlife management and conservation planning. Large mammals are particularly challenging to survey due to their large spatial ranges and often-elusive behaviour. Recent exploration of new approaches has led to seismology being used primarily in elephant behavioural studies; however, little had been done to investigate whether this methodology could provide accurate identification of multiple species and of those with lower body masses. 2. We further developed this seismological approach by utilising convolutional neural networks (CNN) to individually identify four mammal species from recordings of their footfall. To facilitate this work, we built a prototype footfall trap - a seismic node customised for recording footfall - which is both inexpensive and easily replicable. Footfall events were extracted using a fully automated workflow and used to train four CNN models. 3.We extracted 10,965 footfall events from 9 days of recordings in a captive environment and observed vibrations detected within a 3m radius. The best-performing CNN model achieved a species identification accuracy of 92% with F1 scores for each species between 86 and 97. Disregarding low confidence predictions (<0.8) increased accuracy to 99% but resulted in 27% data loss. The prototype footfall trap costs approximately 220 USD; this is substantially cheaper than seismometers used in similar studies and could be further reduced. 4. Solution. Our findings demonstrate that footfall traps have the potential to provide accurate species identification and could be fully automated once the necessary training data has been established. This methodology leverages some of the benefits of passive acoustic monitoring but for silent species, while overcoming some camera trap limitations in being omnidirectional and unrestricted by surrounding vegetation. Further research is required to understand effectiveness with a greater range of species, particularly taxonomically similar species, and how well the models generalise when facing other environmental conditions.

AB  - The storage of boar semen samples at 17 degrees C for artificial insemination (AI) doses enables the proliferation of the bacteria, making antibiotics necessary. This can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study tested bacterial presence and sperm chromatin structure after using a low-density colloid (Porcicoll) as an antibiotic alternative to eliminate bacteria. Ejaculates (8 boars, 3 ejac-ulates each) were split as control and low-density colloid centrifugation (single layer centrifugation, SLC, 20%, and 30% Porcicoll) into 500 ml tubes. Analyses were carried out at days 0, 3, and 7 (17 degrees C) for microbial presence and sperm chromatin structure analysis: %DFI (DNA fragmentation) and %HDS (chromatin immaturity), monobromobimane (mBBr; free thiols and disulfide bridges), and chromomycin A3 (CMA3; chromatin compaction). Besides comparing bacterial presence (7 species identified) and chromatin variables between treatments, the associations between these sets of variables were described by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Results showed a significant decrease of some bacteria or a complete removal after SLC (especially for P30). SLC also caused a decrease of %HDS and an increase of disulfide bridges and low and medium mBBr populations, suggesting the removal of immature sperm (poor chromatin compaction). CCA showed an association pattern compatible with the degradation of sperm chromatin parameters with bacterial contamination, especially Enterobacteria, P. aeuriginosa, and K. variicola. In conclusion, bacterial contamination affects sperm chromatin beyond DNA fragmentation; SLC with low-density colloid not only removes bacteria from boar semen, but also chromatin structure is enhanced after selection.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A time-consuming challenge faced by camera trap practitioners is the extraction of meaningful data from images to inform ecological management. An increasingly popular solution is automated image classification software. However, most solutions are not sufficiently robust to be deployed on a large scale due to lack of location invariance when transferring models between sites. This prevents optimal use of ecological data resulting in significant expenditure of time and resources to annotate and retrain deep learning models.
   We present a method ecologists can use to develop optimized location invariant camera trap object detectors by (a) evaluating publicly available image datasets characterized by high intradataset variability in training deep learning models for camera trap object detection and (b) using small subsets of camera trap images to optimize models for high accuracy domain-specific applications.
   We collected and annotated three datasets of images of striped hyena, rhinoceros, and pigs, from the image-sharing websites FlickR and iNaturalist (FiN), to train three object detection models. We compared the performance of these models to that of three models trained on the Wildlife Conservation Society and Camera CATalogue datasets, when tested on out-of-sample Snapshot Serengeti datasets. We then increased FiN model robustness by infusing small subsets of camera trap images into training.
   In all experiments, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the FiN trained models was significantly higher (82.33%-88.59%) than that achieved by the models trained only on camera trap datasets (38.5%-66.74%). Infusion further improved mAP by 1.78%-32.08%.
   Ecologists can use FiN images for training deep learning object detection solutions for camera trap image processing to develop location invariant, robust, out-of-the-box software. Models can be further optimized by infusion of 5%-10% camera trap images into training data. This would allow AI technologies to be deployed on a large scale in ecological applications.

AB  - Aboveground herbivores and soil biota profoundly affect plant invasions. However, how they interactively affect plant invasions through plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) remains unclear. To explore how herbivory by the introduced beetle Agasicles hygrophila affects Alternanthera philoxeroides invasions in China, we integrated multiyear field surveys and a 2-yr PSF experiment, in which we examined how herbivory affects PSFs on the performance of native and invasive plants and the introduced beetles. Despite increased herbivory from A. hygrophila, A. philoxeroides dominance over co-occurring congeneric native Alternanthera sessilis remained constant from 2014 to 2019. While occurring at lower abundances, A. sessilis experienced similar herbivore damage, suggesting apparent competitive effects. Our experiments revealed that herbivory on A. philoxeroides altered soil microbial communities, prolonged its negative PSF on A. sessilis, and decreased A. hygrophila larvae performance on the next-generation invasive plants. Consequently, A. hygrophila larvae performed better on leaves of natives than those of invasives when grown in soils conditioned by invasive plants defoliated by the introduced beetles. Our findings suggest that aboveground herbivory might promote rather than suppress A. philoxeroides invasion by enhancing its soil-mediated self-reinforcement, providing a novel mechanistic understanding of plant invasions. These findings highlight the need to incorporate an aboveground-belowground perspective during the assessment of potential biocontrol agents.

AB  - It is important to monitor the level of parasitic loads in herds of European bison and to identify threats early enough to prevent their spread to other populations or species. The aim of the present study was to compare the detection sensitivity of two fecal flotation techniques, viz. the modified Willis method (WM) with centrifugation and modified McMaster flotation technique (MM), in the diagnostics of gastrointestinal parasites of European bison before the translocation of animals. Out of 166 feces samples, Eimeria spp. oocysts (84.3% in WM and 71.1% in MM) and Trichostrongylidae eggs (82.5% in WM and 53.6% in MM) predominated. These were accompanied by eggs from Capillaria spp. (prevalence: 13.9% in WM and 3.61% in MM), Nematodirus spp. (prevalence: 18.1% in WM and 4.8% in MM) and Trichuris spp. (prevalence: 12.7% in WM and MM) were identified. The lowest prevalence was noted for cestode eggs of Moniezia spp. (5.4% in WM and 3.0% in MM). The Willis method yielded a higher prevalence of eggs and oocysts than the modified McMaster method, and hence has a higher probability of detecting parasitic structures than the modified McMaster method, especially in cases of very low levels of invasion. As the two methods yield consistent results, it is recommended to use the Willis method for diagnosis of internal parasite infection in European bison. This test offers more sensitive method than McMaster technique of detecting the presence of low levels of a variety of parasite eggs and oocysts in feces, while also being inexpensive and adaptable to field work.

AB  - The goat is one of the first herbivores to be domesticated, expanding throughout the world. Goats were introduced in South America during the sixteenth century. Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism constitutes one of the main constraints to the breeding of goats worldwide. This is the first study conducted to investigate the GI parasites recovered from goat coprolites from historical times of Patagonia. Goat coprolites were studied from the archaeological site Cueva Huenul I. Coprolites were processed by rehydration followed by homogenisation and sieved for spontaneous sedimentation. Samples were examined by light microscopy. At least 12 parasite species were recorded. In this first paleoparasitological study of Patagonian ancient goats we found a high percentage of positive samples. We recorded parasite species that currently are common in wild and domestic ruminants, some of them are of public health and veterinary importance; several species are zoonotic. Our results suggest that this could also have been a problem in terms of animal and human health in historical times. The results urge further investigation of the diversity and origin of the infectious diseases of domesticated animals around the dispersal routes associated with ancient human activities and their interaction with native species.

AB  - Plasma and blood osmolality values show interspecies differences and are strictly regulated. The effect of these factors also has an influence on microrheological parameters, such as red blood cell (RBC) deformability and aggregation. However, little is known about the interspecies differences in RBC deformability at various blood osmolality levels (osmotic gradient RBC deformability). Our aim was to conduct a descriptive-comparative study on RBC osmotic gradient deformability in several vertebrate species and human blood. Blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers, dogs, cats, pigs, sheep, rabbits, rats, and mice, to measure hematological parameters, as well as conventional and osmotic gradient RBC deformability. Analyzing the elongation index (EI)-osmolality curves, we found the highest maximal EI values (EI max) in human, dog, and rabbit samples. The lowest EI max values were seen in sheep and cat samples, in addition to a characteristic leftward shift of the elongation index-osmolality curves. We found significant differences in the hyperosmolar region. A correlation of mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration with osmoscan parameters was found. Osmotic gradient deformability provides further information for better exploration of microrheological diversity between species and may help to better understand the alterations caused by osmolality changes in various disorders.

AB  - Pig slurry (PS) has been used as soil fertilizer due to its nutrient and organic matter contents, which may improve soil nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur stocks. The objective of this work was to evaluate the best PS dose that favors the increase in dry matter production and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) contents and stocks after applications of PS to soils with Tifton-85 for six years. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications, in a hay-producing area under a clayey Typic Hapludox in southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of annual applications of organic and mineral fertilizers at rates based on their N contents, using PS (100, 200, 300, and 400 kg ha(-1)) and urea (200 kg ha(-1)), and a control without N application. Samples of the soil in 0-5,5-10, and 10-30 cm layers were collected in March 2019 and evaluated for soil bulk density and N, C, and S contents and stocks. The Tifton-85 dry matter production was evaluated using samples from three cuts carried out between 2012/2013 and 2017/2018 agricultural years. The applications of increasing doses of PS in Tifton-85 pastures over six years increase linearly the dry matter and soil organic C, N, and S stocks in the 0-30 cm layer. The PS rate equivalent to 100 or 200 kg ha(-1) of N is recommended for increasing soil C, N, and S stocks, since it resulted in C, N, and S stocks equal to or higher than the control and mineral (urea) treatments.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in prey biology driven by predation threats that do not involve direct consumption are referred to as non-consumptive effects (NCEs). In general, NCEs are considered common and can affect herbivores sometimes stronger than the direct consumptive effects. However, how the NCEs of predators affect the development, survival, fecundity, and population growth of prey has not been well documented, which is the primary consideration for the compatibility of prey with its natural enemies in agricultural ecosystems. We examined the NCEs of the predator Coccinella septempunctata on the life-history traits and population growth of Sitobion miscanthi via caged predator (i.e., S. miscanthi co-existed with caged C. septempunctata) and caged prey (i.e., C. septempunctata co-existed with caged S. miscanthi) treatments by employing the age-stage, two-sex life table. The findings indicate that S. miscanthi could respond to the predation risk of caged predators by either accelerating the developmental rate or reducing the net reproductive rate, while S. miscanthi might reduce their fitness in response to the predation risk of caged prey. Furthermore, S. miscanthi might also increase the number of winged morphs under both of the above treatments. The results have practical ramifications on managing this economically important pest on wheat production with reduced insecticide applications.
   How the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of predators influence the development, survival, fecundity, and population growth of prey has not been well documented, which is the primary consideration for the compatibility of prey with its natural enemies in agricultural ecosystems. We herein employed the age-stage, two-sex life table to examine the NCEs of the predator Coccinella septempunctata on the life-history traits and population growth of prey Sitobion miscanthi via caged predator (prey co-existing with caged predator) and caged prey (predator co-existing with caged prey) treatments with daily different exposure times (i.e., 0 h (control), 12 h, and 24 h). The results indicated that the predation risk of a caged predator could reduce the first nymphal duration and net reproductive rate (R-0) of S. miscanthi at 12 h, and the first nymphal duration, preadult duration, and mean generation time (T) at 24 h. However, the predation risk of the caged prey resulted in the prolongation of the pre-adult development time and total pre-reproductive period (TPRP) as well as lowered the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), R-0, life expectancy, and reproductive value of S. miscanthi after both 12 h and 24 h. Furthermore, the predation risk of both the caged predator and caged prey could increase the percent of winged morph at 24 h. These findings indicate that S. miscanthi could respond to the predation risk of the caged predator by either accelerating the developmental rate or reducing the net reproductive rate, while S. miscanthi might reduce their fitness in response to the predation risk of caged prey. Furthermore, S. miscanthi might also alter to winged morphs for dispersal under both of the above treatments. The findings obtained have practical ramifications for managing this economically important pest in wheat production with reduced insecticide applications.

AB  - Body size is a key morphological attribute, often used to delimit species boundaries among closely related taxa. But body size can evolve in parallel, reaching similar final states despite independent evolutionary and geographic origins, leading to faulty assumptions of evolutionary history. Here, we document parallel evolution in body size in the widely distributed leaf-nosed bat genus Hipposideros, which has misled both taxonomic and evolutionary inference. We sequenced reduced representation genomic loci and measured external morphological characters from three closely related species from the Solomon Islands archipelago, delimited by body size. Species tree reconstruction confirms the paraphyly of two morphologically designated species. The nonsister relationship between large-bodied H. dinops lineages found on different islands indicates that large-bodied ecomorphs have evolved independently at least twice in the history of this radiation. A lack of evidence for gene flow between sympatric, closely related taxa suggests the rapid evolution of strong reproductive isolating barriers between morphologically distinct populations. Our results position Solomon Islands Hipposideros as a novel vertebrate system for studying the repeatability of parallel evolution under natural conditions. We conclude by offering testable hypotheses for how geography and ecology could be mediating the repeated evolution of large-bodied Hipposideros lineages in the Solomon Islands.

AB  - Background: Seminal plasma is an important component of semen and has a significant effect on sperm function. However, the relationship between seminal plasma and sperm freezing capacity has not been fully studied. Purpose: Exploring metabolites and proteins related to the boar sperm freezing capacity in seminal plasma, by metabolomic and proteomic approaches, and directly verifying the protective effect of seminal plasma on the cryopreservation of boar sperm using high and low freezability seminal plasma as base freezing extender. Methods: Semen samples were collected from 30 different boars, 11 high and 11 low freezing-resistant boars were selected after freezing 2 similar to 4 times, and seminal plasma was selected at the same time. Sperm motility and movement parameters were analyzed using a CASA system. Reproductive hormones (Testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, prolactin, prostaglandin F2 alpha, luteinoid hormone) in seminal plasma were detected by ELISA. Analysis of proteins and metabolites in high and low freezing-resistant seminal plasma by proteomics and metabolomics techniques. Results: The six reproductive hormones tested were not significantly associated with sperm freezing resistance. A total of 13 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and 38 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, while a total of 348 metabolites and 1000 proteins were identified. These DEMs were related to energy metabolism, drugs, or environmental pollutants, while the DEPs were mainly involved in the cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion processes. There were 33 metabolites and 70 proteins significantly associated with mean progress motility (PM) at 10 min and 2 h after thawing. The 70 related proteins were associated with cell division and cycle regulation in gene ontology (GO) terms, as well as KEGG pathways, thermogeneration, and pyruvate metabolism. Using highly freezable boar SP as a base freezing extender made no difference from using lowly freezable boar SP, and both were not as good as the commercial control. Conclusion: There were significant differences in seminal plasma with different freezability, but the similarity was much greater than the difference. The protection effect of seminal plasma is not remarkable, and it does not exhibit superior cryoprotective properties compared to commercial semen cryoelongators. Significance: This study provides a deeper understanding of how seminal plasma composition affects sperm freezabilty. It provides potential biomarkers and targets for improving sperm cryopreservation techniques.

AB  - Boar fertility is a key determinant of the production efficiency of the whole pig breeding industry and boar sperm motility is the seminal parameter with the greatest impact on the fecundity of a sow. Exosomes are small, extracellular vesicles found in many body fluids. Seminal plasma exosomes, which are secreted by the epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicles, and testes, contain a large number of miRNAs, the types and levels of which can reflect the physiological state of source cells. It has been shown that the expression profile of seminal plasma exosomal miRNA differs between low-motility semen and normal semen. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between semen motility and exosomal miRNA profiles to obtain information that would allow to predict boar fertility, as well as contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which exosomal miRNAs regulate semen motility. Three high-motility (semen motility >90 %) and three low-motility (semen motility <80 %) semen samples were collected from Landrace and Yorkshire boars, respectively, and seminal plasma exosomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation. Exosome characterization was performed using transmission electron microscopy, NTA, and Western blot. The expression profiles of exosomal miRNAs associated with semen motility in the two boar breeds were subsequently determined by small RNA sequencing. The results showed that 297 known miRNAs and 295 novel RNAs were co-expressed in the four groups. Notably, six miRNAs (ssc-miR122-5p, ssc-miR-486, ssc-miR-451, ssc-miR-345-3p, ssc-miR-362, and ssc-miR-500-5p) were found to be differentially expressed in both boar breeds. Enrichment analysis of the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed that they were mainly involved in biological processes such as regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, regulation of gene expression, and intracellular signal transduction and signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and Ras signaling pathways. The six differentially expressed miRNAs identified in this study have significant potential as noninvasive markers of boar semen motility. Meanwhile, the results of the enrichment analysis provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of semen motility.

AB  - Social behaviour is thought to be a major component of survival, reproduction, and resilience of populations. Thus, it is a key component in management and conservation of wild populations. In polygynous breeding species, group size influences the reproductive success of males and females, and hence it is essential to understand the environmental and demographic factors that shape the phenology of group size within populations. Here, we investigate harem size and its determinants using a 15-year dataset of annual harem size phenology-based metrics from a reintroduced population of wild Przewalski horses in Hortobagy National Park, Hungary. From the initial reintroduction of 21 animals in 1997, the population grew to 174 animals in 2012. During that same period, the number of harems increased from three to 23. Despite the 8-fold increase in population size, harem sizes remained stable, and variability among harems within years decreased. The annual phenological cycle of harem size was not consistent over the 15-year period, and the associated annual phenology-based metrics varied differently over the years. The best predictors of our phenology-based harem size metrics were adult sex ratio, annual adult mortality and annual mean number of harems, with some evidence that mean age of harem stallions and drought severity were contributing factors. Our findings reveal that complex interactions between demography, climate, and harem size can emerge in social animals. Taken together, our results demonstrate that intrinsic population processes can regulate group size even in the presence of non-stationary climatic conditions during periods of growth in human-introduced, semi-free ranging animal populations.

AB  - Rapid composting by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) may be insufficient to maturation and humification of composting and further composting is necessary. The purpose of this study was to explore cornstalk addition on toxic metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd), toxic metals resistance bacterial (TMRB) destiny and their relationship with physicochemical factors during BSFL manure composting. High-throughput sequencing was performed by six treatments, namely T1 to T6, where T1 to T3 were BSFL manures from chicken, pig and dairy manure, respectively, and T4 to T6 were same manures and utilized cornstalk to adjust C/N to 25. The results showed that cornstalk amendment could enhance the toxic metals immobilization rate compared to control treatments in the ultimate product. TMRB indicated that the major potential hosts bacteria were Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota and Actinobacteriota, and the sum relative abundance were 63.33%, 90.62%, 83.62%, 69.38%, 50.66% and 90.52% in T1 to T6 at the end of composting. Bacteria diversity and heat map revealed composting micro-ecology with additive cornstalk to remarkably effect main resistant bacterial distribution via adjusting environmental factors and potential hosts bacterial. Finally, T5 treatment was able to greatly decrease the TMRB abundance, and improve the ability of composting and ultimate product quality. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Florivory in Chamaecrista varies in occurrence, intensity, and the floral structures affected. As flowers are multifunctional units, the type of damage can impact reproductive success in different ways. Oil-resin-secreting trichomes, present in the sepals of Chamaecrista species, section Absus, are suggested to inhibit florivory. We recorded florivory in Chamaecrista cathartica and Chamaecrista catharticoides in order to determine the frequency of damage, floral whorls most damaged, impact on reproduction, and effectiveness of secretory trichomes in inhibiting florivory. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, Brazil. Twenty individuals of each species were monitored monthly over two bloom periods to record the flowering intensity, rates of florivory, and fruit set and to determine the effectiveness of trichomes in inhibiting florivory. The two species had different flowering patterns, annual for C. cathartica and continuous for C. catharticoides, both more intense during summer. Florivory occurred mainly in the winter and affected floral structures unevenly, resulting in loss of different floral functions. Florivory reduced the fruit set of both species, but C. catharticoides was considerably more impacted. The diversity of damaged structures in C. catharticoides resulted in direct (reduced female and male fitness due to loss of ovules and pollen grains) and indirect (loss of floral resources and reduced floral attractiveness) impacts. Damage to the tubular petal could further result in loss of specialized pollination mechanisms mediated by this structure. Secretory trichomes on the abaxial surface of sepals inhibited florivory of buds and herbivory of early-developing fruits.

AB  - The present study investigated the occurrence of seahorses in Araruama hypersaline lagoon using a combination of rapid assessment surveys and data from citizen science. We conducted transects at each of the six study sites, where we recorded a series of population parameters. Local citizen scientists also provided records of occurrence through social media. A female-biased population of Hippocampus reidi Ginsburg, 1933 occupies the lagoon, where it reaches high densities. Most of the seahorses were found attached to artificial holdfasts, and ammonia and nitrite concentrations were above the level recommended by environmental agencies. The reports provided by the citizen scientists represented a valuable contribution to the database on the occurrence of seahorses around the lagoon. Our findings provide new insights into the biological potential of seahorses to colonize new areas and tolerate extreme conditions, as well as the importance of partnerships with citizen scientists to expand ecological knowledge.

AB  - Simple Summary Dumeng sheep is a novel, specialized meat sheep breed created through crossbreeding innovation, cross-fixation, and herd expansion, using Dorper sheep as the father and Mongolian sheep as the mother. Given the critical role of early growth and development stages in determining the meat production potential of livestock animals, estimating the genetic parameters of early growth traits is crucial for the genetic advancement of meat sheep populations. This study aimed to investigate the genetic and non-genetic factors that affect the nine early growth traits of Dumeng sheep, as well as to estimate the variance components and genetic parameters associated with these traits. It was found that the growth traits of Dumeng sheep could be improved indirectly by selecting for weaning weight.Abstract This study aimed to estimate the genetic and non-genetic factors that affect the nine early growth traits of Dumeng sheep, as well as to estimate the variance components and genetic parameters associated with these traits. A dataset containing detailed information on 17,896 preweaning trait records of 4474 lambs was collected. In addition, 5015 postweaning trait records of 1003 lambs were documented. The effects of recipient dam age, sex, year, season, and herd on the early growth traits were assessed using the general linear model procedure of the statistical analysis system, revealing different levels of significance across different traits. To determine the most suitable model for estimating the genetic parameters, the likelihood ratio (LR) test was employed, fitting six animal models that either excluded or included maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects within the average information restricted maximum likelihood (AIREML) framework using WOMBAT software (Version: 23/11/23). The model incorporating direct additive genetic effects, maternal genetic effects, and maternal permanent environment effects as random effects (model 6) provided the best fit for birth weight (BW) estimation. In contrast, the model combining direct additive genetic effects and maternal permanent environment effects as random effects (model 2) demonstrated a superior fit for estimating the genetic parameters of weaning weight (WW), average daily gain weight from birth to weaning (ADG1), and Kleiber ratio from birth to weaning (KR1). With regard to the genetic parameters of body weight at 6 months of age (6MW), average daily gain weight from weaning to 6 months (ADG2), average daily gain weight from birth to 6 months (ADG3), Kleiber ratio from weaning to 6 months (KR2), and Kleiber ratio from birth to 6 months (KR3), model 1, which incorporates only direct additive genetic effects, was identified as the optimal choice. With the optimal model, the heritability estimates ranged from 0.010 +/- 0.033 for 6MW to 0.1837 +/- 0.096 for KR3. The bivariate analysis method was employed to estimate the correlation between various traits using the most suitable model. The absolute values of genetic correlation coefficients among the traits spanned a range from 0.1460 to 0.9998, highlighting both weak and strong relationships among the studied traits. Specifically, the estimated genetic correlations between WW and ADG1, ADG3, KR1, and KR3 were 0.9859, 0.9953, 0.9911, and 0.9951, respectively, while the corresponding phenotypic correlations were 0.9752, 0.7836, 0.8262, and 0.5767. These findings identified that WW could serve as an effective selection criterion for enhancing early growth traits.

AB  - Excessive heavy metals (HMs) in livestock manure due to additives over-use limits its recycling through composting. However, few studies have investigated the interactive influence of microbial communities, functional genes, and environmental factors in HM immobilization during composting. Therefore, treatments with different C/N ratios (15:1, 20:1, 25:1) and bulking agents (maize straw, green waste, vinasse) were conducted to explore the HMs immobilization pathways using structural equation model (SEM). Results confirmed the promoting effect of C/N ratio of 20:1 and vinasse on microbial diversity, thus leading to greater HMs immobilization rate. Meanwhile, the dominant microbial phyla of Cu/Zn, Cd, As, and Cr were identified as Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chytridiomycota, and Bacteroidota, respectively. Moreover, the significant correlation between functional genes (copC, mt, cbhl, aoxB, yieF) and HMs illustrated potential immobilization effects of metal-binding proteins on Cu and Zn, humus complexation on Zn, and oxidase/reductase on As/Cr. Finally, SEM indicated that the redistribution of Cu, Zn, As, and Cr fractions was interactively influenced by environmental factors (organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, and total phosphorus), microbial communities, and functional genes, while Cd was directly regulated by organic matter and total phosphorus. These results may provide a deeper understanding of HM immobilization pathways during swine manure composting.

AB  - Ecologists have long desired predictive models that allow inference on population dynamics, where detailed demographic data are unavailable. Integral projection models (IPMs) allow both demographic and phenotypic outcomes at the level of the population to be predicted from the distribution of a functional trait, like body mass. In species where body mass markedly influences demographic rates, as is the rule among mammals, then IPMs provide not only opportunity to assess the population responses to a given environment, but also improve our understanding of the complex interplay between traits and demographic outcomes. Here, we develop a body-mass-based approach to constructing generalized, predictive IPMs for species of ungulates covering a broad range of body size (25-400 kg). Despite our best efforts, we found that a reliable and general, functional, trait-based model for ungulates was unattainable even after accounting for among-species variation in both age at first reproduction and litter size. We attribute this to the diversity of reproductive tactics among similar-sized species of ungulates, and to the interplay between density-dependent and environmental factors that shape demographic parameters independent of mass at the local scale. These processes thus drive population dynamics and cannot be ignored. Environmental context generally matters in population ecology, and our study shows this may be the case for functional traits in vertebrate populations.

AB  - Impact statementThe anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) model in goats can facilitate research related to cervical degenerative diseases. To date, there is no uniform standard for establishing an ACDF model in goats. Here, we measured the anatomical parameters of the cervical spine in goats and proposed technical notes for establishing an ACDF model in goats. This study demonstrated that these technical notes based on anatomical features are practical and can minimize the damage to the animals. It can provide an important reference for future related studies.
   Goat is an adequate experimental model for cervical spine testing. However, studies on the anatomy of the cervical spine in goats are limited, and there is no uniform standard for establishing a single-segment anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) model in goats. To address this issue, we investigated the cervical spine anatomy of goats and provided a technical basis for establishing a single-segment ACDF model in goats. We measured the imaging anatomical parameters using Mimics Medical 20.0 software. We then performed histological analysis of the cervical spine segment 2-3 (C2-3) segment of six goat cervical spine specimens. Based on the measurements and histological analysis, the fusion cage was designed to be wedge-shaped, the length of the plate was 25 mm, and the length of the screw was 15 mm. Based on the anatomical characteristics of goats, we believed that the C2-3 segment of goats was most suitable for a single-segment ACDF model in goats, and the decompression should be performed medial to the pterygoid joint on both sides, the thickness of the removed endplate was similar to 0.6 mm, the cage implanted in the anterior two-thirds of the intervertebral space could maximize the contact area of the cage-endplate interface, and the location of the midline spur could position the implantation of the internal fixtures. Radiological examination at 12 weeks postoperatively suggested that the internal fixtures were in place and new bone formation was visible. These results demonstrated that these technical notes based on anatomical features were practical and could minimize damage to animals.

AB  - Rodents are currently the most common animals used for hepatic surgical resection studies that investigate liver regeneration, chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, hepatic metastasis, hepatic function, and hepatic cancer. Our previous work has shown that dietary consumption of linoleic acid (LA) stimulates the growth of rodent and human tumors in vivo. Here we compared 3 dietsa 5% corn oil diet (control), a diet deficient in essential fatty acids (EFAD), and an EFAD supplemented with LA in amounts equal to those in the control diet (EFAD+LA). We hypothesized that consumption of the LA provided in the EFAD+LA diet would elevate plasma levels of LA and stimulate regeneration in rats after a 70% hepatectomy (HPX), and that regeneration would not occur in the EFAD rats. Each diet group was comprised of 30 male and 30 female Buffalo rats (BUFF/CrCrl). Rats were fed one of the 3 diets and water ad libitum. After 8 wk on the assigned diet, rats were underwent a 70% HPX. On days 4 and 21 after HPX, 30 male and 30 female rats from each diet group were anesthetized for in vivo study and then were euthanized for tissue collection. For the in vivo study, arterial and venous blood samples were collected from the liver. LA-, glucose-, and O2-uptake, and lactate- and CO2-output were significantly higher in LA-replete rats as compared with LA-deficient rats. After a 70% HPX, the remaining liver mass in control and EFAD+LA groups had doubled at day 4, reaching 60% of the original total weight, and had regenerated completely at day 21. However, no regeneration occurred in the EFAD group. At day 4 the portions of livers removed from the control and EFAD+LA groups had significantly higher content of LA, protein, cAMP, and DNA as compared with their livers on day 21. [3H]thymidine incorporation into liver DNA was significantly higher in the 2 LA-replete groups, with male values greater than female values, as compared with LA-deficient group. These data indicate that liver regeneration after HPX is dependent on dietary LA. Understanding the mechanisms of LA-dependent liver regeneration in rats supports our current efforts to enhance successful surgical resection therapies in humans.

AB  - Animals adapt to stress by hormone-metabolite interaction. This is necessary to protect animal health status and subsequent milk production. To investigate this, sixteen healthy late-gestation dry Murrah buffaloes were selected and divided into two groups of eight animals each. One group of buffaloes (Cooled/CL) was managed under fan and mist cooling system during dry period. Another group (Non-cooled/NCL) remained without the provision of cooling during dry period. After parturition, all the animals were managed under evaporative cooling. Milk yield was significantly (p<0.05) higher in CL (10.25 +/- 0.23 kg/day) relative to NCL (8.92 +/- 0.17 kg/day) buffaloes without any significant variation in milk composition. The average dry matter intake was significantly (p<0.05) higher in CL as compared to NCL group. The non-esterified fatty acids were significantly (p<0.05) higher in CL relative to NCL buffaloes. Significantly (p<0.05) higher glucose level was found on the day of calving in CL as compared to NCL buffaloes. The level of insulin was higher in NCL buffaloes as compared to CL buffaloes. The growth hormone was higher in CL relative to NCL buffaloes. Evaporative cooling in late gestation therefore proves to be a potential tool to alleviate the adverse effect of thermal stress thus affecting subsequent milk production.

AB  - Transportation is an essential component of commercial swine production in the United States. Stressors experienced during the process of transportation, including loading and unloading, can result in poor welfare outcomes and economic losses. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to a ramp structure during the nursery period affected ease of loading and unloading at marketing. A secondary objective was to determine if nursery ramp provision affected nursery pig behavior and pig growth throughout the nursery and grow-finish phases. Five hundred forty weaned pigs (17 - 21 days of age) housed in 20 pens (each pen holding approximately 27 pigs) were assigned to one of two experimental treatments: 1) access to a ramp with platform within the pen during the nursery phase (RAMP) or 2) a standard pen with no access to a ramp with platform during the nursery phase (CONT). After 6 weeks, ramps were removed from RAMP pens and all pigs were raised under standard conditions until marketing. Nursery behavior (posture, eating, drinking, aggression) and growth performance during the nursery and grow-finish phases were evaluated. No differences in nursery behavior or growth performance were observed between treatments (P > 0.05). At marketing, pigs were loaded in groups of four pen mates onto a semi-trailer and unloaded in mixed treatment groups upon arrival at the processing facility. During loading, duration to ascend the ramp to the trailer was quantified, along with the number of trips displayed by any animals and handler electric prod usage. Pigs in the RAMP treatment required a shorter duration to ascend the ramp compared to the CONT pigs (P = 0.002). An electric prod was used more frequently with CONT pigs compared to RAMP pigs (P = 0.02). During unloading, the total duration it took for pigs to descend the ramp, as well as the number of turnarounds, trips, and backward movement descending the ramp were quantified. Rattle paddle usage by the handler and dead on arrivals were also recorded. Control pigs required a shorter duration to descend the ramp compared to the RAMP pigs (P = 0.04). Additionally, a greater number of RAMP pigs descended the ramp backwards compared to CONT pigs (P = 0.02). No other treatment differences were observed. In conclusion, exposing pigs to a ramp during the nursery phase improved ease of loading at marketing and had no effect on nursery behavior and growth performance throughout the nursery and grow-finish phases.

AB  - Butterflies represent a diverse group of insects, playing key ecosystem roles such as pollination and their larval form engage in herbivory. Despite their importance, comprehensive global distribution data for butterfly species are lacking. This lack of comprehensive global data has hindered many large-scale questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation at the regional and global scales. Here, I use an integrative workflow that combines occurrence records, alpha hull polygons, species' dispersal capacity, and natural habitat and environmental variables within a framework of species distribution models to generate species-level native distributions for butterflies at a global scale in the contemporary period. The database releases native range maps for 10,372 extant species of butterflies at a spatial grain resolution of 5 arcmin (similar to 10 km). This database has the potential to allow unprecedented large-scale analyses in ecology, biogeography, and conservation of butterflies. The maps are available in the WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326 code) and stored as vector polygons in the GEOPACKAGE format for maximum compression, allowing easy data manipulation using a standard computer. I additionally provide each species' spatial raster. All maps and R scripts are open access and available for download in Dryad and Zenodo, respectively, and are guided by FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. By making these data available to the scientific community, I aim to advance the sharing of biological data to stimulate more comprehensive research in ecology, biogeography, and conservation of butterflies.

AB  - Mineral nutrition deficiencies commonly occur in extensive sheep production systems, yet often coincide with critical production periods of breeding and gestation when quality and quantity of winter range are most limited. Ewe productivity may be limited by clinical and subclinical mineral deficiencies when grazing extensive rangelands during the winter months. The objectives of this study were to utilize fecal meta-barcoding DNA (f.DNA) to estimate dietary composition of ewes by plant morphological group (monocots and dicots), and quantified plant nutritional composition from clipped biomass to estimate adequacy of macro- and micro-minerals of the basal diet across extensively grazed sheep operations. Ewe fecal samples for f.DNA were collected from 19 extensive sheep operations across Wyoming and Colorado, USA, and analyzed at the plant morphological group level to estimate dietary composition as 1) Monocot ( >= 70%), 2) Dicot ( >= 70%), or 3) Mixed (monocot and dicot co-dominated, both proportions < 70%). Pooled forage species nutritional composition within morphological group (monocot vs. dicot) was then multiplied by the proportion of monocotyledonous species or dicotyledonous species and intake estimates of 2% of BW on an 80 kg ewe to estimate macro- and micro-mineral intake. Results from f.DNA indicated 36% of operations were categorized as Monocot ( >= 70% dietary component), 42% Dicot ( >= 70% dietary component), or 21% Mixed. A significant effect of plant morphological group category was observed for CP, Ca, K, Mg, and S ( P < 0.05) where dicot dominated rangelands contained higher concentrations of these minerals compared to monocot or mixed monocot-dicot rangelands. Overall, dicot dominated rangelands provided greater macro- and micro-mineral content ultimately meeting more requirements for breeding and gestation than monocot or mixed monocot-dicot rangelands. Therefore, targeted supplementation must be considered for ewes on monocot or mixed monocot-dicot rangelands during winter months that coincide with critical production stages. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to its chemical composition, roe and red deer meat can be a valuable component of a well-balanced diet for the modern consumer; however, the raw material from the carcasses of animals living in the wild can show differences in nutritional value. The present study provides an analysis of the content of basic nutrients (protein, fat, crude ash), Fe, Cd and Pb and fatty acid profile based on which the health-promoting value of wild-harvested roe deer and red deer meat was evaluated. Sixty carcasses were selected for chemical analysis; 30 of roe deer (15 does and 15 bucks) and 30 of red deer (15 hinds and 15 stags). The study leads to the conclusion that the evaluated meat of roe deer and red deer had high dietary value as it contained a high protein and low fat content and had an advantageous fatty acids composition. The noted content of cadmium and lead in the haunch of roe and red deer was significantly lower than permissible standard values, which corroborates that the meat is healthy and safe for consumers.
   The present studies aimed to analyse and assess the health-promoting properties of the musculus semimembranosus (MS) of roe and red deer harvested in the wild. The experimental materials comprising the carcasses of roe deer (15 does and 15 bucks) and red deer (15 hinds and 15 stags) were selected for analysis based on the following criteria: age of animals at harvest-3-4 years; time that passed from the harvest of animals to carcass cutting-48-54 h. After chilling the carcasses for 24 h at +2 degrees C, the haunches were cut from the carcasses and transported to the laboratory in isothermal ice-packed containers. Samples of the musculus semimembranosus were analysed to determine the chemical composition (proximate components, energy value, Fe, Pb, Cd, fatty acids). More (p <= 0.05) dry matter and total protein and less (p <= 0.05) crude fat was found in the musculus semimembranosus of roe deer in comparison to red deer. No significant influence of the animal's sex was observed in the content of the evaluated nutrients, apart from crude fat content, which was increased in the haunch of females from both species. The energy content in the muscle of roe deer was 10% higher than the energy value of MS in red deer (p <= 0.05). The content of iron was significantly (p <= 0.05) higher (6.64 mg/kg) in the meat of red deer compared to the meat of roe deer (31.68 mg/kg). Roe deer haunch contained more lead but less cadmium than red deer haunch. Irrespective of sex, the lipid fraction of red deer muscle contained more saturated fatty acids (SFA). Intramuscular fat (IMF) in roe deer meat contained a higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The atherogenicity (AI) and thrombogenicity (TI) index values were significantly lower in roe deer haunch, and the hypocholesterolaemic-to-hypercholesterolaemic fatty acids ratio (HH) was lower (p <= 0.05) in red deer meat. To sum up, the evaluated roe deer and red deer haunch featured high dietary value as it contained a high protein and low fat content and had an advantageous fatty acids composition. As regards the content of cadmium and lead, roe deer and red deer haunch can be considered safe for consumers.

AB  - Trichomes are well-known efficient plant defense mechanisms to limit arthropod herbivory, especially in Solanaceae. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of trichome types on the development, survival and dispersal of Tetranychus urticae, and the phytoseiid predatory mite Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) recki. Six Solanum lycopersicum cultivars and two wild Solanum species, S. cheesmaniae and S. peruvianum, presenting contrasting densities and types of trichomes, were considered. Cultivars and species were characterized by counting each trichome type on leaves, petioles and stems. Mites stuck on petiole and stem and alive mites on the leaflet used for mite release and in the whole plant were counted three weeks after T. urticae plant infestation. Tetranychus urticae settlement and dispersal were differently affected by trichomes. Trichome types V and VI did not affect settlement and dispersal, whereas trichome types I and IV on the petiole had the highest impacton mites. Trichomes on leaves slightly affected mite establishment, there appears to be a repellent effect of trichome types I and IV. The low densities of both T. urticae and its predator detected for the cv. Lancaster could not be clearly associated to the trichome types here considered. The predator did not seem to be affected by plant characteristics, but rather by T. urticae numbers on the plant. The trichome traits unfavorable to T. urticae, did not affect the predator which showed high efficiency to control this pest on all the plant genotypes considered, but at a favorable predator:prey ratio (1:1). Altogether, these results are encouraging for the use of T. (A.) recki as a biological control agent of T. urticae regardless of the trichome structure of the tomato cultivars, but other conditions should be tested to conclude on practical implementations.

AB  - BackgroundTea, the second largest consumer beverage in the world after water, is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas. However, the effect of environmental factors on the distribution of wild tea plants is unclear.ResultsA total of 159 wild tea plants were collected from different altitudes and geological types of the Guizhou Plateau. Using the genotyping-by-sequencing method, 98,241 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Genetic diversity, population structure analysis, principal component analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and linkage disequilibrium were performed. The genetic diversity of the wild tea plant population from the Silicate Rock Classes of Camellia gymnogyna was higher than that from the Carbonate Rock Classes of Camellia tachangensis. In addition, the genetic diversity of wild tea plants from the second altitude gradient was significantly higher than that of wild tea plants from the third and first altitude gradients. Two inferred pure groups (GP01 and GP02) and one inferred admixture group (GP03) were identified by population structure analysis and were verified by principal component and phylogenetic analyses. The highest differentiation coefficients were determined for GP01 vs. GP02, while the lowest differentiation coefficients were determined for GP01 vs. GP03.ConclusionsThis study revealed the genetic diversity and geographical distribution characteristics of wild tea plants in the Guizhou Plateau. There are significant differences in genetic diversity and evolutionary direction between Camellia tachangensis with Carbonate Rock Classes at the first altitude gradient and Camellia gymnogyna with Silicate Rock Classes at the third altitude gradient. Geological environment, soil mineral element content, soil pH, and altitude markedly contributed to the genetic differentiation between Camellia tachangensis and Camellia gymnogyna.

AB  - This work aimed to explore the concentration of nickel, manganese, iron, copper, chromium, and lead in the milk of goat herds in the industrial area of Asaluyeh (southern Iran) and the non-industrial area of Kaki. The milk of 16 goat herds (each herd had at least ten goats) was collected in several villages in each area, and at the same time, the drinking water and forage of goats were sampled. The concentration of elements in the samples was determined by ICP-OES. The mean concentrations of chromium, copper, iron, manganese, lead, and nickel in milk samples of the Asaluyeh area were 16.423 +/- 0.349, 0.146 +/- 0.118, 6.111 +/- 0.501, 0.239 +/- 0.016, 0.141 +/- 0.030, and 1.447 +/- 0.101 mg/kg, respectively. Concentrations of heavy metals (except for copper) in the milk of goats in the industrialized area of Asaluyeh were significantly higher than that of Kaki (P < 0.05). Also, the content of heavy metals was significantly correlated with lactose levels (P < 0.05). The hazard index for drinking the goat milk was computed to be 0.444 and 0.386 for the Asaluyeh and Kaki area, respectively, which shows a minimal effect of this exposure pathway.

AB  - Individualized social niches arise in social groups, resulting in divergent social behavior profiles among group members. During sensitive life phases, the individualized social niche can profoundly impact the development of social behavior and associated phenotypes such as hormone (e.g. cortisol) concentrations. Focusing on adolescence, we investigated the relationship between the individualized social niche, social behavior, and cortisol concentrations (baseline and responsiveness) in female guinea pigs. Females were pair -housed in early adolescence (initial social pair formation), and a social niche transition was induced after six weeks by replacing the partner with either a larger or smaller female. Regarding social behavior, dominance status was associated with aggression in both the initial social pairs and after the social niche transition, and the results suggest that aggression was rapidly and completely reshaped after the social niche transition. Meanwhile, submissive behavior was rapidly reshaped after the social niche transition, but this was incomplete. The dominance status attained in the initial social pair affected the extent of submissive behavior after the social niche transition, and this effect was still detected three weeks after the social niche transition. Regarding cortisol concentrations, higher baseline cortisol concentrations were measured in dominant females in the initial social pairs. After the social niche transition, cortisol responsiveness significantly increased for the females paired with a larger, older female relative to those paired with a smaller, younger female. These findings demonstrate that the social niche during adolescence plays a significant role in shaping behavior and hormone concentrations in females.

AB  - Trees release Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) into the air in response to damage inflicted by insects. It is known that songbirds use those compounds to locate their prey, but more recently the idea emerged that songbirds could also use those odours as cues in their reproductive decisions, as early spring HIPVs may contain information about the seasonal timing and abundance of insects. We exposed pre-breeding great tits (Parus major) to the odours of caterpillar-infested trees under controlled conditions, and monitored reproduction (timing of egg laying, number of eggs, egg size) and two of its main hormonal drivers (testosterone and 1713estradiol in males and females, respectively). We found that females exposed to HIPVs did not advance their laying dates, nor laid larger clutches, or larger eggs compared to control females. 1713-estradiol concentrations in females were also similar between experimental and control birds. However, males exposed to HIPVs had higher testosterone concentrations during the egg-laying period. Our study supports the hypothesis that insectivorous songbirds are able to detect minute amounts of plant odours. The sole manipulation of plant scents was not sufficient to lure females into a higher reproductive investment, but males increased their reproductive effort in response to a novel source of information for seasonal breeding birds.

AB  - Knowledge about the diets of New Zealand's extinct moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) is heavily biased towards just three species (Dinornis robustus, Megalapteryx didinus and Pachyornis elephantopus), which represent about 90% of all identified coprolites and gizzard content samples. By comparison, the diets of the other six moa species are poorly known. Here, we report the discovery of a new coprolite deposit attributed to little bush moa (Anomalopteryx didiformis) based on DNA barcoding and former moa species distributions. The deposit is the southernmost site from which moa coprolites have been recovered and just the second to contain mid-Holocene specimens. Moreover, the deposit provides the longest known temporal span (similar to 2200 years) of moa coprolites within a stratigraphic context. Pollen and plant DNA from the coprolites, as well as associated plant macrofossils, indicate that the deposit spans a period when the forest canopy was transitioning from Podocarpaceae to silver beech (Lophozonia menziesii) dominance about 6800-4600 years ago. Our analysis of coprolite content supports the current hypothesis that little bush moa browsed trees and shrubs within the forest understorey, but provides new evidence that ferns were also an important part of their diet. Based on this finding, we suggest that moa might once have played a previously unrecognised role in the dispersal of ground fern spores throughout New Zealand forests. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the interest in increasingly sustainable agriculture has also turned attention towards new cover crops suitable for use in marginal areas that could enter the food chain as new protein and oil sources or for biodiesel production. In this scenario, Camelina sativa is a perfect crop to study. Camelina is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae which is interesting in terms of its oil content, since the seeds contain about 40% oils, with a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (30-40% alpha linolenic acid, 15-25% linoleic acid, 15% oleic acid and about 15% eicosenoic acid). It is a hexaploid species (2n = 40, genome size similar to 782 Mb) characterized by rapid growth, a short life cycle (85-100 days for spring varieties, 190-210 for autumn varieties) and low input cultivation needs. However, its use in feed and food is limited by the presence of glucosinolates (GLS). GLS are sulfur molecules involved in plant defense. In recent years, they have been studied not only as antinutritionals but also for their anti-carcinogenic effects against chronic inflammatory and heart diseases and for their use as natural pesticides. Given the recent interest in camelina and its highly nutritious oil, eight pure lines and a synthetic population were compared in two different growing periods, spring and winter. In this work, the genetic materials were characterized for different phenotypic traits, yields and yield components, and bromatological and glucosinolate content. The results confirmed that in North Italy, camelina has higher yields if cultivated in the autumn-winter period (about 2 t/ha vs. 0.6 t/ha); furthermore, a negative correlation was found between spring and winter yields, indicating that varieties that produce more in winter cultivation produce less in spring cultivation. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first work in which a synthetic population of Camelina sativa has been tested and proved to be a valid solution for use in various environments both for its adaptability and for the low content of glucosinolates (about 17 mmol/kg).

AB  - Maternal malnutrition has important developmental consequences for the foetus. Indeed, adverse fetal ovarian development could have lifelong impact, with potentially reduced ovarian reserve and fertility of the offspring. This study investigated the effect of maternal protein restriction on germ cell and blood vessel development in the fetal sheep ovary. Ewes were fed control (n = 7) or low protein (n = 8) diets (17.0 g vs 8.7 g crude protein/MJ metabolizable energy) from conception to day 65 of gestation (gd65). On gd65, fetal ovaries were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analysis to quantify germ cells (OCT4, VASA, DAZL), proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (caspase 3) and vascularisation (CD31). Protein restriction reduced the fetal ovary weight (P < 0.05) but had no effect on fetal weight (P> 0.05). The density of germ cells was unaffected by maternal diet (P > 0.05). In the ovarian cortex, OCT4+ve cells were more abundant than DAZL+ve (P < 0.001) and VASA+ve cells (P < 0.001). The numbers, density and estimated total weight of OCT4, DAZL, and VASA+ve cells within the ovigerous cords were similar in both dietary groups (P> 0.05). Similarly, maternal protein restriction had no effect on germ cell proliferation or a poptotic indices (P> 0.05) and the number, area and perimeter of medullary blood vessels and degree of microvascularisation in the cortex (P> 0.05). In conclusion, maternal protein restriction decreased ovarian weight despite not affecting germ cell developmental progress, proliferation, apoptosis, or ovarian vascularity. This suggests that reduced maternal protein has the potential to regulate ovarian development in the offspring.
   Lay summary
   Variations in a mother's diet during pregnancy can influence her offspring's growth and might cause fertility problems in the offspring in later life. We investigated whether reducing the protein fed to sheep during early pregnancy affects their daughters' ovaries. We then compared our findings to the offspring of sheep on a complete diet. We measured ovary size and estimated the number of germ cells (cells that become eggs) they contained. We used cell markers to assess potential changes in the pattern of germ cell growth, division, and death, and how the ovarian blood supply had developed. We found that protein restriction reduced ovary size. However, the pattern of germ cell development, growth, or death was not altered by poor diet and blood vessels were also unaffected. This suggests that maternal diet can change ovarian development by an unknown mechanism and might reduce future fertility in their offspring.

AB  - Wildlife species are transitioning to greater crepuscular and nocturnal activity in response to high human densities. This plasticity in temporal niches may partially mitigate the impacts of human activity but may also result in underestimating human effects on species foraging, predator-prey relationships and community-level interactions.We deployed remote cameras to characterize shifts in herbivore diel activity in protected habitat versus pastoralist landscapes. We then compared species traits including body mass, dietary preferences and behavioural characteristics as potential predictors of species sensitivity to livestock.Our data capture a significant temporal shift away from core cattle activity for nearly every herbivore species in our study, leading to more crepuscular activity patterns. As livestock were primarily diurnal and predators primarily nocturnal in pastoralist habitat, species that decreased their overlap with livestock were more likely to increase their overlap with potential predators.Other than species' typical daytime activity levels, we found no evidence that any particular trait significantly predicted temporal shifts in response to livestock. Instead, species generally trended towards greater activity levels at dawn, suggesting that cattle have a homogenizing effect on community-wide activity patterns.Our findings highlight how cohabitation with livestock can profoundly alter the temporal niches of wild herbivores. Shifts in diel activity patterns may reduce herbivore foraging time or efficiency and potentially have cascading shifts on predator-prey dynamics. Given that species traits could not predict responses to livestock, our analysis suggests that conservation strategies should consider each species separately when designing interventions for wildlife management.
   Spishi za wanyama pori wanabadili shugli na tabia siku na kuonekana wakati wa utusitusi na usiku ilikuepuka uwingi na msongamano wa binadamu. Uwezo huu wa kubadili tabia siku kwa kiasi waweza kupunguza athari zinazotokana na shughuli za binadamu, lakini pia kusababisha kutotilia maanani athari zinazotokana na shugli za binadamu kama tabia za spishi malishoni, ushusiano baina ya mnyama mwindaji na mnyama anaye windwa pamoja na muingiliano uliomo baina ya jumuia mbalibali za spishi.Kamera za mbali ziliwekwa ilikudadisi na kutofautisha mabadiliko ya tabia siku baina ya wanyama wanaokula majani nakuishi kwenye mazingara yaliyo lindwa na wanyama wanaokula majani na kuishi kwenye mazingira ya jamii za wafungaj, kisha tukatafiti maumbile ya uzito ya mwili, upendeleo wa lishe na tabia za spishi kama viashiria vya uwezekano wa spishi kuhadharika na uwepo wa mifugoData zeta zinaonyesha mabadiliko muhimu wa nyakati za shughuli za wanyama wanaokula majani. Utafiti wetu, umebaini kuwa mifumo za shugli ziimebadilika kuelekea wakati wa machweo. Kwa kawaida mifugo huwa na shughuli wakati wa mchana na wanyama wawindaji huwa na shughuli wakati wa usiku katika mazingira ya jamii za wafugaji na spishi ambazo zilipunguza mapishano na mifugo nyakati hizo zilikuwa na uwezekano mkubwa wa kuongeza mapishano na wanyama wawindaji.Mbali na viwango vya kawaida vya shughuli za mchana za spishi, hatukupata ushahidi wowote iwapo sifa na maumbile ya spishi inauwezo wa kuashiria mabadiliko za tabia kwa uwepo wa mifugo. Badala yake, kwa ujumla spishi zilionyesha mfumo mkubwa wa shughuli wakati wa alfajiri, ikimaanisha kuwa ng'ombe wana athari ya kufanya shughuli za jamii nzima kuwa sawa.Matokeo yetu yanasisitiza kuwa kuishi pamoja kwa mifugo na wanyama pori wanaokula majani kunaweza kubadili vidaka vya wakati ya wanyama porini wanaokula majani. Mabadiliko katika mifumo ya shughuli na tabia siku yanaweza kupunguza muda wa malisho na ufanisi na kusababisha mabadiliko ya mahuhusiano baina ya mnyama mwindaji na mnyama anaye windwa. Ilikuzingatia utofauti mkubwa na aina za spishi mbalimbali, utafiti wetu unadokeza na kupendekeza kuwa mikakati ya uhifadhi yanapaswa kuzingatia kila spishi kivyake wakati wa kubuni njia za usimamizi wa wanyamapori.

AB  - Plant-soil feedbacks can mediate aboveground plant-herbivore interactions by impacting plant chemistry. Given that soil legacies and agricultural practices are closely tied, a better understanding of soil legacy cascades and their application in pest management are needed. We tested how cover crop legacies alter resistance to fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in maize (Zea mays L., Poales: Poaceae). We compared herbivore performance and behavior of fall armyworm larvae on maize grown after four cover crop treatments: a leguminous mycorrhizal cover crop (pea: Pisum sativum L., Fabales: Fabaceae), a nonleguminous mycorrhizal cover crop (triticale: x Triticosecale Wittm. Ex A. Camus, Poales: Poaceae), a nonleguminous nonmycorrhizal cover crop (radish: Raphanus sativus L., Brassicales: Brassicaceae), and no cover crops (fallow). Soil inorganic N was highest in pea treatments and lowest in triticale treatments, while maize AMF colonization was greatest when grown after mycorrhizal cover crops compared to nonmycorrhizal or no cover crops. Cover crop legacies altered the emission of maize volatiles and fall armyworm larvae oriented toward odors emitted by maize grown after radish more frequently than triticale in olfactometer assays. Additionally, larvae performed better and consumed more leaf tissue when feeding on maize grown after radish and poorest on plants grown after triticale. When damaged by fall armyworm, maize grown after triticale expressed higher levels of lipoxygenase-3 (lox3), while plants grown after radish upregulated maize proteinase inhibitor (mpi) gene expression. Our results highlight the importance of appropriate cover crop selection and suggest that triticale could strengthen maize resistance to fall armyworm.

AB  - Understanding the impact of herbivores on croplands is critical to developing sustainable agricultural landscapes. Here, we test the hypothesis that field size and landscape structure modulate the levels of herbivory in cowpea and maize subsistence croplands in Brazilian drylands. We conducted the study in nine small-scale farms with varying levels of landscape structure and field sizes (0.10-1.67 ha). In each farm, we haphazardly sampled 20 plants of maize and cowpea. The frequency of foliar herbivory was high for both crops (0.45-0.72), but the average magnitude of damage was low (<3% of leaf surface in both crops), indicating that herbivory is not an ecosystem disservice. Nonetheless, the field size and level of human impact on the landscape matrix were positively related to the frequency and magnitude of damage on maize foliage and cowpea foliage and pods. Landscape composition (proportion of woodland/forest surrounding the field) and configuration (number of surrounding woodland/forest patches) had weaker effects on herbivory levels, mixing positive and negative effects on both crops. Our findings indicate that herbivory attack is not concerning in the agricultural fields studied, but suggest that maize and cowpea should be preferably grown in small fields surrounded by an environmental-friendly matrix and patches of conserved ecosystems.

AB  - A potential barrier to the establishment of weed biological control agents is interference from other management tactics that induce plant defenses. Methods that suppress the weed such as feeding by other biological control agents or mechanical removal are especially disposed to inducing plant defenses and potentially limiting agent establishment. Here, we focused on the invasive weed Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br. (Schizaeales: Lygodiaceae, Old World climbing fern) and one of its biological control agents, the mite Floracarus perrepae Knihinicki and Boczek (Acariformes: Eriophyidae). We experimentally induced plant defenses in potted plants via damage or application of jasmonic acid, a hormone typically involved in plant defenses, and measured the responses of the mite in a screenhouse. Localized damage to the pinnae (e.g., leaflets) via cutting or larval feeding from a second biological control agent, Neomusotima conspurcatalis (Warren) (Lepidoptera; Crambidae), reduced F. perrepae gall formation, but not the number of mites per gall. In contrast, damage to rachises (e.g., stems) did not affect galling, likely because plant defense responses were not systemic. Application of jasmonic acid reduced gall formation but not the numbers of mites within galls. Taken together, we found that localized damage interfered with gall formation but not within-gall reproduction. However, these effects on the mite from induced plant defenses are likely short-lived, and therefore interference between management tactics is unlikely to affect F. perrepae establishment and performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Biological invasions, such as those by the Asiatic rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), threaten biodiversity, ecosystems, economies, and human health. This study used the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS software to predict the global distribution of this invasive beetle. The model identified areas with high suitability for the beetle mainly between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, particularly in South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern Oceania. Key environmental factors influencing its distribution include the amount of precipitation in the wettest month, temperatures in July and November, and precipitation in September. These findings can guide efforts to prevent and control the spread of this beetle and inform quarantine measures.Abstract The Asiatic rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is a destructive invasive species that poses a serious threat to palms, oil palms, and other plants. Defining a suitable area for the distribution of O. rhinoceros is essential for the development of appropriate policies and preventive measures. In this work, the MaxEnt niche model and ArcGIS software were used to predict the potential geographic distribution of O. rhinoceros in the world based on occurrence data and related environmental variables and to speculate on the influence of environmental variables on the distribution of O. rhinoceros. The results showed that the suitable areas of O. rhinoceros beetle were mainly distributed in 30 degrees N-30 degrees S, and the highly suitable areas were concentrated in South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern Oceania. The key environmental variables that determine the distribution location of O. rhinoceros are Precipitation of Wettest Month (bio13), Temperature of July (tmin7), Minimum Temperature of November (tmin11), and Precipitation of September (prec9). The prediction results of the MaxEnt model can reflect the global distribution of O. rhinoceros. This study can provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of O. rhinoceros and the development of relevant quarantine measures.

AB  - Our understanding of herbivorous insect's host selection is often based on observed associations with host plants, which can be biased by relative plant abundance, leading to inaccurate assumptions of preference. These biases may be particularly pronounced for insects associated with bryophytes, where dominance patterns are less evident. Estimating selection tendencies is also challenging for rare species with unique ecologies. Boreus hyemalis, a winter-active insect, associates with a range of bryophyte species, yet its specificity in moss-host selection remains unclear. This study investigates whether B. hyemalis shows non-random distribution among bryophyte species in natural habitats and laboratory settings. Field surveys revealed associations with 21 moss species, with significant selection tendencies toward Dicranella heteromalla and Hypnum cupressiforme, with moss species richness being a key factor for boreid inhabitance. Laboratory tests assessed selection among 14 moss species, including H. cupressiforme morphotypes, under controlled conditions. Results indicated Polytrichum formosum was the most frequently selected in the lab. Despite some discrepancies between field and lab findings, B. hyemalis shows specific selection tendencies for particular moss species. These results provide new insights into the ecological interactions between bryophytes and this winter-active insect, emphasizing the importance of moss structure and species richness in shaping B. hyemalis distribution.

AB  - Species of Camellia oleifera, Ca. sinensis and Ca. japonica represent globally-important tree germplasm resource and have significant ecological and economic value. However, they have suffered from anthracnose caused by pathogenic fungi from the genus of Colletotrichum. To determine the diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with Camellia anthracnose in China, we collected infected leaves from three major cultivation provinces. A total number of 167 fungal strains resembling Colletotrichum were obtained, 41 from Ca. oleifera, 48 from Ca. sinensis, and 78 from Ca. japonica. Comparison of morphology and phylogenetic analyses based on six loci (ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2 and ITS) of the representative isolates revealed that they fall in four species complexes and represent 15 known and one undescribed taxa. The species complexes are Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. camelliae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. jiangxiense, C. pandanicola, C. siamense, C. wuxiense and C. puerense described here), C. acutatum (C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae), C. boninense (C. boninense and C. karstii) and C. orchidearum (C. clivicola and C. plurivorum). Of these, C. fructicola was the most dominant species occurring on Ca. oleifera (68.3%), Ca. sinensis (50.0%) and Ca. japonica (29.49%). Pathogenicity test results indicated that C. camelliae is the most pathogenic to the three Camellia species. This study represents the first report of C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. boninense, C. camelliae, C. clivicola, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. jiangxinse, C. karstii, C. nymphaeae, C. pandanicola and C. wuxiense causing anthracnose on Ca. japonica and C. pandanicola on Ca. sinensis. Knowledge gained in this study enlarges our understanding of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose on three important Camellia trees and contributes to the disease management.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms of freezing tolerance are unresolved in the perennial trees that can survive under much lower freezing temperatures than annual herbs. Since natural conditions involve many factors and temperature usually cannot be controlled, field experiments alone cannot directly identify the effects of freezing stress. Lab experiments are insufficient for trees to complete cold acclimation and cannot reflect natural freezing-stress responses. In this study, a new method was proposed using field plus lab experiments to identify freezing tolerance and associated genes in subtropical evergreen broadleaf trees using Camellia oleifera as a case. Cultivated C. oleifera is the dominant woody oil crop in China. Wild C. oleifera at the high-elevation site in Lu Mountain could survive below -30 degrees C, providing a valuable genetic resource for the breeding of freezing tolerance. In the field experiment, air temperature was monitored from autumn to winter on wild C. oleifera at the high-elevation site in Lu Mountain. Leave samples were taken from wild C. oleifera before cold acclimation, during cold acclimation and under freezing temperature. Leaf transcriptome analyses indicated that the gene functions and expression patterns were very different during cold acclimation and under freezing temperature. In the lab experiments, leaves samples from wild C. oleifera after cold acclimation were placed under -10 degrees C in climate chambers. A cultivated C. oleifera variety "Ganwu 1" was used as a control. According to relative conductivity changes of leaves, wild C. oleifera showed more freezing-tolerant than cultivated C. oleifera. Leaf transcriptome analyses showed that the gene expression patterns were very different between wild and cultivated C. oleifera in the lab experiment. Combing transcriptome results in both of the field and lab experiments, the common genes associated with freezing-stress responses were identified. Key genes of the flg22, Ca2+ and gibberellin signal transduction pathways and the lignin biosynthesis pathway may be involved in the freezing-stress responses. Most of the genes had the highest expression levels under freezing temperature in the field experiment and showed higher expression in wild C. oleifera with stronger freezing tolerance in the lab experiment. Our study may help identify freezing tolerance and underlying molecular mechanisms in trees.

AB  - Hypoxic environments are significant factors in the induction of various kidney diseases and are closely associated with high oxygen consumption in the kidneys. Yaks live at high altitude for a long time, exhibit a unique ability to regulate kidney oxygen consumption, protecting them from hypoxia-induced damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of oxygen consumption in yak kidneys under hypoxic conditions remain unclear. To explore this hypoxia adaptation mechanism in yak kidneys, this study analyzed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) under hypoxia. We found that the OCR and apoptosis rates of RTECs under chronic hypoxia (> 24 h) were lower than those under acute hypoxia (<= 24 h). However, when oxygen consumption was promoted under chronic hypoxia, the apoptosis rate increased, indicating that reducing the cellular OCR is crucial for maintaining RTECs activity under hypoxia. High-throughput sequencing results showed that the mitophagy pathway is likely a key mechanism for inhibiting OCR of yak RTECs, with protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 2 (PRKAA2) playing a significant role in this process. Further studies demonstrated that chronic hypoxia activates the mitophagy pathway, which inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while increasing glycolytic flux in yak RTECs. Conversely, when the mitophagy pathway was inhibited, there was an increase in the activity of OXPHOS enzymes and OCR. To further explore the role of PRKAA2 in the mitophagy pathway, we inhibited PRKAA2 expression under chronic hypoxia. Results showed that the downregulation of PRKAA2 decreased the expression of mitophagy-related proteins, such as p-FUNDC1/FUNDC1, LC3-II/LC3-I, BNIP3 and ULK1 while upregulating P62 expression. Additionally, there was an increase in the enzyme activities of Complex II, Complex IV, PDH, and SDH, which further promoted oxygen consumption in RTECs. These findings suggest that PRKAA2 mediated mitophagy under chronic hypoxia is crucial mechanism for reducing oxygen consumption in yak RTECs.

AB  - Plants live in association with a multitude of microorganisms, some of which may improve the plant's defense toward herbivores. In a previous study, we showed that Metarhizium brunneum, a fungus mostly known as an insect pathogen, can associate with cabbage roots and prime an increased myrosinase activity upon attack by Plutella xylostella larvae. Here, we ask whether another Metarhizium species, M. robertsii, also primes plant defense and whether this involves leaf glucosinolate content in addition to myrosinase activity. In addition, we tested whether priming reverses after removal of larvae. M. robertsii established and could be reisolated from roots at the end of the experiment, 43 days after inoculation. Before larval herbivory, leaf glucosinolate content and myrosinase activity did not differ between fungal-inoculated and control plants. Immediately after herbivory, in contrast, both the glucosinolate content and myrosinase activity were higher in inoculated plants than in control plants and less leaf material was consumed of the inoculated plants. Twenty-four hours after herbivory, glucosinolates, and myrosinase activity had decreased again to levels like before herbivory. Total biomass and shoot-root ratio were not affected by M. robertsii colonization. In conclusion, Metarhizium fungi can associate with Brassica roots and prime above-ground glucosinolate content and myrosinase activity. The increased defense levels were down-regulated 24 h after herbivory. Root-associated Metarhizium species may thus affect above-ground herbivores indirectly by host plant priming, in addition to their well-known direct effects as insect pathogens.

AB  - The western Terai Arc Landscape (wTAL) in Uttarakhand, India, marks the range limit for the Asian elephant in north-western India. This region has been impacted by land-use changes and infrastructure expansion for the last seven decades. To evaluate the impact of habitat deterioration on the population structure of elephants in the region, we characterized their genetic diversity and local genetic structure using mitochondrial (D loop) and nuclear DNA (microsatellites; n = 15) markers. We used tissue samples of 114 elephants from five different sub-populations, collected between 2005 and 2014. The genetic variation was moderate (H-O = 0.49-0.55) compared with other Indian elephant populations. Two mtDNA haplotypes were identified without strong spatial patterns across wTAL. Bayesian individual-based clustering algorithm identified two genetic clusters (K = 2) with high admixture (50% at Q < 0.7) and no spatial adherence. Though K = 1 was not supported by the Bayesian algorithm, multivariate analysis and sibship patterns did not indicate genetic differentiation. The lack of spatial genetic structuring suggests high levels of gene flow, indicating that this population is still panmictic. This suggests that the life history traits of elephants as well as the ecological features of this landscape influence genetic connectivity. However, ongoing land use changes necessitate regular genetic monitoring in wTAL to identify incipient structuring caused by anthropogenic barriers to movement.

AB  - Aim Latitudinal gradients in life-history traits are apparent in many taxa and are expected to be strong for ectotherms that have temperature-driven constraints on performance and fitness. The strength of these gradients, however, should also be affected by diet. Because diet type (carnivory, omnivory, herbivory) influences accessibility to nutrition and assimilation efficiency, we aim to study how diet affects latitudinal gradients in lifetime reproductive output and the underlying life-history traits in ectotherms. Location Global. Time period Recent. Major taxa studied Lizards (Reptilia, Squamata, Sauria). Methods We used empirical (352 species) and phylogenetically imputed data (563 species) to analyse the interactive effects of latitude and diet on life-history traits (longevity, age at maturity, reproductive life span, hatchling mass, clutch/brood size, clutch/brood frequency, female mass) and lifetime reproductive output of lizards. Results Lifetime reproductive output does not significantly differ in lizards across diet types, and only carnivores exhibit a small increase at higher latitudes. Diet type, however, influences latitudinal patterns of individual life-history traits. Carnivores exhibit a shift towards 'slower-paced' life histories at higher latitudes for most traits (increased longevity, age at maturity, reproductive life span, and decreased clutch frequency). By contrast, herbivores either display 'faster-paced' life histories (reduction in reproductive life span, hatchling mass, female mass) or no change (clutch frequency, clutch size, age at maturity) at higher latitudes. Omnivores exhibit intermediate and muted latitudinal patterns. Main conclusions We suggest that the nutritional challenges of herbivory, compounded by thermal constraints at higher latitudes, may explain differences in life-history characteristics of herbivorous ectotherms. Intermediate patterns exhibited by omnivores highlight how flexibility in diet can buffer environmental challenges at higher latitudes. Our results indicate that lizards with different diet types display various trends in their life histories across latitudes, which eventually balance out to result in similar reproductive outputs throughout their lifetime, with little benefits to carnivory.

AB  - Simple Summary In the arid lands of Northern Mexico, there are several dairy cattle clusters managed under intensive production systems and fed completely with mixed rations, yet 3-5% feed rejection of the total ration offered has been reported. This surplus feed retains a high nutritional value which could be used to improve the reproductive efficiency of goats managed under marginal-extensive schemes. Therefore, we visualized an interesting research opportunity based on the circular economy approach. We hypothesized that a short-term supplementation with feed leftovers from dairy farms (i.e., intensive system) will increase the reproductive outcomes of rangeland managed goats (i.e., extensive system), trying to promote the circularity/connectedness between two highly discordant production systems. Our study intended to elucidate this working hypothesis. Based on a circular economy approach, we evaluated the possible effect of targeted supplementation with leftover feed from dairy cows (i.e., intensive system) on the reproductive performance of crossbred/rangeland goats (i.e., extensive system) in arid Northern Mexico. During the deep-anestrous season (i.e., March-April, 25 & DEG; North), multiparous goats (n = 38) with a similar body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) supplemented group (SG; n = 19; BCS: 1.76 & PLUSMN; 0.07; BW: 43.7 & PLUSMN; 1.8 kg), receiving 400 g goat d(-1) of dairy-cow-feed leftovers prior to grazing; and (2) non-supplemented group (NS; n = 19; BCS: 1.76 & PLUSMN; 0.06; BW: 44.3 & PLUSMN; 2.5 kg). Both groups were directed to the rangeland for a period of & AP;8 h. While the experimental period lasted 36 d, the experimental breeding considered 11 d (d0-d10). The anovulatory status of goats was ultrasonographically confirmed on days -20, -10, and -1 prior to male-female interaction. Previously, bucks were separated for 3 weeks from the experimental females and received exogenous testosterone every third day (i.e., 50 mg i.m.) prior to mating. With respect to the response variables, namely BW, BCS, blood glucose levels (BGLs), estrus induction (GIE, %), latency to estrus (LTE, h), estrus duration (ED, h), and luteal tissue volume (LTV, mm), no differences (p > 0.05) occurred between experimental groups. However, the response variables, namely goats ovulating (GO, %; 78.9 vs. 47.3), total number of corpuses luteum (TNCL, n; 27 vs. 13), ovulation rate (OR, n; 1.42 vs. 0.73), multiple ovulation (MO, %; 73.3 vs. 55.5), and pregnancy rate on d 36 (PRd36, %, 68.4 vs. 36.8), favored (p < 0.05) the SG over the NS goats. Our results demonstrate that connecting the circularity of two divergent ruminant production systems (i.e., cow-intensive and goat-extensive) by using dairy cows' feed leftovers as a targeted supplementation strategy in anestrous goats under a marginal-rangeland production system enhanced out-of-season reproductive outcomes (i.e., ovulation rate and pregnancy rate), thus benefiting marginal goat producers and their families.

AB  - In order to understand the characteristics and influencing factors of surface release fluxes in the typical agro-pastoral mosaic region of the Songnen grasslands of northern China, this study selected two sample plots to, respectively, represent the L. chinensis covered grassland (L), and the Z. mays covered fields (Z) in the Waizi area of Changling County, with western Jilin Province as the study area. This study investigated the atmospheric mercury (Total Gaseous Mercury (TGM)) concentrations, surface soil mercury concentrations, the gaseous elemental mercury exchange fluxes, and related environmental factors. The results showed that the TGM concentrations in two sample plots in the study area were basically the same during the summer and autumn months, but were higher in summer than in autumn, and there was a clear diurnal pattern. The average mercury concentrations in the surface soil were also higher in summer than in autumn. Furthermore, the surface soil has a clear mercury release process, and the mercury release were higher in the sheep grass field than the maize field during the same season. The mercury release fluxes in each site within the ecotone were related to the solar radiation and soil temperature values, and the effects of them on the soil mercury release were independent from one another.

AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a key variable for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from satellite data. In this study, five emissivity radiative transfer models (RTMs) for vegetation canopies are investigated together with a classification-based methodology to produce canopy LSE maps over the Iberian Peninsula with EOS Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The five canopy RTMs are FR97, Mod3, REN15, 4SAIL, and CE-P. The analysis of the RTMs' performance with satellite data gains interest over partially vegetated surfaces, for which these models can obtain accurate emissivities. The sensitivity analyses showed that FR97, REN15, 4SAIL, and CE-P models have higher uncertainty for low leaf area indexes (LAIs), while the Mod3 model increases the uncertainty with LAI. The produced LSEs were first intercompared with emissivities from the MODIS MYD21A1 product, which is obtained with the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method. The RTMs agreed with the TES emissivities within the given uncertainty. In addition, the RTM emissivities were compared with MYD11A1 and MYD11B1 MODIS products, and the IREMIS and CAMEL databases, and they were used to estimate the LST at three specific homogeneous sites: shrubland, vineyard, and olive orchard. The LSTs estimated with each modeled emissivity and emissivity products were validated against reference data at these sites. All RTMs provided accurate LST data, equal to or even better than the MODIS products, with median values of differences between -0.7 K and 0.4 K depending on the site. Therefore, the canopy emissivity RTMs used in this study, together with the classification-based methodology, showed to be suitable for satellite LST retrieval.

AB  - Geographical distribution and abundance of the pupae of six blackfly species of medical and veterinary concern were studied in eastern Spain according to three different sets of explanatory variables including in-stream variables, both (i) abiotic (i.e., physicochemical) and (ii) biotic (i.e., richness and abundance of either taxonomically or ecologically close related taxa), as well as (iii) meteorological and landscape variables. The results showed specific habitat requirements for pupation in Simulium (Boophthora) erythrocephalum (De Geer, 1776) and Simulium (Wilhelmia) equinum (Linnaeus, 1758), two of the six species studied regarding elevation and temperature. While the rest of the species showed a certain degree of ecological overlap, co-occurrence was in general low, which suggested that antagonistic biotic factors may be important in structuring blackfly assemblages. In effect, biotic predictors explained a high proportion (50%-70%) of the variability in the abundance of the pupae of the most generalist blackfly species, although further studies are needed to disentangle the sign of interspecific interactions. At the landscape level, S. (W.) equinum and S. (W.) pseudequinum Seguy, 1921 breeding habitats were associated with the presence of pig farms, and S. (Simulium) reptans (Linnaeus, 1758) and S. (B.) erythrocephalum with the presence of cattle.

AB  - Yaks (Bos grunniens) exhibit exceptional adaptation to the challenging high-altitude environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, making them the sole bovine species capable of thriving in such exreme conditions. Investigating the cellular and molecular characteristics of yak ovaries across different reproductive states is crucial for gaining insight into their ovarian functions. Herein, the cellular atlases of yak ovaries in different reproductive states were depicted by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The cellular atlases of the ovaries were established by identifying specific gene expression patterns of various cell types, including granulosa cells, theca cells, stromal cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, glial cell, macrophages, natural killer cells, and proliferating cells. The cellular compositions of the ovaries vary among different reproductive states. Furthermore, the granulosa cells comprise six cell subtypes, while theca cells consist of eight cell subtypes. The granulosa cells and theca cells exhibit distinct biological functions throughout different reproductive states. The two cell types were aligned along their respective pseudotime trajectories. Moreover, a cell-to-cell communication network was constructed among distinct cell types within the ovary, spanning the three reproductive states. Notably, during the estrus period, the granulosa cells demonstrated more prominent interactions with other cell types compared to the remaining reproductive states.

AB  - Assisted migration consists of the introduction of a species to previously inhabited areas or to new suitable regions. Such introductions have been touted as a viable tool for conserving the earth's biodiversity. However, both the likely success of assisted migrations and the impacts on local communities are hotly debated. Empirical data on the local impacts of assisted migration are particularly lacking. We examined the short and long time-scale effects of herbivory on Lonicera involucrata (Richards) Banks ex. Spreng (Caprifoliaceae) after an introduction of Euphydryas gillettii Barnes (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae, Melitaeini) to Gunnison County, Colorado, USA, via an assisted migration in 1977. The plant is the primary larval host plant for the butterfly. We quantified plant seed production, plant survival, and population stage structure in two sets of observational experiments. We found that herbivory by E. gillettii increased L. involucrata reproduction on an annual time scale, independent of plant size and local microhabitat characteristics. Over the time since the butterfly's introduction, herbivory by E. gillettii resulted in a plant population structure biased toward smaller plants in the butterfly introduction and satellite sites compared with sites without the butterfly. Our results highlight the importance of studying the effects of assisted migrations on native populations at different temporal scales. As assisted migration becomes an indispensable tool for species conservation, our work adds to the understanding of the multi-trophic impacts of assisted introductions on local populations and communities.

AB  - This investigation was undertaken to characterize health effects associated with a major bloom of blue-green algae due to the proliferation Microcystis aeruginosa that occurred in Florida in 2018. Cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs), that have been reported to cause illness in exposed persons worldwide. Widespread exposure to toxins released by blue-green algae during the 2018 bloom was shown by the presence of MCs in the nasal passages of 95 percent of the individuals studied previously in south Florida (Schaefer et al., 2020). The current analyses were conducted to determine whether self-reported symptoms were associated with activity patterns, direct contact with water, residential, recreational, and occupational exposure. The 125 persons who participated in the initial study reported an average of 4.94 (+/- 4.87) symptoms. Those reported most commonly included rhinorrhea, sneezing, headache, sore throat and dry cough. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 74%, ocular symptoms by 62%, and gastrointestinal symptoms by 35% of respondents. Residential and recreational exposures were associated with increased risks of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or ocular symptoms in univariate and adjusted multivariable analyses. Residential exposure was significantly associated with increased reporting of dry cough (p = 0.03), dyspnea (p < 0.01) and wheezy respirations (p = 0.04). Among persons reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea (p = 0.02) and abdominal pain (p < 0.01) were significantly associated with residential exposure. Recreational exposure was significantly associated with sore throat and eye irritation. The findings add to the evidence that exposure to cyanobacteria at concentrations encountered during an algal bloom is associated with a diverse array of symptoms and that inhalation of aerosols constitutes an important exposure pathway.

AB  - Fermented dairy products have been studied for their physiological functions, particularly their antioxidant properties. Dadih is a traditional Indonesian fermented dairy product produced from buffalo milk and prepared in bamboo tubes that exhibit functional properties. Compared to cow milk, goat milk has gained more attention for dadih production due to its low allergen count and ease of digestion. In our previous study, we identified the dipeptide glycine-methionine (Gly-Met) generated from goat milk dadih as a novel antioxidant peptide. This study aimed to investigate the antiaging effects of Gly-Met in Caenorhabditis elegans using an in vivo model. Initially, the effective concentration (EC50) was determined and Gly-Met exhibited an effective antioxidant activity value of 0.96 mg/mL. Our results demonstrated that Gly-Met significantly extended the mean lifespan, enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in C. elegans. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of Nsy-1, Sek-1, and Pmk-1 that are the target genes of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway was upregulated in C. elegans. Subsequently, Skn-1 and Gcs-1 expression levels were significantly upregulated. Activation of SKN-1 target genes may be modulated by the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Our study revealed that Gly-Met, an antioxidative peptide identified in goat milk dadih, may contribute to antiaging effects through the SKN-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in C. elegans.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the possibility of masking boar taint or skatole levels by adding dried Origanum vulgare or Allium sativum in two experiments and to evaluate the sensory preferences towards the skatole concentration in different carcass parts (longissimus lumborum; semimembranosus; neck chop and subcutaneous fat). The results of the first experiment showed that the percentages of samples with low (0.069 mu g/g) and medium (0.269 mu g/g) concentrations of skatole differed significantly between the control group and the groups treated with Origanum vulgare or Allium sativum. According to the results of the second experiment, meat samples from leaner parts, such as the semimembranosus, longissimus lumborum, and neck chop not treated with Allium sativum and Origanum vulgare for masking, were significantly worse in terms of the occurrence of boar taint or abnormal odour. No significant differences were found between the two masking methods. With increasing efforts to ban surgical castration, it is important to find ways to mask the level of boar taint in meat. The aim of this study was to test the possibility of masking boar taint or skatole levels by adding dried Origanum vulgare or Allium sativum and to evaluate consumer sensory preferences towards the skatole concentration in different carcass parts (longissimus lumborum; semimembranosus; neck chop and subcutaneous fat) and the masking strategy (addition of Allium sativum or Origanum vulgare). In the first experiment, the effect of the masking strategy was evaluated at three different skatole concentrations (0.069, 0.269 and 0.463 mu g/g). The results showed that the samples with low and medium skatole levels were significantly different between the control group and the groups treated with Origanum vulgare or Allium sativum. In both cases, the addition of Allium sativum and Origanum vulgare had a positive effect on the parameters of abnormal odour and pleasantness of odour (p < 0.05). According to the results of the second experiment, meat samples from leaner parts, such as the neck chop semimembranosus and longissimus lumborum, not treated with Allium sativum and Origanum vulgare for masking, were significantly (p < 0.05) worse in terms of the occurrence of boar taint or abnormal odour than the masked samples. No significant differences were found between the two masking methods.

AB  - The long rough dab (Hippoglossoides platessoides) is one of the most common bottom dwelling fish species in the Barents Sea with a limited commercial value, even though it is regularly caught as bycatch. Adult H. platessoides can be found in large numbers along the west coast of Svalbard, but nothing is known about the spawning area of this species or the distribution of their eggs and larvae within Svalbard fjords. Recent findings of H. platessoides eggs in Kongsfjorden indicate that a spawning population exists either within the fjord or on the west Spitsbergen shelf.

AB  - Farm roadway runoff is a high-risk source of pollution when connectivity with waters occurs. Nutrients in this runoff are dominated by fresh animal deposits, but recent dairy and beef farm studies showed that available phosphorus (P) accumulates in roadway surface material and can be lost in runoff. A current knowledge gap is to examine available P concentrations in unsealed roadway and trackway (non-maintained) network of a lowland sheep farm. The present study focused on a 45 ha farm stocked with 544 sheep in south-east Ireland. Ten locations were sampled along with the adjacent fields for available P (i.e., Morgan's P) and ancillary parameters (e.g., pH, total P and heavy metals) in December 2022. The first sampling location was on an aggregate roadway and the other nine were on trackways representing an older aggregate roadway network used by the flock but now covered with soil and grass. Results showed a distinct difference in surface material pH between roadway and trackway locations. Trackways had a pH that mimicked adjacent fields around the agronomic optimum for grassland of similar to 6.2. All sampling locations had elevated available P concentrations, ranging from 26.3 to 111.0 mg L-1 (mean 62.8 mg L-1), similar to the spatial distribution for dairy farms but above those found at beef farms previously studied. The highest available P concentrations were found in roadway and trackway sections adjacent to the farmyard. Other elevated sampling areas were on trackways (87.3 or 97.7 mg P L-1) away from the farmyard where sheep are funnelled to pasture, stop to seek shade, urinate and defecate but do not graze. By contrast the average available P concentration for the surrounding fields was 8.4 mg L-1 with a range of 2.7-15.9 mg L-1. Two sampling areas combine to create a critical source area where a high available P source becomes visibly mobilised as runoff during rainfall, discharges into an open drainage ditch, which is then connected to a local stream. Breaking the pathway before runoff enters the open ditch could be a cheap and effective way of mitigating nutrient losses at these two locations.

AB  - Simple Summary High ambient temperature provokes heat stress in animals. Observed signs of heat stress in pigs include altered physiological constants, changes in feeding behavior, reduced weight gain, or even body weight loss. Short-term exposition to heat stress has been associated with alterations in small intestine physiology, including digestion and absorption of nutrients. Those alterations reduce when pigs start the acclimation process to heat stress, which may occur at around one week of exposure to high ambient temperature. In this study, the short- (2 days) and long- (7 days) term exposure to natural heat stress on performance, blood components, and intestinal integrity of growing pigs were analyzed. Short-term heat stress reduced pig performance and altered blood components. Intestinal integrity was affected drastically at day 2 under heat stress conditions, but pigs started to recover most of their growth rate and intestinal integrity at day 7. The effect of short- and long-term exposure to heat stress (HS) was analyzed on blood components, performance, and intestinal epithelium integrity of pigs. Eighteen pigs (36.0 +/- 3.5 kg BW) were assigned to three groups: thermo-neutral (TN); 2 d exposure to HS (2dHS); and 7 d exposure to HS (7dHS). Blood chemistry and hemogram analyses were performed; small intestine samples were analyzed for mRNA expression and histology. Compared to TN, 2dHS and 7dHS pigs reduced weight gain and feed intake; weight gain was higher in 7dHS than in 2dHS pigs (p < 0.05). White blood cells, platelet, and hematocrit were affected in 2dHS and 7dHS compared to TN pigs (p < 0.05). Short- and long-term exposure to HS affected blood concentration of triglycerides, urea, total protein, and albumin (p <= 0.05). Villi-height and crypt-depth decreased in HS pigs (p < 0.01). Mucin-producing and apoptotic cell number increased in 7dHS compared to TN pigs (p < 0.05). Expression of tight-junction-proteins decreased in 2dHS pigs compared to TN and 7dHS pigs (p < 0.05). Short-term exposure of pigs to HS dramatically affects performance, blood components, and integrity of the small intestine epithelia; nevertheless, pigs show signs of recovery at 7 d of HS exposure.

AB  - Typical sources of nitrate pollution in the fragile ecological environment of karst areas, such as agricultural production activities and domestic sewage, have long attracted serious concern. However, coal development can play an equally significant role in releasing the nitrogen fixed in coal into surface watersheds in the form of nitrate, nitrite, or ammonia, consequently threatening the water quality of surface water systems in mining areas. In this study, a typical karst surface watershed system affected by coal mining activities was selected for an in-depth investigation with the aim of realistically assessing the potential contribution of coal mining to nitrogen pollution. The results reveal increasingly concerning nitrate pollution from August 2020 to November 2021 in the Huatan River watershed under the influence of anthropogenic activities, especially mining development and agricultural production. Given that the nitrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of nitrate do not support the presence of denitrification, the variation in the NO3-/Cl- ratio and the relatively stable Cl- concentration may be a reflection of nitrification. Although the leaching of atmospheric precipitation on the strata in the basin promoted the release of nitrogen associated with coal mining, the higher rate of nitrogen cycling in the oligotrophic mine water environment limited the contribution of coal mining to nitrogen pollution in the surface watershed. Specifically, the contribution of coal mining activities to nitrogen pollution in surface karst river is mainly NH4+-N, which contributes 10% or less to the nitrate input to the waters of the Huatan River. The findings thus highlight the necessity of further uncovering the geochemical cycling process of nitrogen during the transport of mine water in the coal mining environment.

AB  - Penaeus vannamei is a vital crustacean species in global aquaculture. It is challenged by various pathogens, including the devastating White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), which often causes high mortality rates. Hippo signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism controlling organ development and immune responses, has been implicated in antiviral defense. In this study, we identified and characterized the core components (PvHpo, PvSav, PvWts, and PvMats) of the Hippo kinase cascade in P. vannamei. Transcriptional analysis linked the Hippo kinase cascade to WSSV infection, which displayed distinct expression patterns. They were upregulated in hepatopancreas, while down-regulated in gills post WSSV infection. The central component, PvHpo, was further studied. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that PvHpo played a crucial role in immune regulation against WSSV. Subcellular localization of PvHpo in shrimp hemocytes suggested its cytoplasmic growthsuppressive function. Moreover, transcriptome analysis and knockdown experiments implicated PvHpo in regulating antiviral responses through apoptosis, and modulation of signaling pathways as well, such as mTOR, Toll, Imd, and C-type lectin receptors. This work established a connection between Hippo signaling pathway and WSSV, which opened new avenues for developing effective antiviral strategies in shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - A prominent hypothesis for the adaptive value of anthocyanin production in the autumn leaves of trees and shrubs is that anthocyanins protect leaves from photooxidative stress at low temperatures, allowing a better resorption of nutrients-in particular, nitrogen-before leaf fall. While there is evidence that anthocyanins enable photoprotection, it is not clear whether this translates to improved nitrogen translocation and how this can explain inter-specific variation in autumn colours. A recent comparative analysis showed no correlation between temperature and anthocyanin production across species but did not analyse nitrogen content and nitrogen resorption efficiency. Here, we provide this comparison by analysing the nitrogen content of mature and senescent leaves and their autumn colours in 55 species of trees. We find no correlation between the presence of anthocyanins and the efficiency of nitrogen resorption. We find, instead, that nitrogen resorption is more efficient in species with yellow autumn colours, pointing to chlorophyll resorption, rather than anthocyanin synthesis, as the main determinant of nitrogen translocation efficiency. Hence, our results do not corroborate the photoprotection hypothesis for the evolution of autumn colours.

AB  - This study provides a detailed analysis of a medium-scale commercial sago palm weevil farm in Pattani province, Thailand. It focuses on farming techniques, sustainability, cost analysis, and carbon footprint calculation. The farming setup includes the use of plastic containers for breeding and utilizes sago palm sawdust and commercial pig feed as substrates. The larvae are reared in controlled conditions, with a typical production cycle of 45 days yielding 0.5 to 0.7 kg of larvae per container. The production cost per kilogram of larvae was calculated at 113.6 THB i.e. 3.4 USD, with a selling price of 200 THB, resulting in a net profit of 86 THB per kilogram, or approximately 43,000 THB i.e. 1274.1 USD per cycle. Sustainability analysis revealed that the farm's carbon footprint is primarily driven by pig feed and energy consumption, with a total estimated annual carbon footprint of 8,041.25 kg CO2e. The carbon footprint per kilogram of larvae turned out to be approximately 2.71 kg CO2e which is lower than the conventional livestocks. This study highlights the economic viability of sago palm weevil farming and its environmental impact, suggesting areas for potential improvements in sustainability practices.

AB  - We describe a new genus and species of large-bodied murine from archaeological deposits at Liang Bua, a limestone cave in western Flores, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Among a large assemblage of murine remains, several mandibular elements recovered from mostly Holocene sediments show a distinct anatomy, with a long and robust jaw, massive proodont incisors, and relatively small molars. These morphological features are unusual among murines but most similar to terrestrial and carnivorous species of the Indo-Pacific, colloquially referred to as shrew rats (Philippines, Sulawesi) or moss mice (New Guinea), and indicate a potential carnivorous dietary adaptation, perhaps specializing in a vermivorous diet. The size of the mandible indicates that this murine is the largest shrew rat yet known. Although presumed extinct, targeted field research is needed to determine if this rat still lives on Flores today.

AB  - A stochastic SEIW brucellosis model with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is investigated. In the model, we consider some of the realities of brucellosis transmission, such as the existence of incubation period and environmental pathogen contamination, and the spread of brucellosis also in incubation period and contaminated environment. The threshold values R0e and R0s for the stochastic extinction of the disease and the existence of a stationary distribution are established. Specifically, if R-0(e) < 1, then brucellosis almost surely exponentially dies out; otherwise, if R-0(s )> 1, then brucellosis is persistent in the mean, and the model also has ergodic property and at least one stationary distribution. Furthermore, when R-0 > 1, where R0 is the basic reproduction number of the corresponding deterministic model, the specific expression of an approximate normal density function around quasi-positive equilibrium is calculated. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results, discuss the change of R0e with the main parameters beta 1, beta 2, alpha and l and examine the relationship between R0 and R0s. The specific expression of the marginal probability density function is obtained through a numerical simulation. The numerical simulation indicates that, in the real world, environmental interference may promote the spread of brucellosis.

AB  - High-quality oocyte production strategies play an important role in animal-assisted reproductive biotechnologies, and rapamycin (Rap) has been commonly used to increase the development potential of mammalian oocytes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and possible molecular mechanisms of rap on the maturation of yak oocytes. Different concentrations of Rap were supplemented during in vitro maturation (IVM) of yak oocytes. The maturation rates of oocytes and development rates of parthenogenetically activated embryos were assessed. The levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were detected via ELISA, and the expression of autophagy-related factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and HIF-1 alpha was detected via qRT-PCR, western blotting, and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. In addition, the impacts of E2 and HIF-1 alpha on Rap-mediated oocyte autophagy were investigated by investigating the activities of E2 and HIF-1 alpha. Our results showed that 0.1 nM Rap substantially enhanced the developmental ability of yak oocytes. In this group, the levels of E2, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, and autophagy-related factors were also significantly increased, and the expression of ATG5 and BECN1 in subsequent embryos was also increased. Further analysis revealed that Rap tends to enhance the development competence of yak oocytes and that the levels of autophagy-related factors are reduced when the activity of E2 or HIF-1 alpha is inhibited. Furthermore, the levels of E2, CYP19A1, and CYP17A1 were downregulated when the activity of HIF-1 alpha was inhibited, and the levels of HIF-1 alpha were also significantly reduced by the estrogen receptor antagonist G15. Nevertheless, the levels of CYP11A1 mRNA in mature yak COCs were not significantly different among these groups, a phenomenon which implies that the levels of E2 were not correlated with the CYP11A1 content in yak COCs. There was an increasing tendency for the development competence of yak oocytes at the optimum concentration of Rap during IVM. The potential underlying mechanism is that Rap can activate autophagy and upregulate the levels of E2 and HIF-1 alpha in mature oocytes. Additionally, the levels of both E2 and HIF-1 alpha are regulated by each other and involve Rap-regulated autophagy in oocytes.

AB  - Bird pollination is specific among flowering plants which support mostly cross pollination and has been regarded as an important pollination syndrome. Frequency of bird pollinators visiting flowers of the corky coral tree Erythrina suberosa Roxb., was studied in a subtropical montane forest located in Garhwal Himalaya, India. Forty trees were selected randomly in the population and the observations on birds visitors were recorded for 10 days during peak flowering. In total 18 bird species were found visiting flowers of E. suberosa. The bird species belonging to Passeriformes, Piciformes, Psittaciformes, and Cuculiformes were observed most frequently. The highest bird frequency and abundance among flower-visiting birds were recorded for the red-billed blue magpie Urocissa erythrorhyncha (26 +/- 3.2 individuals per hour per branch and 60 birds per tree, respectively), whereas the lowest - for the verditer flycatcher Eumyias thalassinus (2 +/- 0.02 individuals per hour per branch and 6 individuals per tree, respectively). Majority of the bird species followed bimodal pattern of foraging on nectar in a day (mostly morning and evenings), which is consistent with other studies carried out for other ornithophilous tree species in the Himalayan region. The birds observed in this study are presumed to be pollinators, as the majority of birds foraged on nectar of properly opened flowers oriented upwards; however, possibility of nectar robbing cannot be excluded and requires further investigation in future studies.

AB  - Context Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the oviductal fluid (oEVs) play a critical role in various reproductive processes, including sperm capacitation, fertilisation, and early embryo development. Aims To characterise porcine oEVs (poEVs) from different stages of the estrous cycle (late follicular, LF; early luteal, EL; mid luteal, ML; late luteal, LL) and investigate their impact on sperm functionality. Methods poEVs were isolated, characterised, and labelled to assess their binding to boar spermatozoa. The effects of poEVs on sperm motility, viability, acrosomal status, protein kinase A phosphorylation (pPKAs), tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P), and in in vitro fertility were analysed. Key results poEVs were observed as round or cup-shaped membrane-surrounded vesicles. Statistical analysis showed that poEVs did not significantly differ in size, quantity, or protein concentration among phases of the estrous cycle. However, LF poEVs demonstrated a higher affinity for binding to sperm. Treatment with EL, ML, and LL poEVs resulted in a decrease in sperm progressive motility and total motility. Moreover, pPKA levels were reduced in presence of LF, EL, and ML poEVs, while Tyr-P levels did not differ between groups. LF poEVs also reduced sperm penetration rate and the number of spermatozoa per penetrated oocyte (P < 0.05). Conclusions poEVs from different stages of the estrous cycle play a modulatory role in sperm functionality by interacting with spermatozoa, affecting motility and capacitation, and participating in sperm-oocyte interaction. Implications The differential effects of LF and LL poEVs suggest the potential use of poEVs as additives in IVF systems to regulate sperm-oocyte interaction.

AB  - The extinction of conditioned fear is frequently used in laboratories as a model for human exposure therapy and is crucial for studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the efficacy of specific protocols can vary greatly, and the underlying brain mechanisms are not sufficiently clarified. To address this issue, variable starting time (one or twenty-eight days after fear conditioning) and extinction protocols were used, and the efficacy and durability of fear extinction were also studied. Changes in the behavior, stress hormone levels and neuronal activation patterns of stressed rats were analyzed. Conditioned fear was rapidly and efficiently extin-guished by all the protocols investigated. However, when these extinction protocols were initiated one day after fear training, conditioned fear relapsed spontaneously four weeks later. In contrast, when extinction trials were started 28 days after conditioning, no relapse occurred. Hormone measurements taken by the end of extinction trials indicated that adrenocorticotropin, but not corticosterone responses reflected behavioral extinction without any sign of relapse. The last extinction training increased the activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and decreased the activation of the central and medial amygdala when extinction began one day after fear conditioning. By contrast, the activation of the basolateral amygdala and the entire hippocampus decreased by the last training session when extinction started 28 days after fear conditioning. Our findings show that extinction training can extinguish remote fear memories more effectively than recent ones, and that the brain mechanisms underlying remote and recent fear memory extinction differ. Laboratory models should also focus on a later time point to increase their translational value.

AB  - For studying the response of bat communities to urbanization in an area of the southern Mediterranean, acoustic and underground roost surveys were carried out in and around the city of Constantine. Echolocation calls of 10 species were recorded, with 6, 7 and 9 species in urban, suburban and rural areas, respectively. Pipistrellus kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, Tadarida teniotis, Hypsugo savii, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Eptesicus isabellinus were detected in all three area types. Myotis capaccinii was recorded only in a suburban site crossed by a permanent river. Activity of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis punicus and M. emarginatus was restricted to a few sites in the rural area. The survey of underground roosts (mine, cave, tomb) added two bat species, Plecotus gaisleri and Rhinolophus hipposideros. Overall bat activity did not show an increase from urban to rural areas. The same pattern was reported for the most active species, P. kuhlii, whereas T. teniotis was more active in urban sites, and H. savii in rural sites. This first study of bat species richness and activity in a south-Mediterranean city should be extended to different periods, including winter, and different levels of urbanization.

AB  - In pig-to-human xenotransplantation, the transmission risk of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) is of great concern. However, the distribution of PERVs in pig genomes, their genetic variation among Eurasian pigs, and their evolutionary history remain unclear. We scanned PERVs in the current pig reference genome (assembly Build 11.1), and identified 36 long complete or near-complete PERVs (IcPERVs) and 23 short incomplete PERVs (siPERVs). Besides three known PERVs (PERV-A, -B, and -C), four novel types (PERV-JX1, -JX2, -JX3, and -JX4) were detected in this study. According to evolutionary analyses, the newly discovered PERVs were more ancient, and PERV-Bs probably experienced a bottleneck similar to 0.5 million years ago (Ma). By analyzing 63 high-quality porcine whole-genome resequencing data, we found that the PERV copy numbers in Chinese pigs were lower (32.0 +/- 4.0) than in Western pigs (49.1 +/- 6.5). Additionally, the PERV sequence diversity was lower in Chinese pigs than in Western pigs. Regarding the IcPERV copy numbers, PERV-A and -JX2 in Western pigs were higher than in Chinese pigs. Notably, Bama Xiang (BMX) pigs had the lowest PERV copy number (27.8 +/- 5.1), and a BMX individual had no PERV-C and the lowest PERV copy number (23), suggesting that BMX pigs were more suitable for screening and/or modification as xenograft donors. Furthermore, we identified 451 PERV transposon insertion polymorphisms (TIPs), of which 86 were shared by all 10 Chinese and Western pig breeds. Our findings provide systematic insights into the genomic distribution, variation, evolution, and possible biological function of PERVs.

AB  - Livestock rearing and agriculture are the main sources of community-based livelihoods in western Nepal. Across the rural mid-hills region of Gandaki Province, leopards are the top predator and frequently depredate livestock and attack humans. Spatiotemporal patterns of human-leopard conflicts (HLC) in Nepal are poorly known at the provincial and national scales, which are essential to formulating effective conflict mitigation strategies and implementing them in the field. This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of HLC by applying Maxent modeling to covariates relating to known and registered conflict cases (n=842) collected from Nepalese government offices. We found that cases of HLC have been increasing significantly over the past five years. We also concluded that mid-elevation, south-facing slopes were more susceptible to HLC, but that mean annual temperature was by far the most important predictor of HLC; overall livestock density and proximity to roads were also important, but secondarily so. Although we found the increase in human fatalities to 2.16/year was significant (p<0.05), overall human injuries were down slightly, though not significantly (5.16/year; p>0.05). However, we also found an increasing trend in livestock depredation rates for this same five-year period (p<0.05), which averaged 159.6 head/year among incidents reported. We also found that winter was the main season when depredations occurred, and that goats were the most depredated of all livestock. A total US $86,892.25 ($17,378.45/year) of economic losses were incurred by communities during this time, with 78.57% of the total value reimbursed as compensatory relief through the government's relief fund. We recommend that the use of predator-proof livestock corrals, greater awareness in local communities about wildlife behavior, better animal husbandry and security practices, and a more efficient compensation program, can improve coexistence between leopard populations and human communities in western Nepal.

The coefficient of distance value between sexes (D-sex) and multi-variate similarity of percentages analysis (SIMPER) revealed universal existence of sex difference in FA composition, particularly in gonad, intestine and liver. Nonetheless, this sex difference was highly dependent on fish species. In general, DHA, 18:1n-9, 16:1n-7, 16:0 and EPA appeared to be the TOP FAs differentially abundant between sexes.

AB  - As the main components of the outermost membrane during embryonic development, trophoblast cells play an important role in embryo implantation and placenta formation. However, the molecular mechanism of trophoblast cell proliferation, invasion and hormone secretion remains elusive. In this study, we explored the role of GRP78 in the functionalities of goat trophoblast cells (GTCs). The Grp78 gene was efficiently knockout by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which resulted in altered morphology and function of GTCs. The cell shape showed a subrounded configuration, and the cell size also significantly increased. Furthermore, Grp78 knockout significantly decreased proliferation and adhesion activity, while increasing invasion activity. The secretion of estradiol and progesterone was also dramatically decreased after Grp78 knockout. Our results strongly suggest that GRP78 plays an important role in maintaining the normal functionalities of GTCs.

AB  - As part of a widespread ecological study on the ectoparasites of bats in Western Mexico, we report new information on the specificity, and distribution of bat flies in a geographical transition zone between the neartic and neotropical zones. Fifteen (15) species of bats representing three families (Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae) were collected in 10 locations throughout western Mexico. A total of 276 bat flies, representing 6 genera and 25 species, were identified four species of the bat flies are new records for the region indicating an expansion of the distribution for Trichobius corynorhini (Cockerll, 1910), T. hoffmannae (Guerrero & MoralesMalacara, 1996), T. intermedius (Peterson & Hurka, 1974) and Nycterophilia natali (Wenzel, 1966). These records update the species richness of streblids to 40 species in the state of Jalisco, representing 65.6% of the total number of 61 species of streblids recorded in Mexico. The interaction network showed a high degree of specialization of the bat flies towards their hosts (H2' = 0.92). Similarly, the specificity indices showed that there is a high ecological specificity (SI) with an average of 92%, of all the bat flies was associated with their primary hosts, while the average value of specificity of the phylogenetic trees (STD) of the six streblid species that presented more than one host was 1.7%, indicating a high specificity. The results of this study provide relevant information on bat-parasite associations and highlight the need for further research to obtain information on the geographic distribution of streblids and their hosts.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important factors that lead to a decline in sperm quality during semen preservation. Excessive ROS accumulation disrupts the balance of the antioxidant system in sperm and causes lipid oxidative damage, destroying its structure and function. Curcumin is a natural plant extract that neutralizes ROS and enhances the function of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The effect of curcumin on the preservation of sheep semen has not been reported. This study aims to determine the effects of curcumin on refrigerated sperm (4 degree celsius) and analyze the effects of curcumin on sperm metabolism from a Chinese native sheep (Hu sheep). The results showed that adding curcumin significantly improved (p < 0.05) the viability of refrigerated sperm at an optimal concentration of 20 mu mol/L, and the plasma membrane and acrosome integrity in semen were significantly improved (p < 0.05). Adding curcumin to refrigerated semen significantly increased (p < 0.05) the levels of antioxidant enzymes (T-AOC, CAT, and SOD) and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) ROS production. A total of 13,796 metabolites in sperm and 20,581 metabolites in negative groups and curcumin-supplemented groups were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proportion of lipids and lipid-like molecules among all metabolites in the sperm was the highest, regardless of treatment. We identified 50 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in sperm between the negative control and curcumin-treated groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that DEMs were mainly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, phospholipase D signaling pathway, sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways. The findings indicate that the addition of an appropriate concentration (20 mu m/L) of curcumin to sheep semen can effectively suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and extend the duration of cryopreservation (4 degree celsius) by modulating the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, phytosphingosine, and other metabolites of semen. This discovery offers a novel approach to enhancing the cryogenic preservation of sheep semen.

AB  - Plants are attacked by multiple herbivores, and depend on a precise regulation of responses to cope with a wide range of antagonists. Simultaneous herbivory can occur in different plant compartments, which may pose a serious threat to plant growth and reproduction. In particular, plants often face co-occurring root and floral herbivory, but few studies have focused on such interactions. Here, we investigated in the field the combined density-dependent effects of root-chewing cebrionid beetle larvae and flower-chewing pierid caterpillars on the fitness and defense of a semiarid Brassicaceae herb. We found that the fitness impact of both herbivore groups was independent and density-dependent. Increasing root herbivore density non-significantly reduced plant fitness, while the relationship between increasing floral herbivore density and the reduction they caused in both seed number and seedling emergence was non-linear. The plant defensive response was non-additive with regard to the different densities of root and floral herbivores; high floral herbivore density provoked compensatory investment in reproduction, and this tolerance response was combined with aboveground chemical defense induction when also root herbivore density was high. Plants may thus prioritize specific trait combinations in response to varying combined below- and aboveground herbivore densities to minimize negative impacts on fitness.

AB  - Tea is one of the world's oldest crops and is cultivated to produce beverages with various flavours. Despite advances in sequencing technologies, the genetic mechanisms underlying key agronomic traits of tea remain unclear. In this study, we present a high-quality pangenome of 22 elite cultivars, representing broad genetic diversity in the species. Our analysis reveals that a recent long terminal repeat burst contributed nearly 20% of gene copies, introducing functional genetic variants that affect phenotypes such as leaf colour. Our graphical pangenome improves the efficiency of genome-wide association studies and allows the identification of key genes controlling bud flush timing. We also identified strong correlations between allelic variants and flavour-related chemistries. These findings deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of tea quality and provide valuable genomic resources to facilitate its genomics-assisted breeding.

AB  - Predator-prey theory often assumes that potential prey individuals are solitary and evenly distributed in space. This assumption is violated in social, mobile prey, such as many ungulates. Here we use data from 80 monthly field censuses to estimate the parameters for a power relationship between herd density and population density for eight species of large herbivores commonly found in the diet of Serengeti lions, confirming a power relationship proposed from a preliminary Serengeti dataset. Here we extend our analysis of that model to demonstrate how parameters of the power function relate to average herd size and density-dependent changes in herd size and evaluate how interspecific variation in these parameters shapes the group-dependent functional response by Serengeti lions for eight prey species. We apply the different prey-specific functional response models in a Rosenzweig-MacArthur framework to compare their impact on the stability of predator-prey dynamics. Model outcomes suggest that group formation plays a strong role in stabilizing lion-herbivore interactions in Serengeti by forcing lions to search over a larger area before each prey encounter. As a consequence of grouping by their prey, our model also suggests that Serengeti lions are forced to broaden their diets to include multiple species of prey in order to persist, potentially explaining the generalist foraging by lions routinely recorded across multiple ecosystems.

AB  - Accurate and rapid fixation of key parts of sika deer is essential for the mechanized and intelligent collection of both deer blood and velvet antler. To solve the low detection accuracy problem of key parts of deer caused by the diversity of deer farm breeding environment and the rapid movement of deer, this paper proposes an ADYOLOv5 algorithm for detecting key parts of sika deer based on YOLOv5s. Specifically, a new weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network S-BiFPN is first proposed, which both simplifies the structure and effectively performs skip feature fusion to better capture object information at different scales, so that the adaptive feature fusion capability of the model is optimized. Second, this paper proposes to add a SENet module after the C3 module of the 9th Layer in the backbone part of the network, so that the network can adaptively readjust the channel weights of feature maps to enhance the important features for key parts of sika deer and improve the expression ability of the model for key parts. Furthermore, to make the model more stable in the training process, a novel bounding box regression loss function SIoU is led into, which can better learn the position and size of the bounding box by fusing the orientation information between the ground truth box and the predicted box. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through ablation experiments. Experimental results show that the mAP@0.5 of the proposed algorithm reaches 97.30 % for the detection of key parts of sika deer, which is 12.85 %, 9.65 %, 9.18 %, 7.13 %, 3.59 %, 4.6 %, 0.90 % and 0.10 % higher than SSD, EfficientDet, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8s, respectively. This research provides a new idea for detecting key parts of animals in complex environments and lays a theoretical foundation for the development of intelligent fixation devices for sika deer.

AB  - Uncertainty remains over composting time and maturity degree for compost production. The objectives of this study were to establish maturity indicators for composting based on spectral and chemical components and to provide a reference for future composting management. Several indicators of composting were assessed for three commercial composts at 0, 7, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days during the germination of Chinese cabbage, including (1) central temperature, (2) moisture content, (3) pH, (4) electrical conductivity, (5) C/N ratio, (6) E4/E6 ratio, (7) fluorescence humification index (HIX), and (8) germination index (GI). We evaluated the optimal composting time using these indicators, reflecting the changes in hog manure, chicken manure, and agricultural by-product composts throughout their composting process to provide a basis for maturity time. The results showed that the E4/E6 ratio, C/N ratio, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and germination rate, which reached a stable status after 30 days of composting, could be the indicators of "early-stage" maturity. In contrast, central temperature, electrical conductivity, HIX, and GI reached stable values after 45 days of composting and thus could be more suitable indicators of full maturity. Based on our results, we recommend a minimum composting time of 30 days to achieve primary maturity, while fully matured compost may be obtained after 45 days.

AB  - Animal weapons are diverse and often exaggerated structures associated with sexual selection and male-male combat. Despite their diversity, our knowledge of these structures comes primarily from studies that focus on the size of the weapons and neglect other components, such as their shape or performance. Furthermore, weapons can exhibit species-level plasticity based on nutrition and other ecological variables, but few studies have documented seasonal variation in weapon plasticity. Here, we investigate how weapon size, shape and performance differ across adult male reproductive and non-reproductive Allegheny crayfish, Faxonius obscurus. Given that F. obscurus and other cambarid crayfishes exhibit cyclical moulting between reproductive and non-reproductive states, they provide an ideal system in which to investigate such questions. We found that claws of reproductive and non-reproductive male F. obscurus differ in all three weapon components we investigated; claws from reproductive males were longer, stronger and different in shape compared with claws from non-reproductive males. Wielding longer and stronger claws is likely to confer greater competitive success during the mating season, which demonstrates an unexplored pattern of seasonal weapon plasticity. We discuss these results considering our knowledge of the seasonality of weapon phenotypes and propose several avenues of future research using cambarid crayfish as a model system.

AB  - Green spaces in synanthropic environments are known to provide suitable habitats for wildlife species; however, these green spaces also influence the dynamics of bat populations, especially due to their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation, which has conservation and ecological implications. Currently, there is still limited information on bats' habitat associations in green spaces, hindering our understanding of their ecological requirements. This study aimed to determine the habitat association and local range distribution of bat species in the green spaces of Davao City, the largest city by land area in the southern Philippines, employing conventional mist-netting techniques. We recorded a total of 3,674 bat individuals, representing 17 species belonging to six families, of which five are Philippine endemics. We examined three habitat types of green spaces (i.e., synanthropic, forest, and subterranean). Synanthropic habitats harbored most bat individuals, which constituted 52% of bats observed, followed by forests (40%), and subterranean (8%). Some bat species showed strong habitat affinity: Rousettus amplexicaudatus in synanthropic habitats, Cynopterus brachyotis in forests, and Rhinolophus arcuatus in subterranean habitats, especially caves. Similarities in species composition were observed between synanthropic and forest habitats, whereas subterranean species displayed specialized niche dependence. The results of this study further revealed that bat species prefer to utilize their natural habitats but are more abundant in human-altered landscapes or synanthropic habitats. Prioritizing the protection of bats' remaining natural habitats in urban green spaces is thus highly recommended.

AB  - The analyses of the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and oxygen (delta O-18) in animal tissues are powerful tools for reconstructing the feeding behavior of individual animals and characterizing trophic interactions in food webs. Of these biomaterials, tooth enamel is the hardest, most mineralized vertebrate tissue and therefore least likely to be affected by chemical alteration (i.e., its isotopic composition can be preserved over millions of years), making it an important and widely available archive for biologists and paleontologists. Here, we present the first combined measurements of delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta O-18 in enamel from the teeth of modern fauna (herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores) from the well-studied ecosystem of Gorongosa National Park (GNP) in central Mozambique. We use two novel methods to produce high-precision stable isotope enamel data: (i) the "oxidation-denitrification method," which permits the measurement of mineral-bound organic nitrogen in tooth enamel (delta N-15(enamel)), which until now, has not been possible due to enamel's low organic content, and (ii) the "cold trap method," which greatly reduces the sample size required for traditional measurements of inorganic delta C-13(enamel) and delta O-18(enamel) (from >= 0.5 to <= 0.1 mg), permitting analysis of small or valuable teeth and high-resolution serial sampling of enamel. The stable isotope results for GNP fauna reveal important ecological information about the trophic level, dietary niche, and resource consumption. delta N-15(enamel) values clearly differentiate trophic level (i.e., carnivore delta N-15(enamel) values are 4.0 parts per thousand higher, on average, than herbivores), delta C-13(enamel) values distinguish C-3 and/or C-4 biomass consumption, and delta O-18(enamel) values reflect local meteoric water (delta O-18(water)) in the park. Analysis of combined carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen stable isotope data permits geochemical separation of grazers, browsers, omnivores, and carnivores according to their isotopic niche, while mixed-feeding herbivores cannot be clearly distinguished from other dietary groups. These results confirm that combined C, N, and O isotope analyses of a single aliquot of tooth enamel can be used to reconstruct diet and trophic niches. Given its resistance to chemical alteration, the analysis of these three isotopes in tooth enamel has a high potential to open new avenues of research in (paleo)ecology and paleontology.

AB  - Decoupling of crop and livestock production has become increasingly common in the world during to past de-cades. The cooperation between specialized crop and livestock farms have been paid more attention for the development of sustainable agriculture. This study assumed that rebuilding the linkage between specialized crop and livestock farms through cooperation at the local level would decrease agricultural GHG emissions. Therefore, we designed a cooperative crop-livestock farming model (CCLS) in South China by recoupling the cow farm with the sweet maize cultivation farms around it to demonstrate the hypothesis based on carbon footprint (CF) method. The CFs under two cooperative scenarios (CCLS20 and CCLS50) were compared with the corresponding decoupling models (DCLS20 and DCLS50). Results showed that CCLS significantly reduced GHG emissions from cropping systems in comparison to DCLS primarily by increasing the soil organic carbon storage while decreasing accumulative N2O emissions. In specific, the CFs of CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 48.78% and 623.34% lower than DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively. The yield-based CFs of CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 66.30% and 165.99% lower than DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively. Meanwhile, the CF of the cow farm in CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 8.80% and 8.22% lower than that in DCLS20/50 by lowering relative GHG emissions of straw supply in roughage forage and shortening manure storage time in the manure management process. Finally, the yield-based CF in CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 67.68% and 168.51% lower than the DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively, demonstrating that the cooperation between specialized planting and livestock farms at local level reduced the CF of the agricultural production chain by the synergistic reduction effects of GHG emissions in cropland, livestock rearing and transportation processes. The results would provide a quantitative understanding of the net GHG emission of cooperative crop-livestock system at the local level in China and valuable information for the development of sustainable farming system in the world.

AB  - Here, we document the immediate aftermath of a lion predation event on a juvenile elephant in a private concession near the southeastern border of the Moremi Game Reserve (Okavango delta, Botswana). The carcass was monitored over a four-week period to assess patterns of defleshing and scavenger activity. Lions were the primary consumers, rapidly defleshing most anatomical regions within the first week, with minimal evidence of early hyena involvement. Hyenas appeared later but had little impact on the bone assemblage, likely due to food abundance in the ecosystem. Remarkably, soft tissue structures like podal pads remained intact after a month. These observations have implications for paleoanthropology, suggesting that bulk meat from megafaunal carcasses would only have been accessible to early hominins under confrontational scavenging scenarios. Additionally, the data provide ecological insight into carnivore competition and resource use in high-biomass landscapes.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of a short glutamate supply on the ovarian response in goats with low body condition scores. Twenty-one goats had their estrus and follicular waves synchronized using three injections of prostaglandin analog at seven-day intervals. Goats were allocated to groups receiving 10 mg/kg LW (iv) of glutamate administered in a single dose (group LBCG1, n = 7) or in two doses five days apart (group LBCG2, n = 7). The control group (LBC; n = 7) received saline solution. Glutamate treatment did not affect glucose, cholesterol, or glutathione peroxidase levels, body weight, or adipose deposits. During the experimental period, the LBCG2 group showed a higher (P < 0.05) number of follicles (> 3 mm) and an increase in follicle diameter (P < 0.05). Glutamate supply improved (P < 0.05) the intraovarian Doppler blood area size in the LBCG groups, and the second dose in LBCG2 also induced a higher (P < 0.05) systolic and diastolic peak of the ovary artery. After ovulation induction, LBCG2 exhibited a high (P < 0.05) volume of the corpus luteum and vascularized area. We concluded that the supply of two doses of glutamate five days apart was efficient in ovarian stimulation in goats with a low body condition.

AB  - Recent genomic study on Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides throughout the Northwest Atlantic revealed genetic differentiation between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the remainder of the Northwest Atlantic. Knowledge of migration and thus connectivity among fish populations is key to understanding the stock dynamics of commercial species and establishing effective management strategies. In this study, we use otolith microchemistry to assess the population structure and define more clearly the potential connectivity of Greenland halibut among Saguenay Fjord, the Estuary, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) and outside this system. Otolith margins and cores were analyzed to determine the elemental fingerprints. The margin elemental fingerprints (Mg, Sr, and Ba) were used to infer spatial differentiation, and quadratic discriminant analysis resulted in an overall reclassification success of fish to their capture site of 59%. The core elemental fingerprints indicated three chemically distinct juvenile sources, suggesting high connectivity in the EGSL supporting the St. Lawrence Estuary as a main nursery. Our results also suggest that one of these three sources has a smaller contribution relative to the other sites.

AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a severe pathogen that has resulted in enormous eco-nomic losses in the global tilapia sector. GBS can be effectively controlled by antibiotics to some extent, but antibiotic resistance limits the application of antibiotics. It is urgent to find eco-friendly novel strategies against GBS. As the smallest antibody, nanobodies (Nbs) are novel effective biologics for treating bacterial and viral infections, as they can identify conserved epitopes of hypervariable pathogens. In the study, GBS-specific Nbs were screened from a naive phage-displayed Nb library, and the anti-GBS activity of Nbs was explored in vivo. The results showed that high-affinity Nbs were obtained from a naive phage-displayed Nb library after three rounds of biopanning. A novel nanobody Nb01 was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system and pu-rified using the Ni-NTA Agarose column. The results of indirect ELISA showed that purified recombinant protein Nb01 still had a high affinity against GBS. Furthermore, we found that Nb01 could effectively inhibit GBS infection in vivo. The copy numbers of GBS in the zebrafish brains were significantly reduced after treatment with Nb01. The survival rate of GBS-infected zebrafish treated with Nb01 was 70.0%, while it was only 43.3% for the controls. The expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes (tnf-alpha, il-6 and inf-gamma) and Wnt-signaling related genes (wnt2, wnt3a and fzd5) in the GBS-infected zebrafish brain were significantly decreased after treatment with Nb01. In conclusion, Nb01 could protect zebrafish from GBS infection, and these results highlighted the potential therapeutic activity of Nbs against GBS in fish.

AB  - Ant guards can increase plant fitness by deterring herbivores, but they may also reduce it by interfering with pollination. While ant impacts on herbivory have been well-studied, much less is known about their impacts on pollinators and associated consequences for plant pollination, particularly pollen transfer dynamics and outcrossing/selfing rates. We used field experiments to quantify the effect of ant guards on pollinator community composition, frequency and duration of flower visits, and cascading effects on outcrossing pollen transfer and pollen exports in Turnera velutina (Passifloraceae). Although ant patrolling did not affect pollinator community composition or visitation frequency, it decreased flower visit duration and the time pollinators spent foraging inside flowers. Such behavioural changes resulted in reduced pollen deposition on stigmas, decreased pollen exports (a proxy for male fitness) and significantly doubled outcross pollen transfer. This study contributes to our understanding of how non-pollinator mutualists can shape plant reproductive processes. We discuss the downstream effects that variation in biotic defences, such as rewards for guarding ants, can have on plant pollen transfer patterns and fitness. In conclusion, guarding ants influence pollen transfer patterns in Turnera velutina, increasing outcrossing in a self-compatible species at the cost of male fitness. We show how non-pollinators, such as defensive ant mutualists, can shape plant reproductive traits and discuss the consequences these interactions may have for plant mating systems.

AB  - Many organisms, especially animals and land plants, are known to use structural colouration, i.e. colour produced by an object's microstructure rather than by pigments, for communicative functions such as mating, camouflage and aposematic (warning off predators) purposes combined with toxic or distasteful substances. Some macroalgae show structural colours, typically produced by three mechanisms: (1) multilayered structure of the thallus surface, (2) arrays of microfibrils or (3) iridescent/refractile bodies within the cell. Suggested functions include the optimization of photosynthesis by reducing stresses of strong ambient light, especially in species that grow in the intertidal zone, although some subtidal species also show structural colour. Regarding other possible functions of structural colour, some macroalgae accumulate toxic materials such as secondary metabolites and highly acidic substances as defensive systems against herbivorous animals, yet few studies have linked herbivore defence with structural colouration as a possible communicative function. Here we report that refractile bodies in the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis, which contain anti-herbivory substances such as bromides, also have optical effects causing a whitish appearance of the thallus. This masks the more typical reddish colour of the species, thereby functioning as camouflage from herbivorous animals that seek food by visual cues. Furthermore, the opal-like structure of the refractile bodies creates bluish structural colour in the meristematic region and so may provide aposematic functions. Similarly, in the brown alga Sporochnus dotyi, the iridescent bodies within cells of the assimilatory filaments create greenish structural colour. These refractile bodies incorporate some unknown highly reactive substances that apparently have anti-herbivory functions. Therefore, the iridescent bodies of S. dotyi may also have an aposematic function. Other tropical to warm temperate macroalgae, such as Martensia, Callophyllis and Dictyopteris, have structural colour that we consider to have communicative functions such as camouflage and aposematism. Based on these observations, we consider that structural colouration is probably widely used for communicative functions in macroalgae, as in animals and land plants.

AB  - With the development of technology and science, automated farming methods have gradually begun to replace traditional manual feeding methods, offering advantages such as precise feeding and reduced labor costs. However, there is still a lack of extensive research on the effects of different feeding methods on the reproductive performance of pigs and the diversity of their intestinal microbiota. This study analyzed the reproductive performance of Yorkshire pigs fed the same diet under different feeding methods, and further explored the diversity of their intestinal microbiota, aiming to elucidate the interactions between feeding methods, intestinal microbiota, and reproductive phenotypes, in order to understand the impact of the interaction between feeding methods and intestinal microbiota on host reproductive performance. This study aims to provide a certain theoretical and experimental basis for the promotion of automated feeding modes. The feeding mode is an important factor affecting the reproductive performance of pigs. The composition and expression of the intestinal microbiota are closely related to the physiological and biochemical indicators of animals. Therefore, to explore the impact of different feeding patterns on the reproductive performance of pigs, this study collected reproductive performance data from 1607 Yorkshire pigs raised under different feeding patterns and conducted a fixed-effect variance analysis. Among them, 731 were in the artificial feeding (AM) group and 876 were in the feeding station feeding (SM) group. Additionally, 40 Yorkshire sows in the late gestation period were randomly selected from each feeding mode for intestinal microbiota analysis. The results of the analysis showed that, in the AM group, both the number of birth deformities (NBD) and the number of stillbirths (NSB) were significantly greater than they were in the SM group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the total number born (TNB) in the AM group was significantly lower than that in the SM group (p < 0.05). The results of the intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that at the phylum level, there were significant differences in nine bacterial taxa between the AM and SM groups (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of a variety of beneficial bacteria related to reproductive performance in the SM group was significantly greater than that in the AM group. Finally, fecal metabolomic analysis revealed that the contents of butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, and isobutyric acid, which are associated with reproductive performance, in the feces of sows in the SM group were significantly higher than those in the AM group (p < 0.05). These results indicate that different feeding methods can affect the gut microbiota composition of Yorkshire pigs and further influence the reproductive performance of pigs through the gut microbiota-metabolic product pathway. The results of this study provide valuable insights for further exploring the relationships between feeding modes, intestinal microbial composition, and host phenotypes.

AB  - Oogenesis involves two phases: initial volumetric growth driven by nutrient accumulation and subsequent nuclear maturation. While melatonin (MLT) has been employed as a supplement to enhance the quality of fully grown oocytes during nuclear maturation phase, its impact on oocyte growth remains poorly studied. Here, we provide in vivo evidence demonstrating that follicle-stimulating hormone increases MLT content in ovary. Administration of MLT improves oocyte growth and quality in mice and goats by enhancing nutrient reserves and mitochondrial function. Conversely, MLT-deficient mice have smaller oocytes and dysfunctional mitochondria. Exploring the clinical implications of MLT in promoting oocyte growth, we observe that a brief 2-day MLT treatment enhances oocyte quality and reproductive performance in older mice. These findings highlight the role of MLT in regulating oocyte growth and provide a specific treatment window for optimizing oocyte quality and reproductive performance in female animals.
   This study investigates the elevation of melatonin (MLT) levels in the ovary by follicle-stimulating hormone and its involvement in boosting oocyte growth by facilitating nutrient accumulation and improving mitochondrial function.image

AB  - The current study was performed under controlled conditions to study the effects of exogenous potassium application on carotenoid contents and drought tolerance in Camelina. Water deficit levels such as 100% FC (control) and 40% FC (drought stress) were imposed after germination of Camelina plants grown to maturity, and different treatments of exogenous K+ were applied at the vegetative stage. We have reported 17 traits of plant growth, physiology, antioxidant enzyme activity, focusing on carotenoids in Camelina to explore their potential yield and yield components. For this purpose, we used multivariate analysis techniques (descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, analysis of variance [ANOVA] and principal components analysis [PCA] to determine the best relation between potassium and studied traits). The results showed a large number of variations in the studied trait under control and water deficit condition. Plant fresh weight (g) was negatively correlated with shoot length and SOD insignificantly correlated with plant fresh weight (g) under water deficit conditions. Potassium loading predicted that foliar application (3 mM K2SO4), foliar application (6 mM KNO3), foliar application (12 mM KNO3) and foliar application (12 mM K2SO4) are the important doses that contribute the most to enhance the growth, physiological and biochemical activities and carotenoids to improve the Camelina yield under water deficit condition. These doses should be considered in the future to improve the Camelina yield under semi-arid conditions with increased genetic diversity (varietal selection).

AB  - The invasive pest Cameraria ohridella annually colonizes trees of the genus Aesculus across Europe, causing dark brown damage called mines that gradually cover the leaf surface. This study aimed to compare the VOC profiles emitted by chestnut tree leaves with varying susceptibility to the pest and assess whether these profiles change due to larval feeding. The research involved a susceptible tree (Ae. turbinata) and resistant trees (Ae. glabra and Ae. parviflora). Over three growing seasons (2014, 2015, 2016), leaf damage and the profile of VOCs were analyzed biweekly from May to September. Leaf damage increased progressively in Ae. turbinata during all seasons. The VOC profiles differed both qualitatively and quantitatively among the trees and across years. More VOCs were identified in 2014 and 2015 than in 2016. The susceptible Ae. turbinata exhibited the highest VOC diversity in 2014, aligning with severe leaf damage-profiles of VOCs in Ae. turbinata were different from resistant trees. Statistical analysis revealed that in 2014 and 2015, differences in the profile of VOCs between susceptible and resistant trees were apparent near pest-feeding dates. In 2016, VOCs significantly distinguished the profile of susceptible trees that were present before the appearance of the first generation of the pest.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plant is fluoride (F) hyperaccumulator. The decomposition of pruned litter in tea plantations releases a large amount of F back into the soil. However, the effect of pruned litter return on soil F bioavailability has remained unclear. We investigated the decomposition dynamics of pruned litter from four tea varieties (Chuannong Huangyazao, Chuancha No. 3, Chuanmu No. 217 and C. sinensis 'Fuding Dabaicha') and its effect on soil F bioavailability. The decomposition of pruned litter occurred in two distinct periods, with an early period of rapid decomposition during the first 120 days, releasing 26-33 % of F, followed by a late period of slow decomposition during 120-360 days, releasing 2-9 % of F. The decomposition of pruned litter enhanced soil F bioavailability by increasing the concentrations of soil water-soluble F (WS-F), exchangeable F (EX-F), and organic matter-bound F (OR-F). The increase in WS-F, EX-F, and OR-F concentrations was higher than the amount of F released from pruned litter, suggesting that the increases in soil F availability did not solely originate from the release of F from pruned litter. The findings reveal the pathway of pruned litter decomposition priming soil F bioavailability through both the direct release of F and transformation from other fractions. Furthermore, the traits (C, N, lignin, and cellulose) of pruned litter from different tea varieties were the dominant factors controlling F release and soil F bioavailability. Compared with other tea varieties, the pruned litter of Chuanmu No. 217 with low lignin and cellulose content promoted higher mass loss and F release, resulting in the highest soil F bioavailability. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of bioavailable F in soil. These insights offer valuable support for devising effective management strategies for the incorporation of pruned litter into soil.

AB  - Estrus detection in buffaloes primarily relies on behavioral and physiological signs. Especially during summer, these signs are less prominent to recognize. Thus, estrus detection is a pronounced challenge within the realm of buffalo husbandry, particularly in the summer. Therefore, a simple and accurate estrus detection method is required for buffalo farmers. The observation of fern-like salivary crystallization patterns is one such simple method to detect estrus in buffaloes, bactrian camels, beagle bitches, and cows. However, the exact mechanism for the formation of typical fern-like is not known. We hypothesized that it might be because of the estrus-specific mucins and salts. To test this hypothesis, we prepared the smears by combining different concentrations of mucin type -2 (MUC2) and -3 (MUC3) with sodium chloride (NaCl). Microscopic examination confirmed that fern-like patterns resulted from a combination of the MUC3 and NaCl produced more realistic fern patterns than that of MUC2 or BSA with salt. To predict possible mucin and salt concentration showing natural fern-like patterns at the estrus stage in buffalo saliva, we constructed a guide tree of artificially generated fern-like patterns using an image analysis online tool. This computation analysis revealed that most of the natural buffalo estrus saliva samples showing typical fern-like patterns clustered in the cluster 2 of the guide tree comprising of 13 clusters. In the cluster 2, MUC3 in combination with the salt concentrations of 100, 150, and 250 mM was commonly found in a close proximity to the natural typical fern-like patterns of saliva smear of buffaloes at estrus. Conclusively, the buffalo saliva at estrus is predicted to have a gel-forming heavily glycosylated protein such as mucin along with at least 100 mM of NaCl.Research Highlights Glycoprotein and salts combination replicates fern-like pattern of buffalo saliva at estrus. MUC3 and NaCl salt combination produces more realistic fern-like patterns compared with MUC2 or BSA and salt combination. MUC3 with NaCl at 100, 150, and 250 mM consistently resembled natural estrus saliva fern-like patterns. During estrus, buffalo saliva is expected to contain heavily glycosylated mucin and at least of 100 mM NaCl.

AB  - PADs are a group of calcium-dependent enzymes that play key roles in inflammatory pathologies and have diverse roles in cancers. PADs cause irreversible post-translational modification of arginine to citrulline, leading to changes in protein function in different cellular compartments. PAD isozyme diversity differs throughout phylogeny in chordates, with five PAD isozymes in mammals, three in birds, and one in fish. While the roles for PADs in various human cancers are mounting (both in regards to cancer progression and epigenetic regulation), investigations into animal cancers are scarce. The current pilot-study therefore aimed at assessing PAD isozymes in a range of animal cancers across the phylogeny tree. In addition, the tissue samples were assessed for total protein deimination and histone H3 deimination (CitH3), which is strongly associated with human cancers and also indicative of gene regulatory changes and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis). Cancers were selected from a range of vertebrate species: horse, cow, reindeer, sheep, pig, dog, cat, rabbit, mink, hamster, parrot, and duck. The cancers chosen included lymphoma, kidney, lung, testicular, neuroendocrine, anaplastic, papilloma, and granulosa cell tumour. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CitH3 was strongly detected in all of the cancers assessed, while pan-deimination detection was overall low. Both PAD2 and PAD3 were the most predominantly expressed PADs across all of the cancers assessed, while PAD1, PAD4, and PAD6 were overall expressed at lower, albeit varying, levels. The findings from this pilot study provide novel insights into PAD-mediated roles in different cancers across a range of vertebrate species and may aid in the understanding of cancer heterogeneity and cancer evolution.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of insect herbivory is important for understanding the complex and diverse plant-insect associations in terrestrial ecosystems during the mid Mesozoic. We examined 2503 plant specimens from the Mid-Jurassic (Callovian, 165 Ma) Jiulongshan Formation, a gymnosperm-dominant, fern subdominant plant assemblage at Daohugou, northeastern China, where 149 species/morphotypes from 11 plant groups were identified. Based on the functional feeding group-damage type (FFG-DT) system, we detected a richness of 11 FFGs and 78 DTs, frequency of 2329 DTs, 8045 feeding event occurrences, and herbivory index of 3.27 %. Major consumption occurred on broad-leaved of bennettitaleans, accounting for half of all herbivory indicated by multiple indices, and ginkgoaleans, less so for narrow-leaved of conifers. The top-four feeding groups were margin feeding, piercing and sucking, oviposition, and galling; all groups displayed a pattern of narrow DT functional-breadth (22.22 %) and twofold increase of broad DT functional-breadth (48.15 %). Physical plant defenses were found on the most herbivorized plant host implying trade-offs between host physiology and insect herbivory. Compared with other gymnosperm-dominated assemblages, the elevated richness and intensity of Daohugou herbivory indicates a new regime of resource consumption that occurred by late Middle Jurassic time associated with predator and especially parasitoid diversification.

AB  - Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is a valuable mariculture fish that shows female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD), yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this study, the growth differences between females and males were compared, and comparative transcriptome analyses of brains/pituitaries, livers, muscles, and gonads from 13-month-old females and males were performed. The critical time window for SSD was from 13- to 14-month-old, with females reaching significantly larger sizes than males. Muscle cell size and plasma growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2 (IGF1, IGF2), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels had no significant differences between the sexes of 13and 14-month-old flounders. Furthermore, the RNA-seq data revealed differential expression in the genes encoding the receptors for these hormones, suggesting that regulation may occur at the receptor level, potentially leading to SSD during the critical window. RNA-seq analysis identified 88, 645, 414, and 15,833 differentially expressed genes between females and males in brains/pituitaries, livers, muscles, and gonads, respectively. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GSEA-based KEGG analyses revealed that some pathways associated with growth and development, including "prolactin signaling pathway" in brains/pituitaries, "cell cycle", "oocyte meiosis", and "DNA replication" in livers, "focal adhesion", "ECM-receptor interaction", "protein digestion and absorption", "arginine and proline metabolism", and "cysteine and methionine metabolism" in muscles, and "Hippo signaling pathway" and "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" in gonads may be involved in the establishment of sexual growth differences. Notably, females had lower steroid hormone synthesis abilities than males in brains/pituitaries, livers, and gonads, indicating the importance of sex steroid hormones in the establishment of SSD. Moreover, genes including frizzled3 (fzd3) and prolactin (prl) in brains/pituitaries, and growth hormone receptor (ghr), estrogen receptor (esr1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (igfbp3), bone morphogenetic protein 8A-like (bmp8a), leptin receptor (lepr), and lipoprotein lipase-like (lpl) in livers emerge as potential candidates for the establishment of SSD. In conclusion, this study may help clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in SSD-related growth traits in flounder and provide basic data for genetic breeding of flounder.

AB  - Gilthead sea bream (GSB) (Sparus aurata) have been generally considered to be resistant to viral encephalo-retinopathy. However, the recent increase of the number of outbreaks in sea bream hatcheries caused by ner -vous necrosis virus (NNV) called RGNNV/SJNNV, a reassortant virus, has encouraged researchers to investigate the disease pathogenesis in this species, with particular emphasis on fish age. For this purpose, experimental challenges of juveniles and larvae were carried out.
   Four experimental trials were performed by infecting GSB of different ages with the RGNNV/SJNNV virus: juveniles of 7 g of weight and larvae of 70, 35 and 21 days post hatch (dph).
   Virological, histological and immunohistochemical analysis, as well as qualitative and quantitative real time PCR at different time points post infection (pi) were performed. ELISA test for antibody detection was also implemented, where applicable.
   Overall results showed that the gilthead seabream larvae are susceptible to RGNNV/SJNNV infection irre-spective to the age, as proved by the massive viral replication detected by quantitative RT-PCR and the massive presence of immunoprecipitates in the nervous tissues evidenced by immunohistochemistry. However, clear clinical signs and mortality were observed only in the youngest group of 21-dph larvae. The viral kinetics in-vestigations led to think that the efficiency of RGNNV/SJNNV replication was higher in 21dph larvae compared to the older ones, which in turn correlated with the disease outcome. Most likely the latter was related to the developmental stage of the immune system. Noteworthy survivors were always tested negative for the presence of specific antibodies. The identification of the factors governing the host ability to control viral replication, or conversely those inhibiting the virus in older fish will be crucial to better understand the disease pathogenesis in this species. Notably, despite the age and the disease outcome of the infection, GSB remained persistently infected for a long time, even up to one year, becoming asymptomatic carriers.

AB  - In this study, we explore the effects of Poria cocos mushroom polysaccharides (PCPs) on the quality and DNA methylation of the cryopreserved spermatozoa of Shanghai white pigs. A total of 24 ejaculates (three ejaculate samples per boar) from eight Shanghai white pigs were manually collected. The pooled semen was diluted with a based extender supplemented with different concentrations of PCPs (0, 300, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 mu g/mL). Once thawed, the quality of the spermatozoa and their antioxidant function were assessed. In the meantime, the effect of spermatozoa DNA methylation was also analyzed. The results show that compared with the control group, 600 mu g/mL of PCPs significantly improves the spermatozoa viability (p < 0.05). The motility and plasma membrane integrity of the frozen-thawed spermatozoa are significantly higher after treatment with 600, 900, and 1200 mu g/mL of PCPs compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In comparison with the control group, the percentages of acrosome integrity and mitochondrial activity are significantly enhanced after the application of 600 and 900 mu g/mL PCPs (p < 0.05). The reactive oxygen species (ROS), the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, in comparison with the control group, are significantly decreased in all groups with PCPs (all p < 0.05). The enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in spermatozoa is significantly higher in the treatment with 600 mu g/mL of PCPs than in the other groups (p < 0.05). As compared with the control group, a significant increase in the catalase (CAT) level is found in the groups with PCPs at 300, 600, 900, and 1200 mu g/mL (all p < 0.05). In comparison with the control group, the 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) levels are significantly decreased in all groups with PCPs (all p < 0.05). As a result of these findings, a certain amount of PCPs (600-900 mu g/mL) added to the cryodiluent can significantly improve the quality of Shanghai white pig spermatozoa and can also reduce the methylation of spermatozoa DNA caused by cryopreservation. This treatment strategy may establish a foundation for the cryopreservation of semen from pigs.

AB  - Identifying interaction partners, a particularly challenging task in the absence of an explicit communication system (e.g. vocalization), is key to understanding how information is distributed and processed within animal groups. Moreover, the interaction network regulates complex collective behaviours such as collective motion and predator detection. Despite the relevance of the interaction network, only a few experiments have been designed to decipher it. Moreover, the mechanism by which an individual selects its interaction neighbours remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the interaction neighbour selection process, by studying the behavioural response of na?ve group members confronted with the controlled departure of a trained individual in herds of merino sheep, Ovis aries. By identifying the first individual that followed the trained individual, we inferred the probability of a group member choosing it as its interaction neighbour, assuming that this probability is modulated by either the relative distance, the relative distance rank or a combination of both. The underlying interaction network was constructed from this probability. The results provide unique, reliable information on the functional form of this probability, and thus on the interaction network and on how individuals interact within groups. The suggested method of working out the selection process can be easily implemented in other animal systems and contexts. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - This study was conducted to understand the long-term influence of biostimulator NeOsol in combination with different manure types on soil's physical properties and crop status. NeOsol is a soil biostimulator that should stimulate the biological reactions of the soil profile and improve the soil's physical and chemical properties. A six-year experiment was conducted with eight treatments: NPK, cattle manure, pig manure, poultry manure, and the same four treatments with the NeOsol added on top. The in situ sampling of soil properties provided data on unit draft (UD), bulk density (BD), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC). Furthermore, remotely sensed data were analyzed to describe crop status via three selected vegetation indices (VI), and crop yields were assessed last. The variants treated with NeOsol demonstrated decreases in UD over time; BD, SHC, and VI did not significantly change. The impact on yield was significant and increased over time. When comparing the variants with manure application to those without one, the cattle manure led to significantly higher SHC; the pig manure led to significantly lower UD and BD but significantly higher SHC and yield; and the poultry manure led to significantly lower UD and BD but higher yield.

AB  - Tropical pastures are one of the main land uses in Brazil, forming the backbone of the country's beef and milk production chain. Adopting sustainable management practices that increase the productivity of pastoral livestock systems is essential to mitigate environmental impacts and ensure food security. However, eddy covariance studies that contribute to understanding the influence of grazing management strategies on the ability of intensively grazed tropical pastures to absorb carbon remain scarce. Therefore, our main objective was to investigate the dynamics of CO2 and water vapor exchange and biomass production in a tropical C4 grass ( Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Cameroon) pasture under intermittent stocking management strategies from March 2021 to June 2023. We found that the pasture acted as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere in both years studied. The annual NEE was 34 +/- 14 g CO2-C m-2 yr-1 in 2021-2022 and 21 +/- 12 g CO2-C m-2 yr-1 in 2022-2023. Reco, influenced by rising air and soil temperatures, increased rainfall, and higher incoming solar radiation levels, especially during spring and summer, played a crucial role in this result. The pasture absorbed more CO2, showed higher evapotranspiration, and produced more leaves in the rainy periods when the pasture structure was kept close to the previously established management targets. CO2 losses to the atmosphere prevailed in the dry periods and in wet periods where the pasture structure was far from the optimal limits for elephant grass.

AB  - High semen quality is vital for reproductive success in the swine industry; however, seasonal fluctuations often compromise this quality. The molecular mechanism underlying these seasonal effects on semen quality remains largely unclear. This study employed untargeted metabolomic profiling of boar seminal plasma (SP) to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with semen quality during the summer and winter months. Semen samples were collected from mature Duroc boars at a commercial boar stud and classified as Passed or Failed based on motility and morphology. SP from five samples per group was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). In total, 373 metabolites were detected in positive ion mode and 478 in negative ion mode. Several differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified, including ergothioneine, indole-3-methyl acetate, and avocadyne in the summer, as well as LysoPC, dopamine, and betaine in the winter. These metabolites are associated with key sperm functions, including energy metabolism, antioxidant defense, and capacitation. KEGG pathway analysis indicated enrichment in starch and sucrose metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and amino acid metabolism across the seasons. Overall, the results reveal that SP metabolomic profiles vary with the season, thereby influencing semen quality. The identified metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing semen quality and enhancing reproductive efficiency in swine production.

AB  - The in vivo ability of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) larvae to incorporate, de-acylate and re-acylate [1-14C]fatty acids (FA) into lipid classes and to elongate and desaturate those substrates was elucidated. To this purpose, 30 days post-first-feeding (30 dpff) larvae were incubated in the presence of either free [1-14C]-FAs (18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3), [1-14C]18:1n-9 bound to mono- (MAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG), or [1-14C]20:4n-6 bound to phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Halibut larvae can efficiently incorporate dietary FAs through MAG, while FA incorporation when provided as free FAs and especially bound to TAG or phospholipids seems to be very low. These results suggest that lipid digestion might be a limiting factor in the FA absorption and incorporation by 30 dpff Atlantic halibut. The present study also shows that esterification into phospholipids is a strong metabolic fate for dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), and the capacity of 30 dpff Atlantic halibut larvae to metabolize dietary FAs through elongation/desaturation processes. Nonetheless, neither EPA nor DHA were detected from [1-14C]ALA, indicating a reduced capacity to biosynthesize these LC-PUFAs and the necessity for them to be adequately supplied through the diet for proper larval development.

AB  - Silver pomfret (Pampus argenteus) is an economically important marine fish species in the Indian and Western Pacific oceans, it has great aquaculture potential. Research on the ontogeny of the digestive system is critical in improving the larval rearing protocols and weaning process. In this study, an approach that integrates histology and biochemistry was used to illustrate the digestive system ontogeny of silver pomfret from hatching to 50 days post-hatching (dph). At 1 dph, the digestive system was differentiated into the esophageal sac, esophagus, anterior and posterior intestine, liver, pancreas, and gall bladder, and except for pepsin, digestive enzymes were detected. At 4 dph (4.0 & PLUSMN; 0.2 mm in total length, TL), the mouth opened to allow for exogenous feeding, which coincided with the development of papillae and mucous cells in the esophageal sac, indicating their preliminary function of grinding food. At 7 dph (4.5 & PLUSMN; 0.2 mm, TL), the larvae entered an exclusively exogenous feeding stage and numerous supranuclear vacuoles appeared in the posterior intestine. From 1 to 10 dph, alkaline phosphatase increased sharply, suggesting the rapid development of enterocytes and intestine. At 10 dph (4.8 & PLUSMN; 0.6 mm, TL), gastric glands appeared in the stomach, and from 14 to 20 dph (5.2 & PLUSMN; 0.3 to 6.1 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mm, TL), they multiplied greatly. At this time, the other digestive organs, including the esophageal sac, pyloric caeca, intestine, and accessory glands were well developed and tended to mature in structure. From 15 to 20 dph, the activity of pepsin, trypsin, lipase, and & alpha;-amylase rapidly increased, suggesting that the digestive system might have become functionally integrated. After reaching enzyme activity peaks, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, and & alpha;-amylase decreased significantly while pepsin and trypsin initially decreased and then increased to a second peak at 50 dph (25.0 & PLUSMN; 4.6 mm, TL). Except for the esophageal sac, the ontogeny of the digestive system in silver pomfret larvae appears to be generally similar to that of other marine fish species; it might be feasible to begin weaning this species from 15 to 20 dph, which would reduce the amount of live food as required by current protocols. This study provides a preliminary insight into the digestive system ontogeny of silver pomfret and establishes an initial step towards the rearing and weaning process optimization of this novel species.

AB  - Transcription factors of TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain) family are the downstream nuclear effector of Hippo signaling pathway, which play a pivotal regulatory role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor formation and antiviral immunity. Here, we cloned and characterized a novel homolog of TEAD family from Litopenaeus vannamei for the first time, designed as LvScalloped. LvScalloped had an open reading frame of 1155 bp, which contained a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain and a Yes-associated binding domain. It was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, and especially abundant in the intestine. Upon WSSV infection, the transcriptional levels of LvScalloped were found to be up-regulated significantly in the gills and hepatopancreas. To clarify its role in WSSV infection, dsRNA-mediated RNAi was performed. Results showed that inhibition of LvScalloped transcription reduced the transcription of viral genes (ie1 and vp28) and also the mortality of L. vannamei after WSSV challenge. Further investigation revealed that LvScalloped could induce the activity of the immediateearly viral gene wsv083 promoter. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation and CCK8 assay demonstrated that the interaction of LvScalloped and its transcriptional co-activator LvYorkie was involved in the regulation of cell viability in High Five cells. The study revealed that LvScalloped might be manipulated by WSSV for its propagation and played a pivotal role in viral gene transcription and cell viability. It will provide information for an indepth understanding of virus-host interactions and the functional mechanism of Hippo signaling pathway in shrimp.

AB  - The application of manures leads to the contamination of agricultural soils with veterinary antibiotics (VAs). These might exert toxicity on the soil microbiota and threaten environmental quality, and public health. We obtained mech-anistic insights about the impact of three VAs, namely, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tiamulin (TIA) and tilmicosin (TLM), on the abundance of key soil microbial groups, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and class I integron integrases (intl1). In a microcosm study, we repeatedly treated two soils (differing in pH and VA dissipation capacity) with the studied VAs, either directly or via fortified manure. This application scheme resulted in accelerated dissipation of TIA, but not of SMX, and accumulation of TLM. Potential nitrification rates (PNR), and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganism (AOM) were reduced by SMX and TIA, but not by TLM. VAs strongly impacted the total prokaryotic and AOM communities, whereas manure addition was the main determinant of the fungal and protist communities. SMX stimulated sulfonamide resistance, while manure stimulated ARGs and horizontal gene transfer. Correlations identified opportunistic pathogens like Clostridia, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, and Nocardioides as po-tential ARG reservoirs in soil. Our results provide unprecedented evidence about the effects of understudied VAs on soil microbiota and highlight risks posed by VA-contaminated manures. Environmental implication: The dispersal of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) through soil manuring enhances antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development and poses a threat to the environment and the public health. We provide insights about the impact of selected VAs on their: (i) microbially-mediated dissipation in soil; (ii) ecotoxicity on the soil microbial communities; (iii) capacity to stimulate AMR. Our results (i) demonstrate the effects of VAs and their application -mode on the bacterial, fungal, and protistan communities, and on the soil ammonia oxidizers; (ii) describe natural attenuation processes against VA dispersal, (iii) depict potential soil microbial AMR reservoirs, essential for the devel-opment of risk assessment strategies.

AB  - We report an unknown taxon of bot fly (Diptera: Oestridae: Oestrinae) in red river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus Linnaeus, 1758) in Cross River State, Nigeria. From direct observation and interviews with local hunters, we document that, remarkably, the parasite typically occurs within the intracranial supra-meningeal space - i.e., between the inner wall of the skull and the brain - but without causing visible inflammation or clinical signs. The parasite is most similar (up to 87.9%) to Rhinoestrus usbekistanicus based on cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 DNA sequencing but is sufficiently divergent phylogenetically to represent a new or previously un-sequenced taxon. Morphologically, the parasite shares some, but not all, features with R. nivarleti. Local cultural belief systems attribute aspects of red river hog behavior (e.g. intelligence, elusiveness) to the parasite, suggesting a prolonged presence in the red river hog population. The parasite's unusual anatomic location may be aberrant, or it may be a protective adaptation to life in red river hogs, which forage vigorously with their snouts.

AB  - Frequent social interactions, proximity to conspecifics, and group density are main drivers of infections and parasite transmissions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the health benefits of sociality and group living can outweigh the costs of infection and help social individuals fight infections or increase their infection-related tolerance level. Here, we combine the advantage of studying artificially created social work groups with different demographic compositions with free-range feeding and social behaviours in semi-captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), employed in timber logging in Myanmar. We examine the link between gastro-intestinal nematode load (strongyles and Strongyloides spp.), estimated by faecal egg counts, and three different aspects of an elephant's social world: individual solitary behaviour, work group size, and work group sex ratio. Controlling for sex, age, origin, time since last deworming treatment, year, human sampler bias, and individual identity, we found that infection by nematodes ranged from 0 to 2720 eggs/g between and within 26 male and 45 female elephants over the 4-year study period. However, such variation was not linked to any investigated measures of sociality in either males or females. Our findings highlight the need for finer-scale studies, establishing how sociality is limited by, mitigates, or protects against infection in different ecological contexts, to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these pathways.
   Significance statement
   Being social involves not only benefits, such as improved health, but also costs, including increased risk of parasitism and infectious disease. We studied the relationship between and three different sociality measures-solitary behaviour, group size, and the proportion of females to males within a group-and infection by gut nematodes (roundworms), using a unique study system of semi-captive working Asian elephants. Our system allows for observing how infection is linked to sociality measures across different social frameworks. We found that none of our social measures was associated with nematode infection in the studied elephants. Our results therefore suggest that here infection is not a large cost to group living, that it can be alleviated by the benefits of increased sociality, or that there are weak infection-sociality associations present which could not be captured and thus require finer-scale measures than those studied here. Overall, more studies are needed from a diverse range of systems that investigate specific aspects of social infection dynamics.

AB  - Goats or sheep are the preferred animal model for the preclinical evaluation of cartilage repair techniques due to the similarity of the goat stifle joint to the human knee. The medial femoral condyle of the stifle joint is the preferred site for the assessment of articular cartilage repair, as this is the primary location for this type of lesion in the human knee. Proper surgical exposure of the medial femoral condyle is paramount to obtain reproducible results without surgical error. When applying the standard human medial arthrotomy technique on the goat stifle joint, there are some key aspects to consider in order to prevent destabilization of the extensor apparatus and subsequent postoperative patellar dislocations with associated animal discomfort. This paper describes a modified surgical technique to approach the medial femoral condyle of the caprine stifle joint. The modified technique led to satisfactory exposure without postoperative incidence of patellar luxations and no long-term adverse effects on the joint.

AB  - Purpose Agroforestry biowaste compiles large amount of solid waste, which could be pyrolyzed into biochar and applied as soil amendment. The application of biochar has emerged as an excellent tool to mitigated the greenhouse gases emissions. However, effects of biochar could be varied according to soil type, feedstock type and rate of biochar application. Materials and methods We studied the effect of three types of biochar (FS, fruit shell of Camellia oleifera-based; MS, spent mushroom substrate-based and RS, rice straw-based) on N2O emissions with nitrogen treatment N (urea, 0 and 0.02%) from and two soils with different origin (rice paddy soil, RPS and C. oleifera plantation soil, CPS). Results and discussion FS and MS biochar significantly reduced N2O emissions in fertilized CPS by 66% and 33%, respectively, while that in RPS were increased by 74% and 49%, respectively. After RS biochar addition, N2O emissions were decreased by 82% only in fertilized CPS, indicating that FS and MS biochar applied in soil with the same origin as those of biochar feedstocks efficiently mitigated N2O emission rates. The relatively lower soil pH in CPS increased profoundly relative to RPS after biochar was added which contributed substantially to N2O emissions reduction, that result could be supported by the increased abundance of nosZ in RPS with nitrogen and biochar. Simultaneously, the higher soluble C and N of MS and FS biochar could increase that of RPS after application, which could further enhance N2O emissions in RPS. Conclusions Biochar mitigated more N2O in soils with the same origin as that of biochar feedstocks compared with that of different origin ecosystems. Mitigating N2O emissions should consider the origin ecosystem of both biochar feedstock and soils, both of which profoundly impact the outcome of soil N2O mitigations.

AB  - Pleistocene faunal assemblages are often highly fragmented, hindering taxonomic identifications and interpretive potentials. In this paper, we apply four different methodologies to morphologically unidentifiable bone fragments from the Neanderthal open-air site of Salzgitter-Lebenstedt (Germany). First, we recorded zooarchaeological attributes for all 1362 unidentifiable bones recovered in 1977. Second, we applied zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) to 761 fragments, and calculated glutamine deamidation values. Third, we assessed the collagen preservation of 30 fragments by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and, finally, we pretreated 10 bones with high predicted collagen values for radiocarbon dating. All returned dates at, or beyond, the limit of radiocarbon dating, indicating an age of older than 51 000 years ago. The ZooMS faunal spectrum confirms a cold environment, dominated by reindeer, alongside mammoth, horse and bison. The low occurrence of carnivore modifications (1%) contrasts with an abundance of human modifications (23%). Cut marks and marrow fractures were observed across reindeer, horse and bison. The mammoth remains are less well preserved and show a lower degree of human modifications, indicating, perhaps, a different taphonomic history. Overall, this study illustrates the importance of retaining, studying and incorporating the unidentifiable bone fraction to optimize interpretations of site formation and subsistence behaviour at Palaeolithic sites.

AB  - Endometritis is a common postpartum disease of female animals that causes significant losses to the goat industry. High levels of cortisol induced by various stresses after delivery severely inhibit innate immunity and tissue repair. The repair ability of the endometrium is closely related to the reproductive performance of goats. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in animals that has powerful antioxidant and immunity-enhancing functions. In this study, we established a goat model of endometritis at high cortisol (Hydrocortisone) levels to investigate the effect of Se (supplement additive) on endometrial repair. The results showed that the clinical symptoms, %PMN in uterine secretions, morphological endometrial damage, and the gene expression of BAX were reduced in the goats with Se supplementation compared with those in the model group. Se increased the gene expression of BCL2, VEGFA, TGFB1, and PCNA and activated the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in goats with Se supplementation. In conclusion, Se reduced the inflammatory response, increased the proliferation, and decreased the apoptosis of endometrial cells to promote endometrial tissue repair in goats with endometritis at high cortisol levels. It probably achieved this effect of promoting repair by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways and affecting the gene expression of VEGFA, TGFB1, PCNA, BCL2, and BAX.

AB  - The present study analyzed the growth pattern of the stingray Urotrygon chilensis caught as bycatch by the shrimp fishery in the southeastern Mexican Pacific. From January to December 2012, the thoracic vertebrae of 491 females and 205 males were collected. Female ages ranged from 0 to 14 years, whereas male ages ranged from 0 to 12 years. The marginal increment and edge analyses suggested the annual formation of growth bands in the vertebrae. The size-at-age data were analyzed using the multimodel inference approach; six candidate growth models were compared, including models with a theoretical age-at-zero total length, mean size-at-birth, and generalized models. Based on Akaike's information criterion, the best statistical fit to the size-at-age data was the two-phase Gompertz growth model (k = -0.13, G = 1.59, L0 = 10.40) for males and the two-parameter Gompertz growth model (k = 1.42, alpha = 0.15, L0 = 10.90) for females. In this study, we compare the growth parameters among batoid species, finding that U. chilensis has a relatively short lifespan, slower growth, and that females are larger than males.

AB  - We report the first case of flower bud galls in a species of the mainly American genus Senega (Polygalaceae), specifically in the South Andean Patagonian plant species S. salasiana. The galls were found to be induced by gall midges (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae) and mites (Acari). We also assessed their impact on plant reproduction by measuring the relationship between inflorescence density (number of inflorescences/plant cover) and gall abundance in two populations next to San Carlos de Bariloche, Patagonia, Argentina. Plant reproduction was negatively related to the number of galled inflorescences, suggesting that high levels of gall abundance strongly reduced plant reproductive success. Our study illustrates a novel case of flower galls in the genus Senega and highlights the negative impact of this type of herbivory on plant fitness.

AB  - Capybaras are the primary hosts of Amblyomma sculptum tick, vectors of Rickettsia rickettsia bacteria, and the zoonotic agent of Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF). In this context, contraceptive methods have been suggested for population control in order to reduce the number of free-ranging capybaras cohabiting with humans in urban and rural areas and acting as disease amplifiers. To maintain the group's expected behavior and social hierarchy, sterilization techniques that preserve the gonads are recommended. On 126 female capybaras in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo, a new surgical technique named "Passos Nunes" uterine horn ligature was performed after adequate general anesthesia. It achieved effective surgical sterilization, with an incision length of about 3 cm in the periumbilical linea alba, cranial to the pubis. After entering the abdominal cavity, the urinary bladder is pulled laterally to access the uterine horns and the cervix. The uterine horn is folded up, forming a strap; the distal portion of the strap is ligated and its distal end sectioned. The exact process is performed on the opposite horn. After the surgical procedure, the musculature is sutured in a sultan pattern and the subcutaneous tissue with a horizontal mattress pattern. The skin is sutured in a separate simple format, using nylon 2.0 for all steps. The wide exposure of the uterine horns facilitates the confirmation of pregnancy, allowing the surgeon to choose between salpingo hysterectomy or ligature of the uterine horns. The present study presents a new technique of surgical sterilization that can be used in female free-ranging mammals in which maintenance of the gonads is recommended, and births of offspring should not occur.

AB  - The kidney of fish contains numerous nephrons, each of which is divided into the renal corpuscle and renal tubules. This glomerular structure is the filtration unit of the nephron and is important for the kidney function, but it has been reported that the renal corpuscle was lost in at least four independent linages of fish (i.e., aglomerular kidney). In this study, the authors newly described renal structures for three species by histological and ultrastructural observations: two aglomerular kidneys from a seahorse Hippocampus barbouri and a toadfish Allenbatrachus grunniens and a glomerular kidney from a snake eel Pisodonophis boro. The renal development of H. barbouri was also described during 1-35 days after birth. In all species tested, the anterior kidney was comprised of haematopoietic tissues and a few renal tubules, whereas the posterior kidney contained more renal tubules. Although the glomerular structure was present in P. boro, light microscopic observations identified no glomeruli in the kidney of H. barbouri and A. grunniens. Ultrastructurally, abundant deep basal infoldings with mitochondria in the renal tubules were observed in A. grunniens compared to H. barbouri and P. boro, suggesting the possible role of basal infoldings in maintaining the osmotic balance. By integrating the results from the three species and comprehensive literature search, the authors further showed that 56 species have been reported to be aglomerular, and that the aglomerular kidney has evolved at least eight times in bony fishes.

AB  - Adoption of rotational grazing or multi-species herbal leys, planting trees and integrating livestock into arable rotations can increase agricultural productivity and carbon storage on temperate ruminant livestock farms. However, farmers frequently have rational reasons for not adopting seemingly beneficial management practices. Here, we conduct semi-structured interviews with sheep and beef cattle farmers and industry representatives in England, to determine the advantages, disadvantages, and reasons for non-adoption of these four management practices. We find key reasons that farmers rationally do not adopt these practices include capital outlay, incompatibility with farming objectives, and the risk that desired benefits are not delivered.

AB  - One of the unanswered questions in Palaeolithic studies is how Neanderthals adapted their subsistence strategies by changing their diet at such a late stage of their existence. Zooarchaeological and taphonomic studies are critical to determine anthropogenic behaviour and to accurately understand the strategies used to exploit different ecological niches. In this line of research, the present paper aims to provide a thorough assessment of the unpublished faunal assemblages from two Late Mousterian Italian sites: Riparo del Broion (northern Italy) and Roccia San Sebastiano cave (southern Italy). These two sites occupy two distant and different areas of Italy, however providing late Neanderthals coeval occupations dated between 50,000-44,000 cal BP.In this study we analysed more than 27,000 remains following a multidisciplinary approach that combines taxonomical, anatomical and taphonomic investigations. Moreover, an experimental study that supports the instrumental use of valve fragments of Anodonta sp. is also presented for Riparo del Broion. Strontium isotope analysis of cervid remains, the most exploited prey in both sites, provides useful information to explore selection of available animals, the mobility of human groups, and the composition of animal herds.In general, the characteristics of the territory of the two sites highlight the exploitation of different resources that could vary from almost specialized small game (Riparo del Broion) to selective ungulates (Roccia San Sebastiano) hunting strategies. At Riparo del Broion, the main exploitation of red deer was accompanied by beaver hunting, fishing, and shellfish gathering from freshwater lake environments. On the contrary, human groups at Roccia San Sebastiano cave hunted almost exclusively red deer, despite the sea was not far from the cave. The absence of shellfish and fish remains is remarkable. In addition, the transformation and use of diaphyseal bone flakes as retouchers at both sites and the presence of a probable "bone awl" at Roccia San Sebastiano, further confirm an extended capacity in the use of a large range of materials for different subsistence activities.Present results consist of the first zooarchaeological comparison of the Late Mousterian levels of Roccia San Sebastiano cave and Riparo del Broion. These allowed us to detail environments, and subsistence strategies of two Neanderthal groups that inhabited different ecological niches of the Italian territory and provide important data to disentangle possible changes in faunal exploitation strategies, butchering, processing, and cultural behaviours during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Italy.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating viral disease of both wild boar and domestic pigs. Historically, the disease was mainly found in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, after the introduction of ASF into Georgia in 2007, the fatal disease spread to many European and Asian countries. In the absence of vaccines or treatment options, early detection of disease incursions is of paramount importance to limit the impact on animal health and pig industry. Thus, the biological characteristics of circulating virus strains must be known and communicated to practitioners and official veterinarians. Along these lines, the ASFV strain found in Belgium in 2018 was further characterized for its disease course in young and subadult domestic pigs. In general, clinical and pathological findings were in line with previous experiments utilizing highly virulent ASFV genotype II strains. However, in one of our experimental infections, four out of eight subadult domestic pigs showed milder signs and recovered, which was unexpected and points to an age dependency of clinical signs that could impact the early recognition of ASF incursions. We hope that communication of the available data will help practical and official veterinarians in the field to detect ASF as early as possible and thus minimize its impact. African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important and devastating viral diseases in wild boar and domestic pigs worldwide. In the absence of vaccines or treatment options, early clinical detection is crucial and requires a sound knowledge of disease characteristics. To provide practitioners and state veterinarians with detailed information, the objective of the present study was to characterize the ASF virus (ASFV) isolate "Belgium 2018/1" in subadult and weaning domestic pigs. To this end, two animal trials were performed. Trial A included eight subadult domestic pigs and trial B five weaner pigs. In general, clinical signs and pathological lesions were in line with previous studies utilizing highly virulent ASF genotype II viruses. However, in trial A, four subadult domestic pigs survived and recovered, pointing to an age-dependent outcome. The long-term fate of these survivors remains under discussion and would need further investigation.

AB  - Simple Summary: "Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP" (mozzarella cheese) is mainly produced and marketed during the spring and summer months. The buffalo is a seasonal species that increases its reproductive activity when daylight hours decrease. Therefore, to increase milk production in the favourable period, the so-called "Out of Breeding Season Mating" technique is applied. It consists of the interruption of sexual promiscuity during the naturally occurring breeding season and concentrating calving and milk production during periods of increasing daylight length. However, the application of this technique increases the incidence of anoestrus, as animals are forced to breed outside of their natural and favoured period of the year, although other factors can also increase the incidence of anoestrus, such as climate. A reduction of seasonal anoestrus can be achieved by using some hormonal treatments. In this study, primiparous acyclic buffaloes were selected and divided into three classes according to their days in milk. Animals were synchronized using P-4 vaginal implants, and artificial insemination (AI) was performed according to protocol. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was recorded to evaluate its influence on anoestrus. Statistical analysis showed that the implemented P-4-based treatments were highly effective in removing the anoestrus condition in buffaloes. On the contrary, no influence of the THI on the efficacy of the P-4 synchronization treatment was observed.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a progesterone-based treatment on anoestrus in buffaloes. Primiparous acyclic buffaloes (n = 276), were divided into three classes according to their days in milk (DIM): from 50 to 90 (Class I; n = 86), from 91 to 150 (Class II; n = 102) and from 150 to 200 (Class III; n = 88). Animals were synchronized using P-4 vaginal implants, followed by timed artificial insemination (TAI). They were then allowed to enter into a larger group of buffaloes for natural mating 15 days after AI was performed, and pregnancy status was monitored from then on at 15-day intervals. Finally, the temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA by means and both multiple and linear regression. The total pregnancy rate (PR) was 87.7%, with no differences among DIM classes (88.0, 92.4, and 80.0% in Classes I, II, and III, respectively). However, the PR at TAI tended to be higher (p = 0.07) in buffaloes in Class II. The follicle (FL) area in Class II buffaloes was larger (p < 0.01) than that of the other classes. No influence of the THI on the total PR was recorded. The pregnancy outcome at TAI was affected by the FL area (odds ratio = 2.237; p < 0.05) and body condition score (BCS) (odds ratio = 1.256; p < 0.05). In conclusion, treatment with vaginal P-4 optimizes pregnancy rates in anoestrus buffaloes, particularly when the animals are in mid-lactation and show an optimal BCS. Furthermore, the THI does not seem to affect the efficiency of the progesterone treatment.

AB  - A long-term monitoring programme from 2005 to 2021 has allowed the assessment of age and longevity in an endangered seahorse Hippocampus whitei in the wild. Seahorses were marked using visible implant fluorescent elastomer (VIFE) which allows for individual identification. The longest period from marking to last sighting was 6 years 8 months and 17 days for a female. Using a von Bertalanffy growth function model for the species, this individual would have been approximately 7 years 7 months old on last sighting. These observations suggest that seahorses in the wild can live for over 7 years and demonstrate the benefits of using VIFE in long-term movement, population abundance and life-history studies of seahorses.

AB  - The Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay is a relatively non-invasive method successfully applied to evaluate genomic damage for biological monitoring of human populations exposed to various mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds. This paper presents a protocol developed to apply the buccal micronucleus assay to wild mammal species during field or management activities. We applied the BMCyt to one population of Eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis, n=37) and one of wild boars (Sus scrofa, n=41) living in anthropized and natural areas, respectively. Micronuclei, nuclear buds, and other nuclear abnormalities, e.g. binucleated, Kidney-shaped nucleus, broken eggs, karyorrhexis, cells with condensed chromatin, pyknotic and karyolysis, were recorded. The frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear buds were respectively 0.51 +/- 0.60 and 1.29 +/- 1.08 for wild boars and 0.16+0.37 and 0.57+0.73 for grey squirrels. Sex, age classes and body weight had generally no effects on the frequencies of genomic damages, except for a limited effect of weight on broken eggs and karyolitic cells in grey squirrels and of sex on condensed chromatin in wild boars. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that buccal mucosa is a sensitive site for detecting micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities and that the protocol used in this paper may represent a valuable tool to evaluate the genomic damage in wild species living in both anthropized and natural areas.

AB  - The tapetum lucidum, a biological reflector system found in the eyes of many vertebrate species, enhances visual sensitivity in low light conditions by reflecting light back through the retina. The structure of the ungulate tapetum fibrosum is unique, and its reflectance varies temporally in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We used reflectance spectroscopy to characterize the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) tapetum fibrosum and to determine if reflectance varies spatially across the species' range. Our results revealed spatial variation in tapetal coloration and reflectance across parts of the white-tailed deer's range, with populations displaying distinct spectral profiles. Deer in the northern populations of Missouri, Minnesota, and Indiana primarily possessed more short-wave-reflecting tapeta, whereas deer in the Georgia population exhibited more mid-wave-reflecting tapeta and the tapeta of Texas deer appeared intermediate in reflectance. Our findings suggest that tapetal reflectance in white-tailed deer may be influenced by ecological and environmental pressures that vary spatially. These results suggest that local variations in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tapetum fibrosum in ungulates may be an adaptive trait.

AB  - Phytophthora ramorum is a harmful pathogen of ornamental and forest trees in Europe and North America. This pathogen has been recovered from nursery plants in Galicia (northwestern Spain) since 2003 and, despite carrying out the measures implemented by Commission Decision 2002/757/CE, including the eradication of infected plants and periodic inspections in nurseries, it is likely that P. ramorum has spread in landscaped green areas through planting of infected nursery stock. The aim of this work was to survey woody ornamental plants in public parks and gardens in Galicia for the presence of P. ramorum from 2011 to 2018 and to identify and characterize any other species of the genus found. Samples of leaves, twigs, and rhizosphere soil of symptomatic ornamental trees and shrubs were analyzed. Morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics of 93 collect isolates enabled the identification of 13 species of Phytophthora. The greatest diversity of Phytophthora species was detected on Rhododendron and Camellia. P. ramorum was isolated from leaf samples of Camellia sp., Rhododendron sp., and Viburnum tinus grown in three sites. To our knowledge, this is the first time that P. ramorum has been detected in landscaped green areas in Spain. These results suggest that regular inspections of symptomatic ornamental woody plants are necessary to control the spread of P. ramorum and other Phytophthora species.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat deposition profile and fatty acid biosynthesis in adipose tissues are two relevant metabolic processes for breeding companies as the fat content of meat relates to its technological, organoleptic, and nutritional quality. Age, breed, and sex have a great impact on fat metabolism. Therefore, in the present experiment, a labeled saturated fatty acid was added to the diet of pigs belonging to three different producing types during two growth phases, to define the rate of its incorporation into body fat. In addition, the activity of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which promotes the conversion of some saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated, was analyzed. In the growing phase, direct incorporation of fat from diet was higher than biosynthesis in most adipose tissues, whereas in the fattening phase it was higher only in the liver, revealing the changing roles of organs in fat metabolism with age. The leaner pigs also obtained a higher fat incorporation, denoting higher reliance on dietary fatty acids for fat deposition; overall, real stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was higher in the fattening phase. Fatty acid (FA) deposition in growing-fattening pigs is mainly based on endogenous lipid synthesis, but also direct FA incorporation from the diet. To evaluate the direct fat incorporation rates and the endogenous desaturation action of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzyme, a deuterium (D)-labeled saturated FA (d(35)-C18:0) was added to the diet. Sixteen three-way (3W) crossbred boars, and thirty-two purebred Duroc barrows homozygous for the SCD single nucleotide polymorphism rs80912566 (16 CC/16 TT), were used. Half of the animals of each genotype belonged to the growing and fattening phases. The fractional incorporation rate (FIR) of dietary fat in growing pigs was generally higher in adipose tissues, whereas in fattening pigs it was higher in the liver. Duroc pigs exhibited lower FIRs than 3W pigs, suggesting lower rates of endogenous synthesis by 3W pigs. Real fractional unsaturation rates (FURs) increased with age by the higher FIRs in 3W pigs and the de novo synthesis pathway in Duroc genotypes. Moreover, pigs carrying the SCD_T allele showed more enhanced oleic acid biosynthesis than Duroc CC pigs. In conclusion, suitable feeding protocols should be designed for each pig type to optimize production traits, considering that the metabolic pathway of FA for its deposition may differ.

AB  - Pumas (Puma concolor) are solitary large carnivores that exhibit high energetic investments while hunting prey that often take multiple days to consume. Therefore, pumas should behave in a way to maximize their energetic gains, including using caching, which is a behavior used by many mammal species to preserve and store food or to conceal it from conspecifics and scavengers to limit their losses. Yet pumas do not always cache their kills. In order to understand caching behavior, we used variables associated with the kills such as prey mass, search time, climate, and habitat to test 20 ecological models (representing four a priori hypotheses: food perishability, resource pulse, consumption time, and kleptoparasitism deterrence) in an information-theoretic approach of model selection to explore factors related to the caching behavior. Models were run with information from tracked radio-collared pumas in California over a 2.5-year period and identified a total of 352 kills. Overall, we documented pumas caching 61.5% of their kills, including 71.6% of Black-tailed Deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), their primary prey in the study area. The model with a quadratic effect of adjusted mass of prey on puma caching probability had all of the empirical support (w = 1.00). Specifically, pumas were most likely to cache intermediate-sized prey, such as yearling and adult female deer, and also fed from cached kills for longer periods of time. Larger prey may be too large to easily cache, making it less energetically efficient-while small prey can often be consumed quickly enough to not require caching. This suggests that intermediate-sized prey may be the optimal size for caching, allowing a puma to feed for multiple days while not greatly increasing energetic output. The hypotheses we tested were not mutually exclusive and pumas caching their prey may occur for several reasons; nevertheless, our study demonstrated that pumas use caching to extend their foraging time and maximize energetic gains when preying on intermediate-sized prey.

AB  - Temperature and nutrients are two of the most important drivers of global change. Both can modify the elemental composition (i.e. stoichiometry) of primary producers and consumers. Yet their combined effect on the stoichiometry, dynamics and stability of ecological communities remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we extended the Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource model by including thermal dependencies, nutrient dynamics and stoichiometric constraints on both the primary producer and the consumer. We found that stoichiometric and nutrient conservation constraints dampen the paradox of enrichment and increased persistence at high nutrient levels. Nevertheless, stoichiometric constraints also reduced consumer persistence at extreme temperatures. Finally, we also found that stoichiometric constraints and nutrient dynamics can strongly influence biomass distribution across trophic levels by modulating consumer assimilation efficiency and resource growth rates along the environmental gradients. In the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, consumer biomass exceeded resource biomass for most parameter values whereas, in the stoichiometric model, consumer biomass was strongly reduced and sometimes lower than resource biomass. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for stoichiometric constraints as they can mediate the temperature and nutrient impact on the dynamics and functioning of ecological communities.

AB  - Damaging behaviour, especially tail and ear biting, are common problems in modern pig production. It has been suggested that a low birth weight could predispose pigs to become tail biters. Further, previous studies have shown somewhat contradictory links between growth rate and damaging behaviours, as well as resulting lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate, under practical farm conditions, if birth weight and growth of pigs are related to the risk for damaging behaviours and their outcomes, namely tail and ear lesions. A total of 386 pigs were followed from birth until the end of finishing period on four commercial farm pairs (piglet-producing and finishing farms). Based on birth weight, pigs were categorised as Small and Others, and pigs were weighed around weaning and in the growing and finishing units. At the two latter phases, they were scored for lesions and observed for pig- and environment-directed manipulative behaviour (PMB and EMB, respectively). PMB was not more common in Small than in Other pigs. However, PMB in the growing unit was positively associated with growth rate during suckling and growing periods (p = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively) and EMB was reduced in pigs with high growth rate (p = 0.02) in the finishing unit. Additionally, ear lesions in the growing unit were related to high growth rate in both the suckling (p = 0.03) and the growing period (p < 0.01). The current study shows no evidence that low birth weight predisposes to become a performer of damaging behaviours. Instead, a high growth rate in the suckling and growing period increased the risk for a high level of pig-directed manipulation as well as for becoming a victim of damaging behaviour in the growing unit. We suggest that this could be a consequence of increased feeding motivation in fast-growing pigs: they might experience more competition for feed, and consequently a higher level of stress, which predisposes to damaging behaviour.

AB  - Quercus acorns and coniferous cones are the main food sources for tree squirrels, and the chemical contents of seeds, such as tannins and terpenes, are predicted to affect the squirrels' food preference. The tolerance of squirrels to chemical contents may vary between species that have evolved in different environments. The consumption of artificial food containing tannic acids or terpenes were compared between the endemic Sciurus lis and two alien species, S. vulgaris and Callosciurus erythraeus. Sciurus lis ate foods containing up to 4% tannic acid, whereas S. vulgaris and C. erythraeus ate foods containing 8% tannic acid. Sciurus lis and S. vulgaris could eat food containing a high-concentration of terpenes (up to 0.3% alpha-pinene and 2% limonene), whereas the food consumption by C. erythraeus decreased drastically with increasing terpene concentrations. The two alien squirrels are highly resistant to tannins and thus the acorns of most Quercus species may be available for them. Sciurus lis exhibits a lower tolerance to tannins, but can consume foods with high concentrations of terpenes, suggesting a strong adaptation to coniferous forests, but not to Quercus forests. More attention must be paid to conserving suitable habitats for S. lis, an endemic relict species.

AB  - In the Czech Republic, the abundance (burrow index (BI) of the common vole (Microtus arvalis), an herbivorous pest rodent in Central Europe, were collected in vole-suitable agricultural crops in spring and autumn. We used a 20-year data set that we predicted would cover enough spatial and temporal variations in the natural population fluctuations to allow us to test the effect of main crops. We found that permanent and perennial (i.e. alfalfa and clover) crops hosted the most abundant common vole populations among all studied crops. Among winter crops the population reached the greatest abundance in winter rape. In the growing season, (a) permanent and perennial crops, and to a lesser extent winter rape, maintained a high vole population during autumn and winter; (b) their population in winter cereals (winter barley and winter wheat) was consistently smaller compared to previous crops; (c) in sugar beet, in comparison with other crops, the population reached the highest level in two months of autumn (September and October) and (d) their population in spring barley reached a number comparable to winter cereals in only three months (March, April and May) of spring. We also revealed that the mild winter season positively influenced the common vole?s abundance. Fluctuations in the common vole?s BI in various crops over the 20-year time period were correlated and resulted in significant synchronisation. This led to the conclusion that permanent crops can serve as a good indicator for the prediction of the future development of species density and prevention.

AB  - Haliotis kamtschatkana is the only abalone native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Haliotis kamtschatkana populations are in decline, and current restoration efforts in Washington State rely on out-planting hatchery-produced juveniles. Hatchery personnel report highest mortalities in the postlarval stage of H. kamtschatkana, mainly during the first 3 to 6 months. Postlarvae feed on films of benthic diatoms, and the purpose of this study was to test six diatom species (Achnanthes brevipes, Amphora sauna, Amphiprora paludosa, Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula incerta, and Nitzschia laevis) as suitable diets for H. kamtschatkana. Diatom diet suitability might rely on several factors, including diatom characteristics as well as the postlarva's ability to ingest the diatoms. The radula is a crucial feeding structure for gastropods and may display morphological plasticity, but this has never been characterized in H. kamtschatkana. We investigated survival, growth, and radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana postlarvae when fed one of six benthic diatom species for 61 days post-settlement. Amphora sauna yielded the highest survival, in a statistically homogenous subgroup with N. incerta, A. paludosa, and C. closterium. Achnanthes brevipes yielded exceptionally low survival, on par with a starvation control. Cylindrotheca closterium yielded significantly better growth than all other diets except A. sauna. Radula development was similar to that of other abalone species. The shape and size of the radula did not explain success or failure of any of the diatom diets since the radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana was comparable to other abalone that have succeeded when fed these same diets. We found no relationship between diatom diet and radula morphology. We recommend A. sauna as a suitable diet for newly settled H. kamtschatkana postlarvae, and that a combination of A. sauna and C. closterium be used to supplement feeding on naturally occurring biofilms.

AB  - Recycled manure solids (RMSs) are widely utilised as beddings due to their economic and environmentally friendly features. Internal change in RMSs plays a vital role in the stable operation and management of beddings. However, the internal microenvironment of various manure beddings has not been fully reported. Therefore, we evaluated the physicochemical properties, internal gases and changes in the microbial community of the in situ fermentation beds, which were prefermented by cow manure with sawdust (FSD), straw (FST) and sawdust-straw mixture (FM), at a farm in Jiangsu, China, from June to September 2022. The results indicated that the FSD and FM beds were more capable of degrading organic matter (OM), accumulating total nitrogen and processing a more stable pH environment. FSD bed promoted the conversion of nitrate-nitrogen and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N). Different treatments and times had significant effects on bacterial and fungal communities. FSD enriched Chloroflexi, and FST enriched Actinobacteriota in the early stage, while FM enriched Proteobacteria in the late stage. Bacterial communities were more sensitive to NH4+-N and OM, while fungal communities were more sensitive to temperature and pH. FSD had potential advantages concerning N conversion and C emission reduction. The results of the study revealed the microenvironmental dynamics during bedding use, providing a theoretical basis for the use of a compost bedding system for managing recycled dairy manure.

AB  - A significant amount of GHG is produced during milk production and dairy product processing and manufacturing. In this context, the current research was carried out in Haryana (India), with the objective to estimate the GHGs emission from dairy buffaloes and dairy products. Further, by using LCA methodology and tier-2 technique of IPCC guidelines, this research estimated the CF (Carbon Footprint) of raw milk production from buffalo using the "cradle to farm gate" system boundary and CF of major Indian dairy products using "Farm gate to factory gate" system boundary. LCA calculations were as per ISO:14,040 and 14,044 to detect and measure the effect within system boundary. The result showed that the average CF for raw milk production was 2.24 kg CO2-eq/ Kg FPCM. The study estimated the most significant source for GHG (tonne CO2-eq. head-1 year-1) contribution was from enteric fermentation (3.27), followed by feed and fodder production (1.37) and manure-management (0.29). The CF of Ghee, curd, and Pasteurized milk were 4.2, 1.8 and 0.24 kg CO2-eq, respectively. The overall CF of dairy products (Kg CO2-eq) was significantly higher for Ghee (47.6), followed by Curd (4.28) and pasteurized milk (3.68). The emission values for GHGs in the study were estimated on higher side as compared to other countries due to low productivity, poor management practices, higher emission factors and poor environmental efficiency of the dairy sector. Further studies to accurately estimate CF of milk from specialized farms using LCA while giving a special concern to multifunctionality of animals are advocated.

AB  - There are currently 12 recognised extant species of giant clams (Cardiidae: Tridacninae) inhabiting the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Six species have been newly described or rediscovered since 1982, such as the recently resurrected species Tridacna elongatissima in the Western Indian Ocean. In order to investigate the distribution range of this species, 24 specimens have been collected and identified by DNA barcoding. This study provides the first record for T. elongatissima in Tanzania and expands both the northern (Zanzibar, Tanzania) and southern (Ponta de Ouro, Mozambique) ranges of this species.

AB  - Background and Aims: Most angiosperms rely on pollinators to transport pollen and effect fertilization. While some floral visitors are effective pollinators, others act as thieves, consuming pollen but effecting little pollination in return. The importance of pollen theft in male and female reproductive success has received little attention. Here, we examined if pollen consumption by flies altered pollen receipt and exacerbated pollen limitation for a bumblebee-pollinated plant, Polemonium foliosissimum (Polemoniaceae).
   Methods:To examine the effect of pollen-thieving flies, we took a three-pronged approach. First, we used single-visit observations to quantify pollen removal and pollen deposition by flies and bumblebees. Second, we manipulated pollen in the neighbourhood around focal plants in two years to test whether pollen reduction reduced pollen receipt. Third, we combined pollen reduction with hand-pollination to test whether pollen thieving exacerbated pollen limitation. Polemonium foliosissimum is gynodioecious in most populations in the Elk Mountains of central Colorado, USA. Thus, we also tested whether pollen theft affected hermaphrodites and females differently.
   Results: Flies removed significantly more pollen and deposited less pollen per visit than did bumblebees. Reduction of pollen in the neighbourhood around focal plants reduced pollen receipt in both years but only nearly significantly so in 2015. In 2016, plants were significantly pollen-limited; hand-pollination significantly increased seeds per fruit for both hermaphrodites and females. However, the reduction of pollen around focal plants did not exacerbate pollen limitation for either hermaphrodites or females.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that plants tolerate significant consumption of pollen by thieves and pollinators by producing ample pollen to feed both and fertilize available ovules. Our results demonstrate that pollen limitation in P. foliosissimum is driven by lack of effective pollinators rather than lack of pollen. Teasing out these effects elucidates the relative importance of drivers of reproductive success and thus the expected response to selection by different floral visitors.

AB  - The hippocampus is crucial for memory. Memory consolidation is thought to be subserved by hippocampal "replays" of previously experienced trajectories. However, it is unknown how the brain replays long spatial trajectories in very large, naturalistic environments. Here, we investigated this in the hippocampus of bats that were flying prolonged flights in a 200-m-long tunnel. We found many time-compressed replay sequences during sleep and during awake pauses between flights, similarto rodents exploring small environments. Individual neurons fired multiple times per replay, according to their multiple place fields. Surprisingly, replays were highly fragmented, depicting short trajectory pieces covering only similar to 6% of the environment size-unlike replays in small setups, which cover most of the environment. This fragmented replay may reflect biophysical or network constraints on replay distance and may facilitate memory chunking for hippocampal-neocortical communication. Overall, hippocampal replay in very large environments is radically different from classical notions of memory reactivation-carrying important implications for hippocampal network mechanisms in naturalistic, real-world environments.

AB  - The larch wooly adelgid Adelges laricis Vallot (Hemiptera Adelgidae) infestation has a damaging effect on the European larch Larix decidua Miller. In the present study, we found significant differences in A. laricis population number between individual larch trees. On the scarcely infested tree T1, few A. laricis exulis progrediens sessile nymphs/adult females and winged sexuparae occurred incidentally in mid-May and at the end of June. On the heavily infested tree T2, we found all developmental stages of A. laricis typical of the secondary host: the exulis sistens sessile nymphs/females, exulis progrediens sessile nymphs/females, L1 crawlers, and winged sexuparae. The population of A. laricis on T2 developed from the beginning of April, the maximum number occurred at the end of May, and the decline - in the end of July, which coincided with the migration of winged sexuparae to the primary host, the spruce Picea abies (L.) H. Karsten. We studied the qualitative and quantitative content of mono- and sesquiterpenoids in the needles of T1 and T2, as these allelochemicals play a major role in conifer defence against herbivores. Thirty mono-and sesquiterpenoids were identified using GC-MS. The amounts of verbenone, isobornyl acetate, and camphene were 42, 10, and 5 times higher in T1 than in T2, respectively. While the relative contents of verbenone and camphene were 3.4% vs. 0.0% and 6.0% vs. 1.8% in T1 vs. T2, respectively, the content of isobornyl acetate was 28% vs. 4.0%. It is likely that the relatively high content of isobornyl acetate in the needles is an important component of antixenosis resistance in L. decidua against A. laricis. The results of this study may contribute to future investigations on herbivore resistance in conifers and may appear helpful in designing sustainable control strategies in forests and in urban environments.

AB  - Deterioration of seagrass beds worldwide has raised concern about the future of dugongs because almost all aspects of their life history depend on availability of seagrass. Understanding their energy metabolism and consequently how much seagrass they need will inform protective conservation strategies for dugongs. This study determined resting metabolic rate (RMR) in five wild-caught adult dugongs by measuring oxygen consumption (V<middle dot>$$ \overset{\cdotp }{\mathrm{V}} $$O2). Measurement conditions met assumptions for RMR, except that dugongs were not postabsorptive, thus a postprandial (pp) allometric equation for herbivorous mammals of similar size was used to predict an expected RMRpp for dugongs of known mass. V<middle dot>$$ \overset{\cdotp }{\mathrm{V}} $$O2 was measured for 30 min in a metabolic tank after brief habituation. Dugongs' RMRpp was approximately half that predicted for their body mass but was higher than for manatees. Based on dugongs' RMRpp and considering plant caloric and water content, the daily minimum intake of fresh weight seagrass was 40-65 kg Halophila ovalis, or 20-40 kg Halodule spp. Greater seagrass intake would be required for growing and reproducing dugongs. Slow growth and protracted reproductive rates of dugongs are likely related to limitations in seagrass energy and nutrients. To ensure viability of this vulnerable species, it is critically important to conserve extensive healthy seagrass beds.

AB  - Limited data are available regarding the gonadal development of farmed seahorse along with the physiological role of gonadotropins and sex steroids during gonadal maturation. In the present study, we conducted an examination of the developmental stages of gonad and brood pouch during the initial reproductive cycle of the farmed big -belly seahorse ( Hippocampus abdominalis ), and our results showed that males sexually matured half of a month later than females, and the brood pouch emerged at 3.5 -month old and then reached the late -stage at 5.5 -month old. Meanwhile, the open reading frame (ORF) of gonadotropin subunits ( cg alpha , fsh beta and lh beta ) of the bigbelly seahorse were cloned and characterized, and tissue distribution profiles of their transcripts were analyzed, revealing their detectability across various tissues, with a notable presence observed in the brain tissues. Furthermore, expression profiles of cg alpha , fsh beta and lh beta transcripts and the plasma levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (KT) in farmed big -belly seahorse during the first reproductive cycle were also investigated. The findings indicated that cg alpha , fsh beta and lh beta transcripts exhibited low expressions at the initial development of ovary or testis, raised continuously and reached their peak levels at the period of spawning or spermation, and they kept gradually increasing accompany with brood pouch growth. It is noteworthy that variation of mRNA levels of fsh beta were slightly higher than those of lh beta . Besides, the results showed that plasma 11 -KT levels presented an increasing trend during testicular development, peaking in fish with III and IV -stage testis and earlystage brood pouch, and plasma 17 beta-E2 levels were higher in vitellogenic stage of fish with II -stage ovary and early III -stage ovary. Taken together, these data reveal that gonadotropins and sex steroids likely play a role in the regulation of gonad and brood pouch growth in seahorse. These observations not only contribute to clarifying function of reproductive hormones on growth of gonad and brood pouch of seahorse, but also providing an important theoretical foundation for the artificial breeding of seahorses.

AB  - In nine Caranx hippos specimens, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Cu concentration was determined in tissues (muscle and gonad) and parasites (nematodes and cestodes). The fish were caught from February to June 2019 in Las Barrancas, Alvarado Beach, Veracruz, Mexico. Heavy metals were quantified using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results of the average concentration of pollutants were, Cr = 0.18 +/- 0.05 mg kg(-1) dry weight (dw); Cu = 0.2 +/- 0.1 mg kg(-1) dw; Pb = 0.022 +/- 0.01 mg kg(-1) dw; Cd = <0.003 mg kg(-1) dw. Among the tissues, Cu was the one with the highest concentration in nematodes vs. cestodes (2.2:1); vs. gonad (2.5:1); vs. muscle (2.7:1). Due to the concentration registered in Caranginema americanum nematodes could be identified as a bioindicator species for Cu pollutant. The values generally do not exceed the limits established in the Mexican National Standard (NOM-242-SSA1-2009) for Cd and Pb (0.5 mg kg(-1)). Records of heavy metals do not represent a health risk from consuming C. hippos.

TI  - A Test of Deriving Sex-Composition Data for the Directed Pacific Halibut Fishery via At-Sea Marking
T2  - MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - Sensitivity analyses have identified uncertainty regarding sex ratios within commercial landings of Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis as an influential source of variance within annual stock assessments for this species in U.S. and Canadian waters. Sex composition of dockside landings cannot be directly observed because all retained fish must be eviscerated at sea, and sex cannot be visually determined in the absence of the gonads. In the current study, a marking program was evaluated in which sex-specific marks were applied by fishers to their retained catch, the mark was recorded during dockside monitoring, and the accuracy of the recorded sexes was validated using genetic techniques. The chosen marks (two vertical cuts in the dorsal fin for females and a single cut in the operculum of males) were considered by fishers to be easy to apply during at-sea processing and produced sex-ratio estimates that were equivalent to genetic results for 65% of sampled landings. However, vessel- and region-specific accuracy was variable. Additional incentives to encourage vessels to participate in the program, continued outreach, or potentially a regulatory requirement to mark fish would be required to produce sufficient data to satisfy stock assessment needs, and ongoing validation would likely need to accompany such a program to ensure consistent and acceptable data quality.

AB  - BackgroundIn infected hosts, immune responses trigger a systemic energy reallocation away from energy storage and growth, to fuel a costly defense program. The exact energy costs of immune defense are however unknown in general. Life history theory predicts that such costs underpin trade-offs between host disease resistance and other fitness related traits, yet this has been seldom assessed. Here we investigate immune energy cost induced by infection, and their potential link to a trade-off between host resistance and fat storage that we previously exposed in sheep divergently selected for resistance to a pathogenic helminth.ResultsTo this purpose, we developed a mathematical model of host-parasite interaction featuring individual changes in energy allocation over the course of infection. The model was fitted to data from an experimental infectious challenge in sheep from genetically resistant and susceptible lines to infer the magnitude of immune energy costs. A relatively small and transient immune energy cost in early infection best explained within-individual changes in growth, energy storage and parasite burden. Among individuals, predicted responses assuming this positive energy cost conformed to the observed trade-off between resistance and storage, whereas a cost-free scenario incorrectly predicted no trade-off.ConclusionsOur mechanistic model fitting to experimental data provides novel insights into the link between energy costs and reallocation due to induced resistance within-individual, and trade-offs among individuals of selected lines. These will be useful to better understand the exact role of energy allocation in the evolution of host defenses, and for predicting the emergence of trade-offs in genetic selection.

AB  - Plant food such as pollen represents part of the diet of many predaceous coccinellids, exploited as a supplemental food source when prey is scarce. They can therefore suffer adverse effects when foraging on genetically modified plants expressing Cry1Ab toxin derived from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner. The Variegated Lady Beetle, Hippodamia variegata Goeze, a very common and important aphid predator in the Mediterranean area, feeds preferably on aphids but can use plant pollen as a supplemental food source. Hence, it can be exposed to Cry proteins when foraging on insect-resistant Bt-maize. In the current study, an experimental methodology to provide pollen to the coccinellids and quantify the amount of pollen eaten was developed. Using this methodology, the potential effects of the consumption of Bt-maize pollen on the fitness of H. variegata were evaluated. Both standardized laboratory bioassays and demographic approach by means of an age-structured matrix population model were performed. Both biological and demographic parameters did not differ between coccinellids fed Bt- or non-Bt-maize pollen. However, demographic analyses showed that some effects of Bt pollen exposure on H. variegata occurred. Indeed, the Bt-pollen-fed females had a higher expected lifetime reproduction; however, a reduced life expectancy occurred early in life for their offspring. As a result, the consumption of Bt-maize pollen causes a lower increase in H. variegata population since a reduction of offspring survival seems only partially outweighed by increased female fecundity. Overall, this study shows that the consumption of Bt-maize pollen expressing Cry1Ab by adults of H. variegata does not significantly affect their fitness, but it also shows that this outcome is a result of a trade-off among vital rates such as age-specific fecundity and survival probability that are positively or negatively influenced. Moreover, the methodology proposed in this study provides a sound exposure system to supply pollen to the coccinellids and appears functional to quantify maize pollen consumption by H. variegata adults.

AB  - This study aimed to determine a nutritionally adequate feeding protocol for Hippocampus hippocampus juveniles. In the experimental trial, seahorses were fed copepods from 0-7 days post-parturition (DPP) and, from 8-28 DPP, four different dietary treatments: (copepods (control diet) (Cop); microalgae-enriched Artemia with a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio of 2:1 (Art(DHA/EPA)); microalgae-enriched Artemia with a DHA/EPA ratio of 2:1 along with 5% copepods (ArtDHA/EPA5%); and with 10% copepods (Art(DHA/EPA)10%)). At the end of the trial, juvenile seahorses fed Cop grew significantly more (p < 0.05) (5.1 mg d(-1)) than those on fish-fed diets Art(DHA/EPA)5% or Art(DHA/EPA)10% (3.09 and 3.07 mg d(-1), respectively), or those on the fish-fed ArtDHA/EPA (1.83 mg d(-1)) diet, all of which performed poorly. Data suggest that feeding copepods during the first 7 DPP promotes maturation of the digestive tract of juvenile seahorses, and the addition of a limited amount of copepods to the diet improves H. hippocampus juvenile growth performance when compared with the use of Artemia as a single diet due to the improvement of the essential fatty acid profile in the diets.

AB  - Residual feed intake (RFI) is a nutritional variable used in genetic improvement programs, the relationship between the environment and the availability of energy and protein in the diet has not yet been explored. Thus, the aim was to evaluate interactions between RFI and thermal environment on performance, nitrogen balance, ingestive behavior and carcass yield of Dorper lambs receiving diets containing different concentrate levels. Dorper lambs (male, n = 64, 17.83 +/- 2.43 kg and 110 +/- 10 days of age) were confined individually for 40 days for RFI classification. Lambs were separated into positive RFI (n = 30) and negative RFI (n = 30) and remained confined for another 60 days. The animals were distributed in a randomized block design, with a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial scheme, with 2 confinement environments (full sun or shade), 2 groups of feed efficiency (RFI positive or RFI negative) and three diets containing different concentrate levels (30, 45 and 60%), with 5 replications in each treatment. Isolated effects of concentrate level were observed for dry matter intake and digestibility, feeding, rumination, idle and chewing times, feeding efficiency, ingested, excreted and absorbed nitrogen, and on cooling losses, hot and cold carcass yield (P < 0.05). There was an effect of environment x concentrate interaction on performance, retained nitrogen and nitrogen balance (P < 0.05). There was an effect of RFI x environment interaction on the dry matter rumination efficiency, hot and cold carcass weight (P < 0.05). Under experimental conditions, RFI did not influence the productive performance of Dorper lambs. Interactions between environment and diet indicate better performance for Dorper lamb confined in the shade and receiving a higher proportion of concentrate. Animals with negative RFI show better performance and carcass weight when confined in shade, while animals with positive RFI showed better responses to these variables when confined in full sun.

AB  - The article presents the results of research conducted during 2018-2021 in a field experiment on sod-podzolic soils on studying the efficiency of different fertilization variants on the productivity of Camelina sativa L. and, accordingly, the economic and energy efficiency of growing this crop.The dependence of productivity and yielding capacity elements on the application of mineral fertilizers has been revealed. It was found that the application of mineral fertilizers had a significant impact on the productivity of Camelina sativa L. seeds and the index of prime cost and profitability of Camelina sativa L. seeds accordingly. Depending on the studied elements in the technology of growing little-known in Ukraine crop of Camelina sativa L., the main indices of economic and energy efficiency were determined. It was found that optimization of plant nutrition, regardless of cultivation cost increase, provided an increase of conditionally net profit and profitability level. This was facilitated by foliar fertilization with modern regulators of growth and complex micro-fertilizers in critical periods of the crop vegetation. Depending on the variant of the experiment, conditionally net profit on average for the years of cultivation ranged from 14.899 UAH to 21.719 UAH/ha, and the level of profitability-from 172.8% to 197.4%. Under influence of the studied factors, the energy consumption of the yield, on the contrary, decreased compared to the control, which indicates expediency of different fertilization of plants in main periods of vegetation with the studied fertilizers and micro-fertilizers.

AB  - A primary facet of climate change is an increase in average temperatures which can have immense consequences for ectotherms, organisms that cannot physiologically regulate their own body temperatures, such as insects. Moreover, thermal stress can influence species interactions across trophic levels, especially if members of different trophic levels show differential responses. In agricultural systems, parasitoids are frequently used as biocontrol agents to reduce crop damage by regulating populations of insect herbivores, but climate change can potentially threaten this ecosystem service. In this study, we investigated the effects of diurnally fluctuating temperature regimes (average treatment temperatures = 23 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the relationship between the common agricultural pest Plutella xylostella and its larval parasitoid Diadegma insulare. We found that at higher temperatures, both the host and the parasitoid developed faster. Host survival was not influenced by tempera-ture, but higher temperatures resulted in increased parasitoid mortality in the pupal stage. Realized parasitism rates were also significantly decreased at higher temperatures, suggesting that D. insulare may become a less efficient biocontrol agent of P. xylostella as temperatures continue to increase.

AB  - Mongolian sheep are characteristically cold-tolerant and they partially depend on seasonal browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) to acclimate to cold environments. The present work aimed to examine the rumen mi-crobes, rumen fermentation profile, and relationships between the rumen microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and markers of WAT browning and are thus conducive to exploring the plateau environment adapt-ability of Mongolian sheep in the cold season. A comparative analysis of the rumen microbes and SCFAs in the cold and warm seasons was conducted. Rumen microbes were analyzed using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Ruminal SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography. Spearman's correlation test was used to determine the relationships between the rumen microbiota, SCFAs, and markers of WAT browning. Microbial 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a marked shift in rumen microbiota composition between the two seasons, and the bacteria were characterized by increased levels of the Actinobacteria and genera Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Ruminococcaceae UCG-011, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Papillibacter, and Butyrivibrio 2 and reduced levels of Prevotella 1 and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 in the cold season (P<0.05). Furthermore, the concentrations of SCFAs such as acetate and butyrate were significantly increased in the cold season (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the relative abundances of the Actinobacteria and the genera Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Butyrivibrio 2, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-011, identified as members of the Christensenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families (all within Fir-micutes), were positively correlated with markers of browning in either retroperitoneal WAT or perirenal WAT, and acetate was positively correlated with Ruminococcaceae UCG-011 and Butyrivibrio 2 and markers of browning in either retroperitoneal WAT or perirenal WAT. Overall, there are distinct relationships between the rumen microbiota, ruminal SCFAs and markers of WAT browning during the cold season in grazing Mongolian sheep.

AB  - Despite significant differences between men and women in the symptoms of PTSD and the response to therapeutic interventions, most PTSD studies have been done on male subjects. Continuing our previous study in male rats, this study aimed at better understanding the effect of a combination therapy of exercise with fluoxetine on female PTSD rats. The results were then compared with our past findings in male animals. Female adult Wistar rats subjected to PTSD were treated with moderate treadmill exercise or fluoxetine, or a combination of both. PTSD was induced by the single prolonged stress (SPS) model. Elevated plus-maze (EPM), serum and prefrontal BDNF, and fear extinctions were evaluated. The results showed that exercise plus fluoxetine decreased anxiety-like behavior, improved fear extinction, and increased BDNF changes in female rats. The effects of exercise alone were comparable with those of combination therapy except that combination therapy was more effective on OAT (open arm entry). The majority of results in female rats, except for those of prefrontal BDNF, 4th extinction, and OAT, were similar to those of male rats as shown in our previous study. According to our findings, exercise as a safe and cost-effective intervention can be considered as a complementary efficient option for PTSD treatment in both sexes. To achieve better treatment outcomes in PTSD patient, considering sex differences is recommended.

AB  - Archaeological findings from the Neolithic open-air location Ayakagytma 'The Site', situated in the south-eastern part of the Kyzyl-kum Desert in Uzbekistan, can potentially shed new light on the camel domestication process in the Central Asian drylands and help to connect it to regional changes of paleoclimate. Detailed analyses of composition and C-13 isotopic ratios of fatty acids performed on potsherds from an archaeological horizon of a Keltaminar culture dated at 3000-4000 cal BC combined with analogical analyses of modern camel and horse milk samples from Uzbekistan indicated a plausible possibility that camels were kept and milked by stockbreeders of Ayakagytma during this time period. The observed herding practices based almost exclusively on camel husbandry, as opposed to earlier more balanced herds of cattle, horses and camels, were probably an adaptation to climate transition from relatively humid to relatively dry, and the following changes in vegetation. Such climatic shift did not correspond with the general trend of Holocene moisture changes over the Westerlies-dominated Central Asia. However, it was in accordance with wet-to-dry climate transitions recorded in sediments of several lakes in the same region at around 4000 cal BP. The observed changes in Neolithic stockbreeding practices, as other inconsistencies in Holocene moisture evolution over a massive area of arid Central Asia, may have resulted from local manifestations of globally-forced climate changes and/or from local hydrographic alterations unrelated to paleoclimate.

AB  - Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.), a group of male ovoviviparous fish, are of high commercial value in traditional Chinese medicine and aquarium trades. The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), an easily domesticated species, was introduced to China and quickly became a popular farmed species to relieve the conflict between supply and demand. Although the sexual dimorphism in size and immunocompetence has been observed, the sex determination mechanism in the lined seahorse remains unclear. In the present study, we applied the 2b-RAD-seq approach for the first time to successfully identify 6 male-specific tags and 4 sex-specific SNP loci in the lined seahorse, which were further validated in 108 individuals by PCR amplification based on the flanking sequences of sex-specific markers. The male-specific tags and heterozygous SNP loci indicate that a male heterozygous XX/ XY sex-determination system is employed in the lined seahorse. Based on the annotation and analysis of the sex specific sequences, two sex-related candidate genes, lrriq1 and il34, were identified. The results provide novel insights into sex-determination mechanisms and promising methods for all-male breeding of Hippocampus erectus.

AB  - Seahorse is a specialized animal due to its male pregnant strategy in the brood pouch, which can evidently provide immune protection, nutrition, and osmoregulation to the offspring. Secretory phospholipase A2 group IB (sPLA2-IB), which encodes a secreted phospholipase A2 that functions for metabolic regulation and antibacterial defense, plays a vital role for immune regulation in teleost, but its potential immune functions in seahorse remain unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the characteristics and functional profiles of sPLA2-IBs in lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), which is one of the most important breeding seahorse species in the world. Results showed that most teleost species have only one sPLA2-IB gene, while the seahorses presented two tandem repetitive copies (sPLA2-IBa and sPLA2-IBb). This finding showed that the highest expression levels of sPLA2-IBs in seahorses were in the liver, and significant up-regulation could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly [I:C]), as well as the seahorse's common pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Interestingly, the expression levels of sPLA2-IBs in the brood pouch showed an upward trend during pregnancy, compared with that in non-pregnancy stage, and peaked in the late pregnancy stage, implying that seahorse sPLA2-IBs in brood pouch might function for immune defense during pregnancy. In addition, seahorse sPLA2-IBa was significantly highly expressed in early developing embryos in brood pouch, but sPLA2-IBb expression dramatically increased in new-born juveniles, which implies the functional divergence between the two sPLA2-IBs by different ontogenetic expression. In conclusion, this study indicated that seahorse sPLA2-IBs play an important role in the immunoprotection during male pregnancy, and functional co-option of seahorse sPLA2-IBs might be conducive to improving the survival rate of its offspring.

AB  - A novel pathogenic strain Vibrio 20190611023 was isolated from the hepatopancreas of moribund cultured Penaeus vannamei suffering from black gill disease. This strain was identified as V. brasiliensis based on the phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gene and five other housekeeping genes (i.e., gapA, ftsZ, mreB, topA and gyrB). Some biochemical features of this strain were determined with an API 20NE system, and its haemolytic activity was determined using a sheep blood agar plate. The pathogenicity of this isolate 20190611023 was confirmed by the experimental challenge tests and histopathological examinations. P. vannamei were challenged via reverse gavage with different doses of bacterial suspensions. The calculated median lethal dose (LD50) was (3.16 +/- 1.78) x 10(5) CFU/g (body weight). Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed, the results of which showed that the strain 20190611023 was sensitive to chloramphenicol, compound sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and oxacillin, but resistant to erythromycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, cefamezin and piperacillin. To our knowledge, this is the first report for demonstrating V. brasiliensis as a shrimp pathogen, which expands the host range of V. brasiliensis infection. The present study highlights that more attention should be paid to this novel pathogen in intensive shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion of swine manure (SM) and waste kitchen oil (WKO) was conducted to evaluate the effect of high organic loading rates (OLRs) on biogas production efficiency and microbial changes. Combinations of different loading rates of SM and WKO, with total OLRs from 2 to 8 g VS (volatile solid)/L/d, were evaluated in a laboratory-scale study. While feeding more than 4 g VSSM/L/d did not result in higher biogas production in both mono-and co-digestion scenarios, the addition of WKO increased the total OLR up to 6 g VS/L/d without sig-nificant reduction of system productivity. Biogas yields of M2O1 (2 g VSSM/L/d + 1 g VSWKO/L/d) and M4O2 were 910 +/- 35 and 849 +/- 85 mL/g VSfed which were 25.2 % and 16.9 % higher than the mono-digestion of M2, respectively. A significant increase of bacterial alpha-diversity (Shannon index) was observed in M2O1, at 233.0 +/- 3.6 compared with 218.7 +/- 5.1 of M2 (p < 0.05). Less bacterial alpha-diversity and accumulation of volatile fatty acids were observed in M4O1 and M4O2, suggesting their potential instability. When digesters were fed with M2, the introduction of 1.4 g VSWKO/L/d or more did not increase biogas yield and could cause system imbalance. The study suggests the limit of WKO could be increased when higher OLRs of SM were applied but should not be more than 4 g VSSM/L/d, and ratio between SM and WKO should be considered to avoid failure. Some of the system disturbances took up to three months to show.

AB  - Several biosafety gaps in agri-food sectors have become evident in recent years. Many of them are related to the global livestock systems and the organizational models involved in their management and organization. For example, producing pigs requires a global system of massive confinement and specific technological innovations related to animal production and health that involve broad technical and scientific structures, which are required to generate specific knowledge for successful management. This suggests the need for an underlying socially agglomerated technological ecosystem relevant for these issues. So, we propose the analysis of a specialized scientific social structure in terms of the knowledge and technologies required for pig production and health. The objective of this work is to characterize structural patterns in the research of the swine health sector worldwide. We use a mixed methodological approach, based on a social network approach, and obtained scientific information from 4868 specialized research works on health and pig production generated between 2010 to 2018, from 47 countries. It was possible to analyze swine research dynamics, such as convergence and influence, at country and regional levels, and identify differentiated behaviors and high centralization in scientific communities that have a worldwide impact in terms of achievements but also result in significant omissions.

AB  - Meat and dairy products in the food industry represent a significant portion of anthropogenic green house gas emissions. To meet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendations to limit global warming, these emissions should be reduced. Meat and dairy products are also responsible for the majority of our daily, vital, protein intake. Yet, meat and dairy products contain very different amounts of proteins, making it difficult in general to rationalize which protein source has the lowest carbon footprint. Here we present a practical and pedagogical review, comparing the carbon footprint of a variety of meat and dairy products with respect to their protein content. We investigate the carbon footprint of different dietary choices for several countries, by keeping the total number of meat and dairy proteins constant. Interestingly, we find that dairy-only diets are in general only a little less carbon intensive than current diets. However, 50% carbon footprint reduction may be obtained, throughout the world, with a "low CO2''-tailored diet including only small poultry, eggs and yogurt. Such a dietary pattern suggests easy to follow consumer guidelines for reduced carbon footprint. We report further on a number of consumer-oriented questions (local or imported? organic or not? cow or goat milk? hard or soft cheese?). Our methodology may be applied to broader questions, such as the carbon footprint of proteins in general (including fish and plant proteins). We hope our work will drive more studies focusing on consumer-oriented questions.

AB  - Goat cheese whey is a co-product that comes from goat cheese manufacture. Due to its high organic load, adequate treatment is necessary before its disposal. Additionally, the recent growing interest in caprine products, attributed to their specific nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics, such as the lower allergenicity of their proteins and higher content of oligosaccharides, compared with bovine products, made the recovery of goat cheese whey a challenge. In this study, an integrated process for the recovery of sweet goat whey components was carried out. It includes filtration, centrifugation and pasteurization, followed by sequential membrane processes, ultrafiltration/dilution, nanofiltration of ultrafiltration permeates in dilution mode and the concentration/dilution of nanofiltration retentates. Ultrafiltration was performed with membranes of 10 and 1 kDa. Membranes of 10 kDa have higher permeate fluxes and, in a single stage of dilution, allowed for better protein retention and higher lactose purity, with a separation factor of 14. The concentration of lactose by nanofiltration/dilution led to the retention of almost all the lactose in retentates and to a final permeate, whose application in cheese dairy plants will allow for the total recovery of whey. The application of this integrated process in small- or medium-sized goat cheese dairies can represent an important contribution to their sustainability.

AB  - Peppermint shrimp resembling Lysmata vittata, a species native to the Indo-West Pacific, were found in the lower Chesapeake Bay and adjacent coastal embayments in 2013, representing the first recorded introduction of this species in the northwestern Atlantic. Conflicting morphological descriptions, inconsistent morphological terminology, and limited molecular data (i.e., unresolved taxonomy), as well as the destruction of the type material of L. vittata, created uncertainty regarding proper identification. We provide the first phylogeny incorporating individuals from across the presumed native and introduced range of L. vittata. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicate L. vittata represents a species complex of two widely divergent groups: 1) "Bruce Type" with a uniramous dorsal antennule that agrees with A.J. redescription of L. vittata, and 2) "Rauli Type" with a one-article accessory branch on the dorsal antennule that agrees most closely with the junior synonym L. rauli. Given the taxonomic ambiguity surrounding L. vittata, we designate the individual used by A.J. Bruce to redescribe L. vittata and incorporated in our analyses as a neotype to fix the identity of this species. We therefore identify introduced North American and New Zealand populations as L. vittata sensu stricto and postulate that the native range spans temperate/subtropical East Asia. These data suggest that L. rauli is a valid species, which includes a possible undescribed sister species. We confirm the presence of L. californica in New Zealand, the first non-native record for this species. We also provide data suggesting L. dispar may be more widespread in the Indo-West Pacific than currently known and consider L. lipkei to be a likely junior synonym.

AB  - Shark-like rays (Order Rhinopristiformes) are among the most threatened families of marine fish, yet little is known about their populations. These rays are normally taken as opportunistic catch in fisheries targeting other species and are thus poorly reported. One exception is the Indonesian tangle net fishery, which targets shark-like rays. Market surveys of Muara Angke landing site in Jakarta, north-western Java were conducted between 2001 and 2005, and the landed catch from the tangle net fishery was recorded (the Muara Angke landing site includes landings from more than one fishery). In total, 1,559 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) were recorded, comprising 24 species of rays and nine species of sharks. The most abundant species landed were the pink whipray Pateobatis fai and the bottlenose wedgefish Rhynchobatus australiae, the latter being the main target species. Catch composition varied based on differences in species catchability and may also be indicative of localized declines. The fishery was highly selective for larger sized individuals, while smaller size classes of many ray species, including the target species, were also caught in other Indonesian fisheries, resulting in fishing pressure across all age classes. The decline of tangle net vessels in the fishery and the potential shift in catch composition in the Indonesian tangle net fishery increase concerns about the status of shark-like rays and stingrays in Indonesia.

AB  - More than 27,000 stomachs from 70 species of fish were collected from the Barents Sea in 2015. Quantitative stomach content expressed relative to the body weight of the predator fish (g g-1 as %) varied by four to five orders of magnitude for six species with the largest sample size (Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, long rough dab Hippoglossoides platessoides, polar cod Boreogadus saida, and Atlantic capelin Mallotus villosus). The quantitative stomach contents of individual fish followed a common and strict statistical relationship for predator species or groups of species (by families), and for prey categories across predator species. The common pattern was log-normal-like and was modelled with good fit by different types of right-skewed distributions, that is, variants of the Box-Cox, generalized inverse Gaussian, inverse gamma, or gamma distributions. The long tail in the high end reflects high variation with no clear sign of a plateau, as could be expected from the concept of a "full stomach". This is interpreted to reflect that high stomach contents are rare events that are sampled at low frequencies. The maximum recorded stomach content varied from 1% to 34% of body weight for 55 species of fish, being positively correlated (R2 = 0.45) with sample size. About a third of the stomachs were empty, and the low tail of the log-normal-like distribution represents the transition to empty stomachs. The amount of food in the stomachs was overall low compared to maximum values, with mean and median of 2.0% and 1.1%, respectively, for the 17,873 stomachs containing food. Supported by bioenergetic considerations, this suggests relatively low feeding rates of the various fish predators but sufficient to meet their energy demands.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute viral disease of sheep, goats, camels and some wild ruminant species. It is widespread in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where it causes heavy economic losses. The disease is currently targeted by the Global Eradication Program (PPR GEP), aimed at eradicating the disease by 2030. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) national animal health plan adopts mass vaccination to control and eradicate PPR from the country. In this study, using the historical and real-time animals' identification and registration data together with different PPR occurrence risk factors, a mathematical algorithm was developed to intellectually design and implement a PPR vaccination campaign in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The algorithm was capable of prioritizing animal holdings at risk of PPR infection to be targeted by vaccination, facilitated the mobilization of vaccination teams in the field and resulted in an increased vaccination coverage of the targeted livestock population in a short time. Such achievements will enhance the UAE national PPR eradication plan to be fulfilled.Abstract Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a contagious and economically important transboundary viral disease of small ruminants. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) national animal health plan aimed to control and eradicate PPR from the country by following the global PPR control and eradication strategy which adopts small ruminants' mass vaccination to eradicate the disease from the globe by 2030. A smart vaccination approach, which is less expensive and has longer-term sustainable benefits, is needed to accelerate the eradication of PPR. In this study, a mathematical algorithm was developed based on animals' identification and registration data, belonging to the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA), and other different parameters related to PPR risk occurrence. The latter included animal holding vaccination history, the number of animals per holding, forecasting of the number of animals and newborns per holding, the proximity of an animal holding to a PPR outbreak and the historical animal holding owner vaccination rejection attitude. The developed algorithm successfully prioritized animal holdings at risk of PPR infection within Abu Dhabi Emirate to be targeted by vaccination. This in turn facilitated the mobilization of field vaccination teams to target specific sheep and goat holdings to ensure the generation of immunity against the disease on a risk-based approach. The vaccination coverage of the targeted livestock population was increased to 86% and the vaccination rejection attitude was reduced by 35%. The duration of the vaccination campaign was reduced to 30 compared to 70 working days and hence can alleviate the depletion of human and logistic resources commonly used in classical mass vaccination campaigns. The results obtained from implementing the algorithm-based PPR vaccination campaign will reduce the negative impact of PPR on the UAE livestock sector and accelerate the achievement of the national PPR eradication plan requirements.

AB  - Restrictions on antibiotic growth promoters have prompted livestock producers to use alternative growth promoters, and dietary copper (Cu) supplementation is currently being widely used in pig production. However, elevated doses of dietary Cu constitute a risk for co-selection of antibiotic resistance and the risk may depend on the type of Cu-based feed additives being used. We here report the first controlled experiment investigating the impact of two contrasting Cu-based feed additives on the overall swine gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome. DNA was extracted from fecal samples (n = 96) collected at four time points during 116 days from 120 pigs allotted to three dietary treatments: control, divalent copper sulfate (CuSO4; 250 mu g Cu g(-1) feed), and monovalent copper oxide (Cu2O; 250 mu g Cu g(-1) feed). Bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were assessed, and bioavailable Cu ([Cu](bio)) was determined using whole-cell bacterial bioreporters. Cu supplementation to feed increased total Cu concentrations ([Cu](total)) and [Cu](bio) in feces 8-10 fold and at least 670-1000 fold, respectively, but with no significant differences between the two Cu sources. The swine gut microbiome harbored highly abundant and diverse ARGs and MGEs irrespective of the treatments throughout the experiment. Microbiomes differed significantly between pig growth stages and tended to converge over time, but only minor changes in the bacterial community composition and resistome could be linked to Cu supplementation. A significant correlation between bacterial community composition (i.e., bacterial taxa present) and ARG prevalence patterns were observed by Procrustes analysis. Overall, results of the experiment did not provide evidence for Cu-induced co-selection of ARGs or MGEs even at a Cu concentration level exceeding the maximal permitted level for pig diets in the EU (25 to 150 mu g Cu g(-1) feed depending on pig age).

KW  - GROWING-FINISHING PIGS
AB  - Effective pig farming relies on precise and adaptable animal identification methods, particularly in dynamic environments where new pigs are regularly added to the herd. However, pig face recognition is challenging due to high individual similarity, lighting variations, and occlusions. These factors hinder accurate identification and monitoring. To address these issues under Open-Set conditions, we propose a three-phase Pig Face Open-Set Recognition (PFOSR) system. In the Training Phase, we adopt a decoupled design, first training a YOLOv8-based pig face detection model on a small labeled dataset to automatically locate pig faces in raw images. We then refine a Vision Transformer (ViT) recognition model via a dual-loss strategy-combining Sub-center ArcFace and Center Loss-to enhance both inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. Next, in the Known Pig Registration Phase, we utilize the trained detection and recognition modules to extract representative embeddings from 56 identified pigs, storing these feature vectors in a Pig Face Feature Gallery. Finally, in the Unknown and Known Pig Recognition and Registration Phase, newly acquired pig images are processed through the same detection-recognition pipeline, and the resulting embeddings are compared against the gallery via cosine similarity. If the system classifies a pig as unknown, it dynamically assigns a new ID and updates the gallery without disrupting existing entries. Our system demonstrates strong Open-Set recognition, achieving an AUROC of 0.922, OSCR of 0.90, and F1-Open of 0.94. In the closed set, it attains a precision@1 of 0.97, NMI of 0.92, and mean average precision@R of 0.96. These results validate our approach as a scalable, efficient solution for managing dynamic farm environments with high recognition accuracy, even under challenging conditions.

AB  - Slurry storage is a significant source of NH3 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aim of this laboratory study was to assess the effects of different chemical additives and biochars on the emissions of NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4 during the short-term storage of pig slurry. The experiment was performed using Kilner jars filled with raw slurry as control and six treatment additives (5% w/w): acidified slurry, alkalinized slurry, neutralized slurry, agroforestry biochar, cardoon biochar, and elderberry biochar. The gas emissions were measured for 30 days, and the composition of the slurries was determined. During short-term storage, the results of this laboratory study indicated that the NH3 emissions were reduced by 58% by acidification and by 20% by the biochars (Agroforestry, Cardoon, and Elderberry treatments), while neutralization reduced this loss by only 12%. Nitrous oxide emissions were not reduced by the chemical additives (Acidified, Alkalinized, and Neutralized treatments), while this loss was increased by 12% by the biochars. Carbon dioxide, CH4, and global warming potential emissions were not affected by the chemical additives and biochars. Furthermore, the absence of differences between the biochars may be related to their similar composition. Regarding the influence of the studied additives on NH3 losses, it can be concluded that acidification was the best mitigation measure and the biochars were quite similar due to their composition. Furthermore, neutralization had the advantage of sanitizing the slurry, but only had a mild impact on NH3 preservation.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can threaten the clean production of rice owing to continuous selective pressure in heavy metal-antibiotic co-contaminated paddy soils. As an important soil carbon reservoir, the role of humic substances from different types of manure in the regulation of soil ARGs remains unclear. In this study, fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) were extracted from pig manure (PM), cow dung (CD), and chicken manure (CM). The influence of their characteristics and doses on the fate of ARGs was investigated in arsenic (As)- antibiotic co-contaminated paddy soils. The release of As and degradation of antibiotics were promoted in 1% PM-FA treatment, with increases of 4.8%-5.6% and 8.3%-8.8% compared with CM-FA and CD-FA treatments, respectively. The coexistence of FA/HA, Fe, As, and antibiotics in soil pore water affected the environmental behavior of ARGs, with FA showing a more positive effect. Species including Bacillus, Geobacter, Desulfitobacterium, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group were considered potential hosts of ARGs, and their resistance to cocontamination increased after the addition of FA. Membrane transport is a potential strategy for host bacteria of ARGs to cope with As-antibiotic complex pressure. These results demonstrate the coupling mechanisms of As, antibiotics, and ARGs regulated by different humic substances in co-contaminated paddy soils, which could support the clean production of rice in agricultural practice.

AB  - During infant feeding, the nipple is an important source of sensory information that affects motor outputs, including ones dealing with compression of the nipple, suction, milk bolus movement, and swallowing. Despite known differences in behavior across commercially available nipples, little is known about the in vivo effects of nipple property variation. Here we quantify the effect of differences in nipple stiffness and hole size on an easily measured metric representing infant feeding behavior: nipple compression. We bottle-fed 7-day old infant pigs (n = 6) on four custom fabricated silicone nipples. We recorded live X-ray fluoroscopic imaging data of feeding on nipples of two levels of hardness/stiffness and two hole sizes. We tested for differences in nipple compression at the nipple's maximum compression across different nipple types using a mixed model analysis of variance. Stiffer nipples and those with smaller holes were compressed less than compliant nipples and nipples with larger holes (p < 0.001). We also estimated the force applied on the nipple during feeding and found that more force was applied to the compliant nipple with disproportionately larger strains. Our results suggest that infant pigs' nipple compression depends on material type and hole size, which is likely detected by the infant pigs' initial assessment of compressibility and flow. By isolating nipple properties, we demonstrated a relationship between properties and suckling behavior. Our results suggest that sensory information affects feeding behaviors and may also inform clinical treatment of poor feeding performance.

AB  - Antarctic polynyas are persistent open water areas which enable early and large seasonal phytoplankton blooms. This high primary productivity, boosted by iron supply from coastal glaciers, attracts organisms from all trophic levels to form a rich and diverse community. How the ecological benefit of polynya productivity is translated to the highest trophic levels remains poorly resolved. We studied 119 southern elephant seals feeding over the Antarctic shelf and demonstrated that: (i) 96% of seals foraging here used polynyas, with individuals spending on average 62% of their time there; (ii) the seals exhibited more area-restricted search behaviour when in polynyas; and (iii) these seals gained more energy (indicated by increased buoyancy from greater fat stores) when inside polynyas. This higher-quality foraging existed even when ice was not present in the study area, indicating that these are important and predictable foraging grounds year-round. Despite these energetic advantages from using polynyas, not all the seals used them extensively. Factors other than food supply may influence an individual's choice in their use of feeding grounds, such as exposure to predation or the probability of being able to return to distant sub-Antarctic breeding sites.

AB  - Time spent assessing host plant quality during oviposition for phytophagous insects represents an energy-fitness tradeoff affecting future reproduction and offspring survival. In situations where resources are scarce or unattractive, organisms can utilize social information, including cues left behind by conspecific individuals, to inform decisions. In invertebrates, eggs deposited by previous females could signal a desirable resource, or alternatively females might avoid ovipositing near conspecific eggs to reduce offspring competition. Here, we show that monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) display the same pattern of oviposition across milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) stalks of differing quality, ignoring potential social cues and competition pressure imposed by conspecific eggs. Female monarchs preferentially laid eggs on healthy-looking, intact milkweed relative to water-stressed or herbivory-damaged stalks and exhibited differential post-alightment behavior on the three stalk types. Despite this apparent assessment of host plants for suitability, females failed to respond to social information in the form of conspecific eggs. Contrary to expectations that females would avoid healthy-looking, intact stalks with high egg numbers and prefer less desirable stalks with moderate egg numbers, the number of eggs laid by focal females did not depend on the number of prior conspecific eggs per stalk, regardless of stalk type. Our results suggest that monarchs neither avoid nor prefer stalks with conspecific eggs- perhaps due to low egg densities and larval survival in the wild, making discrimination based on conspecific eggs impractical when milkweed is abundant. Alternatively, egg clustering by females may be an adaptive oviposition strategy when host plant options are few, regardless of quality.

AB  - The Ramnad white sheep are farmed in state of Tamil Nadu, India, and are highly adapted to the ecological conditions, providing livelihood by way of meat, milk, skin, manure, etc., to thousands of rural landless laborers. Interdigital glands are special skin glands in sheep that play a crucial role in scent marking behavior and pheromone communication, as well as protecting the foot from UV-rays and fungal and bacterial infections. As there has not yet been research on the anatomy and histomorphology of these glands of this sheep breed, the present study examined the impact of sex and seasons on the morphology of the interdigital glands of Ramnad white sheep. A total of 40 interdigital glands were collected from male and female sheep from a slaughterhouse during breeding and non-breeding seasons for examination. Radiographic analysis revealed that the interdigital glands are located between the digits of both fore- and hind limbs, and shaped tobacco-pipe-like. In morphometric examination, the mean values of weight, length, and width of the gland varied significantly between male and female sheep. Histological analysis identified three distinct layers within the walls of the gland: (i) epidermis, consisting of keratinized squamous epithelium forming into stratum basale, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, etc.; (ii) dermis, consisting of sebaceous lobules, apocrine lobules, hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, etc.; and (iii) fibrous capsule, consisting of several parallel bundles of collagen fibers, nerve fibers, blood vessels, etc. Histochemical analysis revealed the sebaceous and apocrine secretions from this gland to react positively with alcian blue, periodic acid-Schiff, and Sudan black B, indicating the presence of glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, and lipoproteins, respectively. SEM analysis confirmed the interdigital gland to contain apocrine and sebaceous secretory components. Based on these anatomical, morphological and histological observations, we conclude that the Ramnad sheep possesses well-developed interdigital gland located on the corpus of the phalanx media between two toes in the fore- and hind feet, and contains apocrine and sebaceous secretory lobules.

AB  - Ensuring the well-being of animals during transport is becoming an increasingly important societal concern. The Australian livestock export industry recognises the need for comprehensive monitoring and reporting on animal welfare during sea transport. It is predicted that pen-side assessments of sheep can be used to monitor environmental conditions, resource access, and animal health and behavioural outcomes throughout a sea voyage. Pen-side assessments by observation are non-invasive and practical to apply in an industry setting. This study monitored sheep using a pilot list of welfare indicators during two sea voyages from Australia to the Middle East, in contrasting seasons. Sheep behaviour, environment and resources were recorded three times daily via pen-side observations of six pens of Merino wethers (castrated males), repeated over three decks for each voyage. Behavioural outcomes were examined for the effect of sampling frequency on group assessments. The number of behavioural measures were reduced via Principal Component (PC) analysis. The primary three PC factors were tested against the time of sampling and pen location after accounting for the effect of environmental- and resource-based predictor variables. PC 1 (24.0 % of the total variance) described activity levels, with sheep on Voyage B being more active in the morning and resting or recumbent in the middle of the afternoon and evening. PC 2 (14.7 %) reflected heat responses with the majority of the variation in these data accounted for by changes in Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and manure pad moisture. The heat responses described by PC 2 also varied by voyage day (p < 0.001) and time point (p < 0.001). PC 3 scores (9.5 %) reflected flight distances and feeding behaviour and strongly correlated to WBGT and pellet consumption per head per day. Feeding behaviour generally became more competitive, and flight distances reduced as both voyages progressed. Results indicate that a comprehensive welfare monitoring protocol requires repeated daily sampling throughout a voyage. The findings of this study are pertinent for developing a sampling strategy to assess sheep welfare during sea transport.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays a crucial role in many bioprocesses across species, but its function in granulosa cells during oocyte maturation is not well understood in animals, especially domestic animals. We observed an increase in m6A methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in granulosa cells during oocyte maturation in Haimen goats. Our results showed that knockdown of METTL3 disrupted the cell cycle in goat granulosa cells, leading to aggravated cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation and hormone secretion. Mechanistically, METTL3 may regulate the cell cycle in goat granulosa cells by mediating Aurora kinase B (AURKB) mRNA degradation in an m6A-YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) manner and participating in AURKB transcription via the Cyclin D1 (CCND1)-Retinoblastoma protein (RB)-E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) pathway. Overall, our study highlights the essential role of METTL3 in granulosa cells during oocyte maturation in Haimen goats. These findings provide a theoretical basis and technical means for understanding how RNA methylation participates in oocyte maturation through granulosa cells.

AB  - Secondary metabolites produced by primary producers have a wide range of functions as well as indirect effects outside the scope of their direct target. Research suggests that protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria influence grazing by herbivores and may also protect against parasites of cyanobacteria. In this study, we asked whether those same protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria could also influence the interactions of herbivores with their parasites. We used the Daphnia-Metschnikowia zooplankton host-fungal parasite system to address this question because it is well documented that cyanobacteria protease inhibitors suppress trypsin and chymotrypsin in the gut of Daphnia, and because it is known that Metschnikowia infects via the gut. We tested the hypothesis that Daphnia gut proteases are necessary for Metschnikowia spores to be released from their asci. We then also tested whether diets that decrease trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in the guts of Daphnia lead to lower levels of infection. Our results show that chymotrypsin promotes the release of the fungal spores from their asci. Moreover, a diet that strongly inhibited chymotrypsin activity in Daphnia decreased infection levels, particularly in the most susceptible Daphnia clones. Our results support the growing literature that cyanobacterial diets can be beneficial to zooplankton hosts when challenged by parasites and uncover a mechanism that contributes to the protective effect of cyanobacterial diets. Specifically, we demonstrate that host chymotrypsin enzymes promote the dehiscence of Metschnikowia spores; when cyanobacteria inhibit the activity of chymotrypsin in hosts, this most likely traps the spore inside the ascus, preventing the parasite from puncturing the gut and beginning the infection process. This study illustrates how secondary metabolites of phytoplankton can protect herbivores against their own enemies.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate non-genetic and genetic effects as well as heritabilities and repeatabilities for seven reproductive traits using phenotypic records from an experimental Kajli flock in Punjab, Pakistan. Phenotypic data comprised 2501 records of litter size at birth (LSB), cumulative litter weight at birth (LWB), and mean litter weight at birth/ lamb born (LMWB), 1657 records of litter size at weaning (LSW), cumulative litter weight at weaning (LWW), and mean litter weight at weaning/ lamb weaned (LMWW), and 1674 records of lambing interval (LI) from Kajli sheep housed at the Livestock experiment station Khushab from 2007 to 2018. Least squares procedures (SAS, 9.1) were used to assess the effect year of service (YOS), season of service (SOS), parity of dam, and breeding ram on the expression of all reproductive traits. A derivative free REML algorithm was used to estimate heritabilities and repeatabilities with software WOMBAT (R). The overall least squares means +/- standard error for LSB, LWB, LMWB, LSW, LWW, LMWW and LI were 1.19 +/- 0.03, 5.75 +/- 0.17 kg, 4.88 +/- 0.06 kg, 1.17 +/- 0.05, 20.77 +/- 0.91 kg, 17.87 +/- 0.57 kg, 330.69 +/- 20.48 days, respectively. The YOS had significant (p <= 0.01) impact on LSB, LWB, LMWB, LWW and LMWW. However, SOS did not affect any reproductive trait except for LI (p <= 0.01). Parity significantly affected LMWB (p<0.05) as well as LSB, LWB, LSW and LWW (p <= 0.01), but not LMWW and LI. Breeding ram influenced LSB, LSW and LWW significantly (p <= 0.01). Genetic parameter estimates were very low due to large values of environmental variances for all reproductive traits. Estimates of heritability were low for all traits (0.08 +/- 0.05, 0.01 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, 0.01 +/- 0.01, 0.04 +/- 0.03, 0.07 +/- 0.05 for LSB, LWB, LMWB, LSW, LWW and LMWW, respectively). The heritability for LI was zero. Repeatability estimates were also low for all traits (0.09 +/- 0.05, 0.02 +/- 0.02, 0.06 +/- 0.03, 0.02 +/- 0.01, 0.04 +/- 0.02, 0.09 +/- 0.06, 0.01 +/- 0.01 for LSB, LWB, LMWB, LSW, LWW, LMWW and LI, respectively). Regression of estimated breeding values for all reproductive traits on year of breeding yielded no significant genetic trends during the 12 years of the study.

AB  - The increasing volume of genome sequencing data presents challenges for traditional genome-wide prediction methods in handling large datasets. Machine learning (ML) techniques, which can process high-dimensional data, offer promising solutions. This study aimed to find a genome-wide prediction method for local pig breeds, using 10 datasets with varying SNP densities derived from imputed sequencing data of 515 Rongchang pigs and the Pig QTL database. Three reproduction traits-litter weight, total number of piglets born, and number of piglets born alive-were predicted using six traditional methods and five ML methods, including kernel ridge regression, random forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Adaboost. The methods' efficacy was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation and independent tests. The predictive performance of both traditional and ML methods initially increased with SNP density, peaking at 800-900 k SNPs. ML methods outperformed traditional ones, showing improvements of 0.4-4.1%. The integration of GWAS and the Pig QTL database enhanced ML robustness. ML models exhibited superior generalizability, with high correlation coefficients (0.935-0.998) between cross-validation and independent test results. GBDT and random forest showed high computational efficiency, making them promising methods for genomic prediction in livestock breeding.

AB  - Two wolf species reported from Pakistan include the grey wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) and the Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus chanco). Limited studies have focused on grey wolf ecology in the country, therefore, scientific data on the species' ecological parameters and conservation are scanty. The species is also facing persecution threat in response to depredation on livestock in many parts of the country. We investigated occurrence and diet composition of grey wolf in Deosai National Park, Pakistan to record how much proportion of its diet comprises of livestock, leading to human-wolf conflict. Field surveys were made on monthly basis from July 2018 to December 2019 for data collection. The distribution of the species was determined by surveying the potential habitats and recording its direct and indirect field signs (such as scats, pug marks, prey remains, hairs), while diet composition was investigated by using noninvasive technique of scat analysis. Results showed grey wolf being distributed at an elevation range of 3921 m to 4282 m above sea level (asl) in the park. Scat analysis showed 7 wild and 6 domestic prey species in its diet, with approximately 47 % contribution from livestock and 53 % from wild prey. Most frequently consumed domestic prey were donkey, yalk, goat and sheep, while among wild prey golden marmot (Marmota caudata), house mouse (Mus musculus), Palm Civet (Paguma larvata), Royel's Pika (Ochotona roylei) and markhor (Capra falconeri) were frequently consumed. Winter diet of grey wolf contained more proportion of livestock (59%) compared to wild prey (41%) whereas its summer diet contained more proportion of wild prey (53%). The grey wolf was found as one of the major predators in the study area mainly attacking donkeys, cows, sheep, and goats.

AB  - Seahorses are constantly endangered by harvesting for ornamental trade on the Brazilian coast. Information on the ecology and biology of these fish is essential for their conservation. We analyzed the feeding ecology of the seahorses Hippocampus patagonicus and H. reidi, caught as bycatch, on the coast of the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Their diet was analyzed through analysis of their alimentary canal contents. The specimens of H. patagonicus were obtained as bycatch of shrimp fishing in three regions of the state: southern (Angra-Parati), central (Niteri), and northern (Tamoios-Macae) regions. Hippocampus reidi specimens were captured in Sao Goncalo, inside the Guanabara Bay. We assessed differences in diet composition between sexes for both species, between regions only for H. patagonicus, and seasonal variation only for H. reidi. For this purpose, we analyzed the alimentary canal content of 204 individuals of H. patagonicus and 27 of H. reidi. We found that both species feed mainly on small benthic organisms, like crustaceans of the order Amphipoda. According to the PERMANOVA, no differences between sexes were found in both species. This analysis indicated significant differences in the diet of H. patagonicus between regions and seasonal differences for H. reidi. However, our results were inconclusive regarding this variation due to the high volume of highly digested food content. This study provides essential baseline information on the trophic ecology of the seahorses on the Rio de Janeiro coast, which can help to monitor the population of seahorses on sites where they are constantly threatened by harvesting and trade.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Caseous lymphadenitis is one of the main infectious problems affecting sheep rearing areas worldwide. In Morocco, sheep farming constitutes an important socioeconomic activity and is considered to be a source of income for the local rural population. However, breeders are facing considerable economic losses due to caseous lymphadenitis. This negative impact is mainly due to the low prices and limited saleability of sheep with superficial abscesses, particularly for religious celebrations. In the present study, investigations were realised at the flock and slaughterhouse levels to determine the prevalence and risk factors implicated in caseous lymphadenitis. As a result, the form of rearing management adopted was found to impact the dissemination of caseous lymphadenitis. In conclusion, improvement of ventilation in sheep barns and implementation of periodic control of abscess cases, including their treatment with adequate procedures, are a must. Two surveys were conducted to assess the prevalence and risk factors of ovine caseous lymphadenitis (CL) and explore the association between its superficial and visceral forms in Sardi sheep in Settat province, Morocco. A total of 1521 sheep, including 318 lambs < 6 months, 572 young sheep aged 6-24 months, and 631 adult sheep > 24 months, were examined from 57 flocks. Superficial CL prevalence levels were as follows: 69/318 in lambs, 292/572 in young sheep, and 114/631 in adult sheep. Additionally, 2124 sheep, including 1813 young and 311 adult sheep, were inspected in slaughterhouses ante- and post-mortem. Among all infected animals, the prevalence of visceral abscesses was notably higher in adult sheep (83%, OR = 9.8, 95% CI = 5.5-17.2) compared to young sheep (35%). Data on flock size, sex, age, body condition score, rearing methods, and hygienic measures were collected. Suspected CL cases were confirmed using quadruplex-PCR. Poor barn ventilation, lack of abscess control, and younger age were identified as key risk factors for CL. Additionally, a high percentage (89%) of animals with thoracic abscesses did not display superficial lesions. While age and abscess control have been reported in previous studies, barn ventilation appears to be a new, but important, risk factor. In conclusion, the identified risk factors in Settat province are linked to breeding management practices. Implementing regular abscess control measures and improving barn ventilation are essential for CL prevention.

AB  - Restoration of natural processes via the reintroduction of locally extinct species is a key component of the rewilding process. In Ireland, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), an indigenous medium-sized felid, is no longer extant, possibly due to increasing human pressures over the course of the Holocene. With increased afforestation levels and subsequent range expansion in the populations of both native and exotic deer species, the potential for the Irish landscape to support a viable lynx population was examined. Four sequential steps were undertaken: (1) identifying the extent of available habitat using GIS software, (2) assessing the connectivity between habitat patches using a least-cost path analysis, (3) estimating the number of lynx which could be supported by the available habitat, and (4) investigating the long-term viability of a reintroduced lynx population under differing scenarios, using Rangeshifter software. Overall, a total of 4,488 km(2) of suitable habitat was identified, spread between 4 habitat networks and 3 isolated patches. Under current habitat availability, a lynx population was found to have a low chance of persistence after 100 years under varying densities, with some improvement seen when habitat availability was increased. For Ireland to be capable of sustaining a viable population of lynx, there must be enhancement of both habitat availability and connectivity, through coherent landscape-scale woodland restoration. The results also highlight the importance of an evidence-based approach in species reintroduction planning, allowing for the likelihood of success to be rapidly quantified.

AB  - The tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), a Near-Threatened (NT) species endemic to China and Myanmar, requires robust genetic data for effective conservation. However, the genetic landscape of key populations, such as those in Chongqing, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the genetic diversity, population structure, gene flow, and demographic history of tufted deer across this critical region. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 46 non-invasively collected fecal samples from three distinct populations: Jinfo Mountain (JF, n = 13), Simian Mountain (SM, n = 21), and the Northeastern Mountainous region (NEM, n = 12). Genetic variation was assessed using the cytochrome b (Cyt b) and D-loop regions, with analyses including F-st, gene flow (N-m), neutrality tests, and Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSP). Our results revealed the highest genetic diversity in the SM population, establishing it as a genetic hub. In contrast, the JF population exhibited the lowest diversity and significant genetic differentiation (>0.23) from the SM and NEM populations, indicating profound isolation. Gene flow was substantial between SM and NEM but severely restricted for the JF population. Demographic analyses, including BSP, indicated a long history of demographic stability followed by a significant expansion beginning in the Middle to Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the SM/NEM metapopulation serves as the genetic core for the species in this region, while the highly isolated JF population constitutes a distinct and vulnerable Management Unit (MU). This historical demographic expansion is likely linked to climatic and environmental changes during the Pleistocene, rather than recent anthropogenic factors. These findings underscore the urgent need for a dual conservation strategy: targeted management for the isolated JF population and the establishment of ecological corridors to connect the Jinfo Mountain and Simian Mountain populations, ensuring the long-term persistence of this unique species.

AB  - Previous studies have found relatively high chlorinated paraffin (CP) concentrations in moose (Alces alces) compared with other wildlife from Scandinavia. To explore CP accumulation behaviors in this long-lived terrestrial mammal, temporal trends of muscle concentrations of CPs were first measured in samples collected over the past 40 years from moose calves from Grimso'', Sweden. The four CP classes, i.e., very-short chain, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain (LCCPs) classes, showed similar temporal trends, with increasing concentrations from 1982 to the 1990s, relatively high levels in two time periods around 1993 and 2008, and decreasing concentrations after 2012. A concentration plateau period was identified, and moose samples of both sexes and different ages from the median year (1993) of the concentration plateau period were selected for further analysis. CP levels increased exponentially with age in the male moose, while CP levels were found to exponentially decrease with age in females. LCCPs showed the slowest decreasing tendency with age in females compared with the other three classes, resulting in a general increase of the LCCP proportions with age. The sex-biased accumulation of CPs indicates additional stresses from these POP-like chemicals toward males of the largest and one of the most widespread terrestrial mammals in northern hemisphere forests.

AB  - This study assesses existing human-purpose underpasses below an unfenced high-traffic 4-lane highway in the Appalachian region of Quebec, Canada, as potential crossing structures for native mammal species. Eight underpasses of three types (five water culverts with minimum height and width of 1.8 m, one low-use gravel road byway, and two railroad underpasses) were continuously monitored by motion-detection infrared camera traps for time periods spanning up to 778 days (September 2016 to November 2018). We asked how the ratios of successful crossings through the structures (termed full crossings) and aversions to the structures (termed aversions) differed between species and we explored the influence of human activity levels on the use of these structures by wildlife. All monitored crossing structures had low human observations (with averages of less than 35 human activities per day). Our results provide evidence that 21 species of mammals in the study area successfully crossed through at least one of the eight observed underpasses on a minimum of one occasion. Some species were observed crossing through some of the underpasses on a regular basis, namely raccoon, red fox, and white-tailed deer. We propose a classification of mammal species into five human co-use classes (no or low co-use to very high co-use) to explore the relationship between mammal use of the structures and human presence. We found that humans and mammals were observed sharing passages for the four mammal species identified as tolerant of human co-use (high and very high co-use classes), but co-use was observed to be limited or not occurring for most other species. The strengths of this study include the length of time during which monitoring took place, as well as the placement of four cameras at each structure (two facing inward and two facing outward) to determine whether individuals successfully crossed through the structures or displayed avoidance behaviour. The results suggest select species of mammals show some co-use with humans at existing underpasses. The activity patterns of mammals documented over the two-year study can assist with future estimates of highway permeability. Further, measurements of human and mammal co-use have species-specific implications for retrofitting existing structures and constructing wildlife fences and purpose-built wildlife passages.

AB  - The moult in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) represents an especially energetically demanding period during which seals must maintain high skin temperature to facilitate complete replacement of body fur and upper dermis. In this study, heat flux from the body surface was measured on 18 moulting southern elephant seals to estimate metabolic heat loss in three different habitats (beach, wallow and vegetation). Temperature data loggers were also deployed on 10 southern elephant seals to monitor skin surface temperature. On average, heat loss of animals on the beach was greater than in wallows or vegetation, and greater in wallows than in vegetation. Heat loss across all habitats during the moult equated to 1.8 x resting metabolic rate (RMR). The greatest heat loss of animals was recorded in the beach habitat during the late moult, that represented 2.3 x RMR. Mass loss was 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg day-1, resulting in changes in body condition as the moult progressed. As body condition declined, skin surface temperature also decreased, suggesting that as animals approached the end of the moult blood flow to the skin surface was no longer required for hair growth.

AB  - We investigated the structural features of arterial blood vessels in yak uterine caruncle and the effects of the expression of vascular regulation-related factors on angiogenesis in pregnant and non-pregnant yak uterus. Three-dimensional specimens of the uterine artery of non-pregnant and pregnant yaks were produced to observe and measure the distribution characteristics and number of arterial vessels in the uterus and caruncle in the two periods. The uterine caruncle structure was observed and analysed by haematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression features of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the uterine caruncle were detected with immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The length and number of blood vessels in the caruncle were increased, the degree of curvature was decreased, and the folding was more complicated during pregnancy as compared with that during non-pregnancy. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated that VEGF and Ang-1 were mainly expressed strongly in the mucosal epithelial cytoplasm. The glandular lumen of the uterine gland, lymphocytes and the media and adventitia of blood vessels are widely distributed, and they are all positive. VEGF and Ang-1 mRNA and protein levels were highest in pregnancy, followed by that in the luteal phase and in the follicular phase, and three stages were significantly different (p < .05). These findings provide an anatomical reference and theoretical basis for improving the diagnosis and treatment of yak reproductive disorders and other diseases in high-altitude and low-oxygen environments.

AB  - Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV), a tick-borne flavivirus, is emerging in the United States. However, little work has assessed spatial distribution and infection prevalence and density of infected vector ticks in Pennsylvania (PA). Therefore, we conducted active surveillance for Ixodes scapularis in every PA county and screened for pathogen presence by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1,672 pools were assayed for 5,588 adult I. scapularis collected. We detected POWV/ DTV in three counties. Minimum infection rates (MIRs) ranged between 1.01 and 1.47%. Mean statewide MIR was 0.06% +/- 0.28%, well below infection estimates from more northern studies, suggesting a relatively more recent emergence of POWV/ DTV in PA. These data should help efforts to raise awareness among regional public health practitioners of POWV/DTV prevalence and distribution.

AB  - In this study, the main aim is to evaluate the mixing ratio of co-digestion of buffalo manure (BM) and excess sludge (ES) influenced for methane yield and digestate dewaterability. Five batch experiments with different BM and ES mixing ratios were carried out under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. The methane yield of co-digestion of BM and ES increased by 10.1-73.5% under thermophilic conditions and 87.9-153.3% under mesophilic conditions, compared with the mono-anaerobic digestion of ES under the same conditions. Shannon and Chao1 indices showed that the bacterial species of the mesophilic digesters were more abundant than that of the thermophilic digesters. With the increase in the BM proportion in the substrate, the normalized capillary suction time (NCST) and total solids (TS) of sediment (centrifugal dewatering) increased. The NCST at thermophilic temperature (8.98-12.54 s center dot g(-1)-TS) was greater than that at the mesophilic temperatures (5.45-12.32 s center dot g(-1)-TS). However, the TS of sediment was not directly related to the digestion temperature. This study has shown that anaerobic co-digestion of BM and ES at the appropriate ratio (BM/ES = 1:1.5) has a significant meaning in a high methane yield.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance (AMR) in animal agriculture represents a critical One Health challenge, with pig farms serving as major reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). While MGEs are known drivers of ARG dissemination, their impact on actual expression of resistance in these complex microbial communities is poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the contribution of MGE-associated ARGs to overall resistance expression and compare their transcriptional efficiency to chromosomally located ARGs in pig farm wastewater. Utilizing deep metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on wastewater from five typical Chinese pig farms, we comprehensively elucidated ARG presence, genetic context, host association, and transcriptional activity. We identified a vast dataset comprising 811 ARG types conferring resistance to 27 antibiotic classes, with 71.02 % actively transcribed, indicating significant resistance potential. MGEs were associated with 34.87 % of ARG-like ORFs. Crucially, MGE-associated ARGs were responsible for the majority (62.07 %) of total ARG transcript abundance, exhibiting an expression efficiency nearly 2.5 times higher than ARGs on chromosomal non-MGE loci. Taxonomic analysis revealed that these highly expressed MGE-associated ARGs were primarily hosted by genera known to include opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Klebsiella. Differential coverage binning further uncovered diverse draft genomes simultaneously harboring multiple highly expressed ARGs and MGEs, potentially contributing to the persistence and spread of highly resistant bacterial strains. Our findings underscore that MGEs not only propagate ARGs but critically enhance their expression, providing vital data for effective AMR surveillance and mitigation strategies within the One Health framework.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the way we determine the antibody repertoires encoded by B cells in the blood or lymphoid organs and transformed our understanding of adaptive immune responses in many species. Sheep (Ovis aries) have been widely used as a host for therapeutic antibody production since the early 1980s, however, little is known about their immune repertoires or immunological processes affecting the antibody generation. The objective of this study was to employ NGS for a comprehensive analysis of immuno-globulin heavy and light chain repertoires in four healthy sheep. We obtained > 90 % complete antibody se-quences and nearly 130,000, 48,000 and 218,000 unique CDR3 reads for the heavy chain (IGH), kappa chain (IGK), and lambda chain (IGL) loci, respectively. Consistent with other species, we observed biased usage of germline variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes in the heavy and kappa loci, but not in the lambda loci. Moreover, the enormous diversity of CDR3 sequences was observed through sequence clustering and convergent recombination. These data will build a foundation for future studies investigating immune repertoires in health and disease as well as contribute to further refinement of ovine-derived therapeutic antibody drugs.

AB  - Ranging behaviors performed by animals are influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. For herbivorous mammals, seasonality in forage production is considered to be the main driver of movement patterns. Here, we investigated the home range and movement of one of the most abundant herbivores in the Americas and their relationship with plant phenology in an Amazon igapo - a seasonally flooded riverine forest with strongly pulsed leaf production phenology. Using a combination of telemetry and phenological analysis, the study recorded movement patterns of five brown-throated three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus Schinz, 1825) over a 6-month period and related these to seasonal and within-forest differences in food availability through monitoring young leaf production of 570 trees. All monitored animals were shown to be permanently resident within the igapo flooded forest, maintaining their home range even during flood periods when most trees lacked leaves. We found that seasonal variation in leaf production had no effect on the extent of displacement of the sloths. Accordingly, for herbivores with low metabolism, variation in young leaf availability may not be the main driver of their ranging behavior. In addition, an arboreal habit and well-developed swimming capacity allow igapo sloths to occupy a niche ecologically inaccessible to other mammals.

AB  - Desilicification and allitization is important characteristic of acidic soil. While decrease in soil silicon (Si) may generate Si limitation, the increase of aluminum (Al) will aggravate soil acidification. Biochar has been used in acid soil improvement, which could mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and alter soil Si and Al concentration. However, the effect of biochar with different Si and Al concentration on greenhouse gas emissions remains unclear. We evaluated the effects of biochar derived from feedstock with different Si (moso bamboo leaves, BL; rice straw, RS) and Al (Camellia oleifera fruit shell, CFS; C. oleifera leaves, CL) concentration on greenhouse gas emissions and soil acidification. Microbial functional gene abundance associated with N2O emissions were measured to further explore the response of microbiological community. The results showed that BL, RS, CFS and CL significantly increased soil pH (by 19.2%, 16.7%, 18.7% and 24.9%, respectively), decreased soil exchangeable acid and exchangeable Al content, and reduced N2O emission rate of soil with nitrogen (N) (by 14.2%, 27.3%, 25.6% and 38.7%, respectively), which correlated with increase in soil nosZ abundance. BL, RS, CFS and CL increased soil nirK (by 325.6%, 66.7%, 155.8%, and 253.2%, respectively) and nosZ (by 198.6%, 174.1%, 72.2%, and 152.0%, respectively) abundance with N. Structural equation model showed that Si input via biochar application directly reduced N2O emissions, and soil acid-extractable Si is inversely proportional to N2O emission rate. In addition, Si input reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions via indirect effects. Al input via biochar addition indirectly affected N2O and CO2 emissions through mainly indirect effects on other soil factors. In intensive management and production activities, Si-rich biochar can be considered instead of sole addition as fertilizer, which will be beneficial to the sustainable development of agricultural and forestry production in acid soil areas, and mitigation of global change.

AB  - Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), is widely consumed as a vegetable in many parts of the world and also touted for many health benefits. Although the nutritional value has been known and medicinal value purported for years, research findings are scarce on its value to ruminants. This study evaluated the hematological and gut health benefits of supplementing pelleted stinging nettle to pastured yearling goats for twelve weeks. Overall health, hematocrit, total serum protein, and anemia scores using (FAffa MAlan CHArt) FAMACHA (c) scoring system were evaluated. Total gut parasite load was determined by both fecal egg count and molecularly using a PCR protocol. Total fecal Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp were also determined molecularly. Overall, pelleted stinging nettle was highly palatable to goats and no negative health effects were detected in supplemented goats. Nettle supplemented goats exhibited significantly increased hematocrit, FAMACHA (c) scores, and decreased total parasite load. A significant decrease in total gut E. coli in the supplemented goats was also detected. The Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp counts were very low in all goats irrespective of treatment group. These findings indicate potential of stinging nettle pellets in circumventing the negative health impacts of Hemonchus contortus and other gut parasites while reducing the potential gut microbial pathogen loads. Thus stinging nettle seems a good candidate for further research on potential use as a bioactive feed supplement for ruminants.

AB  - Many studies have inferred the way in which natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow shape the population genetic structures, but very few have quantified the population differentiation under spatially and temporally varying levels of selection pressure, population fluctuation and gene flow. In Nara Park (6.6 km(2)), central Japan, where several hundred sika deer (Cervus nippon) have been protected for more than 1,200 years, heavily- or moderately-haired nettle (Urtica thunbergiana) populations have evolved probably in response to intense deer browsing. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of two Nara Park populations and five surrounding populations using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. A total of 546 marker loci were genotyped from 210 individuals. A Bayesian method estimated 5.5% of these loci to be outliers, which are putatively under natural selection. Neighbour-joining, principal coordinates and Bayesian clustering analyses using all-loci, non-outlier loci and outlier loci datasets showed that the Nara Park populations formed a cluster distinct from the surroundings. These results indicate the genome-wide differentiation of the Nara Park populations from the surroundings. Moreover, these imply the following: (1) gene flow is limited between these populations and thus genetic drift is a major factor causing the differentiation; and (2) natural selection imposed by intense deer browsing has contributed to some extent to the differentiation. In conclusion, sika deer seems to have counteracted genetic drift to drive the genetic differentiation of hairy nettles in Nara Park. This study suggests that a single herbivore species could lead to genetic differentiation among plant populations.

AB  - Rodents can influence the succession and assembly of plant communities by preying on and dispersing seeds. Using a seed tray experiment with three common seeds, American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), we assessed factors that influence seed selection and foraging time of three rodents: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). All three rodents preferred beech seeds, likely due to its large size and high lipid content. However, when beech availability was low, secondary seed selection differed by rodent species with P. maniculatus equally selecting hemlock and red maple, P. leucopus preferring hemlock, and M. gapperi preferring red maple. Red maple seeds contained high levels of phenolic compounds, which hinder digestion, and the elongated cecum of M. gapperi may allow for better processing of these compounds relative to Peromyscus. Beech seeds were nearly always removed from trays intact, suggesting rodents could be important dispersers compared to the small-seeded species, which were generally processed on trays. The influence of environmental factors on seed selection was only notable when beech seed availability was low. Beech seed availability was also the primary factor influencing foraging time on trays, with individuals increasing foraging time as beech availability decreased. Consistent with predator avoidance behaviors, denser shrub cover increased foraging time for P. maniculatus, whereas moon luminosity decreased foraging for all three species. Our findings underscore that seed quality drives seed selection but that preferences are context dependent, varying with seed availability and digestive capacity.

AB  - While ants are dominant consumers in terrestrial habitats, only the leafcutters practice herbivory. Leafcutters do this by provisioning a fungal cultivar (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus) with freshly cut plant fragments and harnessing its metabolic machinery to convert plant mulch into edible fungal tissue (hyphae and swollen hyphal cells called gongylidia). The cultivar is known to degrade cellulose, but whether it assimilates this ubiquitous but recalcitrant molecule into its nutritional reward structures is unknown. We use in vitro experiments with isotopically labelled cellulose to show that fungal cultures from an Atta colombica leafcutter colony convert cellulose-derived carbon into gongylidia, even when potential bacterial symbionts are excluded. A laboratory feeding experiment showed that cellulose assimilation also occurs in vivo in A. colombica colonies. Analyses of publicly available transcriptomic data further identified a complete, constitutively expressed, cellulose-degradation pathway in the fungal cultivar. Confirming leafcutters use cellulose as a food source sheds light on the eco-evolutionary success of these important herbivores.

AB  - Psychometric studies reveal a variability that ranges between 30 and 75 % for different cognitive processes, both in humans and non-human animals. This variability has been ascribed to a "general intelligence" factor ( g ). Current studies implemented in non-human animals to identify individual differences in cognitive skills are still far from those applied in humans. We tested for cognitive performance in a fallow deer herd using a test battery of eight tasks based on measures for cognitive development in untamed confined wild animals: motor control, spatial memory, colour and tone discrimination and inversion, inhibitory control and symbol discrimination tests. g factor explained 60 % of the variability in cognitive performance. Significant correlations, both positive and negative, were found between the different cognitive processes studied. Likewise, the cognitive performance of the group was affected by a "collective intelligence" factor ( c ), inferred through variables describing the hierarchical structure of the studied population but which, however does not affect individual intelligence quotient of the members of the group.

AB  - Simple Summary As a member of the bone morphogenetic protein families (BMPs), BMP6 is a key regulatory factor in the ovaries. It is expressed in the ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of different species and plays an important regulatory role in follicular growth and development. Moreover, the steroid hormones secreted by ovarian granulosa cells are involved in important physiological processes such as follicle development, ovulation, and embryo implantation. However, the role of BMP6 in steroid hormone synthesis in goat ovarian GCs remains unclear. We aimed to examine the effects of BMP6 on the function of goat ovarian GCs. The results showed that BMP6 did not significantly affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of ovarian GCs but it up-regulated the expression of the steroid hormone synthesis rate-limiting enzymes CYP19A1 and CYP11A1 to promote the production of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). This finding provides a new idea for the study of steroid hormone synthesis in follicles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BMP6 on the function of goat ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). The results showed that the exogenous addition of BMP6 did not affect the EdU-positive ratio of ovarian GCs and had no significant effect on the mRNA and protein expression levels of the proliferation-related gene PCNA (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, BMP6 had no significant effect on the cycle phase distribution of GCs but increased the mRNA expression of CDK4 (p < 0.05) and CCND1 (p < 0.01) and decreased the mRNA expression of CCNE1 (p < 0.01). Moreover, BMP6 had no significant effect on the apoptosis rate of GCs and did not affect the mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes BAX, BCL2, and Caspase3 (p > 0.05). Importantly, BMP6 upregulated the secretion of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in ovarian GCs (p < 0.01). Further studies found that BMP6 inhibited the mRNA expression of 3 beta-HSD and steroid synthesis acute regulator (StAR) but significantly promoted the mRNA expression of the E2 synthesis rate-limiting enzyme CYP19A1 and the P4 synthesis rate-limiting enzyme CYP11A1 (p < 0.01). Taken together, these results showed that the exogenous addition of BMP6 did not affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of goat ovarian GCs but promoted the secretion of E2 and progesterone P4 in ovarian GCs by upregulating the mRNA expressions of CYP19A1 and CYP11A1.

AB  - Chile has about 72 species of terrestrial orchids, most of them endemic. Some are threatened due to habitat loss, fires and herbivores damage and many have potential as ornamental plants or cut flowers. In vitro plant germination could be a key strategy for the long-term conservation and propagation of these species. In vitro asymbiotic and symbiotic, germination and subsequent embryo development in the orchid Chloraea longipetala were evaluated using five different culture media, aiming to provide efficient protocols for its propagation. For asymbiotic germination, we used water agar (AW), banana culture medium (CMB), tomato culture medium (CMT), oatmeal agar (OMA) and Malmgren terrestrial orchid medium (MM). For symbiotic germination, just AW and OMA were used. In addition, seed viability was estimated and reached 86.6 %. After four weeks, in all media except AW, the germination stage (embryo emerges from seed coat) was reached, for asymbiotic germination. However, there were no significant differences in the germination percentage among all five media, not exceeding 10 % in any treatment. After eight weeks, only seeds in MM reached the protocorm stage. On the other hand, symbiotic germination resulted in a significantly higher germination percentage (40 %), and embryos reached the rhizoid stage. For C. longipetala, unlike other Chilean species, the presence of orchidiod fungi seems to be necessary for successful and efficient germination and embryo development. This information is key for future propagation initiatives, for conservation, restoration or commercial applications as ornamental plants.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) is a significant factor that adversely affects the health, welfare, and productivity of domestic animals, particularly impacting embryo implantation rates. However, the effects of HS on endometrial function during the peri-implantation period in Hainan black goats remain unclear. This study explores the influence of HS on the endometrium of these goats. We collected uterine tissue samples from both control and heat-stressed goats and performed in vitro experiments using a 2 x 2 factorial design. This design included two temperature conditions (37 degrees C as the control and 42 degrees C to simulate heat stress) and two pharmacological treatments: chloroquine (CQ), an autophagy inhibitor, and rapamycin (RAPA), an autophagy activator. Our results showed that heat stress initially suppresses autophagy activity, which is subsequently enhanced with prolonged exposure. The pharmacologic modulation of autophagy, through activation or inhibition, resulted in corresponding upregulation or downregulation of the endometrial epithelial cells' (EECs) receptivity markers. The overexpression of ATG7 partially reversed the HS-induced downregulation of these markers. Additionally, TJP1, a tight-junction marker, was degraded under the pharmacologic and genetic activation of autophagy in HS conditions but accumulated more in the EECs pre-treated with CQ. These findings suggest that autophagy plays a protective role in maintaining endometrial function under HS conditions in Hainan black goats. This study offers valuable insights into the role of autophagy in endometrial receptivity and proposes a potential strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of HS on goat reproduction.

AB  - The expansion of the world 's merchant fleet poses a great threat to the ocean 's biodiversity. Collisions between ships and marine megafauna can have population-level consequences for vulnerable species. The Endangered whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) shares a circumglobal distribution with this expanding fleet and tracking of movement pathways has shown that large vessel collisions pose a major threat to the species. However, it is not yet known whether they are also at risk within aggregation sites, where up to 400 individuals can gather to feed on seasonal bursts of planktonic productivity. These "constellation " sites are of significant ecological, socioeconomic and cultural value. Here, through expert elicitation, we gathered information from most known constellation sites for this species across the world ( >50 constellations and >13,000 individual whale sharks). We defined the spatial boundaries of these sites and their overlap with shipping traffic. Sites were then ranked based on relative levels of potential collision danger posed to whale sharks in the area. Our results showed that researchers and resource managers may underestimate the threat posed by large ship collisions due to a lack of direct evidence, such as injuries or witness accounts, which are available for other, sub-lethal threat categories. We found that constellations in the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of California, and Southeast and East Asia, had the greatest level of collision threat. We also identified 39 sites where peaks in shipping activity coincided with peak seasonal occurrences of whale sharks, sometimes across several months. Simulated collision mitigation options estimated potentially minimal impact to industry, as most whale shark core habitat areas were small. Given the threat posed by vessel collisions, a coordinated, multi-national approach to mitigation is needed within priority whale shark habitats to ensure collision protection for the species.

AB  - The presence of hemoglobin beta mRNA and protein in the female gonad suggests that hemoglobin beta may be present in the male gonad as well. The frequent occurrence of hemoglobin beta in nonerythroid tissues with hypoxic environments further underscores a potential role for hemoglobin beta in the testis to facilitate the regulation of oxygen availability for the developing germ cells and Sertoli cells since they are separated from the blood supply by multiple tissues. The presence of mRNA and protein were evaluated by qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The mRNA and protein for hemoglobin were detected in juvenile and postpuberal porcine testes. The most intense immunolabelling for the protein was present in testicular interstitial cells, in contrast to previously reported ovarian labelling in close proximity to the gamete and observed in porcine ovaries in the current study. The observed decrease in mRNA expression of hemoglobin beta with age is probably due to the change in testicular composition (increase in seminiferous tubule compartment) with age. The localization of hemoglobin beta in the testis will contribute to future understanding of its potential function in facilitating oxygen availability to seminiferous tubules or reducing oxidative damage.

AB  - Translation, plays a critical regulatory role in follicular development, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation and degeneration in the ovaries. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of reproductive regulation at the translation level in yaks, the present study analyzed gene expression changes in the ovarian tissues of yaks in different reproductive stages by using ribosome profiling and integrating RNA sequencing data. The small open reading frames (sORFs) of the ovarian tissue were characterized, and the effect of the translation efficiency of the targeted genes on their sequence features was determined. The results showed that over 80% of genes in the two groups exhibited inconsistent changes in their expression at the transcription and translation levels; this finding indicated that the changes in gene expression at both levels were not merely synergistic. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes were enriched in various pathways, including PI3K-Akt, MAPK, calcium signaling, and ovarian steroidogenesis. Further investigations showed that some genes related to ovarian function displayed inconsistent changes in their expression at both transcription and translation levels and exhibited dynamic changes in translation activity, including PALB2, BMP7, PIK3R2, and WNT2B. Additionally, we identified 66 predicted translatable sORFs and assessed the impact of upstream ORFs on the translation efficiency of downstream major ORFs. The present study systematically revealed the characteristics of gene expression at the translational level in yak ovarian tissues in different reproductive stages for the first time and provided a new perspective for in-depth understanding of the physiological mechanisms of yak reproduction.

AB  - Among the various plant-animal antagonistic interactions, florivory stands out due to its numerous direct and indirect negative effects on plant reproduction. However, some interfaces of this relationship are still poorly understood, especially which floral traits of certain species are affected by florivory. This study aimed to delimit the florivore guild of Senna aversiflora (Herb.) H. S. Irwin & Barneby and examine the natural patterns of florivory and the possible floral traits that influence florivory in the species. We evaluated seventeen flowering individuals of S. aversiflora, considering the floral development stage, floral display, and floral whorls, besides the corolla size. Florivorous organisms included individuals of the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Blattodea, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. Floral display positively affected the number of flowers and buds damaged by florivory. On the other hand, florivores showed no preference for a particular floral development stage. The gynoecium was the least consumed whorl. In the corolla, damage was caused continuously and discontinuously at the base and apex of the petals. Corolla size had no relation with the proportions of florivory in the whorls, the locations of the damage in the petals, forms of florivory, and the amount of tissue consumed in the petals. We conclude that some traits such as floral development stage and corolla size do not determine florivory in S. aversiflora, but floral display and floral whorls were traits that responded to the pressure by florivores on S. aversiflora and allowed us to gather relevant information about the ecological relationship between this species and its florivores.

AB  - Models of migratory behavior predict trade-offs between fitness costs and benefits with respect to migration distance. Shorter migration distances may confer a fitness benefit by facilitating earlier breeding, however this is rarely investigated. We tested this hypothesis using a large-scale geolocation (GLS) dataset from 109 rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), a differentially migrating seabird, that was tagged at 12 breeding colonies along the Pacific Coast of North America, spanning southern California to the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Using GLS-based position estimates, we determined the geographic centroid of the pelagic areas occupied by birds in winter (1 January-28 February) and then calculated the distance between their wintering centroids and colony of origin. We then used GLS light-intensity and salt-water immersion (wet/dry) data to determine each individual's date of egg-laying the following spring. Rhinoceros auklets were very widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean in winter. Among all individuals, the distance between winter centroids and breeding colonies ranged from < 100 to > 2500 km, being greater among individuals originating from colonies at higher latitudes. As predicted, migration distance and colony latitude were positively related to lay date: after accounting for colony-level differences in phenology, individuals that migrated shorter distances tended to lay their eggs earlier, a pattern that emerged across all populations. Our study links the migration distance of rhinoceros auklets to a fitness-related outcome, underscoring the selective pressure that migration exerts on subsequent breeding activity.

AB  - Successful implementation of conservation programs for endangered species requires biological material for use in reproductive biotechnologies. This enhances reproductive efficiency and helps increase the populations of critically endangered species. One way to facilitate the exchange of genetics between captive and free-ranging animals is through the creation of cryogenic banks that store cryopreserved gametes. In particular, semen cryopreservation allows for this exchange to occur. We evaluated whether the use of exogenous hormones (such as oxytocin and prostaglandin) prior to electroejaculation increases seminal volume, sperm concentration, and the number of doses produced in the red brocket deer (Mazama rufa). We also evaluate whether seminal parameters vary over the three stimulation cycles of the same electroejaculation procedure. The treatments did not affect ejaculate volume (p = 0.402), the number of sperm cells in the ejaculates (p = 0.926), total doses produced (p = 0.684), sperm mass movement (p = 0.229), sperm cell concentration (p = 0.106), and acrosome integrity (p = 0.210). The use of hormones has potential in reducing the need for stressful stimuli in electroejaculation, but the choice of hormones must take into account their effects on semen quality.

AB  - Understanding factors affecting social interactions among animals is important for applied animal behavior research. Thus, there is a need to elicit statistical models to analyze data collected from pairwise behavioral interactions. In this study, we propose treating social interaction data as dyadic observations and propose a statistical model for their analysis. We performed posterior predictive checks of the model through different validation strategies: stratified 5-fold random cross-validation, block-by-social-group cross-validation, and block -by-focal-animals validation. The proposed model was applied to a pig behavior dataset collected from 797 growing pigs freshly remixed into 59 social groups that resulted in 10,032 records of directional dyadic in-teractions. The response variable was the duration in seconds that each animal spent delivering attacks on another group mate. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted. Fixed effects included sex, individual weight, prior nursery mate experience, and prior littermate experience of the two pigs in the dyad. Random effects included aggressor, recipient, dyad, and social group. A Bayesian framework was utilized for parameter esti-mation and posterior predictive model checking. Prior nursery mate experience was the only significant fixed effect. In addition, a weak but significant correlation between the random aggressor effect and the random recipient effect was obtained when analyzing the attacking duration. The predictive performance of the model varied depending on the validation strategy, with substantially lower performance from the block-by-social -group strategy than other validation strategies. Collectively, this paper demonstrates a statistical model to analyze interactive animal behaviors, particularly dyadic interactions.

AB  - Key Message The patterns of induced chemical defences in Quercus ilex leaves are specific to the biotic stress factor that causes them. Interactive effects between stressors depend on provenance. Quercus forests are suffering serious decline worldwide, closely linked to the consequences of climate change. The increase of biotic stressors threatens the survival of the holm oak (Quercus ilex), a dominant tree species in the Mediterranean Basin. A better understanding of its resistance mechanisms is urgently required to enable a better control of its decline. In this work, the ability of holm oaks from six Iberian provenances to respond to multiple biotic damage is studied through an analysis of their induced chemical defence patterns. Using 2016 seedlings established in a common garden trial (6 regions x 12 families/region x 7 seedlings/family x 4 treatments), biotic damage was induced at the root level (by infection with the widespread pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi) and at the above-ground level (by mechanical defoliation). The levels of constitutive and induced total phenols, total tannins and condensed tannins were measured. Results showed that (1) the defensive chemical patterns present significant local and geographical variation, (2) survival to stress is more related to constitutive defences than induced ones, (3) the induced response is stressor-specific, and (4) there is an interactive effect amongst stressors whose sign (induction/inhibition) depends on the provenance. These findings on biotic stressor effects on the chemical defences and survival of holm oak can contribute to the development of genetic material selection programs in the integrated control of the widespread decline of Quercus.

AB  - Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs), an important type of ovarian somatic cells, carries out various functions related to oogenesis, follicular development, and steroidogenesis. Studying the biological mechanisms involved in the development and function of CGCs makes a great contribution to understanding the reproductive regulation in female animals. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is an important Ca2 thorn -regulated glycoprotein hormone that exhibits high expression levels in ovaries. In this study, we cloned the coding sequence of the yak STC1, predicted the structure of STC1 protein, detected the expression and localization of STC1 in yak ovaries, and analyzed the functions of STC1 in yak CGCs. The CDS (coding sequence) region of yak STC1 gene was found to be 744 bp and encoded 247 amino acids. Homology comparison revealed that STC1 protein was highly conserved among mammals. The STC1 mRNA displayed dynamic expression profiles in different stages of yak ovaries, and the highest expression was found in the follicular phase. Regarding localization, STC1 protein was widely distributed in various kinds of yak ovarian cells, including oocytes, mural granulosa cells, CGCs, and thecal cells. Repressing the expression of STC1 resulted in defective proliferation and survival of yak CGCs. In addition, knockdown the expression of STC1 repressed the secretion of progesterone and promoted the secretion of estrogen. Overexpression of STC1 partially rescued the proliferation of CGCs and resulted in opposite effects on the secretion of progesterone and estrogen. Several apoptosis and steroidogenesis-related genes, including BAX, BCL2, HSD3B1, HSD17B1, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 showed altered expressions after repressing or increasing the expression of STC1 in yak CGCs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on the role of STC1 in yak CGCs, and the outcomes offer fresh insights into the mechanism governing yak reproduction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hyperactive orbitofrontal cortical activation is commonly seen in patients of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies from our laboratory showed that for rats with aberrant activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during the extinction phase, they were unable to use contexts as the reference for proper retrieval of fear memory during renewal test. This result supported the phenomenon that many OCD patients show poor regulation of fear-related behavior. Since there are robust anatomical connections of the OFC with the fearcircuit, we aim to further examine whether the OFC is actively engaged in fear regulation under normal circumstances. In this study, the lateral or medial OFC was inactivated during the extinction phase using the ABA fear renewal procedure. We found that these animals showed intact fear renewal during retrieval test with their freezing levels equivalent to the control rats, revealing that the OFC did not have decisive roles in extinction acquisition. Together with our previous study, we suggest that the OFC only interferes with fear regulation when it becomes pathophysiologically hyperactive.

AB  - Herbivorous mammals have evolved symbiotic relationships with ciliates, either as mutualists or as parasites. Here, we investigate the ecological roles and metabolic impacts of ciliates across different gastrointestinal environments (rumen, caecum, and large intestine) through a functional genomic analysis. Functional analysis revealed that most rumen and caecum ciliates shared similar metabolic profiles, whereas the parasitic Balantioides coli displayed genes associated with energy metabolism and pathogenicity, suggesting a shift from mutualism to parasitism. Carbohydrate-active enzyme profiling showed rumen ciliates to be more metabolically diverse, supporting niche partitioning, enhancing ecological balance in the rumen environment.

AB  - Methods for collecting animal behaviour data in natural environments, such as direct observation and biologging, are typically limited in spatiotemporal resolution, the number of animals that can be observed and information about animals' social and physical environments. Video imagery can capture rich information about animals and their environments, but image-based approaches are often impractical due to the challenges of processing large and complex multi-image datasets and transforming resulting data, such as animals' locations, into geographical coordinates. We demonstrate a new system for studying behaviour in the wild that uses drone-recorded videos and computer vision approaches to automatically track the location and body posture of free-roaming animals in georeferenced coordinates with high spatiotemporal resolution embedded in contemporaneous 3D landscape models of the surrounding area. We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group-living African ungulates. We demonstrate how to track multiple animals simultaneously, classify individuals by species and age-sex class, estimate individuals' body postures (poses) and extract environmental features, including topography of the landscape and animal trails. By quantifying animal movement and posture while reconstructing a detailed 3D model of the landscape, our approach opens the door to studying the sensory ecology and decision-making of animals within their natural physical and social environments.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) of sheep and goats, that threatens food security, small ruminant production, and the conservation of wild small ruminants. Current efforts are directed towards the global control and eradication of PPRV, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and Food and the Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. A plethora of diagnostic tools for PPR were primarily developed for livestock. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems, and in complex field situations. Recent studies confirmed that single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have proven to be a powerful tool in diagnostics and therapeutics due to their unique properties, such as small size and strong antigen-binding affinity. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to generate PPRV-reactive nanobodies in order to set a pace for the development of diagnostic and possibly therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Initially, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca was immunized with PPRV in order to raise an affinity-matured immune response, from which an immune nanobody library was constructed. Following phage display, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This study has generated PPRV-reactive nanobodies and have significant implications in the development of cost-effective diagnostic tools in context with the planned eradication of PPR in the world. Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) of sheep and goats, that threatens food security, small ruminant production, and the conservation of wild small ruminants in many developing countries, especially in Africa. Robust serological and molecular diagnostic tools are available to detect PPRV infection, but they were mainly developed for domestic sheep and goats. The presence of a wide host range for PPRV does present serological diagnostic challenges. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems and in complex field situations. Interestingly, single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have emerged as a new hope in the development of accurate, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic tools in veterinary and biomedical fields that are suitable for low-income countries. The main objective of this study was to construct an immune nanobody library to retrieve PPRV-reactive nanobodies that enable the development of diagnostic and therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Here, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) was immunized with a live attenuated vaccine strain (PPRV/N/75/1) to raise an affinity-matured immune response in the heavy-chain-only antibody classes. The nanobody gene repertoire was engineered in pMECS-GG phagemid, whereby a ccdB gene (encoding a lethal protein) was substituted by the nanobody gene. An immune nanobody library with approximately sixty-four million independent transformants was constructed, of which 100% contained an insert with the proper size of nanobody gene.
   Following phage display and biopanning, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise completely inactivated PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   They showed superb potency in rapidly identifying PPRV, which is likely to open a new perspective in the diagnosis and possible treatment of PPR infection.

AB  - Simple Summary The objective of our study was to gain a deep understanding about the role of predicted climate change on the range restricted and high-mountain dwelling animal species like the Himalayan goral (HG). To achieve this, we conducted species distribution modeling of the target species under present and predicted future climate change scenarios. Our focus was on identifying the potential suitable microhabitats of the target species using a predictive modeling and maximum entropy algorithm under current climate, and any possible range variation and shift under future climate change scenarios. Annual precipitation and elevation are important factors that affect goral distribution; the elevation between 2000 and 3000 m is thought to be the most suitable for the goral's habitat. Additionally, a general slight range shift toward northern latitudes and along the higher elevations is observed. Our analysis shows that the suitability of the Himalayan goral's habitat can change dramatically depending on the forecast. This work might fill the existing knowledge gap about the target species distribution in the study area and predict suitable habitats necessary for species conservation. This study might also be helpful in future planning, management, and sustainable use of available resources, and to mitigate the possible negative effects of climate change in the Himalayan region. The distribution of large ungulates is more often negatively impacted by the changing climate, especially global warming and species with limited distributional zones. While developing conservation action plans for the threatened species such as the Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral Hardwicke 1825; a mountain goat that mostly inhabits rocky cliffs), it is imperative to comprehend how future distributions might vary based on predicted climate change. In this work, MaxEnt modeling was employed to assess the habitat suitability of the target species under varying climate scenarios. Such studies have provided highly useful information but to date no such research work has been conducted that considers this endemic animal species of the Himalayas. A total of 81 species presence points, 19 bioclimatic and 3 topographic variables were employed in the species distribution modeling (SDM), and MaxEnt calibration and optimization were performed to select the best candidate model. For predicted climate scenarios, the future data is drawn from SSPs 245 and SSPs 585 of the 2050s and 2070s. Out of total 20 variables, annual precipitation, elevation, precipitation of driest month, slope aspect, minimum temperature of coldest month, slope, precipitation of warmest quarter, and temperature annual range (in order) were detected as the most influential drivers. A high accuracy value (AUC-ROC > 0.9) was observed for all the predicted scenarios. The habitat suitability of the targeted species might expand (about 3.7 to 13%) under all the future climate change scenarios. The same is evident according to local residents as species which are locally considered extinct in most of the area, might be shifting northwards along the elevation gradient away from human settlements. This study recommends additional research is conducted to prevent potential population collapses, and to identify other possible causes of local extinction events. Our findings will aid in formulating conservation plans for the Himalayan goral in a changing climate and serve as a basis for future monitoring of the species.

AB  - Ambient temperature is an underappreciated determinant of foraging behaviour in wild endotherms, and the requirement to thermoregulate likely influences food intake through multiple interacting mechanisms. We investigated relationships between ambient temperature and hepatic detoxification capacity in two herbivorous marsupials, the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) that regularly feed on diets rich in plant toxins. As an indicator of hepatic detoxification capacity, we determined the functional clearance rate of an anaesthetic agent, Alfaxalone, after possums were acclimated to 10 degrees C [below the thermoneutral zone (TNZ)], 18 degrees C [approximately lower critical temperature (LCT)], and 26 degrees C [approximately upper critical temperature (UCT)] for either 7 days or less than 24 h. We then measured intake of foods with high or low plant secondary metabolite (PSM) concentrations under the same temperature regimes. After 7 days of acclimation, we found a positive correlation between the functional clearance rate of Alfaxalone and ambient temperature, and a negative relationship between ambient temperature and intake of foods with high or low PSM concentrations for both species. The effect of ambient temperature on intake of diets rich in PSMs was absent or reduced when possums were kept at temperatures for less than 24 h. Our results underscore the effects of ambient temperature in hepatic metabolism particularly with respect intake of diets containing PSMs. Given that the planet is warming, it is vital that effects of ambient temperature on metabolism, nutrition and foraging by mammalian herbivores is taken into account to predict range changes of species and their impact on ecosystems.

AB  - Milk thistle is an alternative crop to winter cereals for southern Europe as this species is drought tolerant and its fruits contain silymarin. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of two varieties and fertilization regimes (sheep manure and inorganic fertilizer) on crop productivity. A two-factor experiment was conducted in a randomized split-plot design with three replicates. The varieties were Palaionterveno and Spata, while the fertilization treatments were control, sheep manure, and calcium ammonium nitrate applied at 75 and 125 kg N ha(-1). Variety and fertilization significantly affected plants development and productivity, as well as oil and silymarin yield. The use of manure and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer increased rosette diameter, oil and silymarin yield, above-ground biomass, and fruit yield. The influence of inorganic fertilization, regardless of the application dose, was more apparent than organic fertilization. Moreover, variety significantly affected plants growth and silymarin content, as well as silymarin composition. The variety Spata had the greatest silymarin content, reaching 4.40%, and a high silybin B concentration. In conclusion, the selection of a suitable variety is important for achieving high fruit and silymarin yields, while inorganic nitrogen fertilization can maximize the productivity of the milk thistle crop.

AB  - Combined use of cannabis and alcohol is common in adolescents. However, the extent to which such polydrug exposure affects the brain and behaviors remains under-investigated in preclinical studies. This study tested the hypothesis that combined exposure of ?-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and alcohol will have additive effects on cognitive impairments and altered endocannabinoid levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Male Long Evans rats were provided with daily access to cookies laced with oil or dronabinol, a synthetic THC, during adolescence. Three days after discontinuation of edible THC, the effect of orally administered 3 g/kg alcohol on Barnes maze performance was assessed. The results showed that experience with edible THC facilitated the occurrence of increased moving speed on the maze induced by repeated alcohol administration. However, contrasting to the hypothesis, the combined THC and alcohol exposure did not lead to additive deficits in learning and memory on the Barnes maze. While little effect on endocannabinoid levels was observed in the hippocampus, acute abstinence from alcohol significantly reduced endocannabinoid levels in the frontal cortex. In particular, reduction of N-oleoyl ethanolamine (OEA) and N-stearoyl ethanolamine (SEA) were robust and had an interactive effect with discontinuation from edible THC. These findings add to the scarce literature on THC and alcohol associated changes in endocannabinoid levels and provide insights to future investigations on the roles of OEA and SEA on physiology and behaviors following THC and alcohol co-exposure during adolescence.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Deer bone is rich in proteins, free amino acids, chondroitin, organic calcium, phosphorus ions, and other active components. Deer bone had been used widely in antiquity and were first compiled in renowned ancient masterpiece 'Mingyi Bielu ((sic)(sic)(sic)(sic))' written by Hongjing Tao. The deer bone is recorded as non-toxic and has the effects of replenishing bones, strengthening sinews, expelling wind-dampness from the body, promoting muscle growth, and healing wounds. Modern pharmacological research suggests that deer bone can help promote bone density and enhance bone strength, making it potentially valuable for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. However, current studies on the component analysis and pharmacological effects of deer bone against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are incomplete, which to some extent hinders the development and clinical application of deer bone drugs. Aim of the study: The components of deer bone were elucidated by label-free proteomics, and the drug-targetpathway association network was established by network pharmacology. The in vitro validation of the pathway provides a theoretical basis for deer bone as a potential therapeutic drug for rheumatoid arthritis, and also lays a solid foundation for the subsequent clinical application of the in vitro experiments established through serum pharmacology. Materials and methods: We performed extraction of deer bone using traditional water extraction methods and employed label-free proteomics technology to identify and conduct bioinformatics analysis on the proteins and peptides in the deer bone hot water extract (DBHE). These components were considered potential drug targets, and we constructed a "drug-target-pathway" association network. Analysis revealed that the HIF-1 signaling pathway may be pivotal in DBWE's effect on RA. Hypoxia influences the occurrence and development of ferroptosis through various mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that DBWE might induce ferroptosis, promoting apoptosis in RA-FLS under hypoxic conditions, thereby alleviating RA. Therefore, we performed flow cytometry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and western blotting based on molecular docking. Considering the overall effect of drug metabolism post-ingestion, we used serum pharmacology to prepare serum for cellular administration. Results: It showed that DBWE reduces inflammation and synovial proliferation by inhibiting HO-1, increasing ROS production, upregulating ACSL4 expression and inducing RA-FLS apoptosis in hypoxic conditions. This study reveals the potential mechanism by which DBWE modulates ferroptosis to attenuate synovial proliferation in a hypoxic microenvironment and improve RA. Conclusion: These findings not only provide a theoretical basis for deer bone as a potential therapeutic agent for RA, but also lay a solid foundation for subsequent clinical application through in vitro experiments established by serum pharmacology.

AB  - Infectious prions consist of PrPSc, a misfolded, aggregation-prone isoform of the host's prion protein. PrPSc assemblies encode distinct biochemical and biological properties. They harbor a specific profile of PrPSc species, from small oligomers to fibrils in different ratios, where the highest infectivity aligns with oligomeric particles. To investigate the impact of PrPSc aggregate complexity on prion propagation, biochemical properties, and disease pathogenesis, we fractionated elk prions by sedimentation velocity centrifugation, followed by sub-passages of individual fractions in cervidized mice. Upon first passage, different fractions generated PrPSc with distinct biochemical, biophysical, and neuropathological profiles. Notably, low or high molecular weight PrPSc aggregates caused different clinical signs of hyperexcitability or lethargy, respectively, which were retained over passage, whereas other properties converged. Our findings suggest that PrPSc quaternary structure determines an initial selection of a specific replication environment, resulting in transmissible features that are independent of PrPSc biochemical and biophysical properties.

AB  - Biogas digestate is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and could pose a high health risk to both human and animals if the host microorganisms of ARGs become aerosolized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity and relative abundance characteristics of aerosol-loaded ARGs from biogas digestate during storage, and to explore whether the change of ARGs in biogas digestate directly affect the dispersion of aerosol-loaded ARGs. This study reported for the first time that 28 of 42 ARG subtypes detected in the biogas digestate could be dispersed to the atmosphere via aerosol dispersion in a lab-scale dynamic emission vessels experiment. The relative abundance or diversity of ARGs in aerosols were different from that in biogas digestate, and no significant correlation were observed between the relative abundance of ARGs in biogas digestate and aerosols. The dominant ARGs were tetracycline resistance genes in biogas digestate and beta-lactam resistance genes in aerosols. The process of biogas digestate storage reduced the total relative abundance of targeted ARGs in biogas digestate, decreased by 0.35 copies/16S rRNA after 30 days of storage, but increased the abundance of some ARG subtypes, including tetM, tetX, tetQ, tetS, ermF and sul2. High-concerned ARGs, including NDM-1, mcr-1 and vancomycin resistance genes (including vanA, vanB, vanRA and vanSA), were found in biogas digestate, and NDM-1 and vanB were also detected in aerosols. These results indicated a potential risk of ARGs dispersion during biogas digestate storage. Further research on the dispersion of ARGs from biogas digestate is required to elucidate the emission mechanism and develop mitigation measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a widely used tool for coral reefs conservation, but massive tourism activities inside MPAs worldwide can challenge their effectiveness. This study investigated the role of different levels of protection strictness (no-entry, low and high tourism-allowed zones) set for a marine sanctuary in shaping benthic cover and reef fish community structure in the richest and largest coral reef system of the Southwestern Atlantic. Reef fish community structure and benthic cover differed between protection levels. No-entry zones showed significant higher coral coverage and biomass of piscivores and herbivores than tourism-allowed zones. Highest differences were found between no-entry and high tourism intensity zones. Despite the fact that protection from fishing by itself can ensure conservation benefits, we show here that the establishment of no-entry zones improve MPAs effectiveness.

AB  - The steppe plains of Saida (Algeria) has an interest in the agricultural economy that is privileged in extensive area for sheep breeding. Due to the extensive sheep farming, it resulted with a severe degradation. In this phenomenon, by inaugurating the direct consequence of the combined action of man and climate, the recurrent drought and the increasing anthropogenic pressure affect the soil which is the main factor in the ground and the production of biomass, particularly in semi-arid area and the arid ones. By applying the MEDALUS (The Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) that is mainly based on the investigation of the physical, biological, and socioeconomic processes in this current work that will affect the evaluation of the sensitivity of the soils to the process of desertification. It is a cartography based on the combination of several types of sounds like the textural triangle USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), soil map, geological map, MNT and satellite images. The soil quality index are the basis of the mentioned method which determine the resistance to the phenomenon of desertification. These qualities are essential and can be assessed using simple soil properties such as soil texture, soil depth, parent materials, slopes and soil stoniness's, and soil morpho-pedological. This resultant has been obtained, and will be initiated after the final validation, a new decision-making aid reference for the sustainable management of steppe zones. The resulting soil sensitivity map to desertification processes includes three MEDALUS nomenclature classes: class of fragile soils, moderately sensitive soils and soils that aren't too sensitive to desertification with dominance of fragile areas on the zone.

AB  - If transparent and inclusive stakeholder discussion delivers a consensus for active rewilding, then five steps are recommended for operationalizing that decision, focused initially on the large herbivore assemblage. Consideration of large predators could follow, contingent upon the establishment of prey populations. First, determine the potential biomass density (kg/km(2)) of large mammalian herbivores in the target landscape. Regression models based on rainfall or primary productivity are helpful if applicable, otherwise comparative studies are needed. Second, use empirical data from reference ecosystems to apportion biomass density among functional types, crudely defined by body size and feeding type (grazer, browser, mixed feeder). Third, identify specific functional traits (coarse grazing, endozoochory, etc.) of particular local importance. Fourth, identify species within each functional type that are already present, estimate their potential biomass densities, and thus identify the shortfall within each cell of the body size x feeding type matrix. A candidate set of native and non-native (surrogate) species is then identified to make up the shortfalls. This is followed by an iterative process of estimating equilibrium population sizes, stakeholder acceptance, and viability of each potential population. Fifth, stakeholders must be inclusively re-engaged to visualize the potential assemblage, its expected functional interactions, the ecosystem services to be delivered, and the long-term costs (including opportunity costs) and benefits. When a plan is supported, local stakeholders should be integrated as active participants in the implementation, monitoring, and championing of their rewilding project.

AB  - Virtual fencing presents a promising solution for grazing management, providing flexibility, individual monitoring, potential improvements in land management, and enhanced animal welfare. However, welfare issues related to electric stimuli and species-specific learning abilities need consideration. This study aimed to investigate if sheep could learn and be fenced by a fully automated virtual fencing system. Eight Norwegian White ewes with twin lambs, all naive to virtual fencing, were randomly selected at the beginning of September 2018. Fitted with Nofence virtual fence collars designed for goats, the ewes were subjected to daily behavioural observations over nine days. The Nofence technology is a fully automated system that uses GPS coordinates, that trigger an audio cue when an animal crosses the boundary. If the animal does not turn, it receives an electric stimulus. The study was divided into three periods: an adaptation period (2 days), period 1 (5 days), where the first virtual boundary was introduced on day 1, and period 2 (4 days) when a second boundary was introduced. Additionally, the ewes wore heart rate monitors for at least one hour daily. Throughout the study, the ewes received a total of 218 audio cues and 38 electric stimuli, indicating an approximate individual mean of 27 audio cues and 5 electric stimuli received The number of audio cues and electric stimuli significantly decreased over days in both experimental periods. In period 2, the number of audio cues was significantly higher compared to period 1, while the success ratio in avoiding electric stimuli remained stable across days. The experimental period significantly influenced the frequency of standing/walking behaviour, being more common in the adaptation period compared to periods 1 and 2. However, the period did not have a significant effect on the percentages of lying or grazing behaviour. During heart rate monitoring, four ewes received one electric stimulus each, resulting in an immediate heart rate increase that returned to baseline within minutes. The present study demonstrates that sheep wearing a fully automated system quickly learned to associate audio cues with electric stimuli. The ability to generalise experiences from one virtual boundary to another emphasises their learning ability. Minor changes in activity were likely influenced by factors other than the virtual fencing system. The short-lasting increase in heart rate as a response to electric stimuli suggests a temporary stress reaction. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of virtual fencing for sheep management.

KW  - lambs
KW  - sheep
AB  - Simple Summary Global finished cattle and sheep production and prices are becoming increasingly volatile due to various demand, supply, animal disease, and environmental factors. With beef and sheep production systems being globally connected, an approach monitoring the developments of global meat prices as received by producers becomes increasingly important. This paper presents four global price indices for beef and sheep meat based on prices received by livestock producers obtained from 33 beef and 20 sheep producing countries. These indices are: finished cattle, weaner cattle and lambs producer price indices, as well as a lambs and sheep producer price index-all using an internationally standardized approach. These global indices and associated country and regional indices are used to monitor and explain developments in global beef cattle, lambs, and sheep prices over the index period 2000-2019. The global farmgate cattle and sheep prices have been mainly impacted by developments in global supply and demand, as well as changes in international market access. However, factors which are more local in nature, such as droughts, diseases, local economic developments, exchange rates and policy interventions, have also had a considerable impact on price developments. While international beef and sheep meat price developments are usually measured with meat trade prices (provided by FAO), no comparable information exists on world average of national prices that producers receive for livestock. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a set of global producer price indices representing cattle, lambs, and sheep prices as received by producers: the agri benchmark of weaner cattle, finished cattle, lambs and lambs and sheep price indices. These Laspeyres, production-weighted indices measure changes in global farm gate prices as provided annually by the agri benchmark Beef and Sheep Network, with this paper covering prices between 2000 and 2019. The results showed that growing Asian imports, local economic developments in South America, the interconnection with the dairy sector in Europe, growth of beef consumption in China and exchange rates shifts are the key factors that drove developments of global beef producer prices over the past 20 years. Droughts in Oceania and the rapid rise in China's sheep meat prices are highly reflected in the Global Lambs and Lambs and Sheep Meat Price indices. The indices indicate whether cattle and sheep producers globally are receiving more, or less, for the commodity and may increase or reduce production and investment accordingly. This will be of more use if there were similar producer price indices for competing enterprises, such as dairy and cropping, and for competing proteins, such as pigs, poultry, and fish.

AB  - The natural tanks (stricto sensu) are important geomorphological features that occur in the municipality of Itapipoca (CE), which occasionally accommodate Quaternary sediments with relevant fossil content. The "Tanque Jirau 01", located at the Jirau Paleontological Site, stands out among the various depressions that occur in this municipality of Ceara, both in terms of geomorphology and paleontology. The Jirau fossiliferous tank (TF01) is a steep natural tank, which was formed in the crystalline basement, presenting a concave-type bottom morphology. The depression follows the WNW-ESE orientation and is partially filled by sand-clayey sedimentary deposits, with fossiliferous content from the Pleistocene megafauna. Regarding dimensional aspects, the TF01 has an extension of more than 50 meters in length, with a maximum width of 5,30 meters and depths of up to 5 meters. The conformity of the geomorphological aspects, in addition to attributing to the TF01 an extraordinary scenic beauty, also made it possible to offer, in the past, an area of stock and availability of water for the fauna and, later, for the local population in periods of drought. Inside the tank, it is possible to verify the registration of minor structures on the lateral walls, features similar to honeycombs and/or alveoli with centimeter sizes, and evidence of weathering processes of soil-rock contact linked to chemical corrosion. Although there are paleontological studies in academia on the material found in the depressions of Itapipoca, there is still few materials linked to the conditions responsible for the possible origin and development of these natural tanks in the region. This study presents an initial analysis based on the morphological characterization and tectono-structural control of the Jirau 01 (TF01) natural tank, an area of important scientific reference in the municipality of Itapipoca (CE).

AB  - Blood samples are routinely collected from wild populations in remote locations with limited electricity, minimal diagnostic capabilities, and extreme environmental conditions. Under these conditions, serum samples may be stored for prolonged time under varied temperatures prior to processing, which could affect the ability to interpretation the results. This study's objective was to evaluate the effects of delayed processing of serum samples and varied storage temperatures on biochemical values in African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana). Blood samples were collected from six elephants managed by the North Carolina Zoo. For each elephant, seven red top tubes were collected. One serum sample for each elephant was analyzed on Day 0 (control group). The remaining samples were stored under different temperatures including room temperature (23 C-degrees), refrigeration (2.2 C-degrees), and incubation (32.2(degrees)C), with samples from each temperature group being analyzed on Day 5 and Day 10. Many of analytes (10 out of 18) did not change significantly regardless of storage temperature or time. Refrigeration improved stability in an additional four analytes over prolonged storage. We conclude that if serum is properly separated shortly after collection, many serum biochemical analytes can be accurately measured even after suboptimal serum storage, but refrigeration and prompt evaluation are still required for some analytes.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat identification is highly demanded in modern livestock management, and sheep face detection is an important basis for goat identification, for which we developed a new computer model that overcomes the challenges of unclear images, small targets, and low resolution. By considering the surrounding details and combining different features, our model performs better than existing methods in detecting goat faces. We used various evaluation metrics to measure its effectiveness and found a significant improvement in accuracy. The results confirmed that our method successfully addresses the difficulty of detecting lamb faces. This study has important implications for the development of intelligent management systems for modern livestock farms to better identify and monitor goat for improved animal welfare. With the advancement of deep learning technology, the importance of utilizing deep learning for livestock management is becoming increasingly evident. goat face detection provides a foundation for goat recognition and management. In this study, we proposed a novel neural network specifically designed for goat face object detection, addressing challenges such as low image resolution, small goat face targets, and indistinct features. By incorporating contextual information and feature-fusion complementation, our approach was compared with existing object detection networks using evaluation metrics such as F1-Score (F1), precision (P), recall (R), and average precision (AP). Our results show that there are 8.07%, 0.06, and 6.8% improvements in AP, P, and R, respectively. The findings confirm that the proposed object detection network effectively mitigates the impact of small targets in goat face detection, providing a solid basis for the development of intelligent management systems for modern livestock farms.

AB  - This study's objective was to evaluate the thermoregulation aspects of native goats through broken-line regression to understand the triggering of physiological responses in the homeothermy process. Data were collected from ten healthy dams of the Caninde breed once a week at hourly intervals (24 h) for eight consecutive weeks. Air temperature (AT; degrees C), relative humidity (RH; %) were measured and temperature-humidity index (THI) calculated. The thermoregulation parameters evaluated were: respiratory rate (RR; breaths.min(-1)), rectal temperature (RT; degrees C) and sweating rate (SR; g.m(-2).h(-1)). All variables were subjected to analysis of variance with repeated measures over time. The hour was considered a fixed effect (00:00 h, 01:00 h, horizontal ellipsis , 23:00 h), and the animal was a random effect. Multiple regression analyses were also examined using General Linear Models and Variance Inflation Factors were calculated. Broken line non-linear regressions for RR, RT and SR were examined using independent variables. The highest average for AT and RH were 35.9 degrees C (13:00 h) and 92.4% (04:00 h), respectively. The lowest average of TA and RH were 22.1 degrees C (05:00 h) and 28.0% (12:00 h), respectively. The highest average THI was 102.1 (13:00 h), and the lowest 78.0 (05:00 h). The environmental thresholds at which RR, RT and SR began to increase for AT were between 17-21 degrees C and RH were > 17% (RR), >= 21 (RT) and > 23% (SR). For THI the limits were 108.4 for RR, 78.0 for RT and 100.1 for SR. Using THI, the thermoregulatory parameters are activated in the following order: SR, RR and RT. Estimates can serve as a basis to implement heat stress mitigation and improve animal welfare strategies for native goats.

AB  - Predation risk, the probability that a prey animal will be killed by a predator, is fundamental to theoretical and applied ecology. Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator-prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator-prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator-prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator-prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator-prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions.

AB  - Herbivorous insects have evolved various anti-predator defences, including morphological, behavioural, and immune defences, which can make biocontrol of herbivorous pests challenging. Silicon (Si) accumulation in plants is a potent physical defence against mandibulate insects. However, it remains uncertain how Si affects the anti-predator defences of insect herbivores and plant defences following herbivory. We grew the model grass, Brachypodium distachyon, hydroponically with (+Si) or without (-Si) Si and investigated the plant-mediated effects of Si on the anti-predator defences of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, integrating morphological (i.e. integument resistance and thickness), behavioural, and immune defences. We also examined the effects of Si on plant compensatory growth and leaf trichome production. Larval growth, leaf consumption, and integument resistance were lower when feeding on +Si plants compared to when feeding on -Si plants. Larval integument thickness, defensive behaviours, haemocyte density, and lysozyme-like activity in the haemolymph were unaffected by Si. Larvae fed on +Si plants had higher haemolymph phenoloxidase (PO) and total-PO activities than larvae fed on -Si plants, although this did not enhance the melanisation response of larvae. Furthermore, Si supplies increased plant compensation for herbivory and constitutive trichome production, whereas herbivory induced trichome production only on -Si plants. We provide the first evidence for plant-mediated effects of Si on anti-predator defences of an insect herbivore. We suggest that the lower integument resistance of larvae when feeding on Si-supplemented plants could contribute to their vulnerability to natural enemies and that high PO activity may impose fitness costs (e.g. delayed development).

AB  - PC-CREAM is a tool for assessing the radiological impact of routine discharges of radionuclides to the environment. It can be used for prospective assessments, to calculate doses to members of the public for authorisation of proposed discharges, or for retrospective assessments of previous discharges where doses are compared with dose limits. These types of assessment are a fundamental requirement of regulations governing the control of radioactive discharges. However, the latest publications of the basic safety standards for radiation protection, EU (Council of the European Union, 2014) and the IAEA (IAEA, 2014), now include the requirement to demonstrate protection of the environment as well as members of the public. To this end, a module has been added to PCCREAM for calculating dose rates to non-human biota (Anderson et al., 2022). The methodology used for this calculation is based on the recommendations contained in ICRP Publication 108 (ICRP, 2008), which provides a general framework for protection of the environment. The additional module means that PC-CREAM can be used to assess doses to humans and dose rates to biota in an integrated way, for the same set of discharges and using the same dispersion models. This paper describes an assessment of dose rates to biota living in the vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear site, carried out using the new biota module of PC-CREAM. Historical discharges from Sellafield to the sea and atmosphere were considered for the period 1951 to 2017, excluding those from the Windscale fire in 1957. Dose rates calculated for marine biota (flatfish, crabs and brown seaweed) are less than 1 mGy d-1 and are below the lower derived consideration reference level (DCRL) for the ICRP marine reference animals and plants (RAPs). Dose rates for terrestrial biota (bees, deer, earthworms, frogs, wild grass, pine trees and rats) are less than the relevant lower DCRL for terrestrial RAPs, ie 0.1 mGy d-1. Dose rates were also calculated for a user defined organism 'seabird' to represent birds which inhabit both marine and terrestrial environments near Sellafield. For seabird, the lower DCRL of 0.1 mGy d-1 is exceeded throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when the discharges were at their highest, due to exposures from the marine environment. Since the mid-1980s, no dose rates were calculated that exceeded the lower DCRLs.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is a cryptic and rare big cat inhabiting Asia's remote and harsh elevated areas. Its population has decreased across the globe for various reasons, including human-snow leopard conflicts (HSCs). Understanding the snow leopard's distribution range and habitat interactions with human/livestock is essential for understanding the ecological context in which HSCs occur and thus gives insights into how to mitigate HSCs. In this study, a MaxEnt model predicted the snow leopard's potential distribution and analyzed the land use/cover to determine the habitat interactions of snow leopards with human/livestock in Karakoram-Pamir, northern Pakistan. The results indicated an excellent model performance for predicting the species' potential distribution. The variables with higher contributions to the model were the mean diurnal temperature range (51.7%), annual temperature range (18.5%), aspect (14.2%), and land cover (6.9%). The model predicted approximately 10% of the study area as a highly suitable habitat for snow leopards. Appropriate areas included those at an altitude ranging from 2721 to 4825 m, with a mean elevation of 3796.9 +/- 432 m, overlapping between suitable snow leopard habitats and human presence. The human encroachment (human settlements and agriculture) in suitable snow leopard habitat increased by 115% between 2008 and 2018. Increasing encroachment and a clear overlap between snow leopard suitable habitat and human activities, signs of growing competition between wildlife and human/livestock for limited rangeland resources, may have contributed to increasing HSCs. A sound land use plan is needed to minimize overlaps between suitable snow leopard habitat and human presence to mitigate HSCs in the long run.

AB  - The role of trace elements, heavy metals, and their effect on the development of hard tissue mineralization balance is poorly documented and the available results are often contradictory. The aim of the present study was the assessment of the concentration of the selected elements in the teeth of deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) with respect to their potential role in maintaining biomineralization balance in teeth hard tissues. Moreover, the aim was to determine whether trace elements accumulate in teeth with age. This study was conducted on 22 molar teeth of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 54 molar teeth of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from Poland. Samples were analyzed with the use of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry equipped with a concentric nebulizer and cyclonic spray chamber in order to determine their Al, Ba, Cd, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn contents. There were strong positive correlations between strontium and zinc with heavy metals, particularly in dentine, which may affect the neutralization of the negative effects of heavy metals on tooth tissue and, consequently, maintaining ionic balance. The accumulation of trace elements with age in serenades has not been confirmed.

AB  - Trade in wildlife is increasingly moving online, which creates significant challenges for monitoring. Numerous reports have highlighted the extent of the trade but they rarely present a methodology to facilitate replication or any form of meta-analysis. Here we present a systematic approach to surveying online trade in wildlife that builds on the well-established systematic evidence review approach. We apply this approach to investigate the online trade in saiga antelope Saiga tatarica horns on Russian-language websites. Of the 419 advertisements, the majority (217, 52%) were from Ukraine, followed by Russia (122, 29%), and were largely offers to sell (254, 61%), and represented one-off advertisements. Trade was identified on 89 websites, with the majority being on classified ads websites (68, 76%), auction.violity.com being the most popular site (156, 37%). Prices varied significantly depending on the country and how the horn was being offered (i.e. by weight or length). It is clear that saiga horn is being traded over the internet, with Ukraine and Russia comprising c. 80% of advertisements on Russian-language websites. Individuals with single advertisements dominate, suggesting website fidelity, although website usage is country-specific, potentially reflecting domestic trade. This suggests country-specific interventions could be particularly effective. A systematic approach for investigating online wildlife trade provides a clear and transparent methodology, and, given data collection is resource-intensive, allows studies to be replicated so that trends can be identified. However, this is only possible if published studies report the methodology used.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of social dominance on the behavioral estrus and ovarian parameters of dairy goats subjected to synchronous estrus induction during the non-breeding season. Synchronous estrus was induced in 23 dairy goats allocated to collective pens. Ovarian ultrasonography was performed at 12 h intervals from device removal to ovulation. Upon estrus onset (EO) detection, the goats were immediately removed from the pens. Dominance was scored according to EO in relation to device removal in each pen, with HD - high dominants ( 36 h; n = 8), MD - medium dominants (36 to 48 h; n = 10) and LD - low dominants ( 0.05) in LD (53.7 +/- 6.5 h) than in MD (37.9 +/- 5.5 h) and HD goats (32.3 +/- 6.6 h), while the interval from device removal to ovulation was similar (P 0.05) among all groups. The interval from EO to FxTAI was longer in HD goats compared to the other groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, although social hierarchy influenced the time of EO, the ovarian ovulation, were not affected.

AB  - Wild boars have a worldwide distribution and also have major economic, veterinary, and medical importance. Due to a small amount of data on the parasitic fauna of wild boars in the Russian Far East, especially in Prymorye territory, a post -mortem parasitic examination of 20 wild boars was provided. The general prevalence was 25%, and a total of six helminth species, including one larva stage, were found. The most prevalent helminth species were Gnathostoma doloresi (25%) and Metastrongylus elongatus (20%). Followed by Trichuris suis and Ascaris suum (15%). The lowest prevalence was registered for Cysticercus tenuicollis (the larvae stage of T. hydatigena ). Parasites were found in each region, with the highest prevalence registered in the Chuguevskii region. Totally 100% of adult boars were positive for helminth infections, instead of 60% of young specimens. Some helminthes found ( G. doloresi, T. suis, A. suum ) have zoonotic potential and can be involved in the circulation of human parasitic diseases, especially in rural areas. Further research work on parasitic infections in wild boars in Prymorye is necessary due to the high prevalence of helminthes in wild boars.

AB  - The corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis is a specialist herbivore that attacks maize in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is the vector of three relevant plant pathogens that are responsible for severe yield losses. Modern agriculture is dependent on the addition of fertilizers, especially nitrogen, which may influence the nutritional quality and/or the defense ability of the plants possibly with a subsequent increment of herbivorous insect populations. Through a field experiment, using a randomized design with four treatments with incremental levels of fertilization, we evaluated the effects of nitrogen in corn on the population level of the vector D. maidis, on the incidence of the diseases transmitted by it, and on the level of parasitism of the vectors' eggs. The amount of nitrogen fertilizer used significantly influenced the density of the corn leafhopper and, as a consequence, the parasitism by egg parasitoids, but not the incidence of the diseases transmitted by it. Two weeks after fertilization, the vector density was significantly higher in the highly fertilized treatment. The disease incidence was not directly linked with the level of fertilization. However, the symptoms of the diseases were much less evident in plants that received higher fertilization. Levels of parasitism by egg parasitoids increased accordingly to the level of D. maidis populations. The management of nitrogen fertilization in corn crops can mitigate the negative effects of the corn stunting disease without affecting the levels of natural control performed by egg parasitoids.

AB  - The present study was conducted to understand transcriptional response of skin fibroblast of yak (Bos grunniens) and cows of Bos indicus origin to hypoxia stress. Six primary fibroblast cell lines derived from three individuals each of Ladakhi yak (Bos grunniens) and Sahiwal cows (Bos indicus) were exposed to low oxygen concentration for a period of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The expression of 10 important genes known to regulate hypoxia response such as HIF1A, VEGFA, EPAS1, ATP1A1, GLUT1, HMOX1, ECE1, TNF-A, GPx and SOD were evaluated in fibroblast cells of Ladakhi yak (LAY-Fb) and Sahiwal cows (SAC-Fb) during pre- and post-hypoxia stress. A panel of 10 reference genes (GAPDH, RPL4, EEF1A1, RPS9, HPRT1, UXT, RPS23, B2M, RPS15, ACTB) were also evaluated for their expression stability to perform accurate normalization. The expression of HIF1A was significantly (p < 0.05) induced in both LAY-Fb (2.29-fold) and SAC-Fb (2.07-fold) after 24 h of hypoxia stress. The angiogenic (VEGFA), metabolic (GLUT1) and antioxidant genes (SOD and GPx) were also induced after 24 h of hypoxia stress. However, EPAS1 and ATP1A1 induced significantly (p < 0.05) after 48 h whereas, ECE1 expression induced significantly (p < 0.05) at 72 h after exposure to hypoxia. The TNF-alpha which is a pro-inflammatory gene induced significantly (p < 0.05) at 24 h in SAC-Fb and at 72 h in LAY-Fb. The induction of hypoxia associated genes indicated the utility of skin derived fibroblast as cellular model to evaluate transcriptome signatures post hypoxia stress in populations adapted to diverse altitudes.

AB  - With economic development and improved living standards, the demand for mutton and wool continues to grow, and improving the production performance and genetic potential of sheep breeds has become the key to promoting the high-quality development of the sheep industry. Thus, this study analyzes the influencing factors of the early production traits of Yunnan semi-fine wool sheep, optimizes the genetic evaluation model, and relies on accurate genetic parameter estimation to provide a theoretical basis for formulating a scientific and efficient breeding strategy for this breed. Data were collected from the Laishishan and Xiaohai breeding farms in Qiaojia, Yunnan, covering production records of the core flock from 2018 to 2022. Using the GLM procedure in SAS 9.4 software, this study analyzed the non-genetic influences on early production traits in Yunnan semi-fine wool sheep. Concurrently, Danish Milk Unit 5 (DMU 5) software estimated the variance components across various animal models for each trait. Employing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT), six models were tested, incorporating or excluding maternal inheritance and environmental impacts, to identify the optimal model for deriving the genetic parameters. The results show that the birth year, dam age, sex, flock and litter size significantly affect both the Birth Weight (BWT) and Weaning Weight (WWT) (p < 0.01). Additionally, the birth month was found to exert a significant effect on Birth Weight (BWT) (p < 0.01), the weaning month has a significant effect on the Weaning Weight (WWT) (p < 0.05). No significant effects of farm location were observed on either trait (p > 0.05). The most accurate genetic evaluation model determined the heritability of the Birth Weight (BWT) and Weaning Weight (WWT) as 0.3123 and 0.3471. From a production perspective, improving lamb birth, Weaning Weight (WWT), feed composition, and maternal nutrition during gestation is vital for breeding efficiency. This study not only identified the optimal animal models for early growth traits in Yunnan semi-fine wool sheep, offering a precise basis for estimating genetic parameters but also provides theoretical guidance for genetic selection and breed improvement in this population.

AB  - Simple Summary Through gesture recognition and detection of sika deer, farmers can observe the gestures of sika deer without physical contact, providing data and technical support for the intelligent and welfare-oriented breeding of sika deer. This study is based on the YOLOv8 network model. By optimizing the convolution module, incorporating the attention mechanism, and enhancing the detection head module, a new method for detecting sika deer poses was developed. The method was assessed using four behavioral datasets, which included standing, lying, eating, and attacking. The pose-recognition accuracy of sika deer significantly improved to an average of 91.6%, laying a foundation for the health assessment and information management of sika deer.Abstract As the sika deer breeding industry flourishes on a large scale, accurately assessing the health of these animals is of paramount importance. Implementing posture recognition through target detection serves as a vital method for monitoring the well-being of sika deer. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of their physical condition, ensuring the industry can maintain high standards of animal welfare and productivity. In order to achieve remote monitoring of sika deer without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals, and to enhance animal welfare, this paper proposes a sika deer individual posture recognition detection algorithm GFI-YOLOv8 based on YOLOv8. Firstly, this paper proposes to add the iAFF iterative attention feature fusion module to the C2f of the backbone network module, replace the original SPPF module with AIFI module, and use the attention mechanism to adjust the feature channel adaptively. This aims to enhance granularity, improve the model's recognition, and enhance understanding of sika deer behavior in complex scenes. Secondly, a novel convolutional neural network module is introduced to improve the efficiency and accuracy of feature extraction, while preserving the model's depth and diversity. In addition, a new attention mechanism module is proposed to expand the receptive field and simplify the model. Furthermore, a new pyramid network and an optimized detection head module are presented to improve the recognition and interpretation of sika deer postures in intricate environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves 91.6% accuracy in recognizing the posture of sika deer, with a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 4.6% increase in mAP50 compared to YOLOv8n. Compared to other models in the YOLO series, such as YOLOv5n, YOLOv7-tiny, YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10, this model exhibits higher accuracy, and improved mAP50 and mAP50-95 values. The overall performance is commendable, meeting the requirements for accurate and rapid identification of the posture of sika deer. This model proves beneficial for the precise and real-time monitoring of sika deer posture in complex breeding environments and under all-weather conditions.

AB  - The debate regarding the evolutionary relationships of the extinct South American native ungulates (SANUs) to the major placental clades Afrotheria and Boreoeutheria is exciting and has profound implications for our understanding of their early diversification and paleobiogeography. Although this controversy has not yet proven resolvable using morphological evidence, paleoproteomic and ancient DNA analyses support that at least some SANUs (i.e., Litopterna and Notoungulata) are members of Boreoeutheria, closely related to Perissodactyla (the Panperissodactyla hypothesis). Here we present a critical assessment of a recently published morphology-based study that claims that: (1) some SANUs (i.e., Notoungulata, Astrapotheria, Pyrotheria, and Xenungulata) represent a monophyletic supraordinal group, the Sudamericungulata, closely related to the Afrotherian hyracoids; and (2) the remaining SANUs (i.e., Litopterna and Didolodontidae, placed in a separate taxon, Panameridiungulata) are boreoeutherian in origin. Because this proposal (hereafter, the Sudamericungulata - Panameridiungulata or S-P hypothesis) is based on an incongruously reduced sample of boreoeutherians (including only a single perissodactyl) and inadequate character sampling restricted to dental and mandibular traits, it cannot be regarded as a satisfactory test of SANU relationships. Moreover, the S-P hypothesis fails to recover monophyletic Boreoeutheria and/or Afrotheria, making it incompatible with all well-established hypotheses of placental diversification. We find that the introduction of molecular constraints forcing the monophyly of Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria produces new trees, all recovering Sudamericungulata and Panameridiungulata nested within Boreoeutheria. These results are consistent with our analyses using a corrected version of the S-P matrix. Although we acknowledge that boreoeutherian affinities have still not been conclusively demonstrated for all nominal SANUs, it is beyond argument that any further credible testing must be based on much more exhaustive surveys than are currently available.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder is varyingly associated with cognitive impairment, that is, deficits in spatial working memory, although it seems unlikely that this is generalised across all domains of functioning. Further, it is unclear whether symptoms will respond to potentially novel, non-serotonergic drugs that have shown promise as so-called cognitive enhancers. Here, we studied low (Norm-N; n = 31) and compulsive-like high (Comp-H; n = 34) stereotypical deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) to establish (1) whether there is a relationship between stereotypical intensity and working memory ability as measured by spontaneous T-maze arm alternation and (2) if and how stereotypy and its association with changes in working memory, would respond to the known anti-compulsive agent, escitalopram, and the proposed cognitive enhancer, levetiracetam. After assessing the stereotypical and alternation behaviour of all animals at baseline, they were divided into three socially housed drug exposure groups, that is, water control (n = 11 per phenotype), escitalopram 50 mg/kg/d (n = 11 per phenotype) and levetiracetam 75 mg/kg/d (Norm-N: n = 9; Comp-H: n = 12). Drugs were administered for 28 days before stereotypy and alternation assessment were repeated. The present data indicate a weak negative relationship between stereotypical intensity and spontaneous alternation. While levetiracetam increased the time spent engaging in normal rodent activity by Comp-H, but not Norm-N animals, neither of the interventions affected the expression of Comp-H behaviour or the alternation behaviour of deer mice. In conclusion, this work points to some degree of cognitive involvement in Comp-H expression, which should be explored to further our understanding of compulsive-like stereotypy.

AB  - Nutritional ecology aims to explore the connections between the behaviour, physiology and ecology of organisms using nutrients as the unifying currency. Although significant progress has been made in studying the nutritional ecology of vertebrates and herbivorous invertebrates, research on predatory invertebrates has lagged, despite their importance in driving ecosystem processes and services, such as nutrient cycling and pest management. However, recent methodological and conceptual advances have provided significant opportunities to explore the interface of digestive physiology and ecology in predatory invertebrates. The goal of this Commentary is to explore evidence for interactions between the ecology and physiology of invertebrate predators, and to propose hypotheses and directions for future studies to expand our understanding in this area. Connections between invertebrate predator ecology and digestive physiology are discussed in relation to four pertinent topics that allow for integrative studies of invertebrate predators: micronutrients, foraging behaviour, microbial symbiosis and the Anthropocene. We hope that these areas of research will serve as examples of how physiology and ecology can be integrated for a more holistic understanding of the nutritional ecology of predatory invertebrates.

AB  - A wide variety of materials, ranging from metals to concrete, experience, typically at high-temperatures or over long time scales, permanent deformations when subjected to sustained loads below their yield stress-a phenomenon known as creep. While theories grounded on defects such as vacancies, dislocations, or grain boundaries can explain creep in crystalline materials, our understanding of creep in disordered solids remains incomplete due to the lack of analogous structural descriptors. In this study, we use molecular dynamics to simulate the creep response of a Kob-Andersen glass model system under constant, uniaxial, compressive stress at finite temperature. We leverage that data to derive, using a machine-learning classification model, a structural descriptor termed looseness, L, which is based on simple and interpretable local structural features and can predict imminent plastic rearrangements within the glass. We show that the average looseness of the system evolves logarithmically with time, mirroring the time dependence of the creep strain and demonstrating the ability of our model to bridge local, short-term particle dynamics with the long-term macroscopic creep response. A detailed feature importance analysis reveals the particular significance of short-range structural heterogeneity in the prediction. We also scrutinize the spatial and temporal correlations of looseness, which mirror the lack of long-range order in glasses and their dynamic heterogeneity. Our research underscores the substantial predictive potential of machine-learning-derived structural indicators in systems experiencing concurrent stress and thermal excitations, paving the way for future work to elucidate the interplay between thermal and mechanical activation of structural defects in disordered solids.

AB  - Increasing ovulation numbers is one of the most important ways to promote reproduction in mammals, and follicular granulosa cells (GCs) provide the necessary nutrients and microenvironment for oocytes to ovulate. WNT4 has been shown to be a key factor in regulating the proliferation of GCs in mammalian ovarian tissues. Our previous transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results have identified two alternatively spliced products of WNT4; however, little is known about the splicing mechanism and its effect on GC proliferation. In this study, two alternatively spliced products of WNT4, designated WNT4-alpha and WNT4-beta, were identified by cloning and analyzed for their function by bioinformatics. The RT-qPCR and Western blot results showed that the expression of WNT4-alpha was significantly higher than that of WNT4-beta in the ovary tissues and GCs of Yunshang black goats. We therefore hypothesized that WNT4-alpha was the main isoform affecting the proliferation of goat GCs. Subsequently, goat GC proliferation assays showed that overexpression of WNT4-alpha significantly promoted GC proliferation, and the opposite was true after WNT4-alpha inhibition. The expression of marker genes of the Wnt signaling pathway was also examined and WNT4-alpha was found to affect the proliferation and hormone secretion of goat GCs by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. In addition, a series of splicing factors were involved in in the alternative splicing; in this study, SRSF6 was found to be involved as a splicing factor in the generation of WNT4 alternative splicing. In summary, WNT4 alternative splicing was mediated by the splicing factor SRSF6, and WNT4-alpha alternative splicing played an important role in follicle development and had a significant effect on the proliferation of goat GCs. The results of this study provide a theoretical foundation for further understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the WNT4 in follicle development in goats.

AB  - Tea tree is a fluorine (F)-enriched plant, leading to much concern about the safety of drinking tea from tea tree (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze). Tea tree is a perennial leaf-harvested crop, and tea production in China is generally categorized as spring tea, summer tea and autumn tea in its annual growth rounds. However, the seasonally dynamic changes of F content and accumulation in the leaves and its drinking safety are poorly understood. In this study, 85 tea varieties cultivated under the same conditions were investigated to analyze the seasonal variation of F content and it's relationships with F accumulation, aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and manganese (Mn) and hazard quotient (HQ) in young leaves (one bud and two leaves, YL) and mature leaves (canopy leaves, ML). The average F contents and accumulations were 350 mg kg(-1) and 203 g ha(-1) in YL, and they were 2451 mg kg(-1) and 2578 g ha(-1) in ML, respectively, with F mainly accumulated in ML. As the growing season progresses, the F content showed a gradual increase in YL, while a decrease in ML, inferring that F may be redistributed from mature leaves to young leaves. Additionally, the F content was quite different among tea varieties which are suitable for processing oolong tea, green tea, and black tea, with higher F accumulation in oolong tea varieties than in green and black tea varieties. Moreover, F content and accumulation could be obviously affected by the geographical origin of the tea tree varieties, with significantly higher F content in the varieties from F rich fluorite belts than other regions. Furthermore, F content and accumulation showed a significant positive correlation with the content of Al and Mn (p < 0.05). Based on a daily tea consumption of 8.7 g, the HQ was investigated to show that the proportion of tea leaves with HQ<1 made from spring, summer and autumn tender leaves of 85 varieties was 100 %, 90.6 % and 50.6 %, respectively, indicating that the tea with the best drinking safety comes from spring, followed by summer, and then autumn. This result suggests that it could be necessary to avoid planting tea trees in fluorite mining areas, choose low F tea tree varieties, and control the tenderness of fresh leaves in order to ensure the safety of tea drinking.

AB  - Dolichousnea longissima is famous as the world's longest lichen, which typically reproduces asexually. Factors impacting its length and reproductive strategies are of theoretical interest and important for conservation. We discovered a Dolichousnea population with apotheciate thalli in Western China. Phylogenetic analyses using ITS sequence data confirmed specimens were D. longissima. Multiple phylogenetic branches included both apotheciate and non-apotheciate thalli, thus genetic differences within the ITS region were not related to apothecia production. There was no indication that apotheciate Dolichousnea specimens from this region belong to a separate, morphologically and genetically distinct population. In a field experiment, we transplanted non-apotheciate thallus strands of 10, 20, 40 or 80 cm length from higher to lower elevations: c. 4000 to 3400 m. Elevational gradients in temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit simulated future climatic change. We tested hypotheses regarding the impact of climatic stressors on D. longissima growth and reproduction. After three years of growth, thallus mortality was highest at the lowest sites. Of surviving thalli, 23% had fragmented, with fragmentation rates increasing with length. Other thalli thrived, reaching a maximum main stem length of 321 cm, with a maximum total length of 764 cm. Intact thalli showed negative length-dependent growth. Lower elevations were associated with initiation of sexual reproduction, reduced relative thallus length growth rates (RTLGR) and lower photobiont abundance, with apparent shifts of photobionts from the main stem to fibrils and reallocation of resources from length to central cord and fibril mass. Probability of switching to sexual reproduction increased with thallus length, but shorter thalli made greater relative investment in apothecia production. Detrimental impacts of climate change could reduce D. longissima range and biomass production, thereby also decreasing food availability for the endangered lichenivorous monkey, Rhinopithecus bieti. Conservation efforts should be prioritized at sites currently hosting abundant, fast-growing thalli, and high-elevation mature forests where D. longissima is most likely to persist under future climatic change. Apotheciate populations need protection because sexual reproduction theoretically generates genetic variability, increasing the likelihood of generating mycobiont genotypes adapted to altered climatic conditions.

AB  - Past work shows a significant negative correlation between foliar oregonin concentration and western tent caterpillar (Malacosoma californicum Packard) feeding on red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.). Above an oregonin threshold of 20% leaf dry weight, little feeding by caterpillars is observed. Concentrations of defensive chemicals are influenced by plant genotype, environmental conditions, insect feeding, and the interactions of these factors. Our objective was to measure the effects of nitrogen (N) availability and wounding on foliar oregonin and condensed tannin concentrations in red alder genotypes. One-year-old seedlings from 100 half-sib red alder families were treated with two levels of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) for two growing seasons in a common garden. In the second year, leaves from 50 families from the fertilization experiment were used in a bioassay feeding experiment to determine the effects of N fertilization and genotype on WTC damage, and to identify a subset of 20 families with a range of damage to analyze for phytochemical composition. In separate experiments, wound-induction treatments were conducted outdoors and, in a greenhouse using the N treated trees in their third and fourth year, respectively. Foliar condensed tannin, oregonin and N concentrations were measured and ranked among the plant genotypes, and between the two N treatments and two wounding treatments. Results showed that oregonin and condensed tannin concentrations varied among the alder genotypes. Leaf N concentration was negatively correlated with concentration of oregonin. Neither of the measured phenolic compounds responded to wounding. The results suggest that red alder foliar oregonin and condensed tannin are likely constitutive defenses that are largely determined by genotype, and that the negative correlation of defense compounds with plant internal N status holds in this N-fixing tree.

AB  - Inducible responses to herbivores can be either localized or spread systemically throughout a plant. The ways in which clonal plants integrate their response to herbivores among clonal ramets is not well understood. Yet, this is important to understand the impacts that herbivores may have on clonal plants. We conducted a factorial split-plot greenhouse experiment to determine whether resistance is induced among ramets and how biomass allocation changes among ramets following herbivore damage to one of them. We manipulated the presence of two herbivores, Pieris rapae and Trichoplusia ni, and the root connection of ramets of the clonal invasive weed, Lepidium draba. We found local inducible resistance on the ramet where an herbivore fed, but not in neighboring ramets. Biomass allocation shifted in response to herbivores. Feeding by the generalist caterpillar T. ni resulted in a greater belowground biomass relative to shoot biomass in the local plant, but only when the clonal connection was intact. In contrast, herbivores had little impact on the root mass fraction of neighboring ramets. Herbivory to the local ramet increased the regrowth of neighboring ramets that lacked clonal connection, a trend that was driven by the specialist herbivore P. rapae. Herbivores did not induce systemic resistance among ramets of L. draba, but herbivores, especially the specialist, did alter how neighboring ramets regrow after grazing or mowing. Our observations suggest that individual ramets have fairly autonomous responses to herbivores, and that coordination among ramets, when present, may happen via signals that do not depend on root connections.

AB  - BACKGROUND This study investigated the influence of the storage method on the physicochemical characteristics and microbial growth of m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL), m. biceps femoris (BF) and m. vastus lateralis (VL) of wild boar. Muscles were stored in a vacuum (VAC), in a modified high-oxygen atmosphere (MAP) or meat seasoning cabinet (DRY-AGED) for 21 days. RESULTS Wild boar meat was characterised by a high protein and low fat content and a good amount of potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Significantly higher (P < 0.05) pH values were noted for DRY-AGED muscles stored for 21 days (up to 5.89 for VL). On day 21, a significant decrease in pH was noted for all MAP muscles (down to 5.23 for BF). Storage losses due to desiccation and water loss were significantly higher for DRY-AGED samples and ranged from 25.63% to 32.89% on day 21. MAP affected protein and lipid oxidation, which was also reflected in Warner-Bratzler shear force VAC and DRY-AGED had positive results regarding tenderness, whereas on day 21 the MAP-stored meat had toughened significantly (from 35.3 N to 50.7 N in LTL). Lipids were oxidised much faster than proteins during prolonged storage in MAP. Compared to the other methods, DRY-AGED had the best effect on microbial growth. CONCLUSION These results indicate that the recommended methods for the storage of wild boar meat are either vacuum packing or dry ageing. The high oxygen content of MAP negatively affected the quality of wild boar meat and carried a risk of increased protein carbonylation. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Context Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing Midwestern North America during the past 3 decades with > 950 cougar confirmations east of established populations. Due to an increase in confirmations east of current breeding populations, evaluation of cougar habitat suitability and connectivity is needed. However, few studies have assessed the habitat potential for cougar recolonization in the eastern portion of their former range. Objectives We used various habitat quality thresholds to model potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors throughout eastern North America. Methods Based on expert opinion, we used landcover, slope, human density, distance to roads, and distance to water as model variables. Least-cost path methods were used to model dispersal corridors from western populations to potential eastern habitat patches. Results Patches of suitable habitat ranged in size from 3868 km(2) (Ozark Mountains) to > 2,490,850 km(2) (central and eastern Canada). Potential habitats were predominantly forest and shrubland, contained little anthropogenic development, and had high stream densities. Dispersal corridors were present throughout the study area. Corridors largely consisted of forested and cultivated landscapes and had higher road densities than habitat patches. Conclusions Our research provides conservationists with insights into areas suitable for cougar recolonization so they may proactively plan for potential cougar populations east of their current range. This work also provides a framework for evaluating multiple levels of landscape suitability for recolonizing species.

AB  - Objective: Reproductive toxicology is a field that deals with the effects of heavy metals on various aspects of reproduction, including sperm count, motility, viability, spermatogenesis, follicular atresia, hormonal imbalance, and oocyte maturation, among others. The present study was carried out to examine the effects of heavy metals, viz., arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and fluoride (F), on boar sperm quality parameters in vitro.Materials and Methods: Forty (40) ejaculates from six (6) boars, averaging eight ejaculates per boar, were collected with the gloved hand technique using a dummy sow. Six (6) different concentrations were selected for the in vitro study: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu M for As and Pb, and 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mM for F. The ejaculates were co-incubated with heavy metals at these different concentrations and assessed after different incubation periods (0, 0.5, and 1 h) for sperm functional attributes, viz., sperm progressive motility, viability and membrane integrity, and sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The combined effects of heavy metals on sperm functional attributes were also evaluated at different doses (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu M/mu M for As-Pb; 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu M/mM for As-F; and 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu M/mM for Pb-F).Results: The present study revealed a highly significant (p <0.001) decrease in sperm progressive motility, viable sperm, membrane integrity, and sperm MMP in samples treated with heavy metals under different incubation periods; furthermore, the longer the incubation time, the greater the toxicity. There was also a significant (p <0.05) decrease in sperm motility, membrane integrity, and MMP in the samples treated with combined heavy metals (As-Pb, As-F, and Pb-F), as compared to the control, after different incubation periods. A significant (p <0.05) reduction in sperm quality attributes was recorded even at the lowest concentrations in the case of heavy metal combinations.Conclusion: It can be concluded that As, Pb, and F are toxic to boar spermatozoa in vitro, causing reductions in sperm functional attributes in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

AB  - The frequency of heat waves has increased over the last years, with an impact on animal production and health, including the death of animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of thermoregu-lation and hormonal responses in non-pregnant and pregnant ewes exposed to successive heat waves. Twenty-four non-pregnant and 18 pregnant Santa Ines ewes with black coat color (live weight: 55 +/- 9.03 kg; age: 60 months) were used. Weather variables such air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation were continuously recorded. The rectal and tympanic temperatures and respiratory rate were measured daily. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) and prolactin were evaluated during the heat wave and thermoneutral periods. The physiological variables were higher under the heat wave conditions and were related to the activation of the thermoregulatory system for maintaining homeothermy (P < 0.05). The core body temperature was higher during successive heat waves (P < 0.05), as was the tympanic temperature, which are both affected by changes in air temperature (P < 0.05). T3 and prolactin levels were not influenced by successive heat waves (P < 0.05) and rectal temperature and respiratory rate were highest in non-pregnant ewes (P < 0.05). Prolactin was not affected by temperature. The results indicate that the Santa Ines breed overcomes the thermal challenge during a heat wave without showing severe signs of thermal stress regardless of being pregnant or not.

AB  - Canola (Brassica napus sp.), the most important oily seed product in the world, is affected largely by salinity and drought stresses due to its ability to be planted in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, studying potent genes involved in salt/drought stress response in canola would help improve abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, genes involved in response to salt and drought stresses in B. napus were investigated via sequence-read archive databases at different time points. The results were analyzed by the GALAXY server to detect DEGs. DEGs associated with short-, medium- and long-term salinity and drought stress were identified via extensive meta- analysis and robust rank aggregation methods. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the identified robust DEGs was performed via BLAST2GO. By constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with Cytoscape software, the hub genes associated with each line of salt and drought stress response were identified. Among all DEGs, HAI2 and DREB1B, which are hub genes, were selected for validation by qRT-PCR in salt/ drought-tolerant and salt/drought-sensitive cultivars of canola, Okapi and RGS, respectively, under salt and drought treatments. Fine-tuning affected the manner and time of contribution of each Abscisic Acid (ABA)- dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathway in response to salinity and drought tolerant and sensitive canola cultivars. Furthermore, the identification of hub genes through meta-analysis provided insight into the molecular responses of canola to salinity/drought stresses and the engineering of abiotic stress tolerance in canola for industrial cultivation of canola in poor-quality lands.

AB  - Ongoing global warming, coupled with increased drought frequencies, together with other biotic drivers may have resulted in complex evolutionary adaptation. The resurrection approach, comparing ancestors raised from stored seeds with their contemporary descendants under common conditions, is a powerful method to test for recent evolution in plant populations. We used 21-26-yr-old seeds of four European plant species - Matthiola tricuspidata, Plantago crassifolia, Clinopodium vulgare and Leontodon hispidus - stored in seed banks together with re-collected seeds from their wild populations. To test for evolutionary changes, we conducted a glasshouse experiment that quantified heritable changes in plant responses to drought and simulated insect herbivory. In three out of the four studied species, we found evidence that descendants had evolved shorter life cycles through faster growth and flowering. Shifts in the osmotic potential and leaf dry matter content indicated that descendants also evolved increased drought tolerance. A comparison of quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) vs neutral molecular differentiation (F-ST) values, using double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) genotyping data, suggested that directional selection, and therefore adaptive evolution, was underlying some of the observed phenotypic changes. In summary, our study revealed evolutionary changes in plant populations over the last decades that are consistent with adaptation of drought escape and tolerance as well as herbivory avoidance.

AB  - Olfactory signals play an essential role in communication in animals. Pheromones are volatile or nonvolatile chemicals that trigger social responses among animals. Therefore, pheromone treatment could, in theory, be used to modify horse behavior to improve human-horse relationships. Androstenone (5 alpha-zandrost-16-en-3-one) is a steroidal pheromone found in the saliva of boars and elicits responses across species. However, its role in horse behaviors is not elucidated. This study investigated the effect of androstenone on horse behavior. Trainability (lowering head and moving hindfeet) and calmness tests (standing still with or without a stimulator) were performed with or without applying androstenone diluted with jojoba oil. Treatment with 10 mu g/mL of androstenone applied 30 minute before the tests significantly decreased the time for the horses to lower their head compared with the control. The results of the calmness tests had no significant differences compared with the control group. In the pressure mediation test for trainability assessment, a group of horses treated with 10 mu g/mL of androstenone moved their hind feet in a significantly shorter time (P < 0.05) than the control group. As a result, androstenone appears to induce horses to be more accepting of general management and training. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An outbreak of contagious foot rot due to Fusobacterium necrophorum infection was reported in a herd of four-horned antelopes ( Tetracerus quadricornis) in a wildlife sanctuary at Goa, India. The infected animals showed signs of anorexia, limping and foot lesions, like erosions and sloughing of hooves. Mortality was recorded in two antelopes in which gross lesions, like generalized congestion of skeletal muscles and internal organs, and multi-focal to coalescing abscesses in lung, pleura, and diaphragm were observed. Histopathological evaluation of interdigital skin showed zones of coagulative necrosis, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, congestion, hemorrhage, and thrombosis in the dermis. Lung showed extensive areas of consolidation with alveolar edema, hyperemic alveolar capillaries, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The bacterial culture from heart blood, lung, liver, and kidney tissues revealed isolation of F. necrophorum being also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using amplification of lktA gene of F. necrophorum. In addition, the PCR also confirmed the presence of F. necrophorum DNA in the interdigital skin, lung, and liver tissues. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the F. necrophorum isolate from the present study grouped closely with isolates from Australia, China, Pakistan, and Iraq, as well as an Indian isolate from goat. The affected live animals were treated with oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and vitamin supplements for seven days, and recovered. This study confirmed the first outbreak of contagious foot rot and systemic infection with F. necrophorum in a herd of four-horned antelopes in India. (c) 2025 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can result in population bottlenecks, genetic differentiation, and loss of genetic diversity, which can contribute to local extinctions. White-lipped peccaries (WLPs, Tayassu pecari) are critically endangered in the Atlantic Forest due to hunting pressure and habitat loss and fragmentation. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic status of a population of WLPs, currently considered locally extinct, in a highly fragmented landscape on the plateau region of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, due to anthropogenic activities. We genotyped 49 blood samples collected from three remnant forest fragments (subpopulations: Morro do Diabo State Park-MDSP, Fazenda Ponte Branca-FPB, and Fazenda Santa M & ocirc;nica-FSM) just before the local extinction, using 11 microsatellites. The genetic diversity indices were similar in the three subpopulations and comparable to those of well-preserved populations. As expected for fragmented populations, we found evidence of bottlenecks in all three subpopulations. The subpopulations were structured into two genetic clusters (MDSP + FPB and FSM) with admixed individuals, and significant genetic differentiation observed between MDSP and FSM. However, the evidence of genetic differentiation over a small spatial scale observed here is unusual for the species in well-preserved areas. Coupled with the evidence of bottlenecks, this may indicate that anthropized landscapes play a role in reducing population size and promoting genetic differentiation in WLP populations. It is essential to delineate conservation actions for populations in similar conditions to reduce the chances of local extinction in other regions.

AB  - We hypothesized congruence in the spatial structure of abundance data sampled across multiple scales for an ecological guild of consumers that exploit similar nutritional and habitat resources. We tested this hypothesis on the spatial organization of abundance of an herbivorous guild of sea urchins. We also examined whether the amount of local along-shore rocky habitat can explain the observed spatial patterns of abundance. Standardized estimates of abundance of four intertidal sea urchins-Diadema cf. savignyi, Echinometra mathaei, Parechinus angulosus, and Stomopneustes variolaris-were determined by six observers at 105 sites across 2,850 km of coast of South Africa. For each species and observer, wavelet analysis was used on abundance estimates, after controlling for potential biases, to examine their spatial structure. The relationship between local sea urchin abundance and the amount of upstream and downstream rocky habitat, as defined by the prevailing ocean current, was also investigated. All species exhibited robust structure at scales of 75-220 km, despite variability among observers. Less robust structure in the abundances of three species was detected at larger scales of 430-898 km. Abundance estimates of sympatric populations of two species (D. cf. savignyi and E. mathaei) were positively correlated with the amount of rocky habitat upstream of the site, suggesting that upstream populations act as larval sources across a wide range of scales. No relationship between abundance and habitat size was found for P. angulosus or S. variolaris. Within the range of scales examined, we found robust congruence in spatial structure in abundance at the lower, but not the larger, range of scales for all four species. The relationship between abundance and upstream habitat availability in two species suggests that larval supply from upstream populations was probably the mechanism linking habitat size and abundance.

AB  - The genetically engineered pig is regarded as an optimal source of organ transplantation for humans and an excellent model for human disease research, given its comparable physiology to human beings. A myriad of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data on humans has been reported, but such data on pigs are scarce. Here, we apply scRNA-seq technology to study the cellular heterogeneity of 3-month-old pig lungs, generating the single-cell atlas of 13,580 cells covering 16 major cell types. Based on these data, we systematically characterize the similarities and differences in the cellular cross-talk and expression patterns of respiratory virus receptors in each cell type of pig lungs compared with human lungs. Furthermore, we analyze pig lung xenotransplantation barriers and reported the cell-type expression patterns of 10 genes associated with pig-to-human immunobiological incompatibility and coagulation dysregulation. We also investigate the conserved transcription factors (TFs) and their candidate target genes and constructed five conserved TF regulatory networks in the main cell types shared by pig and human lungs. Finally, we present a comprehensive and openly accessible online platform, ScdbLung. Our scRNA-seq atlas of the domestic pig lung and ScdbLung database can guide pig lung research and clinical applicability.

AB  - Modern approaches with advanced technology can automate and expand the extent and resolution of biodiversity monitoring. We present the development of an innovative system for automated wildlife monitoring in a coastal Natura 2000 nature reserve of the Netherlands with 65 wireless 4G wildlife cameras which are deployed autonomously in the field with 12 V/2A solar panels, i.e. without the need to replace batteries or manually retrieve SD cards. The cameras transmit images automatically (through a mobile network) to a sensor portal, which contains a PostgreSQL database and functionalities for automated task scheduling and data management, allowing scientists and site managers via a web interface to view images and remotely monitor sensor performance (e.g. number of uploaded files, battery status and SD card storage of cameras). The camera trap sampling design combines a grid-based sampling stratified by major habitats with the camera placement along a traditional monitoring route, and with an experimental set-up inside and outside large herbivore exclosures. This provides opportunities for studying the distribution, habitat use, activity, phenology, population structure and community composition of wildlife species and allows comparison of traditional with novel monitoring approaches. Images are transferred via application programming interfaces to external services for automated species identification and long-term data storage. A deep learning model for species identification was tested and showed promising results for identifying focal species. Furthermore, a detailed cost analysis revealed that establishment costs of the automated system are higher but the annual operating costs much lower than those for traditional camera trapping, resulting in the automated system being >40 % more cost-efficient. The developed end-to-end data pipeline demonstrates that continuous monitoring with automated wildlife camera networks is feasible and cost-efficient, with multiple benefits for extending the current monitoring methods. The system can be applied in open habitats of other nature reserves with mobile network coverage.

AB  - The repatriation of species is common, especially in conservation efforts aimed at restoring trophic interactions. Whether the Eltonian niches of restored species are conserved in reassembled ecological communities is largely unknown. Within mammalian carnivores, we hypothesized that the Eltonian niches of sympatric competitors would be structured by trophic facilitation from subsidies provided by large carnivores (i.e. carrion) and humans (i.e. food subsidies). Using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), we quantified the Eltonian niches of an apex predator, the grey wolf Canis lupus and two subordinate guild members, coyotes Canis latrans and red foxes Vulpes vulpes, from Michigan, USA across three periods that differed in community composition: a 'historical' carnivore community (1910-1930), a 'reduced' community which lacked wolves (1950-1970), and a 'reassembled' carnivore community featuring wolves as well as human food subsidies (2000-2020). In historical and reassembled communities, wolves constrained the niche space of coyotes via resource facilitation, regardless of human presence, such that the consumption of deer by coyotes increased by an average of 1.4-1.8-fold in the presence of wolves. Without wolves, coyotes exhibited an isotopic (dietary) niche breadth similar to 2-5x greater (3.33 +/- 0.74 parts per thousand(2)) than in the historical (0.64 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand(2)) and reassembled (1.66 +/- 0.63 parts per thousand(2)) communities. Conversely, we found that the niche breadth of foxes was conserved across the historical (1.91 +/- 0.41 parts per thousand(2)) and reduced (1.98 +/- 0.75 parts per thousand(2)) communities but increased similar to 4-fold in the presence of human resource subsidies (7.52 +/- 1.95 parts per thousand(2)). Notably, we found that trophic facilitation by wolves and resource subsidies from humans altered the foraging strategies of individuals, resulting in disparate foraging strategies for foxes in the reassembled community. Our results highlight that Eltonian niche conservatism in carnivore communities is driven by resource subsidies, both from the provisioning of carrion by large carnivores to meso-carnivores and from human foods subsidizing small carnivores. More broadly, our work suggests that large carnivore repatriation can restore some species interactions, while human resource subsidies can decouple others.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe present study aimed to investigate the effects of tremella polysaccharides on the gel properties and antioxidant activity of yak skin gelatin with a view to improving the quality of collagen jellies. The preparation of composite gels were performed by yak skin gelatin (66.7 mg mL-1) and tremella polysaccharides with different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 mg mL-1), and finally the collagen jelly was prepared by composite gel (yak skin gelatin: 66.7 mg mL-1; tremella polysaccharides:6 mg mL-1) with the best performance.RESULTSTremella polysaccharides not only improved the hardness, springiness, gel strength, water holding capacity and melting temperature of yak skin gelatin, but also enhanced the composite gel's scavenging activity against ABTS radicals, DPPH radicals, O2 and OH radicals. The filling of tremella polysaccharides into the gelatin network increased the number of crosslinking sites inside the gel, which resulted in the gel network structure becoming dense and orderly. The gel particles became finer and more uniform, and the thermal stability was improved. Furthermore, the sensory score of commercially available gelatin jelly decreased more rapidly during storage compared to the composite gel jelly.CONCLUSIONThe gel properties and antioxidant activity of yak skin gelatin were improved by adding tremella polysaccharides, and then the quality and storage properties of the jelly were improved, which also provided technical reference for the development of functional gel food.

AB  - Species distributions are predicted to change with future climate-associated ecosystem changes such that so-called 'vagrant' individuals may become established or re-establish in areas currently thought to be beyond their principle ranges. Survey data were collated for occurrences of pinniped (seal) species at very high latitudes of the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Aside from Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), which aggregate annually at the Vestfold Hills to breed and/or moult, three other pinniped species were observed with the recession of the fast-ice edge. Leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) occurrences increased with an increase in a seasonally abundant prey resource, and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) were seen at a time that coincides with their moult period. Occurrences of sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) increase the known southward range for this species and may reflect population increases at source populations in the Kerguelen Plateau area. Although there were no direct sightings of Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii), their presence close to the Vestfold Hills was detected by underwater passive acoustic monitoring. Sightings of obligate drift-ice species and sub-Antarctic fur seals may change at the Vestfold Hills with climate-mediated changes in sea-ice conditions.

AB  - Globally, agriculture sector is the significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions into the atmosphere. To achieve the goal of limiting or mitigating these emissions, a rigorous abatement strategy with an additional focus on improving crop productivity is now imperative. Replacing traditional agriculture with soil conservation-based farming can have numerous ecological benefits. However, most assessments only consider improvements in soil properties and crop productivity, and often preclude the quantitative impact analysis on GHGs emissions. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and GHGs emissions (i.e., CO2, N2O, CH4) for three major soil conservation practices i.e., no-tillage, manures, and biochar. We also examined the yield potential of three major cereal crops (i.e., wheat, rice, maize) and their significance in mitigating GHGs emissions. None of the manures were able to reduce GHGs emissions, with poultry manure being the largest contributor to all GHGs emissions. However, pig-manure had the greatest impact on crop yield while emitting the least CO2 emissions. Use of biochar showed a strong coupling effect between reduction of GHGs (i.e., CH4 by -37%; N2O by -25%; CO2 by -5%) and the increase in crop productivity. In contrast, no-tillage resulted in higher GHGs emissions with only a marginal increase in grain yield. Depending on crop type, all cereal crops showed varied degrees of GHGs mitigation under biochar application, with wheat responding most strongly due to the additional yield increment. The addition of biochar significantly reduced CO2 and N2O emissions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, although CH4 reductions were identical in both agroecosystems. Interestingly, the use of biochar resulted in a greater yield benefit in rainfed than in irrigated agriculture. Despite significant GHGs emissions, manure application contributed to higher crop yields, regardless of soil type or agroecosystem. Moreover, no-tillage showed a significant reduction in CH4 and N2O emissions under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Notably , biochar application in coarse while no-till in fine textured soils contributed to N2O mitigation. Most importantly, effectiveness of no-tillage as a countermeasure to GHGs emissions while providing yield benefits is inconsistent. Overall, the decision to use farm manures should be reconsidered due to higher GHGs emissions. We conclude that the use of biochar could be an ideal way to reduce GHGs emissions. However, further understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes affecting GHGs emissions is needed to better understand the feedback effects in conservation agriculture.

AB  - This article highlighted the consequences associated with negative human-nature interactions among local communities and the complexities that stakeholders deal with (or do not) when it comes to human-wildlife conflict (HWC). The study utilized concurrent triangulation research design to ascertain the magnitude as well as explore the psychosocial impacts of HWC on primary, secondary, and vicarious victims. The key findings revealed that local people exposed to life threatening wildlife attacks express fear and animosity toward wild animals and often feel rejected and disappointed from a fragmented government service delivery system. Unsightly scars and repeated surgeries on victims of HWC remind them of the horrific and traumatic events of their encounters with wildlife. The results offer valuable insights into the social and psychological impacts HWC. Psychosocial intervention and constructive surgery are required to enable HWC victims to face their new normal after these accidents.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a way to provide growing pigs with a complex environment to explore and occupy themselves as they grow. Single point enrichment can provide some complexity to the environment while not having the drawbacks of substrate enrichment, including labor, biosecurity, and lack of infrastructure. To expand our knowledge into the type of point enrichments that pigs engage with, as well as the effects the objects have on lesion counts and behavior, a single point enrichment object was placed into each of the 129 pens, containing 27.1 +/- 2.9 pigs per pen, in a conventional fully slatted wean-to-finish facility. The nine treatments included AllBite (TM) blocks, Bite-Rite (TM), chains, branched chains, Green Apple Porcichews (R), Yellow Vanilla Porcichews (R), cotton rope, EasyFix (R) Luna, and nothing. Interactions with the objects and activity level were monitored by scan sampling and skin lesions were measured by direct enumeration of scratches. Behavioral observation was conducted using the focal follow technique with an ethogram encompassing fighting, scampering, floor nosing, belly nosing, biting, and tail biting. Data collection took place in the 50 days after placement of enrichment objects. The proportion of pigs interacting with the enrichment object was lowest for chain (1.95 +/- 0.13%) and highest for rope (6.63 +/- 0.41%) (P < 0.011). A significant object-by-day interaction was observed for pigs at the objects (P <.001) with popularity of objects waning over time. There was a significant object by day interaction on the proportion of pigs in a pen that were standing (P <.001). There was also a significant object by day interaction for skin lesions (P<.001) with skin lesions leveling out by the end of the study but objects generally decreasing lesion counts in the first third of the study. Enrichment objects showed no significant effect on the observed behaviors. These findings suggest that the choice of point enrichment object can influence the level of interaction, level of interest over time, activity level, and skin lesions in growing pigs. Future work should investigate the practicality of these objects and farmer willingness and ability to provide them.

AB  - Whereas most studies on overmarking in mammals analysed the rate of overmarking, that those investigate time between exploration of an olfactory stimulus and the response to it remain less common, with inconsistent results. We examined the latency in time between elimination by the sender and sniffing by the receiver, and from sniffing and overmarking, in four captive African equid species to explore differences among species, and among age and sex classes. We investigated these latency time periods in light of three potential hypotheses explaining overmarking behaviour in equids: social bonds, group cohesion, and intrasexual competition. Analysing 1684 events of sniffing and 719 of overmarking among 130 individuals, we found that (i) the time from elimination to overmarking was shorter among female friends and in parent-offspring dyads, proving support to the social bond hypothesis; (ii) intraspecific differences in time periods do not reflect the social organisation of species, thus not supporting the group cohesion hypothesis; (iii) males were more attracted to elimination of conspecifics than females, and female's eliminations were inspected longer, in line with the sexual competition hypothesis and/or reproductive behaviour. In addition, we found that the younger foals came to sniff eliminations faster than older ones, and in larger groups foals devoted longer time to sniffing the elimination before overmarking. We concluded that examination of the elimination could be driven by motivations other than the decision to overmark. Whereas overmarking serves to express bonds to a familiar individual, the latency of overmarking reflects more reproductive interests.

AB  - Macroalgal beds are increasingly recognised as nursery habitats for coral reef fish; however, the extent to which they are used as a source of food and/or a refuge from predation remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the distribution, feeding behaviour, diet, and predation risk for juvenile rabbitfish in macroalgal habitats on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Visual surveys revealed that juvenile and adult Siganus doliatus had different among-habitat distributions with juveniles being largely restricted to the reef flat and positively associated with macroalgal cover, while adults were abundant on the reef crest. Focal feeding observations show that within macroalgal habitats, juvenile S. doliatus targeted epiphytes on Sargassum (80% of bites), with relatively few bites taken on turfs or the Sargassum itself (27% and 8%, respectively). These observations were supported by stomach content analyses with filamentous algae being the dominant item in the stomach content of both small (< 4 cm total length, TL; 58%) and large juvenile S. doliatus (> 4 cm TL; 47%). The stomach content of juvenile S. doliatus, S. canaliculatus, and S. spinus collected from macroalgal habitats was similar, consisting primarily of filamentous algae and detritus. We found no relationship between the abundance of potential predators and juvenile rabbitfishes across the study sites. Collectively, our results suggest that juvenile rabbitfishes are using macroalgal habitats on this, and potentially other, inshore reefs as a food source and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the importance of these habitats for the early life stages of reef fish.

AB  - Herein, the effects of different bulking agents (sawdust and mushroom residue), on compost quality and the environmental benefits of semipermeable film composting with poultry manure were investigated. The results show that composting with sawdust as the bulking agent resulted in greater efficiency and more cost benefits than composting with mushroom residue, and the cost of sawdust for treating an equal volume of manure was only 1/6 of that of mushroom residue. Additionally, lignin degradation and potential carbon emission reduction in the sawdust group were better than those in the mushroom residue group, and the lignin degradation efficiency of the bottom sample in the sawdust group was 48.57 %. Coupling between lignin degradation and potential carbon emission reduction was also closer in sawdust piles than in mushroom residue piles, and sawdust is more environmentally friendly. The abundance of key functional genes was higher at the bottom of each pile relative to the top and middle. Limnochordaceae, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus were the core microorganisms involved in coupling between lignin degradation and potential carbon emission reduction, and the coupled relationship was influenced by electric conductivity, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen in the compost piles. This study provides important data for supporting bulking agent selection in semipermeable film composting and for improving the composting process. The results have high value for compost production and process application.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine changes in water-holding and water-binding capacities in relation to the tenderness of fallow deer semimembranosus (SM) and longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscles during ageing. In the study, muscles obtained from 18-month-old farm-raised fallow deer bucks were used. The quality of the meat was determined during ageing for 48 h, 168 h, and 288 h post slaughter. It was noted that ageing had a negative effect on water retention in fallow deer meat. It decreased the ability of meat tissue to bind added water (p < 0.01) and increased cooking losses (p < 0.01), though it also increased tenderness (p < 0.01). Generally, SM showed lower (p < 0.001) tenderness than LTL. SM and LTL muscles were similar in terms of free water content, ability to bind added water, and cooking losses (p > 0.05). The way the meat was heated (cooked in water vs. roasted in the dry air) affected only cooking losses (p < 0.05), which were higher in roasted samples but had no effect either on volume loss or meat tenderness. In conclusion, the main factor affecting the water holding and binding capacities, as well as fallow deer meat tenderness, is ageing. The time enough to obtain tender meat is 168 h for LTL, whereas SM should be aged for 288 h.

AB  - Nutrient conservation and greenhouse gas emission control during composting have attracted much attention. This study investigated the effects of different amounts of superphosphate (SSP) on greenhouse gas emissions and the dynamic changes in nutrients during pig manure composting. Six treatments were used: pig manure + straw (S1), pig manure + straw + 3% SSP (S2), pig manure + straw + 6% SSP (S3), pig manure (M1), pig manure + 3% SSP (M2), and pig manure + 6% SSP (M3). The results showed that the addition of SSP had no negative effect on organic matter composting, and all treatments met the requirement of being harmless. The contents of TN, TP, and TK increased during the composting process, but the content of organic matter decreased gradually. At the end of composting, the total nutrient content of the pig manure + straw + 6% SSP treatment was the highest (6.39%), while that of the pig manure treatment was the lowest (4.47%). The NH3 emission reductions with additions of 3% and 6% SSP were 37.13 similar to 56.80% and 45.63 similar to 77.04%, respectively, compared with the pig manure treatment. The treatment addition of 6% SSP reduced CO2 emissions by 10.3 similar to 20.1% compared with the pig manure treatment. The pig manure + 6% SSP treatment resulted in the lowest cumulative emission of N2O, which was 79.75% lower than that of the pig manure treatment. For the cumulative emission of CH4, the treatment of pig manure + 6% SSP was at least 23.14 mg.kg(-1) and had the lowest global warming potential. In conclusion, adding 6% SSP to pig manure compost effectively reduces NH3 and CO2 emissions and improves compost quality.

AB  - The genus Lysmata Risso, 1816 includes five species in the Mediterranean Sea, namely two well-known species with an Atlantic-Mediterranean distribution, L. seticaudata (Risso, 1816) and L. nilita Dohrn & Holthuis, 1950, and three additional species only known from single records. These are L. kempi Chace, 1997 and L. vittata (Stimpson, 1860), alien species native to the Indo-Pacific region, and L. olavoi Fransen, 1991, a poorly known species originally described from the Azores (Atlantic Ocean) and only reported three decades ago from the eastern parts of the basin. Based on an integrative taxonomic approach, we report the first finding of an ovigerous female of L. olavoi from Italy (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) and the entire western Mediterranean, thus confirming the presence of this species in the basin and filling a wide gap in its published distribution. It is possible that this taxon was present in the Mediterranean for centuries but went overlooked or undetected due to cryptic habits, occupancy of still unexplored habitats, or misidentification with the highly similar L. seticaudata. Results of phylogenetic analyses confirm the exclusion of L. olavoi by the major lysmatid groups and underline the necessity of multilocus approaches to disentangle its correct phylogenetic position. As the species is still surrounded by a number of unsolved ecological and phylogenetic questions, further field and laboratory work is required to shed light on them.

AB  - Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is one of the most endangered medicinally important wild animals in the world. Forest musk deer farming is the main way of production of musk. However, the single provenance and lack of genetic information lead to reduced genetic diversity of forest musk deer. Therefore, more SSR markers need to be developed to identify forest musk deer germplasm. In this study, bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells were used to construct cDNA library for transcriptome sequencing. The datasets were de novo assembled and annotated. 9 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were finally identified and used to detect population genetic diversity. 6.07 Gb clean data were generated using Illumina sequencing technology, and de novo assembled into 138,591 transcripts and 81,553 unigenes. 5,777 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, in which there were 578 repeating motif types, with mono-nucleotide and tri-nucleotides comprising 55.88% and 25.60%, respectively. 100 primer pairs were designed to validate amplification and polymorphism using DNA from fecal samples. 9 polymorphic SSRs were developed and used to detect population genetic diversity of 122 forest musk deer in 2 farms. The average number of alleles per locus varied from 4 to 15 (average = 8.3). The observed heterozygosity (H-O) per locus ranged from 0.102 to 0.941, while the expected heterozygosity (H-E) per locus was from 0.111 to 0.651. All loci deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001). The polymorphism information content (PIC) of these loci varied from 0.108 to 0.619. 9 polymorphic SSR markers were developed in this research. These sites can be used for breeding planning and conservation of germplasm resources.

AB  - We report herein a new genus and species of Pyrotheria, Berracotherium koimeterion, from the Quebrada de Los Colorados Formation (middle Eocene-early Oligocene), Salta Province (Argentina). Up to this contribution, pyrotheres had only been known from northwestern Argentina by a single fragmentary tusk referred to Propyrotherium from the Geste Formation (late Eocene), Catamarca Province. This new taxon is based on a right mandibular fragment with the roots of dp4-m1 and m2 in eruption, and it can be differentiated from other pyrotheres as follows: horizontal mandibular ramus high and robust; mandibular symphysis large that extends posteriorly to reach m1; lower cheek teeth longer than wide; m2 bilophodont; mesial and distal lophids completely separated at the labial and lingual ends; both lophids transverse, parallel, nearly straight, and low; crenulations on lophids; the cristid obliqua that connects mesial and labial lophids is conspicuous, almost perpendicular to both lophids, and it is labially placed; and well-expanded distal cingulum that forms a third lobe. A cladistic analysis was performed that recovers Berracotherium gen. nov. as a member of Pyrotheriidae and includes it within an unresolved clade with Griphodon, Propyrotherium, Baguatherium, and Pyrotherium. Berracotherium koimeterion gen. et sp. nov. increases the known diversity of Pyrotheria at both regional and global scales, as well as its geographic and stratigraphic distribution.

AB  - The misalignment of eating time and the endogenous circadian rhythm impairs the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. Although it is well established that children and growing animals differ from adults in their energy metabolism and behavioral patterns, little is known about how mistimed feeding disturbs the diurnal rhythms of behavior and metabolism in children and growing diurnal animals. In this study, growing pigs (diurnal animal) were randomly assigned to the daytime-restricted feeding (DRF) and nighttime-restricted feeding (NRF) groups for 5 weeks. Compared with observations in the DRF group, NRF disrupted the diurnal rhythm of behavior and clock genes and lowered the serum ghrelin, dopamine, and serotonin levels during the daytime and nighttime. Microbiome analysis results suggested that NRF altered the diurnal rhythm and composition of the gut microbiota, and increased log-ratios of Catenibacterium:Butyrivibrio and Streptococcus:Butyrivibrio. Based on the serum proteome, the results further revealed that rhythmic and upregulated proteins in NRF were mainly involved in oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, immunity, and cancer biological pathways. Serum physiological indicators further confirmed that NRF decreased the concentration of melatonin and fibroblast growth factor 21 during the daytime and nighttime, increased the diurnal amplitude and concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, and increased the apolipoprotein B/ApoA1 ratio, which is a marker of metabolic syndrome. Taken together, this study is the first to reveal that mistimed feeding disrupts the behavioral rhythms of growing pigs, reprograms gut microbiota composition, reduces the serum levels of hormones associated with fighting depression and anxiety, and increases the risk of lipid metabolic dysregulation.

AB  - Although there are several nuisance species of serpulids reported worldwide, the present study shows that some of them have been overlooked even in geographic areas that are considered well studied. We report for the first time in Majorca the invasive species Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the first records for the Balearic Islands of the also non-native species Hydroides dianthus, H. dirampha, H. elegans and H. nigra. The most abundant species were F. enigmaticus, found at higher densities in Portixol (with up to 280 ind. m(-2)), and H. elegans, found at highest densities in the port of Palma (with up to 270 ind. m(-2)). Species have been identified after morphological examination and corroborated by mitochondrial DNA sequence data: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Molecular data show that the same haplotypes have been found in distant and disjoint biogeographic areas worldwide, which is only explicable by unintentional translocation of specimens through vectors (i.e. ship hulls or ballast water). Species delimitation analyses support previous findings that species complexes are common in both Ficopomatus and Hydroides. In fact, only among the Majorcan samples were we able to detect three species of the F. enigmaticus species complex, two of the H. elegans species complex and two of the H. dianthus species complex. The genetic distances between members of the F. enigmaticus species complex are 8.7% to 16.7% in COI sequences. The species of Hydroides hold 5.4% to 47.6 % genetic divergence between species of the same complex.

AB  - Allelopathy refers to the beneficial and detrimental effects of one plant on another plant in both crops and weeds through the production of secondary compounds. In order to evalu-ate the allelopathic effects of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a crop and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) as a common weed worldwide on each other in intercropping, these plants were cultivated under controlled conditions at Tabriz University laboratory. The ratios of wheat to redroot pigweed were, 100 : 0 and vice versa as a control, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, and 25 : 75. The results showed that at the ratio of 25 : 75 (wheat : redroot pig -weed), the fresh and dry weight of roots and shoot length of wheat decreased significantly compared to the control. The fresh and dry weight of wheat shoots showed a significant decrease at different ratios compared to the control. Shoot peroxidase (POD), root super-oxide dismutase (SOD), and root and shoot catalase (CAT) activities in redroot pigweed increased in all intercropping ratios compared to the control. POD activity in wheat roots was higher at all ratios than in the control. Furthermore, the ratio of 75 : 25 (wheat : redroot pigweed) led to increased activity of POD enzymes and malonedialdehyde (MDA) content in wheat shoots. Moreover, roots of redroot pigweed showed increased activity of ascor-bate peroxidase (APX) and SOD enzymes and MDA content. With increased density of redroot pigweed, the soluble sugar content of wheat roots reduced significantly. However, the content of insoluble sugar and total protein increased. Root exudate compounds such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, fatty alcohol, steroids, fatty acids, and alkanes were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The findings showed that the roots were more exposed to oxidative stress due to direct contact with allelochemi-cal compounds. Our results support the hypothesis that increasing the density can reduce the toxicity of allelochemical compounds and that increasing the activity of the antioxidant system will improve plant growth under allelochemical stress.

AB  - In East Greenland, the recommendations for the closure of the narwhal (Monodon monoceros) hunt coincide with a pressing demand to continue hunting for meat to supply local communities. By analysing catch statistics and estimating average meat yields, the available meat from marine mammals, polar bears (Ursus maritimus), and muskox (Ovibos moschatus) in East Greenland can be assessed. On average, there was approximately 426 tonnes of meat available per year during this period. However, this quantity declined due to reduced catches of hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) after 2007. This decline was somewhat offset by the inclusion of new species in the hunt, such as dolphins (Delphinidae), killer whales (Orcinus orca), and pilot whales (Globicephala melas). The average annual meat availability per inhabitant decreased from 150 kg before 2008 to 94 kg afterward. Narwhals consistently contributed approximately 5%-6% of the total annual meat supply in Greenland over the observed period, which suggests that narwhal meat is not critical for the overall food supply. The inclusion of the need for meat in discussions surrounding sustainable harvest levels has been a point of controversy, particularly in cases where an urgent halt to hunting is needed.

AB  - Increasing either inter- or intraspecific plant diversity has shown the potential to engender bottom-up and top-down effects upon herbivorous pests. Nonetheless, because interspecific plant diversity is likely to pose logistical challenges to farmers, the use of intraspecific plant diversity has been gaining more interest. Regardless, studies in this area still show mixed results, including neutral, positive or negative effects of plant diversity upon herbivorous pests. To improve such studies, various researchers advocate for the use of a functional trait-based approach to investigate the role of plant diversity in pest suppression. In this context, we examined how intraspecific and interspecific variation of plant traits (i.e., brassica morphology and flowering time/availability) could influence lepidopteran and aphid suppression. To do so, four treatments consisting of either brassica monoculture (collards alone) or brassica polyculture (collards + broccolis + cabbages), fully crossed with presence or absence of alyssum plants (Lobularia maritima L.), were tested during summer and winter in Brazil. A lower number of cumulative aphid-days was noticed in treatments associated with alyssum flowers, especially during the winter. Likewise, natural enemy abundance and collard productivity were higher in treatments associated with alyssum flowers. The early availability of alyssum flowers was a trait that seemed to benefit more specifically aphid parasitoids. Additionally, alyssum plants showed a potential to be a trap crop for Ascia monuste orseis (Godart) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) by allowing a slower development during its immature phase. Taken together, our results suggest that promoting interspecific variation of multiple plant traits may be more important than the intraspecific variation of single plant traits in regard to engendering pest suppression.

AB  - The larvae of insect herbivores feed on plants that may vary nutritionally (qualitatively and/or quantitatively) over the course of insect development. Plant quality may change in response to interactions with the biotic environment that in turn may affect development and biomass of the insects feeding on these plants. However, the larvae of many gregariously feeding herbivores feed on comparatively small plants with limited biomass and may also experience variation in the quantity of plant food available. Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) is a gregarious butterfly species laying clutches of 10-150 eggs that are often laid on small brassicaceous food plants, including the plant used in this study, Brassica nigra L. (Brassicaceae). A single B. nigra plant provides insufficient resources for the development of an entire brood of P. brassicae. In this study, we investigated the effect of both plant quality and quantity on the performance of P. brassicae when feeding on B. nigra plants. When we compared the effects of changes in plant quality induced by (1) aphid infestation, (2) exposure to pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and (3) inbreeding depression, which are all biotic stresses known to change plant quality, pupal mass and larval development time of P. brassicae were fairly similar. We then examined the effects of quantitative food constraints during immature development on pupal mass, which correlated strongly with adult size, longevity, and fecundity. Female pupal mass, longevity and fecundity were negatively correlated with the duration of starvation during larval development. No significant effect of male starvation was found on female reproduction and longevity. Thus, P. brassicae larvae were more affected by quantitative than by qualitative constraints in terms of pupal mass, which strongly correlated with female reproduction.

AB  - Reef degradation and algae-farming fish alter the structures and compositions of coral-algal-microbial communities. We collected epilithic macroalgae in different reef conditions and damselfish territories. The microbial communities were characterized by subjecting the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene to amplicon sequencing. Metagenomic analysis revealed 2 domains, 51 phyla, 112 orders, and 238 families and the dominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota in both fair and degraded reefs inside and outside territories. Chloroflexi on the degraded reef was dominant and its proportion was almost two and a half times compared to the fair reef, whereas Cyanobacteria was low on the degraded reef. Bacteroidota was dominant on the fair reef, whereas Actinobacteriota was scarce on this reef. For the damselfish territories, Chloroflexi was dominant inside the territory, whereas Bacteroidetes were found outside the territory. Differences in the microbial species diversity and richness were not apparent between all sites; however, species evenness was higher on the degraded reef condition and lower outside the territory. Important potential pathogens of reef organisms, such as Vibrio, Photobacterium, and Phormidium, were found on the degraded reef areas inside the damselfish territory. The farming behaviors of damselfish influenced microbial communities by changing the epilithic algal matrix that harbors many microbial communities. This study provides useful information on microbial biota in coral reef habitats which is further applicable to reef conservation and coastal management.

AB  - New gene mutation origination is a driving force for the evolution of organisms. The effect of FecB mutation in BMPRIB gene on the litter size of sheep has been well known for a long time, each copy of the mutant allele increases litter size by 0.4-0.5. However, the origin and adaptive evolution mechanism of FecB mutation are still unclear. Here we carried on the thorough analysis on evolutionary features of BMPRIB gene and found that 150 species as a whole is under purifying selection while sheep lineage shows evidence of positive selection. The results of allele age estimation revealed that the FecB mutation in Mongolian sheep of China originated in Mongolian Plateau at about 5000 years ago. Due the two shape drops in temperature subsequently, Mongolian sheep migrated from north to south following the northern nomadic people. Accordingly, the FecB mutant allele frequency increased, with the lowest in sheep locating at Mongolian plateau (0.01) and the highest in sheep locating at Yangtze River valley (0.96). In conclusion, the FecB mutation in Mongolian sheep of China originated in Mongolian Plateau at about 5000 years ago, and the differentiated litter size of Mongolian sheep might be the result of adaptation to various environments during the migration following latitudinal gradient. This study may well exemplify selection on an ancient variation triggered by drastic ecological shifts, and is also helpful to analyze the adaptive evolution mechanism of economic traits of domestic animals and identify major genes and molecular markers.

AB  - Religious celibate monks at the household level possibly reduce all-cause mortality risk among non-monk older Tibetans. This study aims to investigate the association between having a celibate monk in a family and the all-cause mortality of non-monk household members in a Tibetan population. Baseline interviews were conducted for 713 agropastoral Amdo Tibetans aged >= 50 years residing in the eastern Tibetan Plateau from 2016 to 2017. The Cox mixed-effects regression model was used to estimate the association between having a celibate monk in a household and the mortality risk of other non-monk household members. Potential confounders included age, sex, household size, educational attainment, household wealth (measured as the number of yaks), marital status, and annual expenditure. During a median follow-up of 7 years, 54 deaths were identified. The results showed that people living in households with celibate monks had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.14, 0.67) as compared with those living in households without celibate monks. The results remained robust after controlling for confounders, suggesting that religious celibate monks at the household level were associated with lower all-cause mortality among non-monk older household members.

AB  - Lizards are major predators of arthropods, including chemically defended species such as spiders. We previously found two lizard species (Elgaria multicarinata, Sceloporus occidentalis) possess different degrees of resistance to black widow spider venom (BWSV). Because these lizards are not closely related, resistance might represent independent adaptations to local prey, or be a deeply rooted trait of lizards. To determine whether BWSV resistance is a derived or ancestral trait of lizards, we assessed BWSV resistance at organismal and tissue levels in three additional lizard species (Coleonyx variegatus, Takydromus sexlineatus, Iguana iguana) representing a broad phylogenetic, geographic, and ecological scope. We mapped results onto the lizard phylogeny and used a mammalian outgroup for comparison. To determine whether lizards might possess broad-spectrum resistance against many toxins, we also quantified resistance to Arizona bark scorpion venom (ABSV) in E. multicarinata and S. occidentalis. Sprint trials revealed that insectivorous species (C. variegatus, T. sexlineatus) were not significantly affected by BWSV, while the herbivorous species (I. iguana) exhibited severely reduced performance. Histological analysis showed minimal to moderate muscle damage in insectivorous species, but extensive damage in I. iguana. In comparison, sprint trials with E. multicarinata and S. occidentalis showed these lizards are highly susceptible to ABSV. As such, lizards are not broadly resistant to diverse toxins, but do possess a baseline level of resistance to BWSV compared to mammals, with resistance elevated in some lineages and lost in others. Thus, ecological interactions with widow spiders appear to have driven patterns of venom resistance across the lizard phylogeny.

AB  - Simple Summary Gut health has been a main topic in veterinary medicine research after the ban on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters. Gut health has been defined as absence/prevention/avoidance of gastrointestinal disease so that the animal is able to perform its physiological functions. A bibliometric analysis is a set of statistical methods used to explore trends in the scientific literature such as number of publications, most prolific countries and main research areas to highlight publication dynamics and gaps of knowledge. In this case, a bibliometric analysis was performed on veterinary gut health using the database Web of Science and the R package Bibliometrix. A total of 1696 documents were retrieved between 2000 and 2020, showing an increase of 22.4% in the number of annual publications. Pigs (34.8%), poultry (chicken, duck, turkey and quail-33.9%) and aquaculture (fishes, crustaceans and frog-15.0%) were the most studied species while a scarce number of publications was found on felines, cows, horses, rodents, goats and sheep. China (24.7%), USA (17.2%) and Canada (5.7%) were the most productive countries. Three main research lines aimed to explore animal nutrition, prevention of inflammatory diseases and microbiota composition were identified. This study will help drive future research on the topic. Gut health is a recent relevant research topic in veterinary medicine and it has been shown to be associated with better zootechnical performances and animal welfare. A bibliometric analysis was performed to explore publication trends, dynamics and possible knowledge gaps in this field in the last twenty years (2000-2020). The database Web of Science was searched and the results were analyzed by the R package Bibliometrix. A total of 1696 documents were retrieved in the evaluated period, showing a constant annual growth in the number of publications of 22.4%. These articles focused mainly on pigs (34.8%), poultry (chicken, duck, turkey and quail-33.9%) and aquaculture (fishes, crustaceans and frog-15.0%) while a scarce number was found on felines, cows, horses, rodents, goats and sheep. China was the most productive country (24.7%) followed by the USA (17.2%) and Canada (5.7%). Keyword's analysis showed that the main research lines aimed to explore animal nutrition, prevention of inflammatory diseases and microbiota composition. This study shows a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the evolution of veterinary gut health research that will help to drive future investigations on this topic.

AB  - Cryodamage affects the normal physiological functions and survivability of boar sperm during cryopreservation. Lysine acetylation is thought to be an important regulatory mechanism in sperm functions. However, little is known about protein acetylation and its effects on cryotolerance or cryodamage in boar sperm. In this study, the characterization and protein acetylation dynamics of boar sperm during cryopreservation were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A total of 1440 proteins were identified out of 4705 modified proteins, and 2764 quantifiable sites were elucidated. Among the differentially modified sites, 1252 were found to be upregulated compared to 172 downregulated sites in fresh and frozen sperms. Gene ontology indicated that these differentially modified proteins are involved in metabolic processes and catalytic and antioxidant activities, which are involved in pyruvate metabolism, phosphorylation and lysine degradation. In addition, the present study demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expressions of SIRT5, IDH2, MDH2 and LDHC, associated with sperm quality parameters, are downregulated after cryopreservation. In conclusion, cryopreservation induces the acetylation and deacetylation of energy metabolism-related proteins, which may contribute to the post-thawed boar sperm quality parameters.

AB  - The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) constitutes an evolutionarily conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases, pivotal in regulating various physiological processes in vertebrates, encompassing apoptosis and antibacterial immunity. Nevertheless, the involvement of JNK in the innate immune response remains largely unexplored in pathogen-induced echinoderms. We isolated and characterized the JNK gene from Apostichopus japonicus (AjJNK) in our investigation. The full-length cDNA sequences of AjJNK spanned 1806 bp, comprising a 1299 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 432 amino acids, a 274 bp 5 '-untranslated region (UTR), and a 233 bp 3 '-UTR. Structural analysis revealed the presence of a classical S_TKc domain (37-335 amino acids) within AjJNK and contains several putative immune-related transcription factor-binding sites, including Elk-1, NF-kappa B, AP-1, and STAT5. Spatial expression analysis indicated ubiquitous expression of AjJNK across all examined tissues, with the highest expression noted in coelomocytes. The mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels of AjJNK were obviously induced in coelomocytes upon V. splendidus challenge and lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated predominant cytoplasmic localization of AjJNK in coelomocytes with subsequent nuclear translocation following the V. splendidus challenge in vivo. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of AjJNK led to a significant increase in intracellular bacterial load, as well as elevated levels of Ajcaspase 3 and coelomocyte apoptosis post V. splendidus infection. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of AjJNK inhibited by its specific inhibitor SP600125 and also significantly suppressed the expression of Ajcaspase 3 and coelomocyte apoptosis during pathogen infection. Collectively, these data underscored the pivotal role of AjJNK in immune defense, specifically in the regulation of coelomocyte apoptosis in V. splendidus-challenged A. japonicus.

AB  - The genus Vincetoxicum includes a couple of highly invasive vines in North America that threaten biodiversity and challenge land management strategies. Vincetoxicum species are known to produce bioactive phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids that might play a role in the invasiveness of these plants via chemical interactions with other organisms. Untargeted, high -resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were used to explore specialized metabolism in Vincetoxicum plants collected from invaded sites in Ontario, Canada. All metabolites corresponding to alkaloids in lab and field samples of V. rossicum and V. nigrum were identified, which collectively contained 25 different alkaloidal features. The biosynthesis of these alkaloids was investigated by the incorporation of the stable isotope-labelled phenylalanine precursor providing a basis for an updated biosynthetic pathway accounting for the rapid generation of chemical diversity in invasive Vincetoxicum. Aqueous extracts of aerial Vincetoxicum rossicum foliage had phytotoxic activity against seedlings of several species, resulting in identification of tylophorine as a phytotoxin; tylophorine and 14 other alkaloids from Vincetoxicum accumulated in soils associated with full-sun and a high-density of V. rossicum. Using desorptionelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry, 15 alkaloids were found to accumulate at wounded sites of V. rossicum leaves, a chemical cocktail that would be encountered by feeding herbivores. Understanding the specialized metabolism of V. rossicum provides insight into the roles and influences of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids in ecological systems and enables potential, natural product-based approaches for the control of invasive Vincetoxicum and other weedy species.

AB  - The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. Recent data support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and its projections to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE -> dCA1) in this process. However, it remains poorly understood how RE impacts dCA1 neurons during contextual fear extinction (CFE). Here, we reveal that the RE -> dCA1 pathway contributes to the extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses. Anatomical tracing and chemogenetic manipulation in mice demonstrate that RE neurons form synapses and regulate synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of the dCA1 area, but not in the stratum radiatum (SR). We also observe CFE-specific structural changes of excitatory synapses and expression of the synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95, in both strata innervated by RE, but not in SR. Interestingly, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. To further support the role of the RE -> dCA1 projection in CFE, we demonstrate that brief chemogenetic inhibition of the RE -> dCA1 pathway during a CFE session persistently impairs the formation of CFE memory and CFE-induced changes of PSD-95 levels in SLM. Thus, our data indicate that RE participates in CFE by regulating CFE-induced molecular remodeling of dCA1 synapses.

AB  - Plants face an array of insect herbivores and have evolved complex defense approaches against various insect feeding strategies. However, little is known about how plants respond to successive attacks by herbivores with different feeding modes and coordinate their diverse defense mechanisms. In this study, we unveil that inducible jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation in response to leaf-chewing insects augments plant resistance and repellence to sequential leaf-chewing insect (caterpillar) and phloem-feeding insect (whitefly) infestations. Conversely, constitutive and whitefly inducible salicylic acid (SA) accumulation exclusively bolsters defense against later-stage whitefly invasion. Through assessments of herbivore performance and preferences on wild-type, JA-deficient, and SA-deficient plants, we show that JA/SA levels regulate plant resistance to both initial and sequential herbivores. Notably, JA or SA accumulation due to caterpillar or whitefly attacks does not substantially affect constitutive levels of the other compound, despite their antagonistic crosstalk. Furthermore, exogenous JA application in tobacco elicits efficient defense against successive caterpillar and whitefly assaults, surpassing SA's efficacy, albeit with associated growth penalties. Our discoveries demonstrate that plants can tailor their defense strategies against initial and sequential insects with different feeding modes. This customized defense is facilitated by JA/SA responses and their intricate cross-talk while taking account of the growth-defense trade-off.

AB  - Although the use of composts derived from anaerobic digestates as soil amendments is likely to increase in the future, there is little information concerning the fate of their C and N compounds after their incorporation into soil. This work assesses C and N concentrations and the associated changes in delta N-15 and delta C-13 during the composting processes of cattle and pig slurry anaerobic digestates. In addition, the compost effect on C and N fractions and plant uptake were studied during a six-month pot experiment with rosemary plants. The results did not show delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic discrimination during composting, indicating a previous stabilization of cattle manure and pig slurry during the anaerobic digestion. This fact was also confirmed by the low C losses during the composting processes (1.2-fold and 1.05-fold for the composting piles with cattle and pig slurry anaerobic digestates, respectively). After soil addition, the composts augmented N values (from 0.41 g kg(-1) to around 0.56 g kg(-1) in low dose and 0.68 g kg(-1) in high dose compost amended soils) and delta N-15 soil values (increases in the range of 50%-156%), but showed only slight differences in C and delta C-13 values compared to unfertilised control and inorganic fertilized soils. Moreover, the rosemary leaves of the plants grown on the compost amended soils presented higher N and delta N-15 abundance than control and inorganic fertilized plants. We conclude that delta N-15 abundance of anaerobic digestate composts is useful to discern its N uptake and could thus be a useful tool to detect whether organic or mineral fertiliser types were used for agricultural production.

AB  - Understanding mechanisms underlying coexistence among potential competitors, and between predators and prey, is a persistent challenge in community ecology. Using 6 years (2013-2018) of camera-trapping data and species interaction models, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of inter- and intra-guild interspecific interactions in a diverse terrestrial mammalian community in Pakke Wildlife Sanctuary and Tiger Reserve (PTR), Northeast India. We found no evidence of spatial interaction among apex predators (tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus, and dhole Cuon alpinus). However, dholes temporally separated themselves from tigers and leopards. Among small carnivores, marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata) and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) exhibited temporal separation, whereas leopard cat overlapped spatially and temporally with other small carnivores. Herbivores exhibited neither spatial nor temporal separation with each other. All apex predators exhibited diel activity and space-use patterns to overlap with their preferred prey. Our results suggest that the assembly of the diverse mammalian community of PTR is a complex process, and coexistence among potential competitors, and predators and prey is likely facilitated by several mechanisms including spatial and temporal segregation, and potentially dietary separation.

AB  - The combined application of manure/slurry and synthetic fertilizer (SF) might be a solution to decrease transport and application costs involving those by-products as well as enable access to them in regions where availability is low. Moreover, their joint application can potentially reduce environmental pollution, enlarge the manure benefits to more areas, and enhance the SF efficiency. However, such a strategy might result in increased ammonia emissions when applied to crop residues. Two experiments were implemented to assess ammonia emissions from stubble-covered soil fertilized with manure amended with SF. In Experiment 1 (E1), urea (U) and calcium ammonium nitrate (AN) were applied combined with dairy manure (MAN). In Experiment 2 (E2), urea was combined with acidified pig slurry (APS) and applied just after sowing (T0) or eight days later (T8). The combinations U + MAN and AN + MAN increased the ammonia emissions, while APS decreased the emissions from U, in APS + U combination, by more than 75%. Therefore, manure combined with SF applied on stubble-covered soil should not be recommended. T8 reduced ammonia emissions from U.

AB  - Intraspecific feeding choices comprise a large portion of herbivore foraging decisions. Plant resource quality is heterogeneously distributed, affected by nutrient availability and growing conditions. Herbivores navigate landscapes, foraging not only according to food qualities, but also energetic and nutritional demands. We test three non-exclusive foraging hypotheses using the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus): (1) herbivore feeding choices and body conditions respond to intraspecific plant quality variation; (2) high energetic demands mitigate feeding responses; and (3) feeding responses are inflated when nutritional demands are high. We measured black spruce (Picea mariana) nitrogen, phosphorus and terpene compositions, as indicators of quality, within a snowshoe hare trapping grid and found plant growing conditions to explain spruce quality variation (R-2 < 0.36). We then offered two qualities of spruce (H1) from the trapping grid to hares in cafeteria-style experiments and measured their feeding and body condition responses (n = 75). We proxied energetic demands (H2) with ambient temperature and coat insulation (% white coat) and nutritional demands (H3) with the spruce quality (nitrogen and phosphorus content) in home ranges. Hares with the strongest preference for high-quality spruce lost on average 2.2% less weight than hares who ate the least high-quality spruce relative to low-quality spruce. The results supported our energetic predictions as follows: hares in colder temperatures and with less-insulative coats (lower % white) consumed more spruce and were less selective towards high-quality spruce. Collectively, we found variation in plant growing conditions within herbivore home ranges substantial enough to affect herbivore body conditions, but energetic stats mediate plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Featured Application Ruminant livestock contributes significantly to global methane (CH4) emissions. The CH4 emissions from ruminants in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are an important part of China's animal methane emissions. This study evaluated the in vitro effects of CH4 mitigation additives with different mechanisms and their potential interactions with compounds regularly used in yak feed. Basal substrates (forage and vinasse) and methane mitigation additives (monensin sodium salt (MSS) and disodium fumarate (DF)) have interactions with the in vitro rumen fermentation and microbial composition. The different microbial population was critical to the variations in methane production. Comprehensive analyses of rumen microbiome may help further understand the diet-inhibitor interactions in mitigating methane emissions from ruminants in QTP. Ruminants contribute significantly to global methane (CH4) emissions. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effects of monensin sodium salt (MSS) and disodium fumarate (DF) on CH4 production, rumen fermentation, and microbial community, with different substrates. The addition of MSS and DF, alone and in combination, significantly reduced the concentration and production of CH4 (p < 0.05), and while with vinasse as substrate, the CH4 production was higher for forage. The highest propionate production and lowest acetate and propionic ratio (A:P) values were all observed in cultures added to the combination of 14 mmol/L DF and 80 mg/kg MSS in both substrates, suggesting that these additives improved the rumen fermentation efficiency. The diversity indexes of prokaryotic microbiota with forage as the substrate were significantly higher than vinasse, and there were different effects on diversity indexes with the addition of MSS and DF depending on the incubated substrate. Supplementation with MSS and DF increased the number of starch degradation and fumarate reducing bacteria, decreased the number of methanogens, but had no significant effect on the number of fibrolytic bacteria. pH, NH3-N, and rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) were the main factors influencing prokaryotic community structure. In conclusion, basal substrates (forage and vinasse) and CH4 mitigation additives (MSS and DF) have interactions on the in vitro rumen fermentation and microbial composition.

AB  - Simple Summary The quality of milk is strongly influenced by its lipid profile. The increase in fats with nutraceutical properties at the expense of those negative for human health, has always been a goal to improve the functional properties of milk. To achieve this goal, it is essential to know the metabolism of the mammary gland and the relationship between the various lipid components. Much is known about bovine milk, while the aspect relating to the sheep species has not been developed. The present work aims to investigate the relationships between the various fatty acids in sheep's milk through a multivariate approach, which can highlight the mammary role of lipid synthesis. A multivariate analysis was used to investigate the fatty acid (FA) profile in three different Italian sheep breeds: Comisana, Massese, and Sarda. A sample of 852 animals was considered: 118 Massese, 303 Comisana, 431 Sarda. Sarda sheep were divided into two groups, based on their breeding origin (298 and 133 reared in Sardinia and Tuscany, respectively). Sarda sheep, bred both in Sardinia and in Tuscany, were considered in different groups, both because in these two regions most of the sheep of this breed are reared, and because they differ in geographical characteristics and in the farming system. The individual milk FA composition of dairy ewes was analyzed with multivariate factor analysis. The extracted factors were representative of the following eight groups of fatty acids or functions: factor 1 (odd branched fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids), factor 2 (sn3_position), factor 3 (alternative biohydrogenation), factor 4 (SCD_1), factor 5 (SCD_2), factor 6 (SCD_3), factor 7 (fat secretion) and factor 8 (omega-3). A factor analysis suggested the presence of different metabolic pathways for de novo short- and medium-chain fatty acids and Delta 9-desaturase products. The ANOVA of factor scores highlighted the significant effects of the breed. The results of the present study showed that breed is an important factor in defining the fatty acid profile of milk, combined with the effect of the diet. Breeds reared in the same farming system (Comisana, Massese and Sarda reared in Tuscany) showed significant differences for all the factors extracted. At the same time, we found differences between the Sarda sheep reared in Sardinia and Tuscany, two different regions of Italy.

AB  - Serotonin, acetylcholine and GABA are the neuromediators most involved in tonic immobility (TI). TI duration, in fact, decreases in rabbits following systemic serotonin administration and in guinea pigs following serotonin microinjection administration into the amygdala owing to the activation of fear-related GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms. On the other hand, repeated TI inductions in rabbits and guinea pigs reduce brain serotonin turnover in several brain areas. Microinjections of the acetylcholine agonist carbachol into amygdala, hypothalamus and PAG increase TI duration and reduces other defensive responses to threatening stimuli in several animal species. The cholinergic and serotonergic systems exert different effects on TI in different regions of the PAG according to the receptors stimulated. Their combined action activates opioid-GABAergic neurons ultimately affecting TI duration. Mammals TI and human cataplexy are innate responses induced by different stimuli, although both characterized by deficiency in orexin, reduced muscle tone, normal jerk reflexes and preserved consciousness.

AB  - Simple Summary: The gut microbiota plays an active role in gut development and host growth in juvenile ruminants and contributes to their productive performance in adulthood. However, the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profile patterns of succession from birth to weaning of juvenile sika deer remain unclear. Feces are a highly efficient and convenient biological sample that can be used to reflect gut microbiology and metabolomics studies. Based on fecal samples, we demonstrated that the gut bacterial community and metabolic profile of juvenile sika deer were significantly altered at birth compared to the transition and rumination periods, suggesting functional changes in amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Our results revealed the key role of the birth-transition period in the regulation of gut bacterial communities and metabolic functions during juvenile sika deer development. The gut microbiota establishment in young ruminants has a profound impact on their adult production performance. However, the critical phase for the succession of the gut microbial composition and metabolic profiles of juvenile sika deer still needs to be further investigated. Here, we analyzed the fecal microbiota and metabolites of juvenile sika deer during the birth (D1), transition (D42), and rumination (D70) periods based on 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). The results showed that the fecal bacteria and metabolites composition were significantly different in D1 compared to D42 and D70, and the number of OTUs and the Shannon index were significantly higher in D70 than in D1 (p < 0.05). The relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Lachnoclostridium showed a significant increase in D1 compared to D42 and D70, whereas the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Christensenellaceae R-7, and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group were significantly decreased in D1 compared to D42 and D70 (p < 0.05). The amounts of serine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, ornithine, citrulline, creatine, isoleucine, galactose, and ribose in the feces were significantly higher in D1 compared to D42 and D70. In contrast, the concentrations of cortexolone, resveratrol, piceatannol, fumaric acid, alpha-ketoglutarate, glycerol, uracil-5-carboxylic acid, and maleic acid were significantly decreased in D1. The enrichment analysis showed that amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly changed in D1 compared to D42 and D70. The glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; arginine biosynthesis; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; citrate cycle; and pyruvate metabolism were significantly enriched across the three periods (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results suggested that the birth-transition period is a critical phase for the gut bacterial community and metabolic function shift in juvenile sika deer.

AB  - In the western USA, one legacy of historic mining is drainage of acidic, metal-rich water generated by exposure to oxygen of sulfide minerals in mine workings, referred to as acid mine drainage (AMD). Streams receiving AMD and natural acid rock drainage (ARD) have a low pH, high dissolved metal concentrations, and extensive streambed oxide deposits. Recently, enhanced ARD generation in the Snake River watershed in the Rocky Mountains has been shown to be associated with warmer summer air temperatures, which has been attributed to expanding weathering fronts that promote oxidation due to earlier drying of shallow soils. In mountain watersheds where complex orogeny disseminated minerals throughout the landscape, weathering processes may also mobilize rare earth elements (REEs). We report that in the Snake River REEs are currently distributed in streams at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mu g/L. Further, analysis of archived sample indicates that REE increases over time are also associated with increased summer air temperatures. In downstream reaches where the Snake River discharges into a water supply reservoir, colloidal and particulate metal oxides are abundant and sorptive processes may influence REE speciation. We also show that REEs accumulate in benthic invertebrates at concentrations comparable to toxic metals associated with ARD.

AB  - Corn leaf aphid, Rhopaloshium maidis Fitch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a prevalent maize pest, causing significant yield losses by affecting all crop stages. To mitigate such losses, current management relies on the application of chemical insecticides, posing environmental degradation risks and promoting insecticide-resistant aphid populations. These challenges necessitate the development of environment friendly and effective alternatives. One such promising alternative is silicon (Si) supplementation, which alleviates a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses in plants including insect herbivory, though it's specific effects on corn leaf aphids are poorly understood. Against this back drop, this study investigated the effect of Si supplementation in mitigating corn leaf aphid infestations in maize. Plants were treated with three Si doses (T1: 500, T2: 750 and T3: 1000 mg L(-)1) and infested by corn leaf aphids. Then, performance of aphids was determined by measuring their feeding preferences, fecundity and mortality rates. Si accumulation in maize plants was also determined, with the highest concentration observed in T3 plants, followed by T2 and T1 plants. Correspondingly, aphid number were lowest in T3 (0.65 in free-choice and 0.30 in paired-choice tests) and T2 (0.78 in free-choice and 0.40 in paired-choice tests). Aphid fecundity was significantly reduced in T3 (6.85 nymphs, representing a 78.94% reduction compared to the control) and aphid mortality was highest in T3 (43.3%), and T2 (30.0%). Si supplementation also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) contributing to increased plant resistance against aphid infestation. The results indicate that Si application effectively reduces corn leaf aphid infestation and represents a sustainable strategy for maize pest management.

AB  - Background: Due to their versatility, goats are becoming popular as livestock on commercial farms. To obtain a high productivity, the maintenance of homeostasis in these organisms is needed. Some supplements that could help improve their health state have been tested recently. The study examines the effects of a turmeric-rosemary extract mixture on the antioxidant status of the blood of young castrated bucks. Results: Supplementation lowered lipoperoxidation and increased TAC, probably due to the improved neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enhanced antioxidant pathways. Despite lowering lipid peroxidation, these products can increase protein oxidation. Thus, while enhancing lipid defense mechanisms may reduce lipid peroxidation, it may also increase the level of OMP, probably due to the accumulation of lipid peroxidation metabolites. The activities of SOD, GPx, and GR remained unchanged, whereas CAT activity decreased. CP, ALT, and AST remained stable, suggesting no adverse effects on key markers of liver function. Conclusions: The high antioxidant potential observed after supplementation indicates that the turmeric-rosemary extract mixture elicited a favorable biochemical response; the supplemented compounds effectively enhanced antioxidant defenses (by improving the neutralization of ROS) without negatively affecting liver enzyme activities. Turmeric-rosemary dry extract supplementation can help with homeostasis maintenance in goat organisms and, consequently, improve their productivity.

AB  - Aizoon africanum (L.) Klak (Synonym Galenia africana L.) is traditionally used for a variety of medicinal purposes; however, it has been reported to cause liver damage and severe ascites, particularly in sheep and Angora goats in the arid regions of the Western Cape. This study explores its cytotoxic properties to identify potential cytotoxic compound(s) in the plant. The methanolic extract of A. africanum was re-investigated and subjected to various chromatographic techniques, including preparative HPLC, resulting in the isolation of eight compounds (1-8). Structural elucidation was primarily based on NMR data. Among the isolated compounds, four were flavanones, one was a flavonone, and three were chalcones. Notably, compound 8 was identified as a new chalcone, while compounds 2 and 3 were reported for the first time from this plant. The toxicity of these isolated compounds was evaluated against the HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cancer cell lines using the MTT assay. We further investigated markers of cell death using spectrophotometric and luminometric methods. Among the isolated compounds, 7 and 8 exhibited cytotoxic activities within the range of 3.0-20.0 mu g/mL. Notably, the compounds demonstrated greater cytotoxicity towards liver-derived HepG2 cells compared to the neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line. Compound 7 (2 ',4 '-dihydroxychalcone) was identified as inducing apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway without causing overt necrosis. The findings indicate that the phytochemicals derived from A. africanum exhibit differential cytotoxic effects based on cell type, suggesting potential for developing novel anticancer agents, particularly compound 7. Additionally, the identification of compound 8 provides insight into the liver toxicity of this plant observed in sheep in South Africa.

AB  - Culicoides biting midges were collected using UV light traps from nine livestock farms in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. Collections were made one night per month from June 2020 to May 2021 to determine the seasonal changes and spatial distribution of the Culicoides assemblage. The influence of four environmental factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed), types of animals in each shed (cattle, pigs, and avians), and neighboring animals (those in the other sheds and their proximity) were assessed. A subsample of 130,670 out of a total of 224,153 specimens collected was identified and counted. The collections were predominantly female (76.9%), though males were also commonly collected (23.1%). The dominant species included C. peregrinus (97,098 individuals; 43.0%), C. oxystoma (55,579; 24.6%), C. arakawae (45,996; 20.4%), and C. imicola (15,703; 7.0%), while other species accounted for the remaining 9777 individuals (4.4%). Trap captures were strongly influenced by seasons and animal sheds. Cattle exhibited the greatest effect on the community, likely due to their large biomass. Humidity and temperature had a positive effect on trap captures, whereas wind speed exhibited a negative effect. Cattle positively influenced all major species, except for C. arakawae, which showed a positive association with avians. A "neighboring effect" was also observed. Additionally, the lowest dispersal ability of C. arakawae was suggested.

AB  - Main conclusionDissimilar patterns of variants affecting genes involved in response to herbivory, including those leading to difference in VOC production, were identified in tomato lines with contrasting response to Tuta absoluta.Tuta absoluta is one of the most destructive insect pest affecting tomato production, causing important yield losses both in open field and greenhouse. The selection of tolerant varieties to T. absoluta is one of the sustainable approaches to control this invasive leafminer. In this study, the genomic diversity of two tomato varieties, one tolerant and the other susceptible to T. absoluta infestation was explored, allowing us to identify chromosome regions with highly dissimilar pattern. Genes affected by potential functional variants were involved in several processes, including response to herbivory and secondary metabolism. A metabolic analysis for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was also performed, highlighting a difference in several classes of chemicals in the two genotypes. Taken together, these findings can aid tomato breeding programs aiming to develop tolerant plants to T. absoluta.

AB  - Simple Summary The spatial and temporal structure of the movement of animals is based on behavioural decisions that promote evolutionary success. One of these behavioural decisions is mating strategy. In this paper, we examined the relationship between the movement activity of red deer stags and the fertile period of hinds. We hypothesized that the oestrus of hinds significantly affected the daily activity of stags. We determined the oestrus period of hinds, which was compared with the movement data of the stags determined by GPS telemetry. The combination of GPS telemetry data and oestrus data for red deer has never been used in parallel to demonstrate how the reproductive activity of females affects the spatial behaviour of males in red deer. Knowledge of the movement behaviour of red deer during the mating season is important information in both nature conservation and game management. Detailed animal movement analysis can help understand spatial population processes as the ultimate consequences of individual behaviour and ecological impacts. The mating strategy of mammalian herbivores is adapted to the distribution of females; thus, it is important to observe the activity of animals during a rut. In this paper, we used a new approach to examine the relationship between red deer stags' movement activity and the fertile period of hinds. We presumed a relationship between stags' daily activity changes and the period when hinds are in heat. We determined temporal conception trends, including the first and last conception dates in the examined population and the conception peak. In the same period, i.e., in the interval of major ecological significance when mating takes place, the activity of stags was analysed by GPS telemetry. The data collected in the examined period indicate that 60% of the hinds were conceived between 31 August and 19 September. We demonstrated that conception rates differed significantly between the first and second half of the rutting period. At the beginning of the reproductive cycle, the high number of hinds on heat (oestrus synchrony) increased the activity of stags (harem herding) compared to the pre-rutting period. As the mating season progressed, the movement activity of stags increased more (searching behaviour), induced by the decreasing number of fertile hinds. Therefore, we found that the oestrus of hinds significantly influenced the movement activity of stags in red deer.

AB  - Pollen analysis of a late medieval layer (15th-16th century AD) recovered in the archaeological site of Kastri (Epirus, Greece) highlighted the occurrence of large amounts of stephanocolpate Lamiaceae pollen grains. Morphometric analysis, by means of Light and Scanning Electron Microscopy, allowed three different pollen types to be identified within the family. In particular, the structure of the bireticulate exine, which is only visible under SEM observation, revealed to be a diagnostic feature for genus and even species identification. This was possible thanks to comparison with modern Lamiaceae species that were selected on the basis of pollen morphological similarity and geographical distribution. The results of comparison, achieved through K -nearest neighbour classification, led to ascribe the subfossil pollen types to the genera Salvia, Mentha and Thymus and to propose S. nemorosa/glutinosa/pratensis, M. arvensis and T. praecox as the most probable species to be associated with the subfossil grains. The significance of such a large quantity of Lamiaceae pollen is not easy to decipher. However, the co -occurrence in the sample of grazing indicators would suggest that these aromatic herbs were probably related to feeding or caring for flocks, in line with the archaeological interpretation of the investigated medieval structure as a shelter for shepherds as well as with the current use of these plants as forage supplements.

AB  - Biogas digestive effluent (BDE) is a nutrient-enriched source that can be utilized as an organic fertilizer for rice cultivation without synthetic fertilizer (SF) application. However, a primary concern is the stimulation of methane (CH4) emissions due to the enrichment of the labile organic carbon, a favorite substrate of methanogenic archaea. Methanotrophs potentially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields owing to metabolizing CH4 as a carbon source and energy. We therefore examined the effect of the application of methanotroph-inoculated BDE to the rice cultivated paddy soil on GHG emissions and rice productivity under a pot experiment. Methanotrophs (Methylosinus sp. and Methylocystis sp.), isolated from the Vietnamese Mekong Delta's rice fields, were separately inoculated to the heated BDE, followed by a 5-day preincubation. Methanotroph-inoculated BDE was supplied to rice cultivation to substitute SF at 50% or 100% in terms of nitrogen amount. The results showed that the total CH4 emissions increased similar to 34% with the application of BDE. CH4 emissions were significantly reduced by similar to 17-21% and similar to 28-44% under the application of methanotroph-inoculated BDE at 100% and 50%, respectively. The reduction in CH4 was commensurate with the augmentation of pmoA transcript copy number under methanotroph-inoculated BDE. In addition, methanotroph-inoculated BDE application did not increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and adversely affect rice growth and grain productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary In the current market, most retailers in EU countries pay pig breeders primarily for the lean meat percentage of the carcass, which does not agree entirely with the quality of pork meat (such as colour). It is well known that pigs are more susceptible than other livestock species to high environmental temperatures. High temperatures in finishing pigs are associated with reduced performance parameters. This study evaluated the seasonal effect (summer vs. autumn) on performance (live weight, average daily gain) and slaughter traits of finishing pigs (warm and cold carcass weights, trunk length, fat thickness), as well as meat quality parameters of the pork (pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem, colour, drip loss, thawing loss, cooking loss, shear force, and meat composition). Seasonal differences in performance between summer and autumn were more pronounced when measuring the length of the phase of the average daily weight gain during the trial. There was also a significant difference in trunk length and fat thickness parameters (withers, loin, and mean back fat thickness), L* value, total drip loss, and cooking loss between the two groups. In addition, the seasonal differences affected the meat composition parameters.Abstract Most retailers in EU countries pay pig breeders for their animals' lean meat percentage, which does not align fully with measures of pork quality (such as colour). In this study, we investigated the effects of season (summer vs. autumn) on finishing pigs' performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality parameters in 24 slaughter pigs. Growing performance traits (live weights, average daily weight gain), slaughter values (warm and cold carcass weights, trunk length, fat thickness) and meat quality parameters (pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem, colour, drip loss, thawing loss, cooking loss, shear force, and meat composition) were recorded. Seasonal differences were more pronounced for the initial age, the number of days in the growing-finishing phase, and the average daily gain. There was also a significant difference in the trunk length between groups, the fat thickness on withers and loin, and also in mean fat thickness. A significant difference was found in the case of pH, total drip loss, and meat colour (L*). The intramuscular fat and collagen content of meat was significantly higher in summer; in contrast, the protein content of meat samples was considerably lower in summer. In conclusion, seasonal effects on finishers' performance, lean meat values, and several meat quality parameters highlight the importance of more profound seasonal settings of climate control to fulfil the progressively changing quantitative and qualitative requests of pork sector participants from farm to fork.

AB  - The nature of the mechanisms that have shaped the animal communities of the island of Ireland remains a pervasive question in the study of the Quaternary of north-western Europe. Archived Quaternary faunal bone assemblages from antiquarian excavations of cave sites are a direct line of evidence with demonstrable potential to shed light on this issue, but are currently constrained by limited publication, understanding of early excavation protocols, and a lack of chronological reference. Alice and Gwendoline Cave in the west of Ireland was the subject of extensive excavations in 1902, which yielded a substantial faunal assemblage and the first evidence of an Upper Palaeolithic human presence on the island during the terminal Pleistocene. Here, we report further results from this important site. Archaeological excavations and a radiocarbon dating programme in 2019-2020 have shed light on the environmental context of the faunal assemblage, the cave taphonomy and site chronology. Nineteen radiocarbon dates are now available, including new direct dates for brown bear (Ursus arctos), giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). The archaeological excavations and the analysis of sedimentary lipids - the first of its kind for an Irish cave site, both suggest that the sediments are primarily of exogenous origin, likely carried into the cave through fissures and openings by runoff or colluvial movements. Our analyses indicate that there were at least three main 'pulses' of bone-bearing sediment accumulation: at the beginning of the Younger Dryas (c. 12,700 cal. BP), in the aftermath of the Younger Dryas (11,300 cal. BP) and in the Early Holocene (c. 10,000 cal. BP), with a hiatus in sediment deposition after 9700 cal. BP.

AB  - The seed latex of Hura crepitans (Linn.) has been used for managing various diseases in both humans and animals, including as an intestinal antiparasitic against nematodes and coccidia in sheep. This research aimed to evaluate the antiparasitic efficacy of H. crepitans seeds, determine the effective dose for this effect, and assess any potential toxic effects on fattening lambs and their impact on blood parameters. Six ewe lambs were administered different doses of H. crepitans seeds (ranging from 0.16 to 6 g/kg b. w.). The antiparasitic efficacy was assessed by measuring the presence of gastrointestinal parasites, oocysts per gram of feces (opg), and eggs per gram of feces (epg). No significant changes were observed in feed intake or body weight. Vital signs, blood parameters, and most biochemical variables evaluated (AP, GGT, and TP) remained stable, with no increases in AST, ALT, or LDH even at the highest doses (4 and 6 g/kg b. W.). The absence of significant adverse effects or alterations in the measured blood variables suggests that Hura crepitans seeds can be administered to lambs as a gastrointestinal antiparasitic at doses up to 6 g/kg b. w. without causing side effects.

AB  - Insect herbivores co-occurring on the same host plant interact in various ways. In particular, early-season insect herbivory triggers a wide range of plant responses that can determine the performance of herbivores colonizing the plant later in the course of the season. But the strength and direction of such effects are debated, and virtually unknown in the case of novel interactions involving exotic insects in their introduction range. We conducted an observational field study in SW France, a region recently invaded by the Oak Lace Bug (OLB, Corythucha arcuata Say). We measured early chewing damage and subsequent OLB damage in four oak species (Quercus robur, Q. pubescens, Q. cerris and Q. ilex). We set up a complementary non-choice experiment in the laboratory, feeding OLB with leaves with or without prior herbivory. The four oak species differed in their sensitivity to OLB damage, Q. ilex being broadly resistant. Prior herbivory promoted OLB damage in the laboratory experiment, but not in the field. However, prior herbivory did not alter the rank of oak resistance to the OLB. Our results suggest possible synergistic effects between spring defoliators and the OLB. This study brings insight into herbivore-herbivore interactions and their possible implications for forest management.

AB  - Water temperature is one of the most common physiological stressors in aquaculture. Previous studies demonstrate that organisms require miRNA activity for survival in various unfavourable environmental conditions. However, the detailed role of miRNA in response to low-temperature stress is still unclear. This study was conducted to construct a comprehensive miRNA dataset for the Penaeus vannamei after low-temperature stress. A total of 329 known miRNAs and 60 putative novel miRNAs were identified. Among them, 17 miRNAs were identified with the most significant differences, and they were found to be involved in stimulation or stress processes. The main enriched target pathways of the 17 miRNAs were the Hippo signalling pathway, autophagy, apoptosis and MAPK signalling. In addition, all the 17 miRNAs identified were up-regulated, suggesting that miRNA by inhibiting the expression of target genes constitutes an effective strategy for Penaeus vannamei to cope with low-temperature stress. The 35-putative target of the 17 miRNAs was related to apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins, such as Pxt, DRAM2, cytochrome c, ATG2B, JNK, ATG4 and API5. The analysis of miRNA expression profiles contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of low-temperature tolerance in Penaeus vannamei. This study's findings enrich current miRNA resources and offer the possibility to validate the involvement of 17 miRNAs in the response of shrimp to low-temperature stress.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of the spatial transformation in the Hungarian and Slovenian pig sectors at the level of local administrative units (LAU). Concentration and inequality measures were applied in the empirical analyses, along with Markov transition probability matrices, to examine the stability and/or mobility over time and the presence of clustering effects. Both countries experienced a rapid decline in pig population. This profound structural change has led to a smaller number of more concentrated pig farms and increased territorial concentration. The degree of farm and territorial concentration and inequality in Hungary has been much higher than in Slovenia, and the concentration gap between the countries has increased. Between 2000 and 2010, the degree of concentration was much higher in Hungary than in Slovenia; average herd size per holding increased by 68 percent in Hungary, and only seven percent in Slovenia. In Hungary, clustering effects were particularly significant, with the pig sector moving towards large-scale concentration. The former effect was also confirmed in the Slovenian pig sector, but significantly weakened during the period under investigation. The exploitation and policy management of spatial externalities justifies these agricultural, economic, and agri-environmental practices.

AB  - Simple Summary: alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors mediate many diverse biological effects of the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. Three distinct subtypes of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, alpha 2B, alpha 2C and alpha 2D, have been identified in goats; however, the characteristics and distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in goats remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the characteristics and distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in goats. Our study highlights the wide but uneven distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in goats. Additionally, our study showed that alpha 2D-ceptor has a better analgesic effect in goats than alpha 2B- and alpha 2C-adrenoceptor, whereas alpha 2C-adrenoceptor plays a more important role in thermoregulation than alpha 2B- and alpha 2D-adrenoceptors.alpha 2-Adrenegic receptors (alpha 2Rs) are important presynaptic modulators of central noradrenergic function (auto receptors) and postsynaptic mediators of many of the widespread effects of catecholamines and related drugs. Studies have shown that ruminants (such as goats and cattle) express special alpha 2DR subtypes in addition to alpha 2BR and alpha 2CR. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to investigate the distribution and density of alpha 2R in different nuclei of the goat central nervous system, selected regions of the spinal cord (L4-L6), and in various peripheral tissues. alpha 2-AR subtype-specific antibodies were injected intrathecally and intracerebroventricularly into the tested goats to block the corresponding subtype of receptors. Pain threshold and physiological parameters were evaluated to explore the functional characteristics of alpha 2BR, alpha 2CR and alpha 2DR in goats. Our results suggest that the expression of the mRNAs and proteins of all three alpha 2R subtypes are widely but unevenly distributed in the goat CNS and peripheral tissues. Furthermore, alpha 2DR plays a more important role in alpha 2R-mediated analgesia in goats than alpha 2BR and alpha 2CR, whereas alpha 2CR activation exerts a greater effect on body temperature than alpha 2BR and alpha 2DR.

AB  - Carlosrosaea is a genus of plant-associated yeasts within the family Trimorphomycetaceae of the order Tremellales. Currently, eight species have been described and accepted as members of the genus Carlosrosaea. In this study, six Carlosrosaea strains were isolated from the surface of leaves of the genera Camellia, Distylium, Glechoma, and Glochidion, collected in Fujian, Guizhou, Hainan, and Henan provinces. Based on phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic characterization, these strains were identified as three new Carlosrosaea species: C. camelliae sp. nov. (holotype CICC 33566T), C. glechomae sp. nov. (holotype CICC 33632T), and C. wuzhiensis sp. nov. (holotype GDMCC 2.526T). Descriptions, illustrations, and phylogenetic data of these new taxa are provided. This study enhances knowledge of Carlosrosaea species diversity in China and provides a foundation for future taxonomic and ecological research.

AB  - A new fuel of Spondias mombin (hog plum) assisted, simple, environment friendly, cost-effective combustion synthesised ZnWO4-CuWO4 composite has been adopted for the photocatalytic dye degradation and nitrite sensing. The elemental, structural and morphological analysis of the composite has been carried out using wide range of techniques. Band gap energy and surface area are calculated with the help of UV-DRS and BET results. The photocatalytic study of binary tungstate ZnWO4-CuWO4 has showed better enhanced results compared to individual tungstates towards methylene blue (MB) dye degradation in the presence of visible light interactions. It is more suitable in the acidic environment for the effluent's removal. Despite of the phonon's contribution, higher mobility could be achievable due to more excited electrons and holes in a catalytic reaction. The detection limit of 26.09 mu M for the detection of 5 mM nitrite possible with the ZnWO4- CuWO4 nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE).

AB  - Simple Summary Different bedding materials have important effects on the growth, performance, lying behavior and animal welfare of buffaloes. In this study, we investigated the effects of two bedding materials on lying behavior, production performance and animal welfare of dairy buffaloes. Our results indicated that FMB (fermented manure bedding) promoted the performance and welfare of buffaloes. The results showed that the application of FMB improved the lying behavior of buffaloes, the average daily lying time (ADLT) of buffaloes in FMB increased by 58 min compared to those in CB and the average daily standing time (ADST) decreased by 30 min. The results indicated that the average daily milk yield of buffaloes in FMB increased by 5.78% compared to buffaloes in CB. The results showed that the application of FMB improved the welfare of buffaloes. In summary, the application of FMB has significantly modified the lying behavior, production performance and welfare of buffaloes and significantly reduced the cost of bedding material. Different bedding materials have important effects on the behavioristics, production performance and welfare of buffalo. This study aimed to compare the effects of two bedding materials on lying behavior, production performance and animal welfare of dairy buffaloes. More than 40 multiparous lactating buffaloes were randomly divided into two groups, which were raised on fermented manure bedding (FMB) and chaff bedding (CB). The results showed that the application of FMB improved the lying behavior of buffaloes, the average daily lying time (ADLT) of buffaloes in FMB increased by 58 min compared to those in CB, with a significant difference (p < 0.05); the average daily standing time (ADST) decreased by 30 min, with a significant difference (p < 0.05); and the buffalo comfort index (BCI) increased, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05). The average daily milk yield of buffaloes in FMB increased by 5.78% compared to buffaloes in CB. The application of FMB improved the hygiene of buffaloes. The locomotion score and hock lesion score were not significantly different between the two groups and all buffaloes did not show moderate and severe lameness. The price of FMB was calculated to be 46% of CB, which greatly reduced the cost of bedding material. In summary, FMB has significantly improved the lying behavior, production performance and welfare of buffaloes and significantly reduce the cost of bedding material.

AB  - Herbivore outbreaks cause serious damage to forest trees. In recent decades, outbreaks of the gall midge Schizomyia castanopsisae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) inducing inflorescence galls on Castanopsis sieboldii (Fagaceae) occurred in the Izu Islands, Tokyo, Japan. We investigated the gall density on the islands and estimated the larval population on Miyakejima Island. We also surveyed seasonal changes in larval age structure, presence of natural enemies, larval cold tolerance, and thermal effects on the adult emergence. In addition, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of S. castanopsisae populations among different localities. The gall density was particularly high in southern parts (from Miyakejima to Aogashima) of the Izu Islands. The gall midge seemed to have been expanding its range toward northern parts in recent years. On Miyakejima, the larval population was estimated to be approximately 158 and 36 bn in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Parasitoids were not found in the dissection of galls. A cold temperature treatment did not affect the percentage of adult emergence. Developmental zero and thermal constant during the period from larval departure to adult emergence were estimated to be 4.7 degrees C and 588.2 degrees C-days in males and 7.4 degrees C and 476.2 degrees C-days in females, and the adults were predicted to emerge in April. Populations in Kyushu were genetically distinct from those in Okinawajima and the Izu Islands, but a common haplotype was found between the latter two localities. These imply that S. castanopsisae on the Izu Islands may be a recent invasion, and the absence of natural enemies causes its outbreaks.

AB  - Simple Summary Hu sheep sperm is highly susceptible to ROS during storage at room temperature. It is very important to use an antioxidant to ameliorate oxidative damage. Tau is an important amino acid peptide antioxidant with a wide range of biological effects. It can effectively scavenge free radicals, regulate reproductive function, improve immunity, and enhance its antioxidant capacity. However, the effects of Tau in the preservation of Hu sheep semen at room temperature are unclear. Therefore, Tau was added to Hu sheep semen preserved at room temperature to explore its effect on semen. The results showed that adding an appropriate concentration of Tau had a positive effect on Hu sheep semen preserved at room temperature; in particular, 20 mM Tau performed best. The present study aimed to investigate whether the presence of Tau protected Hu sheep sperm from ROS stress during storage at room temperature. The semen was diluted with extender (Tris-based) at room temperature, supplemented with different concentrations of Tau (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, or 100 mM), and stored at 15 degrees C. Sperm quality parameters (sperm progressive motility, kinetic parameters, plasma membrane integrity rate, acrosome integrity rate, and MMP) and antioxidant parameters (ROS, MDA, SOD, CAT, and T-AOC) were evaluated during the preservation of semen. The addition of Tau, especially at a concentration of 20 mM, exerted positive effects on sperm quality parameters and antioxidant parameters compared to the sperm without Tau treatment (control group). The addition of Tau, especially at a concentration of 100 mM, exerted negative effects on sperm quality parameters and antioxidant parameters compared to the control group. Interestingly, the results indicated that the sperm acrosome integrity rate did not change during storage time. In conclusion, the addition of Tau to sperm preserved at room temperature can enhance the antioxidant ability of sperm, reduce the LPO on the 5th day, and improve the quality of semen preserved at room temperature. These results implied that Tau had potential to enhance Hu sheep sperm reproductive performance.

AB  - In the present study the expansin genes were identified from Adhatoda vasica, a potential medicinal plant. It consists of two morphotypes S (small leaf bearing plants with low alkaloid content) and B (large leaf bearing plants with high alkaloid content). The difference in the leaf size influence the alkaloid content and it act as the economically important trait for this medicinal plant. Therefore, exploring the expression of expansins will facilitate the molecular regulation of leaf expansion in A. vasica. For the identification of expansins, Hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles of double-psi beta-barrel (DPBB) and pollen allergen domains were utilized and searched against the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Catharanthus roseus and Camellia sinensis and confirmed with BLAST search against published expansins of A. thaliana. The resulted expansins were used for homology-based identification of expansin transcripts in A. vasica transcriptome assembly. A total of 22 expansin transcripts were identified in A. vasica leaf transcriptome. The phylogenetic tree illustrated that the expansins were clustered into four subfamily EXPA, EXPB, EXPLA, and EXPLB. Interactome analysis revealed that the expansins interacted with genes involved in cell wall modification. In addition, leaf transcriptome analysis of S and B morphotypes revealed that majority of the expansins were upregulated in B morphotype than S morphotype. Further, qPCR analysis of selected expansin genes from transcriptome were validated in the young and mature leaf tissues of both morphotypes. Overall, the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the understanding the expansins based molecular regulation of leaf size in A. vasica which will aid in the higher production of pharmaceutically important alkaloids.

AB  - Wildlife damage drives the human-wildlife conflict that threaten the management of nature reserves, and the economic losses caused by damage should be compensated. To estimate the economic losses caused by wildlife damage, the household income composition and wildlife infringement of the farmers were investigated by surveying 36 communities in nine administrative areas around the Sichuan, China giant panda nature reserves. A total of 557 households were surveyed, with a response rate of 77.4%. Results show, about 41% of the surveyed households experienced wildlife damage. The main types of wildlife causing damage are wild boars, bears, and monkeys. Agricultural and forestry production accounted for the highest portion of the incurred wildlife damage. Most of the respondents who suffered wildlife damage did not receive compensation. Based on the data, a compensation scheme was proposed to alleviate wildlife damage in Sichuan.

AB  - This paper explores the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as a disruptor to Britain's beef and sheep supply chains. The assessment of COVID-19 impacts is based on the triangulation of farming and industry news reports, submissions to a government COVID-19 enquiry and interviews with industry experts. We find that livestock farming and farm services were least affected compared to processing, retailing, foodservice, or consumers. Primary and secondary processors continued to operate during the first COVID-19 lockdown but had to quickly become 'COVID secure'. The most dramatic effect was the overnight closure of hospitality and catering and the redirection of supplies to the retail sector. This picture of a resilient British beef and sheep industry may also be conceptualised as relatively locked in and resistant to change. Red meat production is tied to the land it farms on and operates on 12-36-month production cycles, making it difficult to change trajectory if disruptions do not directly affect farming. Emerging changes in agricultural payments, trade post-Brexit, and societal and environmental pressures may well be the disruptors that have far-reaching impacts on the beef and sheep supply chains.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the vital resources for plants and its concentrations in the atmosphere have been on the increase globally from the 18th century, and continue to rise at approximately 0.4% per year. Atmospheric CO2 enrichment could possibly modify growth and chemical profiles of plants, as well as plant-insect interactions. The present study investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on stem diameters, aboveground biomass and secondary metabolite components of both terrestrial and aquatic forms of Alternanthera philoxeroides. Stem fragments of the weed were grown in six Open Top Chambers (OTCs): three chambers of ambient (similar to 400 ppm) and three chambers of elevated (similar to 1000 ppm) CO2 levels to simulate the current and future CO2 levels, respectively, based on prediction by IPCC (2013). Total dry weights of leaves and stems, as well as stem diameters were measured to evaluate growth and biomass accumulation in A. philoxeroides. Furthermore, chemical analyses were performed on leaf tissues of plants grown under both elevated and ambient atmospheric CO2 treatments to determine the concentration of secondary metabolites (phenolic acids and flavonoids). Results of the analyses revealed that CO2 enrichment significantly increased stem diameters and enhanced above-ground biomass accumulation in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Enriched CO2 atmosphere treatments increased concentration of secondary metabolites in leaf tissues, with leaves of plants grown under elevated CO2 exhibiting remarkably higher concentrations of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Total flavonoid content increased by 51.02% in aquatic plants and by 99.03% in terrestrial plants. Total phenolic content increased by 29.57% in aquatic plant leaves while in terrestrial plant leaves the increase was by 61.11%. Above-ground biomass accumulation and increase in stem diameters could enhance competitive ability of the species and its ability to invade and colonize new habitats in response to a future CO2-enriched atmosphere.

AB  - Small herbivores, such as meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), have high metabolic requirements but small gut capacities. Therefore, they should prefer food high in macronutrients, like protein, and low in fiber content. Furthermore, protein content affects various reproductive behaviors, including the attractiveness of a vole's scent and maternal behavior. We tested the hypothesis that the protein content of a meadow vole's diet affects both its food intake and subsequent body mass. We predicted that voles fed a low protein diet would consume more food relative to voles fed a high protein diet. Meadow voles were fed either a 9, 13, or 22% protein diet for 4 weeks. We found that male voles fed either a 13 or 22% protein diet consumed more food relative to males fed a 9% protein diet. Protein content of the diet did not affect food intake or body mass of female voles. Such results may be associated with sex differences in the natural history of free-living meadow voles. Consuming more protein may increase the attractiveness of a male vole's scent, thereby increasing his number of mating opportunities.

AB  - Spiromesifen (SPF) is widely used in agriculture to protect against herbivorous mites, whose residues may harmful to the environment. However, the toxicity assessment of SPF is insufficient. Here, we investigated the toxicological effects of SPF using zebrafish embryos as an animal model. The results showed that SPF exposure solutions at 10, 20, 30, and 40 mu M caused cytotoxicity in zebrafish embryos such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, cell division arrest, and apoptosis, which further led to developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos including delayed hatching, decreased survival rate and spontaneous curling rate, and severe morphological deformities. SPF also induced apoptosis via changes the expressions of apoptosis-related marker genes, caused immunotoxicity by reducing the number of macro-phages and the activity of AKP/ALP and increasing inflammatory factors, and disturbed endogenous antioxidant systems via changes SOD, CAT, and GST activities as well as MDA and GSH contents. Therefore, the potential mechanism that caused embryonic developmental toxicity appeared to be related to the generation of oxidative stress by an elevation in ROS and changes in apoptosis-, immune-, antioxidant-related markers. The antioxidant system and inflammatory response simultaneously participated in and resisted the threat of SPF to prevent tissue damage. Taken together, spiromesifen induced oxidative stress to contribute to developmental toxicity zebrafish embryos by inducing embryonic cytotoxicity. Our study provides new insight into the toxicity assessment of SPF to non-target organisms.

AB  - Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill) is a medicinal plant that all parts of it can be used in various industries such as food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. To investigate the effect of vermicompost (VC: 0 and 5%), as an organic fertilizer, on the morphophysiological and biochemical characteristics of two fennel landraces (Shiraz and Urmia) under saline conditions (0, 40, 80, and 120 mM NaCl), a factorial experiment was conducted in greenhouse condition. After 3 weeks of culturing, plants were irrigated with experimental treatments until 5 weeks more. The results showed that salinity stress induced a significant decrease in leaf area, biomass, photosynthetic pigments content, relative water content, membrane stability index, minerals (Fe, K, Ca, and Mg) concentration, total protein content, and gibberellin concentration of the shoot. A significant increase in malondialdehyde, total phenol, and the activity of catalase and peroxidase enzymes in the same organ was also observed. In contrast, for most of these variables, the opposite results were obtained under VC alone or its interaction with salinity stress. In comparison between two fennel landraces, Shiraz was less affected by salinity stress, while the effect of VC on Urmia was more evident. It can be concluded that VC can limit the adverse effects of salinity stress on fennel by affecting photosynthetic pigments, membrane integrity, minerals concentration, water status, protein content, gibberellins biosynthesis, and antioxidants activity.

AB  - The European protein production deficit in livestock feed is currently being covered by soy imports, especially from America. However, these imports are being criticised for social, ecological and economic reasons. In order to close the European protein gap, alternative protein sources are increasingly being searched for. The use of insects represents an innovative approach, highlighting their advantages of high protein content and good nutrient composition, as well as their sustainable production methods. To establish insects as innovation in the livestock industry, their acceptance along the value chain is essential. The present study analyses the acceptance of insects as an alternative protein source in feed by poultry and pig farmers in France (n=84) and the Netherlands (n=182). The study results indicate that French and Dutch livestock farmers would use insects as an alternative protein feed, because their usefulness and benefits are paramount. The importance of support by family and farm members as well as colleagues is confirmed in this study, whereas perceptions of effort and risk are not significant influencing factors. Furthermore, age, gender, freedom to choose feed components, and nationality do not significantly determine the main effects of the model. Overall, the results of the study indicate a positive perception in both countries of insects as feed, which is a good prerequisite for the introduction of insects as feed as an innovation.

AB  - Seabed roughness in the dynamic near-shore environment is continuously modified by the interplay of physical and biological processes including bedform morphodynamics and bioturbation. We introduce a novel regime-state framework to determine the dominant modifier of seabed roughness based on observed or estimated physical forcing, which are classified by critical Shields parameter or wave mobility thresholds. The regime-state framework is applied to a set of field observations containing time-lapse sonar imagery of ripple growth, decay, and bioturbation. The rate of ripple decay varies in both physical and biological processes. The decay rate is sensitive to oscillatory forcing magnitude and direction relative to relict ripple orientation and time-evolving ripple height. We found two distinct episodes of ripples decayed by 20%-30% within 4-5 days. Ripple decay models and observations did not agree in rate of decay up to and following the same time period. By varying decay rate using a time-dependent diffusion coefficient determined by the dominant decay mechanism, the regime-state framework resulted in better agreement to field observations. Benthic megafauna are also shown to create seabed roughness, excavating dense fields (>1 pit/m(2)) of pits (<= 84 cm in diameter) that introduce acoustic roughness comparable to 8-12 cm high ripples. The spatiotemporal variability of megafaunal pit formation suggests diffusion-based bioturbation models are not adequate and megafaunal pits require additional parameterization to mechanistically model. The regime-state framework presented in this study serves as a framework for future investigations and modeling of ripple morphodynamics, bioturbation, and roughness.

AB  - Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is one of the most endangered medicinally important wild animals in the world. Forest musk deer farming is the main way of production of musk. However, the single provenance and lack of genetic information lead to reduced genetic diversity of forest musk deer. Therefore, more SSR markers need to be developed to identify forest musk deer germplasm. In this study, bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells were used to construct cDNA library for transcriptome sequencing. The datasets were de novo assembled and annotated. 9 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were finally identified and used to detect population genetic diversity. 6.07 Gb clean data were generated using Illumina sequencing technology, and de novo assembled into 138,591 transcripts and 81,553 unigenes. 5,777 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, in which there were 578 repeating motif types, with mono-nucleotide and tri-nucleotides comprising 55.88% and 25.60%, respectively. 100 primer pairs were designed to validate amplification and polymorphism using DNA from fecal samples. 9 polymorphic SSRs were developed and used to detect population genetic diversity of 122 forest musk deer in 2 farms. The average number of alleles per locus varied from 4 to 15 (average=8.3). The observed heterozygosity (H-O) per locus ranged from 0.102 to 0.941, while the expected heterozygosity (H-E) per locus was from 0.111 to 0.651. All loci deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<0.001). The polymorphism information content (PIC) of these loci varied from 0.108 to 0.619. 9 polymorphic SSR markers were developed in this research. These sites can be used for breeding planning and conservation of germplasm resources.

AB  - The survival of animals is impacted by landscapes of spatially varying mortality factors including habitat type, predation risk or harvest risk, among others. Characterization of these spatial mortality processes is important for managing animal populations and their habitats, yet this information has proved challenging to capture. Advances in telemetry now make it possible to monitor tagged individuals' locations through time for a wide range of taxa, providing opportunity to assess movement and mortality simultaneously through spatial time-to-event data. Existing time-to-event modelling frameworks have largely ignored spatially varying mortality processes or have treated an animal's location as fixed at a regional level. Here we present a general spatial survival model for analysing time-to-event data arising from animal telemetry. Our model has a flexible Cox regression form and can estimate the effects of conventional non-spatial risk factors (size, seasonality, etc.), spatial covariates (e.g. habitat type) and spatial variation in risk not explained by covariates on mortality. We show how to fit our model using Bayesian methods and demonstrate applications of our model with several simulated examples and two animal telemetry case studies. Our model produced consistent and unbiased parameter estimates throughout simulations with a variety of spatial and non-spatial hazards. In the first case study, data from 147 tagged caribou in British Columbia, Canada, revealed a spatially heterogeneous mortality landscape with caribou survival varying by elevation, likely in response to space use by predators. Our second case study involved a dataset of 390 acoustically tagged Atlantic cod in a southern Norwegian fjord where a marine protected area (MPA) was established during the study. We found that the MPA led to a shift from mostly fishing mortality to mostly natural mortality within the fjord and that these risks had markedly different spatial hazard patterns. Our spatial time-to-event model can make use of data from a variety of widely used telemetry technologies to characterize landscapes of mortality risks for different taxa. Our work provides new opportunities to inform the spatial ecology and management of fish and wildlife populations.

AB  - As seasonal migratory animals, reindeer inhabit the natural habitats in Arctic regions and have evolved their hindlimb joints to adapt to the complex ground conditions there. Inverse dynamics of the joints is an important tool to study foot functions. Herein, with a motion tracking system and plantar pressure data based on kinematics and inverse dynamics of hindlimbs, we investigated the changes in joint angles, net joint moments, net joint powers, and work of reindeer at different speeds. Reindeer may adopt different movement patterns to efficiently utilize energy and adapt to the demands of different gaits and speeds. The joint ranges of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint (alpha(b)), metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (alpha(c)), and interphalangeal joint (alpha(d)) of the hindlimbs were about 20.73 degrees-28.87 degrees, 40.37 degrees-47.69 degrees, and 24.47 degrees-26.18 degrees, respectively. The ankle joint produced positive work to provide propulsion. The positive work done at the ankle joint during walking, slow trotting, and fast trotting was 8.61 x 10(-2), 9.25 x 10(-2), and 15.44 x 10(-2) J<middle dot>kg(-1), respectively. The MTP and interphalangeal joints both absorbed energy during walking, slow trotting, and fast trotting. The energy absorption at the respective speeds was 12.53 x 10(-2), 13.57 x 10(-2), and 19.90 x 10(-2) J<middle dot>kg(-1), respectively, by the MTP joint and was 9.49 x 10(-2), 7.71 x 10(-2), and 10.26 x 10(-2) J<middle dot>kg(-1), respectively, by the interphalangeal joint. The MTP joint and interphalangeal joint of the hindlimbs serve as the primary sites for energy storage and release, functioning as an elastic system. This study contributes to a deeper understanding about the biomechanical properties of hindlimb joints and provides a theoretical basis for designing extremity robots in extreme environments through analyzing the functional characteristics of reindeer foot joints.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study investigated how different amounts of floor space per pig affect their growth and carcass traits, given that current guidelines are based on lighter pigs. Three space allocations were tested: 0.61, 0.75, and 0.88 square meters per pig. The results show that overall feed intake, body weight, and feed efficiency were not significantly affected by pen space. However, pigs given less space (0.61 m(2)) tended to weigh less at the barn average of 135 kg but caught up in weight by final marketing. Pigs with less space also had slightly higher carcass lean percentage.
   Available floor space allocation recommendations are based on considerably lighter market-weight pigs than currently in the United States (i.e., similar to 130 kg). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of individual floor space allocation on overall growth performance and carcass characteristics of pigs raised to >135 kg. Over 49 d, three floor space per pig allocations were tested: 0.88, 0.75, and 0.61 m(2)/pig. When the average weight of pigs in the barn reached 135 kg, the heaviest pigs from each pen were marketed in four cuts, approximately one week apart. Overall, weekly feed disappearance per pig, the mean body weights of pigs, and gain:feed was not affected by floor space allocation (p > 0.10). Pigs remaining in pens with 0.61 m(2)/pig tended (p < 0.09) to be lighter after the first cut than pigs raised with 0.88 m(2)/pig. However, there was no difference in body weight between the floor space allocations when the final group was marketed (143.9 +/- 0.6 kg; p = 0.13). Carcass lean percent tended (p = 0.08) to be greater (56.8 vs. 56.4%) from pigs provided 0.61 m(2)/pig of floor space.

AB  - Infrared image segmentation in marine environments is crucial for enhancing nighttime observations and ensuring maritime safety. While recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation accuracy, challenges remain due to nighttime marine scenes including low contrast and noise backgrounds. This paper introduces a cross-granularity infrared image segmentation network CGSegNet designed to address these challenges specifically for infrared images. The proposed method designs a hybrid feature framework with cross-granularity to enhance segmentation performance in complex water surface scenarios. To suppress feature semantic disparity against different feature granularity, we propose an adaptive multi-scale fusion module (AMF) that combines local granularity extraction with global context granularity. Additionally, incorporating a handcrafted histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features, we designed a novel HOG feature fusion module to improve edge detection accuracy under low-contrast conditions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the public infrared segmentation dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior segmentation results compared to professional infrared image segmentation methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach in facilitating accurate infrared image segmentation for nighttime marine observation, with implications for maritime safety and environmental monitoring.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, are increasingly used in ecological management, conservation and research. Numerous reviews on drones tout almost unlimited potential within the wildlife sciences as they open up inaccessible habitats to observation. However, the influence of drones on the animals themselves is far less understood, and impact studies to construct protocols for best practices are urgently needed to minimise the potential for stress on target species. The impact of a quadcopter drone's approach speed, angle of approach and initial starting altitude was tested on the behavioural responses of African elephants (Loxodonta africana), along with sustained speed and flight pattern. Seventy-nine approach flights and 70 presence flights were conducted. The speed and angle of approach significantly impacted the success of a flight, but neither speed nor flight pattern had any measurable impact on elephants' behaviour during sustained flights. It is recommended that drones be launched at a distance of 100 m from an elephant or a herd of elephants, ascending to a height of 50 m by using an approach speed of 2m/s and an approach angle of 45 degrees or less to successfully contact elephant targets.
   Conservation implications: This study aimed to provide a significant step towards the ethical use of drones in wildlife research. Further research is required to investigate the impacts of drones on other taxa. Physiological responses to drones, for example, would determine if physiological stress responses unlinked to behavioural indicators are of concern in elephants.

AB  - Simple Summary Corral-style traps for wild boar are used to reduce the number of wild boars. However, many people criticise these traps because of animal welfare issues such as stress and panic. While previous studies focused on behaviour and injuries, this study focused on the so-called stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol levels from trapped animals were compared with levels from animals shot during other hunting methods. Inside traps animals were killed by headshot within 2 h and 17 min after trapping and blood samples were directly taken. Cortisol levels were higher in wild boar killed in traps than in driven hunts and single hunts. Wild boar caught in groups of five or more showed lower cortisol levels than single animals or animals in smaller groups. Therefore, the time animals spend inside the trap and the time of culling all animals should be as short as possible. To reduce stress, it is better to capture larger groups of animals instead of single animals. For the evaluation of harm and stress for wild boar in live traps, cortisol levels alone are not sufficient. Additional information about the behaviour and injuries must be integrated. Capture of wild boar in corral-style traps with subsequent culling is increasingly used for population management. The method is debated due to animal welfare concerns making welfare studies in traps necessary. While previous studies focused on behaviour and injuries, this study dealt with the physiological aspect. Cortisol levels in wild boar caught in corral-style traps (50-90 qm(2), n = 138) were compared with those killed during single (n = 37) and driven hunts (n = 90). Collected sera were purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analysed via radioimmunoassay. Cortisol levels in blood samples were stable under cooled (4-7 degrees C) conditions for a storage time of up to 87 h before centrifugation. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in wild boar killed in corral-style traps than during driven hunts and single hunts. Wild boar caught in groups of five or more showed lower cortisol levels than single animals or in smaller groups. Therefore, time span inside the trap and of culling should be reduced to a minimum, and capturing groups of animals should be preferred to reduce stress. For animal welfare assessment of wild boar live-trapping, additional data from behavioural analyses and pathological examinations must be integrated.

AB  - Florivory can affect plant reproduction by altering pollinator behavior, especially in species with specialized floral structures. We investigated these effects using Senna aversiflora, an enantiostylous species susceptible to floral damage, as a species model. The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of floral damage on the frequency of pollinator visits and the quality of reproduction. We tested the following hypotheses: (a) flowers with damaged petals and anthers are less visited than flowers without damage; (b) healthy flowers have a higher fruit set than flowers with damaged petals and anthers; and (c) healthy flowers present higher quantitative aspects of fruits and seeds than damaged flowers. The study was carried out with ten individuals and three treatments (intact flowers, flowers with damaged petals and flowers with damaged anthers). We conducted focal observations of visitors to the flowers of each treatment. The flowers visited were monitored until fruiting, and the collected fruits were analyzed for size, weight, number, and weight of seeds per treatment. Intact flowers received more visits (43%) than flowers with damaged petals (30%) and damaged anthers (26%). Fruit set was similar between intact flowers (86%) and flowers with damaged petals (83%), but lower in flowers with damaged anthers (70%). However, the quality of fruits and seeds did not differ significantly between treatments. Florivory affected the frequency of visits, but did not influence the size of the fruits or the number and weight of the seeds, possibly due to the species capacity for reproductive compensation that allows the plants to produce fruits and seeds with unchanged characteristics despite the stress caused by florivory.

AB  - The alopecia of Chinese Merino sheep (ACMS) has a direct impact on the economic value of fine wool. It is generally considered to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genomic regions that are associated with ACMS in the Chinese Merino sheep population. To identify the genetic risk factors of alopecia in Chinese Merino sheep population, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The 60 Chinese Merino sheep alopecia cases and the 190 Chinese Merino sheep controls were from the same livestock farm. DNA was extracted from ear tissue using the saturated phenol-chloroform method. The DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Ovine SNP50 Bead Chip. After quality control, we detected 4,8335 SNPs, which included four SNPs that are significantly associated with the ACMS of sheep. We identified four quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions for ACMS. These QTLs on Ovis aries (OAR) 2 and OAR26. We observe genome-wide significant association with ACMS at four genomic loci: OAR2_130068033.1, OAR2_216769207.1, OAR2_128282778.1 and OAR26_29848682.1. After gene a notation, we found five candidate genes associated with ACMS, including CTL4A and ITGAV. These candidate genes are involved in derma cell differentiation, diet-induced obesity, and nervous system development. The genomic regions identified in this study provided a start-up point for contribute to similar studies and can facilitate the potential utilization of genes involved in etiology of Chinese Merino sheep alopecia in the future.

AB  - We hypothesized that the coasting time may be beneficial to the quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes recovered from live ewes, as reported in cattle. The present study assessed the effect of coasting times on the quantity and quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in sheep. All ewes were subjected to the "Day 0 protocol", followed by an ovarian stimulation (80 mg of pFSH in three decreasing doses), varying only the coasting time [12 (G12), 36 (G36), or 60 h (G60]. In Experiment 1, data regarding follicular population was assessed. In Experiment 2, the COC quality was checked by their morphology, brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) test, evaluation of chromatin condensation pattern, and oocyte diameter. In Experiment 3, genes related to oocyte developmental competence were evaluated in BCB thorn COCs. The oocytes in the G60 group had more (P < 0.05) large follicles than the other groups and oocytes with a greater diameter than the G12. Oocyte morphology was similar (P > 0.05) among groups, as well as the BCB thorn COCs quantity. The G60-oocytes presented a better (P < 0.05) configuration of chromatin condensation compared with the other groups and a greater (P < 0.05) gene expression of BMP15, MATER, ZAR1, and PTGS2 compared with G12, and PTGS2 and HAS2 compared with G36 group. In conclusion, 60 h of coasting time positively affects the quality of COCs recovered after subjecting ewes to the "Day 0 pro-tocol" and ovarian superstimulation. Implementing the appropriate coasting time to a given protocol can positively impact the in vitro embryo production outcomes in sheep.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants release distinct blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) upon herbivore attack. HIPVs have long been known to influence the behavior of herbivores and natural enemies. In addition, HIPVs can act as physiological regulators that induce or prime plant defenses. Recent work indicates that the regulatory capacity of HIPVs may extend to herbivore immunity: herbivores that are exposed to HIPVs can become more resistant or susceptible to parasitoids and pathogens. While the mechanisms of HIPV-mediated plant defense regulation are being unraveled, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of herbivore immunity are unclear. Evidence so far suggests a high degree of context dependency. Here, we review the mechanisms by which HIPVs regulate plant defense and herbivore immunity. We address major gaps of knowledge and discuss directions for future mechanistic research to facilitate efforts to use the regulatory capacity of HIPVs for the biological control of insect pests.

The aim in this study was to assess the consistency of convenience sampling order (ORDER), and to study the association between potential factors (i.e., behaviors related to handling, and coping ability to weaning) and ORDER in pigs (n = 325). ORDER was recorded by catching the closest pig in the pen on Day (D) 1, 14, 23, 27, 31, 38, 69 and 79, while weighing pigs. Response to handling was assessed on all weighing days except D69. For D1 to 38, vocalization and attempt of escaping were recorded on a Yes/No basis; for D79, a scoring system from 'very difficult' to 'easy to handle' was used for 3 handling phases: 'Moving into the crate,' 'In the crate,' and 'Leaving the crate'. ORDER within each pen was categorized to 4 quartiles. To study the association between coping ability to weaning and ORDER, salivary cortisol and chromogranin A (CgA) were determined on pre-and post-weaning. The response variables for statistical analysis were ORDER: either 1) the log-transformed percentage of ORDER; or 2) first quartile (1QT, i.e., first-caught) vs. the rest; or 3) fourth quartile (4QT, i.e., last-caught) vs. the rest. An individual effect on ORDER was found ( P < 0.001), suggesting that a pig that had been caught either first, middle, or last was very likely to be caught in a similar order in the following handling sessions. On the other hand, neither responses to handling nor coping ability to weaning were associated with ORDER ( P > 0.05). To conclude, although ORDER is not associated with responses to human handling and coping ability to weaning, convenience sampling in pigs should be cautious as ORDER is highly consistent and long-lasting.

AB  - The Western Liaohe River Basin, rich in prehistoric cultures, is one of the significant origins of Chinese civilization. However, what is the subsistence basis that supports the development of prehistoric cultures in this region? More importantly, which role did agriculture play in the development of various prehistoric cultures? Which factors drive the diachronic evolution in subsistence strategies? These issues are worthy of study. Based on this, we systematically collected zooarchaeological, archaeobotanical, and stable isotope data from various prehistoric archeological cultural sites spanning from the Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age in the Western Liaohe River Basin, attempting to explore their economic characteristics, evolution process as well as driving factor. The study found that in the Western Liaohe River Basin, the cultivation of millet crops may have begun as early as the Xiaohexi cultural period, and domestic pigs and dogs may have occurred in the Xinglongwa cultural period (Xionglongwa and Xionglonggou site respectively). However, during Hongshan cultural period, collection and hunting (cervids) remained the main subsistence strategy. In the Lower Xiajiadian cultural period, millet agriculture and domestic pig breeding replaced gathering and hunting, as the predominant subsistence strategy. This subsistence pattern was also adopted by subsequent Upper Xiajiadian cultural populations, and in some areas, animal husbandry developed during this period. We analyze that the evolution of the subsistence strategies of the prehistoric humans in this region may be related with Holocene climate change. Meanwhile, other factors such as improvements in production technology, population pressure and the environmental impacts they brought may also play a role. This study reveals the evolution process of subsistence strategies of prehistoric cultures in the Western Liaohe River Basin, and is of great significance in understanding the relationship between subsistence evolution of ancient populations and environmental changes in northern China.

AB  - To accurately predict species' phenology under climate change, we need to gain a detailed mechanistic understanding of how different environmental cues interact to produce the seasonal timing response. In the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), seasonal timing of egg hatching is strongly affected by ambient temperature and has been under strong climate change-induced selection over the past 25 years. However, it is unclear whether photoperiod received at the egg stage also influences timing of egg hatching. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature in regulating winter moth egg development using two split-brood experiments. We experimentally shifted the photoperiod eggs received by 2-4 weeks compared to the actual calendar date and measured the timing of egg hatching, both at a constant temperature and in combination with two naturally changing temperature treatments - mimicking a cold and a warm year. We found an eight-fold larger effect of temperature compared to photoperiod on egg development time. Moreover, the very small photoperiod effects we found were outweighed by both between- and within-clutch variation in egg development time. Thus, we conclude that photoperiod received at the egg stage does likely not play a substantial role in regulating the seasonal timing of egg hatching in the winter moth. These insights into the regulatory mechanism of seasonal timing could have important implications for predicting insect climate change adaptation, as we might expect different targets of selection depending on the relative contribution of different environmental cues.

AB  - - A standard visual census of fishes was carried out on Yonge Reef, a ribbon-shaped outer-shelf edge reef, in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 1990. A total of 325 fish species were recorded from 30 censuses spanning all the 9 major habitats distinguished from the outer slope to back reef and lagoonal patch reefs, based on physiographical zones and coral communities. Hierarchical clustering classification and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses, performed on abundance data, individualised five fish assemblages across Yonge Reef, themselves organized into three main geomorphological zones: (1) slopes, split into shallow and deep parts on both outer and lagoon sides of the reef; (2) reef front including the outer reef flat and the boulder zone; and (3) inner reef flat including from reef front to lagoon, a zone dominated by Isopora palifera, another by Acropora grandis, and the back reef flat margin. The trophic structure of fish assemblages largely differed at the higher level of organization. Zooplanktivores dominated on reef slopes, small microinvertivores on the reef front, and herbivores along with micro-and macroinvertivores on the inner reef flat. These results indicated different use of energy sources by highly structured fish assemblages within coral reefs. This study represents a 35 years old base line snapshot of fish assemblage structure across Yonge Reef, which could be used to evaluate the effect of the present ongoing climate change.

AB  - Environmental conditions alter the function of many plant traits that drive species interactions, producing context-dependency in the outcomes of those interactions. Seed mucilage is a common, convergently evolved trait found in thousands of plant species. When wetted, the seed coat swells into a viscid mass; when dried, the mucilage strands strongly cement the seed to whatever it is in contact with. This binding to the ground has been previously shown to protect seeds from granivory. Previous research found both that mucilage volume-and the correlated attachment strength-are higher in species from hot, dry, areas suggesting an environmental component of this trait's function. Here, we (1) quantified the effect of temperature on attachment across many species in a lab setting, (2) tested the potential mechanism behind this correlation by accelerating desiccation speed without changing temperature, and (3) tested whether these relationships introduce context dependency of the defensive function of mucilage in the field, using field trials with harvester ants. We found that (1) increasing temperature during mucilage drying strongly reduced the force needed to dislodge seeds for most species, (2) drying time was likely the driving mechanism behind the loss of attachment strength at higher temperatures, not temperature per se, (3) seeds attached to substrate during higher temperatures or under accelerated drying conditions were far more susceptible to granivory. Synthesis. These results show not only the mechanism behind an abiotic modification of a functional trait of seeds, but that this change majorly alters a key interaction contributing to seed survival. These results add to a small, but growing, literature on the importance of seed mucilage in seed survival and demonstrate strong and largely predictable context-dependency in this trait's defensive function.

AB  - Mexico is the center of maize Zea mays L. domestication with a large diversity of landrace genotypes that are of great economic, cultural and social importance. Landrace maize genotypes are mainly cultivated by smallholder farmers for local and specialized markets of culinary dishes, However, all maize genotypes are subject to insect herbivory among which the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith and the White grub larvae (Phyllophaga vetula Horn cause serious yield losses, by feeding on leaves and roots, respectively. Here we investigated the response of landrace and hybrid maize genotypes to herbivory from foliar (S. frugiperda) and root feeding (P. vetula) insects with five maize landrace and five hybrid maize genotypes. The main results showed that landrace maize genotypes suffered from a higher level of herbivory by S. frugiperda than hybrid maize genotypes. For root herbivory, no clear differences between landrace and hybrid maize were observed and overall, only one out of the five maize genotypes for each type of maize were negatively affected from the presence of P. vetula. In conclusion, maize genotypes respond differently to root and foliar herbivory, which should be considered when developing pest management strategies in maize agroecosystems.

AB  - LIM homeobox transcription factor 4 (LHX4) is one of the genes involved in sheep reproduction. Consequently, this study investigated whether the LHX4 gene affects the litter size of ewes. Genomic DNA extraction was performed on 123 ewes with singleton lambs and 109 ewes with twins. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fragments of 207, 256, 257, 325, and 377 bp were amplified from exons 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the LHX4 gene. Genetic analysis of the amplified locus of 207 bp revealed three genotypes. An analysis of the sequence revealed a novel mutation in exon 1: p.17Pro = SNP. Statistical analysis showed that the p.17Pro = SNP was associated with reproductive characteristics (P <= 0.01). Ewes carrying the GG genotype had significantly lower live body weight, litter sizes, twinning rates, lambing rates, and more lambing days than ewes with AG and AA genotypes. Lambs produced by GG genotype ewes were fewer than those produced by AA and AG genotype ewes. These results indicate that the p.17Pro = SNP negatively affects Awassi sheep's reproductive traits. Ewes carrying the GG genotype are less prolific and have lower litter sizes than those without the SNP.

AB  - Transgenerational plasticity in plants enables rapid adaptation to environmental changes, allowing organisms and their offspring to adapt to the environment without altering their underlying DNA. In this study, we investigated the transgenerational plasticity in salinity tolerance of rice plants using a reciprocal transplant experimental strategy. Our aim was to assess whether non-genetic environment-induced phenotypic modifications and transgenerational salinity affect the salinity tolerance of progeny while excluding nuclear genomic factors for two generations. Using salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive rice genotypes, we observed that the parentally salt-stressed salt-sensitive genotype displayed greater growth performance, photosynthetic activity, yield performance, and transcriptional responses than the parentally non-stressed salt-sensitive plants under salt stress conditions. Surprisingly, salt stress-exposed salt-tolerant progeny did not exhibit as much salinity tolerance as salt stress-exposed salt-sensitive progeny under salt stress. Our findings indicate that the phenotypes of offspring plants differed based on the environment experienced by their ancestors, resulting in heritable transgenerational phenotypic modifications in salt-sensitive genotypes via maternal effects. These results elucidated the mechanisms underlying transgenerational plasticity in salinity tolerance, providing valuable insights into how plants respond to changing environmental conditions.
   Parental environmental experiences induce heritable epigenetic changes in offspring: maternal effects lead to the production of salt-tolerant progeny from salt stress-sensitive rice genotypes, revealing transgenerational phenotypic modifications.

AB  - The parameters of sperm apoptosis and capacitation during liquid storage at 17 degrees C can indicate the quality of pig sperm and the potential development of early embryos. However, the effect of kojic acid (KA) on semen preservation and its mechanism has not been fully understood. In this study, we discovered that adding KA to the diluent improved the antioxidant capacity of sperm mitochondria, maintained the normal structure of sperm mitochondria, and reduced sperm apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that KA prevented the release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, reduced the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins cleaved Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-9, and increased the expression of the antiapoptosis protein Bcl-XL. Furthermore, KA also enhanced the motility parameters, oxidative phosphorylation level, adenosine triphosphate level, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation of capacitated sperm, while preserving the acrosome integrity and plasma membrane integrity of capacitated sperm. In conclusion, this study offers new insights into the molecular mechanism of how KA inhibits porcine sperm apoptosis and improves capacitated sperm parameters. Additionally, it suggests that KA can serve as an alternative to antibiotics.

AB  - One of the main substances responsible for the unpleasant odor in boar meat is skatole, which is created by the breakdown of tryptophan by bacteria in the hindgut of pigs. This study aimed to assess the impact of three different plant extracts on skatole levels in the blood and adipose tissue of pigs, while elucidating their relationship with the hepatic skatole metabolism. Origanum vulgare essential oil and Schisandra chinensis extracts were chosen for their potential to mitigate intestinal skatole formation or enhance hepatic skatole degradation, thereby reducing its accumulation in adipose tissue. Garlic essential oil was investigated due to its established capacity to elevate skatole concentrations in adipose tissue. The findings revealed that garlic essential oil significantly influenced skatole accumulation by impeding hepatic degradation, whereas both oregano essential oil and Schisandra chinensis extracts had no discernible impact on skatole metabolism or its adipose tissue concentrations. One of the primary substances responsible for the unpleasant odor in boar meat is skatole. Enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family play a pivotal role in the hepatic clearance of skatole. This study aimed to investigate the impact of oregano essential oil (OEO), Schisandra chinensis extract (SC), and garlic essential oil (GEO) on hepatic CYP2E1 and CYP2A activity in pigs. In three consecutive trials, cannulated castrated male pigs were provided with a diet containing 0.2-0.3% of one of these plant extracts. Following a 14-day feeding period, the animals were slaughtered, and liver and fat samples were collected. The findings indicate that the activities of CYP2E1 were unaffected by any treatment. However, GEO treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in CYP2A activity (p < 0.05). Pigs treated with GEO also exhibited a notable increase in skatole concentrations in both plasma and adipose tissue. In contrast, animals fed SC displayed elevated skatole concentrations in plasma but not in fat tissue. OEO did not influence skatole concentrations in either blood or fat. Furthermore, the study revealed that a supplementation of 6 g GEO per animal per day induced a significant increase in skatole concentrations in blood plasma within 24 h.

AB  - Microplastic (MP, <5 mm) contamination in the ocean raises concern for zooplankton, as their prey and MPs fall within the same size range. This study aimed to evaluate the ingestion capacity of MPs among a diverse array of mesozooplankton taxonomic groups and species from the central Mexican Pacific, focusing on two functional traits: trophic group and feeding strategy. A total of 20 taxa belonging to eight taxonomic groups, 13 which were identified to species level, were exposed to microspheres (Ms) ranging in size from 38 to 53 mu m, at a concentration of 100 Ms/mL. All experimental treatments were placed in 620 mL bottles and rotated on a plankton wheel for 2 h. The results demonstrate that the capacity to ingest MPs is closely related to the trophic group and the feeding strategy of each species, independent of taxonomic group. Omnivores and omnivore-herbivores which generate feeding currents were the most susceptible to MPs ingestion, while highly carnivorous species with active feeding strategies were the least prone. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating MP ingestion by zooplankton at the species level, due to the variability of feeding strategies within taxonomic groups, and the need for continued trait-based research at the species level. A more detailed understanding of zooplankton feeding behavior, especially in ecologically significant species, could enhance trait-based modeling at a biogeographic scale, predicting areas with the highest risk of MP ingestion by zooplankton communities and evaluating global impacts.

AB  - In the context of conservation science and management, the Judas technique refers to outfitting an animal (a Judas animal) with a radio transmitter or other identifier so that its movements can be tracked to locate conspecifics. Although this term is commonly used, some consider it offensive due to historical associations of the word Judas with anti-Semitic sentiments. Thus, the term has a negative sentiment polarity (i.e., the assertion that words can have positive, negative, or neutral connotations). We investigated the etymology of the Judas term in peer-reviewed scientific literature to outline its contextual introduction and use. Prior to the term being co-opted by conservation scientists Judas [animal] was a common term in the livestock industry to describe animals used to lead herds to slaughter. Subsequently, the term has been published and promulgated through conservation-related research and the literature. Due to a negative sentiment polarity linked to this term, especially among members of the public, alternative nomenclature may be preferred to increase objective and dispassionate scientific communication.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes play important roles on coral reefs, acting as key trophic conduits of primary productivity. Whilst these roles are widely appreciated on tropical reefs, the relative contribution of fishes which inhabit marginal reefs, such as Prionurus surgeonfishes, is not well understood. Here, we examine the extent to which herbivorous fish productivity varies amongst global ecoregions, specifically considering the relative contribution of Prionurus. We also compare the productivity of Prionurus to that of other herbivorous fishes in relation to water temperatures. Our analysis revealed that the Eastern Galapagos Islands support the highest levels of herbivorous fish productivity recorded to date, with Prionurus laticlavius accounting for over 94% of that productivity. Moreover, Prionurus productivity peaked at relatively cool water temperatures (similar to 22-25(degrees)C), although patterns were driven by P. laticlavius. These results highlight the exceptional herbivorous fish productivity in the Eastern Galapagos Islands and the disproportionate contribution of P. laticlavius in this locality.

AB  - Predispersal seed predation could influence the sexual expression of plants with sexually heteromorphic flowers. The timing of snowmelt determines the reproductive phenology of alpine plants at a given site, and it can also cause variation in the intensity of seed predation at a local level in alpine ecosystems. We investigated the associations between predation intensity and the floral sex allocation and fitness in an andromonoecious alpine herb, Peucedanum multivittatum (Apiaceae), along the natural gradient of flowering phenology in northern Japan over 4 years. The developing fruits of the early-flowering populations were heavily predated by moth caterpillars, whereas seed predation was negligible in the late-flowering populations because predator moths concentrated their oviposition in early summer. The moths tended to oviposit on umbels with more perfect flowers, fewer male flowers and taller flower stems. Plants with male-biased umbels predominated in the early-flowering populations. Selection differential and selection gradient analyses showed that greater production of perfect flowers accelerated seed predation, resulting in lower female fitness as seed producers. In contrast, male flower production contributed to a reduction in predation damage, but this was independent of male fitness as a pollen donor. Therefore, having a male-biased floral gender is advantageous in minimising seed predation and maintaining the floral display. The proportion of perfect flowers per umbel increased in the late-snowmelt populations, where higher production of perfect flowers led to greater fruit production due to low levels of seed predation. Along the phenological gradient, natural selection for perfect flower production shifted from negative to positive values, indicating heterogeneous local-scale selection. Synthesis: Our study shows that spatiotemporal variation in the intensity of seed predation acts as a selective force, promoting the local evolution of floral sex expression in andromonoecious plants.

AB  - Simple Summary The Dorper sheep breed was created to thrive in harsh environments in South Africa. Two breed variants were developed in the selection process. The breed gained popularity and was exported to several regions of the world where it is reported to be doing better than the purported locally adapted sheep breeds. To enhance the performance of other native sheep breeds, Dorper is widely utilized in crossbreeding with native breeds. There has not been any research done to examine the genomic status of Dorper in South Africa and Dorper in other places outside of South Africa. The genomic architecture of white Dorper and Dorper from South Africa and Hungary are compared in this study. White Dorper, Dorper, and Dorpers from South Africa and Hungary all have significantly distinct genomes. Different environmental factors and variations in coat color could be the cause of the genetic variations. Dorper sheep was developed for meat production in arid and semi-arid regions under extensive production systems in South Africa. Two variants with distinct head and neck colors were bred during their development process. White Dorper have a white coat while Dorper have a black head and neck. Both variants have grown in popularity around the world. Therefore, understanding the genomic architecture between South African Dorpers and Dorper populations adapted to other climatic regions, as well as genomic differences between Dorper and White Dorper variants is vital for their molecular management. Using the ovine 50K SNP chip, this study compared the genetic architecture of Dorper variants between populations from South Africa and Hungary. The Dorper populations in both countries had high genetic diversity levels, although Dorper in Hungary showed high levels of inbreeding. White Dorpers from both countries were genetically closely related, while Dorpers were distantly related according to principal component analysis and neighbor-joining tree. Additionally, whereas all groups displayed unique selection signatures for local adaptation, Dorpers from Hungary had a similar linkage disequilibrium decay. Environmental differences and color may have influenced the genetic differentiation between the Dorpers. For their molecular management and prospective genomic selection, it is crucial to understand the Dorper sheep's genomic architecture, and the results of this study can be interpreted as a step in this direction.

AB  - In briefSteroid hormone secretion by granulosa cells in the ovary is regulated by lipid synthesis and metabolism. This study found that miR-novel-216 affects granulosa cell proliferation and free fatty acid content by regulating TPD52 expression, thereby increasing the reproductive hormone secretion and promoting polytocous trait in goats.AbstractGranulosa cells in the ovaries of livestock are crucial for secreting steroid hormones that regulate follicular development, with lipid synthesis and metabolism playing key roles in this process. The molecular mechanisms behind steroid hormone secretion regulated by fatty acid metabolism in goat granulosa cells have been unclear. Our previous transcriptome analysis of Yunshang black goat ovaries revealed that miR-novel-216, which had lower expression in high-fertility goats, might regulate granulosa cell function. We further investigated the role of miR-novel-216 by isolating and culturing goat granulosa cells in vitro and found that it inhibits cell proliferation, lipid accumulation and progesterone synthesis in goat granulosa cells. The qTar and miRanda analyses predicted TPD52 as a target of miR-novel-216, confirmed by dual luciferase and transfection assays. Previous studies have shown that progesterone synthesis in granulosa cells is closely related to free fatty acid composition. We investigated the effect of in vitro construction of TPD52 overexpression and interference plasmids on the free fatty acid content of goat granulosa cells using mass spectrometry sequencing. The results showed that the overexpression of TPD52 in goat granulosa cells significantly increased the free fatty acid content and promoted granulosa cell proliferation, lipid accumulation and progesterone synthesis, whereas the opposite was true for inhibition of TPD52. It was shown that miR-novel-216 affects granulosa cell proliferation and free fatty acid levels by regulating the expression of TPD52, which increases reproductive hormone secretion and promotes polytocous trait in goats. This provides a foundation for developing breeding strategies to improve goat fertility.

In this study, the global profiles of metabolites in response to cold acclimation (CA) of three tea plant cultivars with contrasting cold tolerances were investigated using UPLC/MS and GC/MS analyses. A total of 167 and 68 metabolites, which were CA responsive and showed differential accumulation in the susceptible and resistant cultivars under CA, were found from UPLC/MS and GC/MS analyses, respectively. The analysis revealed that higher levels of primary metabolites (amino acids, ascorbic acid, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and carbohydrates) were present in the resistant cultivar. Flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and catechin), which are sec-ondary metabolites, also showed high accumulation in the cold-resistant cultivar. Accordingly, under CA, catechin component content in the four cold-resistant accessions was higher than that in the three cold -susceptible accessions, indicating that catechins play important roles in the cold response. Moreover, exoge-nous epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) application conferred tolerance to freezing stress in tea plants. Tea leaves treated with EGCG exhibited decreased levels of relative electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content and increased reactive oxygen species scavenging activity and Fv/Fm under freezing conditions. Expression analysis of cold-regulated genes indicated that EGCG facilitated the transcriptional activation of CsICE1-CsCBF-CsCOR pathway to improve the freezing tolerance of tea plants. Taken together, the induction of stress tolerance-related metabolites was greater in the cold-resistant cultivar than in susceptible cultivars. This study highlights the important roles of catechins, especially EGCG, in cold tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The tea aphid, Toxoptera aurantia is a destructive pest causing severe damage to the quality and yield of tea, Camellia sinensis. Relying on chemical insecticides to control this pest causes adverse ecological and economic consequences. Trap plants are an eco-friendly alternative strategy to mitigate pest damage on focal plants by attracting target insects and natural enemies. Yet, the utilization of trap plants in tea plantations remains limited. Besides, the effects of the trap plant on the tea aphid-ant-predator community and tea quality and yield are unknown.RESULTS: Intercropped Flemingia macrophylla successfully trapped tea aphids and enhanced the complexity of aphid-ant-predator networks over three consecutive years compared to monoculture management. Moreover, F. macrophylla significantly increased the abundance of natural predators by 3100% and species richness by 57%. The increasing predators suppressed the aphid population and hampered its spillover to neighbouring tea plants. Consequently, F. macrophylla improved tea quality by an 8% increase in soluble sugar and a 26% reduction in polyphenols to amino acids ratio.CONCLUSION: The study illustrated that F. macrophylla is a suitable trap crop for tea aphid control in tea plantations. This legume increases species nodes and strengthens multiple connections in aphid-associated communities through its cascade effects, improving tea quality. These findings shed light on the potential application of trap plants in tea plantations as an efficient integrated pest management (IPM) strategy.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Achieving green, healthy, and cyclical development in China's pig industry not only enables the adjustment of the rural industrial structure but also helps meet community demand for safe meat, thus playing a critical role in promoting sustainable agricultural development. This research utilizes panel data from 21 provinces (districts) in China from 2004 to 2021 to construct an evaluation system for green total factor productivity in pig breeding (PGTFP). The super-efficient slacks-based measure (SBM) model is employed to measure PGTFP. Conversely, regional disparities in PGTFP are determined using the Dagum Gini coefficient method. Furthermore, we analyzed the convergence of pig breeding in different regions. The findings indicate that PGTFP in China exhibits fluctuations, with the highest PGTFP, observed in areas of constrained development. Development differences in PGTFP across China have gradually diminished, with the greatest development differences observed within potential growth areas. Furthermore, disparities between focused development areas and potential growth areas are the most pronounced and are primarily attributable to the super-variable density. Both & alpha;- and & beta;-convergence are observed for PGTFP at the national level and within each breeding area. However, the & alpha;-convergence pattern during COVID-19 is not obvious. Consequently, the formulation of differentiated farming development strategies and fostering the coordinated development of pig breeding in all regions have become imperative. Meanwhile, preparing contingency prevention measures to promote stable and high-quality pig breeding is necessary.

AB  - Memory of past experience is central to many animal decisions, but how long specific memories can influence behaviour is poorly understood. Few studies have reported memories retrieved after several years in non-human animals, especially for spatial tasks, and whether the social context during learning could affect long-term memory retention. We investigated homing pigeons' spatial memory by GPS-recording their homing paths from a site 9 km from their loft. We compared solo flights of naive pigeons with those of pigeons that had last homed from this site 3-4 years earlier, having learnt a homing route either alone (individual learning), together with a naive partner (collective learning) or within cultural transmission chains (cultural learning). We used as a control a second release site unfamiliar to all pigeons. Pigeons from all learning treatments outperformed naive birds at the familiar (but not the unfamiliar) site, but the idiosyncratic routes they formerly used several years before were now partially forgotten. Our results show that non-human animals can use their memory to solve a spatial task years after they last performed it, irrespective of the social context during learning. They also suggest that without reinforcement, landmarks and culturally acquired 'route traditions' are gradually forgotten.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm; FAW) is a generalist herbivore that has a severe impact on crop production. Due to its wide range of host plants, FAW fitness on weeds was evaluated. Field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunck.) is an obligate parasitic plant that severely impacts crop production, and the disposal of C. campestris residue needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, finding an alternative application may be the best method for disposal. In this study, extracts from fresh C. campestris tissues, dried tissues, and seeds were tested for their antiherbivore effect on FAW. The ethanol-based extracts from fresh and dried C. campestris tissues exhibited a lower FAW larval survival rate than the control, while treatment with the ethanol-based C. campestris seed extract had no effect. The extract was heated to characterize the inhibitory substances. The heat treatment did not affect the detrimental impact of the C. campestris extract on the FAW survival rate. In addition, the ethanol-based C. campestris extract had a lower FAW larval survival rate than nonparasitized wedelia [Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski], the host plant of C. campestris. However, parasitized wedelia extract had a similar effect on the FAW survival rate as the C. campestris extract and nonparasitized wedelia extract. This study reveals that C. campestris extract has potential applications as a botanical-based pesticide to control FAW.

AB  - Intensifying drought conditions across the western United States due to global climate change are altering plant-insect interactions. Specialist herbivores must find their host plants within a matrix of nonhosts, and thus often rely upon specific plant secondary chemistry for host location and oviposition cues. Climate-induced alterations to plant chemistry could thus affect female selection of larval food plants. Here, we investigated whether host-plant water limitation influenced oviposition preference in a threatened invertebrate: the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We found that females deposited more eggs on reduced-water than on well-watered narrowleaf milkweed plants (Asclepias fascicularis), but we could not attribute this change to any specific change in plant chemistry. Specialist herbivores, such as the monarch butterfly, which are tightly linked to specific plant cues, may experience shift in preferences under global-change conditions. Understanding oviposition preferences will be important to directing ongoing habitat restoration activities for this declining insect.

AB  - Silicon (Si) supplementation can enhance symbiotic functions in some legumes (Fabaceae) with their nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, such as root nodulation and nitrogen fixation. However, it is still poorly understood how Si influences legume-insect interactions. Here, we investigated how a symbiotic legume responds not only to Si supplementation but also to herbivory treatment with varying infestation levels in two events. We conducted a controlled climate chamber experiment by growing Medicago truncatula plants inoculated with rhizobia. For half of the plants, the soil was kept without Si (-Si), whereas the other half was regularly supplemented with Si (+Si). We then infested the plants with caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis with 0, 1 or 3 larvae and 0, 1 or 1 larva in single herbivory attack and in double herbivory attack, respectively. To understand plant responses to such treatment combinations, we examined 16 functional traits. Nodule number, nodule fresh mass and nodule leghaemoglobin concentrations were not affected in single attack plants. However, increasing levels of herbivory led to decreases in such measured traits in double attack plants. Foliar C to N ratio increased in single attack plants but decreased in double attack plants with increasing levels of herbivory, indicating contrasting resource allocation. Herbivory did not affect the content of foliar Si, which was higher in +Si than -Si plants. Si and herbivory led to reduced foliar phenolics in double attack plants, suggesting a potential trade-off between silicification and phenolic production. Si and herbivory led to increased trichome densities in single attack plants, but patterns were less clear in double attack plants. Herbivory but not Si reduced plant biomass with increasing levels of herbivory in double attack plants. Relative growth rates of the caterpillars, as proxy for plant resistance, decreased mainly due to herbivory treatment, when fed on single attack plants. Using a trait-based approach, we provide novel insights to better understand the response of a legume to Si supplementation and different herbivory levels and events. We conclude that herbivory predominantly exerts much stronger effects than Si on various plant traits, pointing to a necessity to respond to herbivory by induced defence strategies.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The cost of reproduction on demographic rates is often assumed to operate through changing body condition. Several studies have found that reproduction depresses body mass more if the current conditions are severe, such as high population densities or adverse weather, than under benign environmental conditions. However, few studies have investigated the association between the fitness components and body mass costs of reproduction. Using 25 years of individual-based capture-recapture data from Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus, we built a novel Bayesian state-space model that jointly estimated interannual change in mass, annual reproductive success and survival, while accounting for incomplete observations. The model allowed us to partition the differential effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on both non-reproductive mass change and the body mass cost of reproduction, and to quantify their consequences on demographic rates. Contrary to our expectation, the body mass cost of reproduction (mean = -5.8 kg) varied little between years (CV = 0.08), whereas the between-year variation in body mass changes, that were independent of the previous year's reproductive state, varied substantially (CV = 0.4) in relation to autumn temperature and the amount of rain-on-snow in winter. This body mass loss led to a cost of reproduction on the next reproduction, which was amplified by the same environmental covariates, from a 10% reduction in reproductive success in benign years, to a 50% reduction in harsh years. The reproductive mass loss also resulted in a small reduction in survival. Our results show how demographic costs of reproduction, driven by interannual fluctuations in individual body condition, result from the balance between body mass costs of reproduction and body mass changes that are independent of previous reproductive state. We illustrate how a strong context-dependent fitness cost of reproduction can occur, despite a relatively fixed body mass cost of reproduction. This suggests that female reindeer display a very conservative energy allocation strategy, either aborting their reproductive attempt at an early stage or weaning at a relatively constant cost. Such a strategy might be common in species living in a highly stochastic and food limited environment.

AB  - In brief: Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is essential for early placenta development in sheep. This study shows that the mechanistic target of rapamycin is the key modulator of trophoblast adaptive response under FGF2 modulation. During the early stage of placentation in sheep, normal conceptus development is affected by trophoblast cell functionality, whose dysregulation results in early pregnancy loss. Trophoblast metabolism is supported mainly by histotrophic factors, including fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), which are involved in cell differentiation and function through the modulation of specific cellular mechanisms. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known as a cellular 'nutrient sensor', but its downstream regulation remains poorly understood. The hypothesis was that during trophoblast development, the FGF2 effect is mediated by mTOR signalling pathway modulation. Primary trophoblast cells from 21-day-old sheep placenta were characterised and subjected to FGF2 and rapamycin treatment to study the effects on cell functionality and gene and protein expression profiles. The model showed mainly mononuclear cells with epithelial cell-like growth and placental morphological properties, expressing typical trophoblast markers. FGF2 promoted cell proliferation and migration under normal culture conditions, whereas mTOR inhibition reversed this effect. When the mTOR signalling pathway was activated, FGF2 failed to influence invasion activity. mTOR inhibition significantly reduced cell motility, but FGF2 supplementation restored motility even when mTOR was inhibited. Interestingly, mTOR inhibition influenced endocrine trophoblast marker regulation. Although FGF2 supplementation did not affect ovine placenta lactogen expression, as observed in the control, interferon-tau was drastically reduced. This study provides new insights into the mechanism underlying mTOR inhibitory effects on trophoblast cell functionality. In addition, as mTOR is involved in the expression of hormonal trophoblast markers, it may play a crucial role in early placenta growth and fetal-maternal crosstalk.

AB  - In insects, ecological competition has often resulted in phenotypic changes and modifications to foraging areas. In termites-and social insects as a whole-colonies cannot easily escape competition through the relocation of their colony. In these species, the outcomes of inter and intra-specific competition are influenced by different life history traits, such as colony size, breeding system (number and types of reproductives), food preference, tunneling patterns, nest site selection, and antagonism between colonies. Here, we investigated variation in breeding system and spatial distribution among colonies of a higher termite Amitermes parvulus and a subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes within an urban landscape. We first developed microsatellite markers as a tool to study these life history traits in A. parvulus. Second, we assessed competitive exclusion or tolerance of A. parvulus and R. flavipes colonies by determining their fine-scale distribution using monitoring stations on a grid site, and their large-scale distribution across an urban landscape. Third, we investigated the breeding system of A. parvulus colonies. We showed that the numerous colonies of R. flavipes inhabiting a restricted area contrast with the few, but spatially expansive colonies of A. parvulus, suggesting these species face different degrees of intra-specific competition. We showed that colonies of A. parvulus frequently merged together, and all of them were likely headed by inbred neotenic reproductives, two characteristics rarely observed in higher termites. Overall, our study revealed drastic differences in colony structure, breeding systems and foraging ranges between the two species. These differences may reflect differences in food preference and food availability between the two species allowing their co-existence within the same urban environment.

AB  - Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) accumulate in top predators, reaching high levels associated with negative physiological effects. Measuring OCs is key for assessing the accumulation of their loads and evaluating the efficiency of contaminant regulations. Some OCs generate specific signatures in certain areas, which allow us to track potential movements and feeding habits of species. Thirty-five blubber biopsies were taken from northern elephant seals (NES) during fall at Guadalupe Island (GI), Mexico, an important site for hauling-out, molting, and breeding. Biopsies were analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (tDDTs), hexachlorobenzene, chlordanes, and total PCB congeners (tPCBs). tDDTs were higher in adults than in juveniles, suggesting age class-based bioaccumulation, related to time and differences in foraging and habitat use between age groups. Females had higher variability of OCs than males, attributed to multiple causes, including variation in the use of foraging grounds and niche segregation. The DDT:PCB ratios were the highest, showing similarity with the Palos Verdes (California) contaminant signature, suggesting the use of similar feeding areas in relation to juvenile NES from Southern California.Our baseline of OC levels for NES at GI, allows future monitoring of changes in legacy contaminants over time, and the evaluation of the efficiency of their regulations.

AB  - Pseudobatos prahli is considered a low-medium fishing importance species in Ecuador, caught as target species and bycatch in both artisanal and industrial fisheries. Despite its importance, some basic aspects of its biology remain unknown, turning its study a priority. The aim of the present research was to describe for the first time the reproductive biology of P. prahli based on the analysis of individuals landed in the port of Santa Rosa, Province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. A total of 96 females and 165 males were sampled from January 2013 to January 2014. Females presented larger sizes (51-86 cm total length, TL) than males (51-78 cm TL), but no significant differences were found between the mean sizes of both sexes. The sexual proportion of landed individuals (0.6F:1M) suggested that free-living individuals segregate by sex, however, sex proportion of embryos was similar to the proportion 1F:1M. The number of mature individuals (64%) in the landings was larger than the immature ones (36%). Mean size at maturity (L-50) of females (65.9 cm TL) was also slightly larger than that for males (61.8 cm TL). Size at birth was estimated at 22.5 cm TL. Ovarian fecundity ranged from 1 to10 and uterine fecundity from 1 to 6, and a positive but low linear relationship was found between both fecundity estimates and maternal size. Based on the comparison of some reproductive parameters, such as mean size at maturity, gestation period and fecundity, it can be concluded that P. prahli is one of the species with lowest biological productivity among the species of the same genus.

AB  - Simple Summary By the 19th century, adequately producing, independent domestic animal breeds had developed in many regions around the globe. However, from the middle of the 20th century they have largely been replaced by high-performing, specialized, single-purpose cosmopolitan breeds. Breed maintenance is an activity aimed at rescuing old breeds from the threat of extinction. This process includes recording the valuable traits of a rare breed, specific diversity conservation selection, and utilization in the original production environment. Additionally, it deals with the history of breeds and the study of their genetic makeup. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the maternal genetic background of two autochthonous sheep breeds in Hungary. The aim of our research was the evaluation of the maternal genetic background of two Hungarian autochthonous sheep breeds of different geographical origin. A major argument for the preservation of endangered animal breeds is their documented past and historical importance. These also include the registration of pedigree data. This is the first study to evaluate and compare Tsigai and Cikta sheep in Hungary. Our investigation is based on two complete sequences of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b gene and control region). Our research was performed on these two sheep breeds with markedly different breed histories and breed characteristics to determine a possible common maternal genetic background, as ultimately the origin of both breeds can be traced back to Asia Minor. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 203 biological samples were taken using a newly introduced founder sampling method. We found that the prevailing haplogroup B accounted for over 80% of both breeds, strengthening the common ancestral root. However, the pairwise genetic differentiation estimates (K-ST) calculated using the sequence-based statistics for cytochrome b gene and control region were 0.034 and 0.021, respectively (both at level p < 0.05); thus, revealing genetic differentiation in both sequences between the Tsigai and Cikta. We note that the known different history of the breeds is clearly justified by the currently studied deviations in their maternal genetic background.

AB  - Crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) are among the most prominent corallivorous invertebrates, contributing greatly to the plight of tropical coral reefs in the Anthropocene. Much of the success of CoTS, and their propensity to undergo major population irruptions, are likely tied to inherent biological traits. Juvenile CoTS feed on coralline algae prior to their ontogenetic switch to corallivory, but their feeding preferences for specific algae and the implications thereof remain unresolved. Here, we conducted 48-hour multiple-choice and 28-day no-choice experiments to compare the selection and consumption of different crustose coralline algae (CCA) diets by juvenile western Pacific CoTS (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and test for concomitant differences in growth rates. In the multiple-choice experiment, juvenile CoTS preferentially consumed the alga Melyvonnea cf. madagascariensis, whilst avoiding Sporolithon sp., Lithophyllum cf. kotschyanum, and Adeylithon cf. bosencei. Daily consumption rates during the no-choice experiment varied substantially among CCA species, ranging from 15.31 mm2 ind-1 d-1 (+/- 2.68) (mean +/- SE) for M. cf. madagascariensis to 1.38 mm2 ind-1 d-1 (+/- 0.24) for Sporolithon sp. This preferential consumption of different CCA corresponded well with large differences observed in the surface area growth rate of CoTS, ranging from 3.01% d-1 (+/- 0.30) to 0.08% d-1 (+/- 0.33) for juveniles feeding on M. cf. madagascariensis and Sporolithon sp., respectively. Organic carbon and nitrogen content of different CCA species did not influence CCA consumption rates or CoTS growth rates. However, CoTS growth rates were positively correlated with daily consumption rates of both organic carbon and nitrogen due to preferential feeding. Our results suggest that the prevalence and consumption of some CCA species, particularly M. cf. madagascariensis, a species that is common on mid-shelf reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, may boost early post-settlement growth and survival of herbivorous juveniles, and thereby contribute to the population build-up of CoTS.

AB  - Small reservoirs are recognised as the most productive man-made ecosystem inhabiting diverse flora and fauna, having a scope for small-scale fisheries to support food security, livelihood, and many other ecological services. This study aimed to determine the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Maphou Reservoir, located in the Northeastern Hill region, India, using the Ecopath mass-balance modelling approach, to figure out the strategic scientific ecosystem-based fisheries management. Ten functional groups were identified, most of which were confined in trophic level II (low order primary consumer). Exotic fish was the most utilized group based on ecotrophic efficiency (EE = 0.782), followed by herbivorous fish (EE = 0.623), and carnivorous fish group are found to be the keystone species. Based on the mixed trophic index (MTI), lower trophic level functional groups (detritus and phytoplankton) had a positive impact on the higher trophic levels, manifesting a 'bottom-up control' ecosystem. The reservoir is a primary producer-driven ecosystem (transfer efficiency from primary producer, PP = 4.864%), and mean transfer efficiency is low (4.732%), indicating scope for enhancing the fish stock sizes. The total primary producer/total respiration (TPP/TR) (3.629) and total primary producer/total biomass (TPP/TB) (70.70) suggested that the reservoir is in immature and developing ecosystem with high resilience against external perturbations (Overhead = 63.25%). The reservoir shows a moderately complex food web structure (connectance index = 0.457). The study recommended management measures for stocking enhancement of detritivores (Cirrhinus mrigala, Cyprinus carpio) and phyto-planktivorous fishes (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, H. nobilis) to improve ecosystem efficiency; both groups have fairly low EE (detritus EE = 0.105 and phytoplankton EE = 0.379). These findings will be an essential input for policy formulation and scientific management of the small reservoir ecosystems in the tropics.

AB  - Purpose A controlled study evaluated the effect of condensed tannins (CT) from Gymnopodium floribundum leaf meal (GF), infection with Haemonchus contortus (I) and their interaction, on feed intake, diet digestibility and retention of N (NR) and energy (ER) in hair sheep lambs. Methods Thirty-six, worm-free hair sheep lambs (14.9 +/- 1.56 kg body weight) were housed in metabolic cages. Eighteen animals were infected with 6000 H. contortus L-3, while other 18 lambs were kept non-infected. On day 28th post-infection (PI), infected lambs were assigned to three diet groups: a diet without GF (I-NONGF), a diet with GF (I + GF) and a diet with GF + polyethylene glycol (PEG) (I + GF + PEG). Non-infected (NI) lambs were assigned to similar diet groups: NI-NONGF, NI + GF and NI + GF + PEG. The packed cell volume (% PCV), ante-mortem faecal egg counts and post-mortem worm burdens were also evaluated. Results Infection did not affect digestibility, NR and ER. Meanwhile, CT intake from the GF diet reduced the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein, as well as NR, compared to lambs consuming the NONGF and GF + PEG diets (P < 0.05). Although, the digestible energy was similar between lambs consuming NONGF and GF + PEG diets, the ER was higher for lambs consuming the control NONGF diet. Diets did not affect the PCV, or the ante-mortem and post-mortem parasitological variables. Conclusion The costs on N and energy metabolism were mainly associated with the CT content of the GF diet, but other features of the diet such as the high lignin content, seemed to affect animals consuming GF meal. Meanwhile, the H. contortus infection had a non-significant impact.

AB  - Heat stress can adversely affect the rumen environment and the growth performance of goats. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), Clostridium butyricum (CB), and their mixture on B-vitamin production in the rumen and the growth performance of heat-stressed goats. Firstly, twelve Macheng x Boer crossed goats (24.21 +/- 2.05 kg, control) were modeled to become heat-stressed goats (HS1). Then, the B-vitamin concentrations in the rumen and the parameters of growth performance were measured in goats. The results showed that heat stress could cause significantly decreased vitamin B1, B2, B6, B12, and niacin concentrations (p < 0.05). It also could cause a significantly reduced dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) (p < 0.05). However, the digestibilities of DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in HS1 compared to controls. Then, these twelve heat-stressed goats were divided equally into four groups: control group (HS2, no probiotic supplemented), SC group (0.30% SC supplemented to the basal diet), CB group (0.05% CB supplemented to the basal diet), and mix group (0.30% SC and 0.05% CB supplemented to the basal diet). They were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experimental design. The results showed that the concentrations of vitamins B1, B2, and niacin in the rumen and the DMI, ADG, and the digestibility of DM, NDF, and ADF were significantly increased (p < 0.05) with SC, CB, and their mixture supplementation (p < 0.05). These results suggest that dietary supplementation with SC and CB could improve B-vitamin production in the rumen and the growth performance of heat-stressed goats.

AB  - In order to determine the ideal conditions for the application of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) in agricultural production, this review studies the effects of nZVI application on plant physiological parameters, presents its mechanism and prospective outcomes. In this research, it was observed that the application of nZVI had both favorable and unfavorable effects on plant growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress, and nutrient absorption levels. Specifically, the application of nZVI significantly increased the biomass and length of plants, and greatly reduced the germination rate of seeds. In terms of photosynthesis, there was no significant effect for the application of nZVI on the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids). In terms of oxidative stress, plants respond by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme under mild nZVI stress and trigger oxidative burst under severe stress. In addition, the application of nZVI significantly increased the ab-sorption of nutrients (B, K, P, S, Mg, Zn, and Fe). In summary, the application of nZVI can affect the plant physiological parameters, and the degree of influence varies depending on the concentration, preparation method, application method, particle size, and action time of nZVI. These findings are important for evaluating nZVI-related risks and enhancing nZVI safety in agricultural production.

AB  - We describe the first maxillae and additional new specimens of Reigitherium bunodontum, a small meridiolestidan from the Late Cretaceous La Colonia Formation, Patagonia, Argentina. The new material supports a dental formula of I?, C1, P4, M3, resolves postcanine positional uncertainty and corrects previous interpretations. Our phylogeny recovers Reigitherium as a meridiolestidan allied to other bunodont Mesungulatoidea, as the sister group of the Paleocene Peligrotherium. Posterior premolars/molars of Reigitherium, and to a smaller degree Peligrotherium, are dominated by an incomplete transverse ridge running between the protoconid-metaconid in the lowers and the paracone-stylocone in the uppers, semi-symmetrical basins developing mesially and distally from these central ridges. The trigonid-derived single transverse crest results from a mesial shift of the robust metaconid, an enhancement of the basin crest stretching from the protoconid/metaconid, and a shallower trigonid basin. The mesungulatoid condition, with its complete absence of talonid, contrasts sharply with that of therians with lophs, or transverse ridges, which involved at least one talonid-derived loph resulting in two transverse crests per tooth. Mesungulatoid meridiolestidans achieved complex tooth-on-tooth occlusion with a predicted increase in herbivory/omnivory, departing from the traditional sharp-cusp insectivores plesiomorphic for meridiolestidans and Mesozoic mammals in general. Reigitherium's dramatic remodeling of the primitive meridiolestidan molar morphology, extensive continuous occlusal surface, accessory cuspules, and highly textured crenulated enamel illustrates one of most distinctive adaptations to herbivory among Mesozoic mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination is widely used for pig reproduction. Boar spermatozoa for use in artificial insemination are usually preserved at 17 degrees C for several days. Storage at lower temperature would be beneficial to reduce the risk of bacterial growth but is hindered by the high chilling sensitivity of boar spermatozoa. Currently, new preservation concepts are evolving which aim to store boar sperm at 5 degrees C. Before introducing these for animal breeding, sensitive tests are necessary to detect chilling-induced sperm damage. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of two tests systems for detecting sperm injury after chilling in two different semen extenders. It was shown that the analysis of sperm movement patterns and the binding of sperm to oviductal tissue sensitively indicate subtle differences of semen extenders to preserve the quality of chilled spermatozoa. The application of these tests is recommended for testing new hypothermic preservation strategies for boar semen. Sensitive detection of chilling injury in boar spermatozoa is required to evaluate novel hypothermic preservation concepts. The study's aim was to examine whether analyses of motility patterns and sperm binding in a competitive oviduct explant assay (cOEA) sensitively detect chilling-induced alterations in sperm function. Semen samples (n = seven boars) were split into four subsamples by dilution either in Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) or Androstar(R) Plus and stored at 5 degrees C or 17 degrees C. Storage temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of spermatozoa in seven major kinematic clusters. The effect size of chilling at 5 degrees C as estimated by Cramer's V was higher (p < 0.05) in the BTS medium (0.21) compared to AndroStar(R) Plus (0.11). Spermatozoa extended in Androstar(R) Plus had higher relative binding capacity compared to sperm in BTS (p < 0.05). Binding indices correlated with the percentage of viable, acrosome-intact (r = 0.62) and motile spermatozoa (r = 0.72, both p < 0.001). The cluster size of sperm with slow, vigorous movement was negatively correlated with sperm-oviduct binding (r = -0.43, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the cluster analysis of sperm kinematics and competitive sperm oviduct binding in vitro present meaningful biological tests to assess novel concepts for hypothermic semen preservation.

AB  - Compared with the amplitude modulation of conventional interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), the image feature control method based on phase modulation exhibits greater energy efficiency and, therefore, has received wide attention recently. In this paper, an Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) image feature suppression method based on arbitrary phase encoding (APE) is proposed. The parameter design criterion is further analyzed. Through the nonperiodic segmented coding and modulation of the imaging signal in fast and slow time domains, the modulated signal produces a two-dimensional suppression region with uniform energy distribution in the ISAR image. Simulations via the measured Yak-42 aircraft data have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for target feature control. Compared to binary phase modulation jamming, the APE method with a phase modulation accuracy of 1 degree can achieve the same jamming effect while reducing the jamming power requirement by 3 dB. By optimizing with the proposed method, the image entropy of the interfered image increases by 1.1 to 1.5 compared to the original image.

AB  - Plastic marine debris is a common source of pollution. Recent research has shown that plastic debris has a negative impact on marine organisms and the environment. For the first time, we investigated the presence of microplastics (MPs) in the Nigerian Lagos Lagoon ecosystem water, sediment, and the most important fish species (Hepsetus odoe, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Lachnolaimus maximus). MPs were found in water, sediment, and three carnivorous fish species (H. odoe, C. nigrodigitatus, and L. maximus), except for herbivorous O. niloticus, raising concerns about the health of the Nigerian Lagos Lagoon ecosystem and the human food chain. Across the lagoon, fibres were more concentrated in the water, while fragments predominated in the sediment. Plastic debris from recreational, industrial, and domestic wastes contributed significantly to this contamination. Given the potential dangers of MPs to human health, it is critical to protect the ecosystem and its inhabitants in the Lagoon from plastic pollution. Our findings highlight the need for urgent measures to protect Nigeria's fragile coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Just one amino acid at the carboxy-terminus of the B chain distinguishes human insulin from porcine insulin. By introducing a precise point mutation into the porcine insulin (INS) gene, we were able to generate genetically modified pigs that secreted human insulin; these pigs may be suitable donors for islet xenotransplantation. The electroporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system into zygotes is frequently used to establish genetically modified rodents, as it requires less time and no micromanipulation. However, electroporation has not been used to generate point-mutated pigs yet. In the present study, we introduced a point mutation into porcine zygotes via electroporation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate INS point-mutated pigs as suitable islet donors. We first optimized the efficiency of introducing point mutations by evaluating the effect of Scr7 and the homology arm length of ssODN on improving homology-directed repair-mediated gene modification. Subsequently, we prepared electroporated zygotes under optimized conditions and transferred them to recipient gilts. Two recipients became pregnant and delivered five piglets. Three of the five piglets carried only the biallelic frame-shift mutation in the INS gene, whereas the other two successfully carried the desired point mutation. One of the two pigs mated with a WT boar, and this desired point mutation was successfully inherited in the next F1 generation. In conclusion, we successfully established genetically engineered pigs with the desired point mutation via electroporation-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into zygotes, thereby avoiding the time-consuming and complicated micromanipulation method.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants are among the most prominent herbivores in neotropical forests and savannas, and Argentina represents the southern limit of their distribution. Despite their importance, few systematic studies analyze the presence and distribution of leaf-cutting ants in Argentina. Our aim was to describe, through an intensive field sampling, the leaf-cutting ant species present in the central Argentine mountains and analyze their distribution along the elevation gradient. We collected ants from 69 nests in 56 out of the 250 plots visited along the study elevation gradient (400-2700 m above sea level) in seven different habitats, from forests to rocky areas. We found six species. The most frequent were Acromyrmex lobicornis and Acromyrmex crassispinus, while Acromyrmex heyeri, Amoimyrmex silvestrii, Amoimyrmex striatus, and Amoimyrmex bruchi were far less frequent. The species distributed at the highest elevation was A. lobicornis (1223 to 2163 m a.s.l.), showing significant differences with the other species. We found leaf-cutting ants in all habitats, with a higher presence in grazing lawns, shrublands, and exotic forests. Our results indicate that leaf-cutting ants are present in most of the mountain range, as the area above their upper limit of distribution represents less than 5% of the total mountain area.

AB  - Overgrazing generally induces dwarfism in grassland plants, and these phenotypic traits could be transmitted to clonal offspring even when overgrazing is excluded. However, the dwarfism-transmitted mechanism remains largely unknown, despite generally thought to be enabled by epigenetic modification. To clarify the potential role of DNA methylation on clonal transgenerational effects, we conducted a greenhouse experiment with Leymus chinensis clonal offspring from different cattle/sheep overgrazing histories via the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The results showed that clonal offspring from overgrazed (by cattle or sheep) parents were dwarfed and the auxin content of leaves significantly decreased compared to offspring from no-grazed parents'. The 5-azaC application generally increased the auxin content and promoted the growth of overgrazed offspring while inhibited no-grazed offspring growth. Meanwhile, there were similar trends in the expression level of genes related to auxin-responsive target genes (ARF7, ARF19), and signal transduction gene (AZF2). These results suggest that DNA methylation leads to overgrazinginduced plant transgenerational dwarfism via inhibiting auxin signal pathway.

AB  - To enhance the retention of compost nutrients, specifically in nitrogen metabolism and humification, compound microbial agents were added during the aerobic composting of bagasse pith and buffalo manure. The introduction of the microbial agent successfully colonized the mixture, boosted the degradation capacity of organic matter, and facilitated the formation of nitrogenous substances and humic substances (HSs). The incorporation of a composite microbial inoculum led to a substantial rise in total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) by 62.04%, nitrate nitrogen (NO- 3-N) by 291.65%, and amino acid (AA) by 78.77%. Furthermore, this intervention resulted in achieving a humic acid (HA) to fulvic acid (FA) ratio of 1.64. Metagenomic sequencing revealed enhanced synergistic interactions among microorganisms through inoculation, increasing the abundance of functional genes related to nitrification and nitrogen fixation compared to the uninoculated control. Spearman correlation analysis identified unclassified_c__Deltaproteobacteria, unclassified_f__Planctomycetaceae, Chryseosolibacter, unclassified_f__Hyphomicrobiaceae as the principal producers of HA. This research provides insights into the interactions between nitrogen metabolism and humification in composting, aiming to effectively retain compost nutrients and support the long-term sustainability of agriculture.

AB  - Insect herbivores often experience seasonal fluctuation in food availability, which plays important role in signaling diapause and/or migration. However, the introduction of non-native plants with different seasonal phenologies has the potential to disrupt these dynamics. Some evidence suggests that this may be a developing issue for the annual migration of the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). The tropical milkweed Asclepias curassavica (Linnaeus) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), which does not seasonally senesce to the same extent or rate as native milkweed host plants, has recently been introduced into the North American mainland population. Here, we report an experimental comparison of monarch developmental success when reared on A. curassavica and the native A. incarnata (Linnaeus) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae) in the summer and fall. We found that A. curassavica facilitates monarch development later into their typical migratory and over-wintering season, despite several prolonged periods where the temperature was below requirements for growth and development.

AB  - Climate changes are promoting increases in global temperatures, variability in precipitation, and more frequent insect pest outbreaks. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for the tolerance of both, biotic and abiotic stresses, is critical for the development of improved genotypes and sustainability of productivity under climate change. Thus, we examine the regulatory cascades and metabolic pathways triggered by both drought and insect attack signals. Profiles from the genotypes drought-tolerant (EMBRAPA 48) and resistant to A. gemmatalis infestation (IAC17) were compared with one sensitive to drought/insect attack (BR16). EMBRAPA 48 and IAC17 plants under drought were less susceptible to insect attack, promoting lower caterpillar survival. Survival reductions were not dependent on the drought-tolerance or insect-resistance phenotypes, despite being more pronounced for IAC17. Furthermore, metabolites profiles, gene expression and enzymatic assays lead us to conclude that drought signal by itself was not enough to explain the survival reductions. Protease inhibition activities and expressions of LOX and PI genes correlated with ABA levels, indicating that JA-signalling was potentialized by ABA to enhance the production of deterrent metabolites. Thus, increased ABA levels during drought treatment may be acting synergistically to induce cascades responsive to JA. Thus, regulatory molecular hub(s) integrating signals may be a target to the genetic engineering of plants with multiple tolerances to environmental stresses.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes are essential for the restoration of shallow lakes for maintaining clear-water conditions. The presence of fish can affect the nutrient cycles and the growth of submerged macrophytes in lakes. In this study, a 28-day mesocosm experiment was carried out with an herbivorous fish Ctenopharyngodon idella (CID) and an omni-benthivorous fish Carassius auratus (CAU) to investigate their effects on the growth of a submerged macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata and phosphorus (P) cycle in shallow lakes. The results showed that CID slowed down the growth of H. verticillata while CAU showed no significant effect. In overlying water, CID only increased the ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration in the later stage due to excretion, while CAU elevated particulate phosphorus (PP) levels during the experiment through disturbance. Meanwhile, the radial oxygen loss and photosynthesis of H. verticillata in CAU might promote the formation of NaOH-P and HCl-P in the sediment, respectively. Changes in the water and sediment properties caused by CID and CAU can contribute to the increase in the eutrophication risk index (ERI). Our findings suggest that CID has the potential to be an indirect biological manipulation tool, while CAU should be controlled to minimize its negative impacts on the P cycle in lakes.

AB  - Shape morph-specific studies in hippolytid shrimps revealed significant results on their ecomorphology and evolutionary adaptations. Among the species of the genus Hippolyte, only one exhibits an unusual, sharp rostral dimorphism and has been used as an animal model for the investigation of mechanisms of the morph-specific adaptation: the intertidal Hippolyte sapphica. The species is endemic of the Central/Eastern Mediterranean basin and exhibits morph-A with a long dentate rostrum and morph-B with a short, juvenile-like one. The two morphotypes were recently confirmed to be conspecific, while offspring and morphological studies showed significant microevolutionary adaptations, which balance the disadvantage of the "rostral loss." The present study aims to investigate the effect of such phenotypic variation on the reproductive traits of the species. We collected ovigerous females of H. sapphica in mixed (morph-A and morph-B) and unmixed populations (morph-A) along the species geographical range. We measured seven morphometric and maternal investment traits: carapace length, fecundity, embryo volume, egg density, female dry weight, brood dry weight, and reproductive output. Our results showed that ovigerous females were bigger in morph-A than in morph-B, whereas fecundity did not show any significant differences between the two morphotypes. High egg volume might be attributed to the latitudinal differences of our sampling sites compared to congenerics. Interestingly, the reproductive output was found to be bigger in morph-A specimens, suggesting that the maternal energy investment is selectively determined from the rostral presence/absence and the morphotype's higher viability in the species populations.

AB  - The abundance of domesticated sheep varieties and phenotypes is largely the result of long-term natural and artificial selection. However, there is limited information regarding the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation induced by the domestication and improvement of sheep. In this study, to explore genomic diversity and selective regions at the genome level, we sequenced the genomes of 100 sheep across 10 breeds and combined these results with publicly available genomic data from 225 individuals, including improved breeds, Chinese indigenous breeds, African indigenous breeds, and their Asian mouflon ancestor. Based on population structure, the domesticated sheep formed a monophyletic group, while the Chinese indigenous sheep showed a clear geographical distribution trend. Comparative genomic analysis of domestication identified several selective signatures, including IFI44 and IFI44L genes and PANK2 and RNF24 genes, associated with immune response and visual function. Population genomic analysis of improvement demonstrated that candidate genes of selected regions were mainly associated with pigmentation, energy metabolism, and growth development. Furthermore, the IFI44 and IFI44L genes showed a common selection signature in the genomes of 30 domesticated sheep breeds. The IFI44 c. 54413058 C>G mutation was selected for genotyping and population genetic validation. Results showed that the IFI44 polymorphism was significantly associated with partial immune traits. Our findings identified the population genetic basis of domesticated sheep at the whole-genome level, providing theoretical insights into the molecular mechanism underlying breed characteristics and phenotypic changes during sheep domestication and improvement.

AB  - 85 pairs of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for aurochs, cattle and sheep bones from the northern Netherlands were studied to establish the influence of salt marsh grazing on bone delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. The observed values proved significantly increased compared to livestock that grazed inland. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of animals grazing former salt marshes were significantly less increased than those grazing the unembanked salt marsh. Absent regular salt marsh flooding may explain the reduced delta C-13 increase in bones of animals grazing there. The delta N-15 values of ruminants grazing the embanked salt marshes continued to be increased, presumably due to persisting saline water at shallow depths. The delta C-13 values of the salt marsh grazing ruminants correspond with a delta C-13 increase of 5 parts per thousand compared to eleven modern salt marsh plants from Schiermonnikoog studied in this paper. The delta N-15 values of the eleven Schiermonnikoog salt marsh plants proved variable, on average too low to explain the observed 3.5 parts per thousand increase in delta N-15 values. This suggests that vegetation delta N-15 values cannot be the only cause of the high delta N-15 values observed in salt marsh ruminants. Other processes may be responsible for the high delta N-15 values of salt marsh grazing ruminants as well.

AB  - Simple Summary The main objective of breeding Iberian pigs is the production of high-quality dry cured meat products. As this breed shows a reduced litter size in comparison to the commercial breeds, some previous studies have reported the use of photostimulation of seminal doses as a method for improving the farrowing rate and litter size. The aim of this study was to explore whether the application of a photostimulation procedure to Duroc seminal doses has any beneficial effect on fertility and litter size. Semen samples were obtained from 38 fertile Duroc boars and the fertility study was conducted on two commercial farms using multiparous Iberian sows (farm A, n = 824; farm B, n = 2131), that were randomly assigned to LED (L) or control (C) groups. Post-cervical insemination took place 0 and 24 h after the diagnosis of estrus, with seminal doses from the same ejaculate and same treatment. The photostimulation of the seminal doses had no effect on the reproductive performance (farrowing rate: 91.72% C vs. 90.09% L, litter size: 8.71 +/- 0.06 piglets C vs. 8.70 +/- 0.05 L, p > 0.05). In pigs, it has been reported that increased farrowing rates and litter size have been induced by photostimulating the seminal doses for artificial insemination with red LED light. As the reproductive characteristics, production system, and outcome parameters of Iberian breed pigs are different from other commercial breeds, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect of illuminating seminal doses from Duroc boars with red LED light and the fertility outcomes of Iberian females. Semen samples were obtained from 38 fertile Duroc boars. Photostimulation of the artificial insemination (AI) seminal doses was carried out by illuminating the samples with a red LED for 10 min, followed by 10 min of darkness, and finally 10 additional minutes of red light. The fertility study was conducted on two commercial farms using multiparous Iberian sows (farm A, n = 824; farm B, n = 2131), that were randomly assigned to LED (L) or control (C) groups. No differences were found between L and C groups in both farms (p > 0.05) for parity, pregnancy rate, duration of pregnancy, farrowing rate, and litter size (total, alive, and stillborn piglets). Farrowing rates in farm A were 88.8% (n = 383) for control and 89.6% (n = 441, p = 0.67) for the LED group. In farm B, farrowing rates were C:90.5% (n = 1030) and L: 90.1% (n = 1101, p = 0.48). In farm A, total born piglets were 8.69 +/- 0.11 for C and 8.71 +/- 0.11 for L (p = 0.87). In farm B, the results were 8.72 +/- 0.7 for C and 8.70 +/- 0.06 (p = 0.82) for L. Under the production conditions for the Iberian breed, the photostimulation with red LED light using Duroc pig seminal doses was not effective in improving the fertility of Iberian sows.

AB  - Long-distance seed dispersal is a crucial process determining the distribution of plant biodiversity and, therefore, of major interest in biogeography and macroecology. A recent data article on Global Ecology and Biogeography presented a database of estimated seed-dispersal distance classes for the European flora, where the classes are defined by the morphological dispersal syndrome of species associated with a single dispersal mode. We explain how this article overlooks literature on the unreliable capacity of dispersal syndromes for predicting key dispersal modes involved in long-distance seed dispersal. Consequently, the published database does not consider the possibility that individual species can naturally be dispersed through multiple modes (polychory). Most importantly, the database consistently omits seed-dispersal modes that can mediate dispersal distances several orders of magnitude longer than the mode predicted by the syndromes. This is the case of many terrestrial and aquatic plants dispersed by animals, notably ungulates and waterbirds, and that of coastal plants dispersed by the sea. We thus urge caution when using this database to model potential plant dispersal because long-distance seed dispersal is underestimated in many species.

AB  - Poaching is driving many species toward extinction, and as a result, lowering poaching pressure is a conservation priority. This requires understanding where poaching pressure is high and which factors determine these spatial patterns. However, the cryptic and illegal nature of poaching makes this difficult. Ranger patrol data, typically recorded in protected area logbooks, contain information on patrolling efforts and poaching detection and should thus provide opportunities for a better understanding of poaching pressure. However, these data are seldom analyzed and rarely used to inform adaptive management strategies. We developed a novel approach to making use of analog logbook records to map poaching pressure and to test environmental criminology and predator-prey relationship hypotheses explaining poaching patterns. We showcase this approach for Golestan National Park in Iran, where poaching has substantially depleted ungulate populations. We digitized data from >4800 ranger patrols from 2014 to 2016 and used an occupancy modeling framework to relate poaching to (1) accessibility, (2) law enforcement, and (3) prey availability factors. Based on predicted poaching pressure and patrolling intensity, we provide suggestions for future patrol allocation strategies. Our results revealed a low probability (12%) of poacher detection during patrols. Poaching distribution was best explained by prey availability, indicating that poachers target areas with high concentrations of ungulates. Poaching pressure was estimated to be high (>0.49) in 39% of our study area. To alleviate poaching pressure, we recommend ramping up patrolling intensity in 12% of the national park, which could be achievable by reducing excess patrols in about 20% of the park. However, our results suggest that for 27% of the park, it is necessary to improve patrolling quality to increase detection probability of poaching, for example, by closing temporal patrolling gaps or expanding informant networks. Our approach illustrates that analog ranger logbooks are an untapped resource for evidence-based and adaptive planning of protected area management. Using this wealth of data can open up new avenues to better understand poaching and its determinants, to expand effectiveness assessments to the past, and, more generally, to allow for strategic conservation planning in protected areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Haemonchus contortus is an important gastrointestinal nematode parasite of the tropical and sub-tropical regions that cause haemonchosis in small ruminants like goats and sheep. It causes low production, reduced growth and may cause death of the infected animals. Due to the resistance development and environmental issues, the use of anthelmintics can be replaced with biological control, which is an environment friendly alternative. In the present study, three bacteria viz; Comamonas testosteroni, C. jiangduensis and Pseudomonas weihenstephanesis showed significant effect on nematode mortality and egg hatch inhibition. It was also observed that the anthelmintic activity of these bacteria was dose dependent, where 100% bacterial metabolite concentration showed the highest activity. It is suggested that these bacteria may included in the integrated nematode management. Haemonchosis is a parasitic disease of small ruminants that adversely affects livestock production. Haemonchus contortus is one of the most prevalent nematode parasites that infect the abomasum of small ruminants. This parasite reduces milk production, overall growth and sometimes causes the death of the infected animals. The evaluation of the biocontrol potential of some abomasum bacterial isolates against H. contortus is investigated in this study. Out of which, three isolates-Comamonas testosteroni, Comamonas jiangduensis, Pseudomonas weihenstephanesis-show significant effect against the nematode L3, adult, and egg hatch inhibition assays. Various concentrations of metabolites from these bacteria are prepared and applied in different treatments compared with control. In the case of adult mortality assay, 50% metabolites of C. testosteroni and P. weihenstephanesis show 46% adult mortality, whereas C. jiangduensis shows 40% mortality. It is observed that decreasing the concentration of bacterial metabolite, lowers nematode mortality. The minimum nematode mortality rate is recorded at the lowest filtrates concentration of all the bacterial isolates. The same trend is observed in egg hatch inhibition assay, where the higher concentration of bacterial culture filtrates shows 100% inhibition of H. contortus egg. It is concluded that the effect of bacterial culture filtrates against H. contortus is dose-dependent for their activity against nematode L3, adult, and inhibition of egg hatchment.

AB  - Traditional sheep counting methods are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and potentially disruptive to sheep behaviour. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged to address these challenges by automating the process. However, these solutions face difficulties due to low object-to- image-pixel ratios and high object densities in images captured for sheep counting, which can compromise detection and counting accuracy. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a novel approach, sub-window inference, designed to increase the object-to-image-pixel ratios, thereby enhancing the performance of existing object detection and segmentation models. Our method was compared to four other object counting techniques, demonstrating superior performance in terms of a reduced mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.21 sheep and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.27%. Furthermore, our findings indicate that incorporating random cropping data augmentation during model training significantly enhances both detection and counting accuracy. It is important to note that a limitation of sub-window inference is that it does not facilitate real-time count predictions. Overall, our proposed method of sub-window inference reduces the MAE in automated sheep counting techniques involving UAVs and ML, presenting a highly effective solution that benefits sheep farmers.

AB  - Livestock behavior serves as a crucial indicator of physiological health. Leveraging deep learning techniques to automatically recognize dairy goat behaviors, particularly abnormal ones, enables early detection of potential health and environmental issues. To address the challenges of recognizing small-target behaviors in complex environments, a multi-scale and lightweight behavior recognition model for dairy goats called GSCW-YOLO was proposed. The model integrates Gaussian Context Transformation (GCT) and the Content-Aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) upsampling operator, enhancing the YOLOv8n framework's attention to behavioral features, reducing interferences from complex backgrounds, and improving the ability to distinguish subtle behavior differences. Additionally, GSCW-YOLO incorporates a small-target detection layer and optimizes the Wise-IoU loss function, increasing its effectiveness in detecting distant small-target behaviors and transient abnormal behaviors in surveillance videos. Data for this study were collected via video surveillance under varying lighting conditions and evaluated on a self-constructed dataset comprising 9213 images. Experimental results demonstrated that the GSCW-YOLO model achieved a precision of 93.5%, a recall of 94.1%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 97.5%, representing improvements of 3, 3.1, and 2 percentage points, respectively, compared to the YOLOv8n model. Furthermore, GSCW-YOLO is highly efficient, with a model size of just 5.9 MB and a frame per second (FPS) of 175. It outperforms popular models such as CenterNet, EfficientDet, and other YOLO-series networks, providing significant technical support for the intelligent management and welfare-focused breeding of dairy goats, thus advancing the modernization of the dairy goat industry.

AB  - A 30-year time series of the recruitment of rabbit fish, a herbivorous coral reef fish, on the island of Guam in the tropical western Pacific, showed variability that ENSO alone does not explain. To help explain this variability, a high-resolution biophysical model that includes directional swimming reveals how mesoscale turbulence and ENSO-driven changes in the ocean circulation control the self-recruitment of rabbit fish. ENSO drives island wakes that enhance the capacity to retain locally spawned larvae, and mesoscale turbulence generates much variability and promotes seaward dispersion at time scales larger than the Pelagic Larval Duration. The same processes are predicted to occur for the self-recruitment of grouper fish, a carnivorous coral reef fish, in Palau, Micronesia. The models suggests that 99% of these fish larvae are exported seaward from Guam and Palau. Those larvae are the ones that could provide connectivity between reefs and islands in Micronesia. This connectivity for the grouper fish was predicted using an altimetry-driven advection-diffusion oceanography model for 40 mass spawning events spread over 10 years. The mesoscale turbulence, and not the mean oceanographic currents, is the dominant process controlling the connectivity, which is thus chaotic. This finding applies also in the Galapagos archipelago and the Coral Sea fringing the Great Barrier Reef.

AB  - The Crested-tailed deer mouse, Habromys lophurus, is one of seven arboreal species within the genus Habromys. Species of this genus are monotypic, relatively rare, and occur in low densities. Their geographical distribution is highly fragmented due to being restricted to montane cloud forest in Mesoamerica and they are of conservation concern. All Habromys species are endemic to Mexico, except H. lophurus, which is also distributed in Guatemala and El Salvador. In this study, we obtained and characterized the first mitogenome and sev- eral thousand nuclear ultraconserved elements (UCEs) of H. lophurus to determine its phy-logenetic position within neotomine-peromyscine mice. Its mitogenome sequence (16,509 bp) is only the second complete mitogenome obtained for this poorly known genus. We also obtained the first nuclear genomic data for H. lophurus, including 3,654 UCE loci, as well as a partial mitogenome of H. simulatus (6,349 bp), and 2,186 UCE for the outgroup Holochi-lus sciureus. Phylogenetic analyses that included our newly generated genomic data cou-pled with previously published data from other neotomine-peromyscine mice confirm the placement of H. lophurus, H. simulatus, and H. ixtlani within a highly supported clade. The Habromys clade was nested within a clade that also contains members of the genus Per-omyscus and provides further support for the hypothesis of the paraphyly of Peromyscus. These genomic resources will contribute to future phylogenomic studies that aim to further elucidate the evolutionary history of this rare and critically endangered genus of rodents.

AB  - The island rule, a general pattern of dwarfism in large species to gigantism in small species on islands relative to mainland, is typically seen as a macroevolutionary phenomenon. However, whether the ecological processes associated with abiotic and biotic factors generate a pattern of plant size variation similar to the island rule remains unknown. We measured plant height for 29,623 individuals of 50 common woody plant species across 43 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago (8500 years old and yet to undergo major evolutionary adaptation) and the adjacent mainlands in China. We found pronounced variations in plant height, similar to those of the island rule. Interestingly, islands with low resource availability, such as low soil organic matter content and low precipitation, had a high degree of dwarfism; islands experiencing high environmental stress, such as high soil pH, had a high degree of dwarfism; and islands experiencing less plant-plant competition had a high degree of gigantism. The magnitude of plant dwarfism was higher on small and remote islands than on larger and nearer islands. These results highlight the importance of ecological processes associated with abiotic and biotic conditions in shaping the island rule-like patterns of plant size variation. Since our studied archipelago is too young to undergo major evolution, ecological processes likely played a prominent role in generating the observed pattern, challenging the notion that the evolutionary process is the dominant factor underlying the island rule. Future studies on the island rule need to perform experiments to disentangle evolutionary from ecological mechanisms. Copyright (c) 2024 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO), as a signal molecule, is involved in the mediation of heavy-metal-stressinduced physiological responses in plants. In this study, we investigated the effect of NO on Camellia sinensis pollen tubes exposed to aluminum (Al) stress. Exogenous application of the NO donor decreased the pollen germination rate and pollen tube length and increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant enzyme activities under Al stress. Simultaneously, the NO donor effectively increased NO content in pollen tube of C. sinensis under Al stress and could aggravate the damage of Al3+ to C. sinensis pollen tubes by promoting the uptake of Al3+. In addition, application of the NO-specific scavenger significantly alleviated stress damage in C. sinensis pollen tube under Al stress. Moreover, 18 CsALMT members from a key Al-transporting gene family were identified, which could be divided into four subclasses. Pearson correlation analysis showed the expression level of CsALMT8 showed significant positive correlation with the Al3+ concentration gradient and NO levels, but a significant negative correlation with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. The expression level of CsALMT5 was negatively correlated with the Al3+ concentration gradient and NO level, and positively correlated with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. The expression level of CsALMT17 showed a significant negative correlation with Al3+ concentration and NO content in pollen tubes, but significant positive correlation with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. In conclusion, a complex signal network regulated by NO-mediated CsALMTs revealed that CsALMT8 was regulated by environmental Al3+ and NO to assist Al3+ entry into pollen tubes; CsALMT5 might be influenced by the Al3+ signal, stimulate malate efflux in vacuoles and chelate with Al3+ to detoxify Al in C. sinensis pollen tube.

AB  - The tricarboxylic acid cycle experienced will cause a lot of carbon and nitrogen (N) losses during aerobic composting, and the greenhouse gases produced will do great harm to ecological balance and human health. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of metabolic regulators like adenosine triphosphate and malonic acid in the organic N transformation and N loss reduction in the composting of chicken manure (CM) and garden waste (GW). Results showed that the addition of metabolic regulators promoted organic N transformation and significantly increased organic N content during composting. Concurrently, adding metabolic regulators reduced N loss, especially in GWATP and GWMA compost, the N loss reduced by 27.99% and 29.10%, respectively. However, metabolic regulators played different roles due to different basic properties of materials. The amino acid N, amino sugar N and hydrolysable unknown N (HUN) were stored in GW, while only amide N and HUN were stored in CM. Moreover, adding metabolic regulators significantly increased the core bacterial community associated with organic N transformation. Ultimately, structural equation model and variance partitioning analysis proved that adding metabolic regulators strengthened the effects of environmental factors and bacterial communities on the transformation and content of organic N. Therefore, adding metabolic regulators had positive effect on promoting N cycle.

AB  - Climate change poses tremendous pressure on agriculture. Camelina sativa is an ancient, low-input, high-quality oilseed crop for food, feed and industrial applications that has retained its natural stress tolerance. Its climate resilience, adaptability to different growth conditions, and the qualities of its seed oil and cake have spurred the interest in camelina. However, due to a period of neglect it has not yet undergone intensive breeding and knowledge about this multi-purpose crop is still limited. Metabolism is strongly associated with plant growth and development and little information is available on camelina primary carbohydrate metabolism. Here, eight camelina lines from different geographic and climatic regions were characterized for important growth parameters and agricultural traits. Furthermore, the activities of key enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism were analysed in leaves, seedpods, capsules, and developing seeds. The lines differed in shoot and leaf morphology, plant height, biomass formation as well as in seed yield and seed oil and protein content. Key carbohydrate metabolism enzymes showed specific activity signatures in leaves and reproductive organs during seed development, and different lines exhibited distinct enzyme activity patterns, providing a valuable basis for developing new physiological markers for camelina breeding programs.

AB  - Nutrition is vital to health, but while the link between diet and body nutritional composition is well explored in humans and other vertebrates, this information is not well understood in insects, despite the vital roles they play in ecosystems, and their increasing use as experimental models. Here we used Nutritional Geometry to explore the rapid physiological response to ingested nutrients in the haemolymph nutritional profile of Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. We ask whether blood nutrients are maintained homeostatically in the face of variable nutritional intake, or if regulation is more flexible for some nutrients than others (allostasis), which allows animals to adapt to stress by responding in a way that prioritises efficiency of responses in the face of trade-offs. Caterpillars were placed on 1 of 20 diets, systematically varying in their nutrient ratios (protein: carbohydrate) and density (calorie content), and their consumption was measured. After 48 h, caterpillars were bled, and the macronutrient (protein, carbohydrates and lipids) and nutrient metabolite (amino acids and simple sugars) content of the haemolymph was measured. Proteins comprised 93% of the haemolymph macronutrient pool on average and their concentration increased with protein eaten. The amino acid (AA) pool was dominated by five AAs, and the total pool increased with total nutrient intake. However, the ratio of essential to non-essential AAs increased as the proportion of protein consumed increased. Carbohydrates were tightly controlled, increasing only on the most extreme carbohydrate intakes. Simple sugars were dominated by glucose and trehalose, and overall, the simple sugar pool showed high levels of homeostasis. Rather than strict homeostasis of blood nutritional properties, an allostatic model seemed to be a better fit for blood nutrient regulation in this generalist herbivore. This flexibility in response to the nutritional composition of the diet may, in part, explain how this species has evolved to extreme dietary generalism and may play a role in its worldwide pest status. Given the range of fitness-related processes affected by the haemolymph, future studies should examine the physiological impacts of blood nutrient variation on reproduction, growth and response to infection and the trade-offs between them.

AB  - The variation in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has an important impact on the protection of estuarine shoal wetlands and the maintenance of waterways. Typhoons (tropical cyclones), one of the most severe meteorological disasters, frequently occur along the southeastern coasts of China and substantially affect the spatial-temporal distribution of SSC in the Yangtze Estuary. In this study, the spatial-temporal distribution of SSC was observed at high frequency through hourly geostationary satellite remote sensing during four typhoon events, namely, Typhoons Damrey/Saola (August 2012), Soulik (July 2013), Matmo (July 2014) and Dujuan (September 2015). Such observation is difficult to achieve through in situ approaches due to the unsafe working conditions created by typhoon winds. Moreover, wind speed, wave height and period, and bottom shear stress (BSS) data combined with turbidity data were used to analyze the causes of typhoon-induced SSC variations. The results indicated that the average wind-driven significant wave height during typhoons was 2.1-fold higher than that in pre-typhoon periods. In the lower mouth of the Yangtze Estuary and in Hangzhou Bay, the SSC increased by 0.14-0.33 g/L, whereas in the upper mouth, the SSC was less affected by wind. The significant increase in SSC persisted for 1-2 days following typhoon transit. With the assistance of the FVCOM model, it was observed that the enhanced wave-current dynamics and increased BSS during the typhoons were the main reasons for the sharp increase in SSC. Moreover, it was inferred from the satellite images that sediment exchange occurs between channels and shoals during a typhoon, which affects the SSC distribution for up to one month.

AB  - A range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been found to be released during zooplankton grazing on microalgae cultivated for commercial purposes. However, production of grazing-derived VOCs from environmentally relevant species and their potential contribution to oceanic emissions to the atmosphere remains largely unexplored. Here, we aimed to qualitatively explore the suite of VOCs produced due to grazing using laboratory cultures of the marine microalga Isochrysis galbana and the herbivorous heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina with and without antibiotic treatment. The VOCs were measured using a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer, coupled to a segmented flow coil equilibrator. We found alternative increases of dimethyl sulfide by up to 0.2 nmol dm(-3) and methanethiol by up to 10 pmol dm(-3) depending on the presence or absence of bacteria regulated by antibiotic treatment. Additionally, toluene and xylene increased by about 30 pmol dm(-3) and 10 pmol dm(-3), respectively during grazing only, supporting a biological source for these compounds. Overall, our results highlight that VOCs beyond dimethyl sulfide are released due to grazing, and prompt further quantification of this source in budgets and process-based understanding of VOC cycling in the surface ocean.

AB  - Defensive symbionts-organisms that confer protection to their hosts against natural enemies such as parasites, predators, or herbivores-are found throughout the natural world. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that defensive symbionts can both interfere with ecological interactions between hosts and exploiters, as well as drive exploiter evolution. Defensive symbionts are also potential candidates for biocontrol agents to help manage infectious diseases or agricultural pests. The impact of defensive symbionts on parasite ecology and evolution has therefore recently received increased empirical and theoretical attention. In this theoretical study, we investigate the impact that a defensive symbiont which protects hosts from infection (conferred resistance) has on the evolution of parasite virulence. We also explore how the extent of protection conferred by the defensive symbiont coevolves with parasite virulence, and how symbiont and parasite evolution affect the ecology of the host population in both the short- and long-term. We show that, while costly resistance-conferring defensive symbionts always select for increased parasite virulence, the overall long-term ecological effect on the host population may still be positive due to reductions in disease prevalence. This contrasts with tolerance-conferring symbionts (which protect against virulence), where the long-term ecological effects on the host population are always negative. We also show when the defensive symbiont can successfully eliminate the parasite. Resistance-conferring defensive symbionts therefore offer more promise as evolutionarily robust biocontrols than those that only confer tolerance.

AB  - functional loss of herbivory on Caribbean coral reefs following an epizootic-driven die-off of the long-spined urchin (Diadema antillarum) in the 1980s and its lack of recovery has inspired efforts to re-establish an ecologically viable population throughout the region. An area of focus is to develop scalable methods for producing D. antillarum through aquaculture from gametes for release onto coral reefs. We had earlier observed that aquaculture-produced D. antillarum lacked the strong diurnal sheltering behavior exhibited by wild individuals. Based upon those findings, subsequent cohorts of aquaculture-produced individuals were therefore maintained under a natural diurnal cycle of UV-filtered sunlight and provided ample access to structure that mimicked its natural shelter. An examination of the sheltering behavior of D. antillarum from one of these cohorts found the pronounced diurnal sheltering behavior typical of wild individuals. This observation underscores the potential that the behavioral deficit observed in earlier hatchery-propagated D. antillarum can be mediated and ecologically functional individuals can be produced through this aquaculture process.

AB  - As the global climate shifts, many species are imperilled by changing thermal regimes. Despite rising global temperatures, some populations must contend with more frequent or extreme cold. In these populations, the ability to cope with cold may be an important determinant of fitness. Experiments in captive animals have shown that extreme cold or rapid temperature declines typically elicit an increase in glucocorticoid hormones (mediators of the stress response); however, it is not known whether free-living adults, which may be better at buffering the effects of cold, show a similar response to ecologically relevant thermal challenges. The effects of cold on the sensitivity to future challenges are also poorly understood. Using targeted manipulations of nest temperature in free-living tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor and a long-term dataset (2,888 samples; 8 years), we tested the relationship between cold exposure and glucocorticoid levels in adults. Both natural and experimental cold exposure altered glucocorticoid regulation. This manifested primarily in terms of an upregulation in the sensitivity to future challenges (stress-induced levels). Experimental cold exposure also increased the initial speed and duration of the acute stress response. Analyses of the long-term dataset found that baseline glucocorticoids were higher in cold conditions; however, the magnitude of this effect was weak. A sliding window analysis revealed differences in the timeline over which temperature best predicted baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoids. Although unpredictability is often regarded as a defining factor of stressors, we found that recent ambient temperatures better predicted circulating corticosterone than measures of thermal unpredictability, including the degree of recent temperature change and negative prediction error (the difference between experienced temperatures and long-term averages). Together, these results suggest that thermally induced increases in the sensitivity to future challenges may prime individuals to respond more strongly or rapidly to worsening conditions, or to subsequent challenges of a different type, without incurring the costs that can result from substantial elevations in baseline glucocorticoids. This kind of preparatory response could be adaptive; however, an increased sensitivity to other challenges could also represent an overlooked cost of changing thermal regimes.

AB  - It is well known that soil fertility is poor in most newly reclaimed land, which has been developed as an effective way to compensate farmland occupation. In order to ameliorate the soil quality of the newly reclaimed land, this study investigated the effect of commercial organic fertilizer (COF) (0.45, 0.90, 1.35 and 1.80 kg/m(2)), sheep manure (SM) (0.45, 0.75, 1.05 and 1.35 kg/m(2)), mushroom residue (MR) (1.50, 2.25, 3.00 and 3.75 kg/m(2)), and chemical compound fertilizer (CCF) (0.075 kg/m(2)) on the growth of sweet potato, soil pH, organic matter content (OMC), available phosphate, total nitrogen, available potassium, exchangeable Ca and Mg, as well as bacterial and fungal microbial composition during 2019-2021. The results from this study indicated that the COF, SM, MR, and CCF did not significantly change the soil pH, but significantly increased the OMC, which has been regarded as the most significant soil quality parameter. This suggests that the soil amendments used in this study have great potential to improve the soil quality in newly reclaimed land. However, these soil amendments exhibited a differential effect on sweet potato biomass, nutrient elements and the microbial community of the newly reclaimed soil, which depend on the kind and concentration of organic/chemical fertilizer, the application time, as well as the plant and soil parameters. The change was also observed on the bacterial and fungal soil microbial community, which provides us with a microbial basis to understand why organic fertilizer has a great effect on soil improvement. Overall, our results suggest that soil amended with organic fertilizers has great potential for the production of sweet potato in immature soil from the new reclamation land.

AB  - Ticks are efficient vectors for transmitting pathogens that negatively affect livestock production and pose a risk to public health. In this study, Babesia and Theileria species were identified in ticks collected from cattle, sheep and goats from the Kassena-Nankana Districts of Ghana between February and December 2020. A total of 1550 ticks were collected, morphologically identified, pooled and screened for pathogens using primers that amplify a 560 bp fragment of the ssrRNA gene and Sanger sequencing. Amblyomma variegatum (62.98%) was the predominant tick species. From the 491 tick pools screened, 12/15 (2.44%) positive pools were successfully sequenced. The pathogen DNA identified were Theileria ovis in eight (15.38%) pools of Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Theileria velifera in two (0.78%) pools of A. variegatum and Babesia occultans and Babesia sp. Xinjiang in one (1.72%) pool each of Hyalomma truncatum. It was further observed that T. ovis occurred in ticks collected from only sheep (p < 0.001) which were females (p = 0.023) and < =1 year old (p = 0.040). This study reports the first identification of these pathogens in ticks within Kassena-Nankana. With the constant trade of livestock, there is a need for effective tick control measures to prevent infection spread.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion, one of the most currently remarkable techniques for biogas production, has provided a method of high organic solid waste disposal. Operating temperature, especially in the winter of northern city, makes biomass degradation less efficient. The microorganisms that take on the role of gas production are greatly affected by temperature. In our study, solar energy was selected for anaerobic digestion and winter was selected as the experimental environment. Anaerobic digestion was performed with solar heating and electric heating separately. Parameters were tested (pH, soluble chemical oxygen demand, total ammonia nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids), and microbial structure was monitored. The volume of methane produced was measured over 60 days. The methane yield differed by 15.92% under different conditions. It is clearly shown that methane yield can be improved by a steady temperature environment. Nevertheless, dominant bacteria and microbial structure did not seem to be much different. This study may provide more energy-saving ideas for winter anaerobic digestion projects in northern regions.

AB  - We assess the effects of changing land use and crop management on alfalfa insect abundance by comparing it in 50 alfalfa fields when they were inserted in landscapes with different proportions of arable crops and orchards. Land use in a buffer of 500 m was assessed, and alfalfa insect abundance was estimated with sticky yellow traps. The number of catches of several herbivores and predators was related to the proportion of landscape components and several field variables. Results indicated that the proportion of orchards in the buffer negatively affected the abundance of predators on alfalfa, likely because orchards treated with pesticides are a sink for predators moving in the landscape, among other possible causes. Other landscape variables such as noncrop habitats, winter cereals, and landscape diversity analysed by the Shannon index had a minor influence. Among field variables, field size influenced positively the abundance of insects on alfalfa, whereas alfalfa growth stage and age affected positively or negatively the different herbivores and predators. Of course, abundance of predators and prey was affected by the abundance of prey and predators, respectively. These findings suggest that a high proportion of intensively managed crops (orchards) in the landscape interferes with the role of alfalfa as a reservoir of predatory insects for adjacent crops and that the responses to local and landscape structures are temporal and species-specific as previously concluded for maize. Consequently, landscape and field management strategies to improve pest control must consider both types of variables as well as their changing influence when we modify them.

AB  - Polygamous species vary in alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in relation to individual or environ-mental factors. Individuals may adopt fixed ARTs consistently across years, or may show flexible behaviour, changing tactic in different years. Different cost-benefit trade-offs should occur in relation to the adoption of each ART, possibly also influencing spatial behaviour and thus leading to alternative spatial tactics. Fixed ARTs are rare in mammals, whereas environmental variability is expected to favour flexibility in ARTs. We evaluated the potential for fixed versus flexible ARTs, and their correspondence with different spatial tactics, in a polygynous herbivore, the Alpine chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra rupi-capra. We collected data on mating behaviour of 31 individually recognizable adult males during five rutting seasons and on their spatial behaviour throughout the same years. Fifteen males were classified as territorial and 16 as nonterritorial. No individual changed ART during our research. Moreover, we report a previously undocumented occurrence of different patterns of spatial behaviour across territorial males. Half of these individuals had overlapping or continuous winter and summer ranges, whereas the others moved between different areas (in winter, immediately after the rut, or between summer and autumn). No differences between males adopting diverse ARTs were found in age or body mass, or in their respective frequencies of intrasexual aggressive interactions. On the other hand, territorial males, dominant over nonterritorial individuals in aggressive interactions, had more mating opportunities than nonterritorial ones. Further work should test for the consistency of our results across broader spatial and temporal scales, as well as species. Differences in key aspects of behaviour (e.g. space use) and life history (e.g. reproductive success) would help explain ART evolution and coexistence in a population. If ARTs were fixed in male chamois, neither ART should have been selected against long enough to determine its extinction, over evolutionary times.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - (1) Background: The pig production sector is a cornerstone in China's agricultural industry and it urgently needs a transition from a conventional sector to one that is efficient, sustainable, and of high quality. (2) Methods: This study examines the effects of environmental regulation (ER) on the development of the pig industry (DPI) between 2005 and 2019. From the perspective of the breeding, production, and consumption industry chain, a comprehensive evaluation index system is used to assess the progress of the pig industry. Furthermore, the effects of ER on the DPI and its mechanism were evaluated using the FGLS and system-GMM. (3) Results: According to the empirical findings, ER exhibits a U-shaped non-linear effect on DPI in both high- and low-pig-production zones. Technological innovation and large-scale farming would lessen the detrimental effects of ER on DPI. Additionally, according to the outcomes of the implementation of local environmental protection policies, LER and DPI have an inverted U-shaped relationship in major producing areas and a U-shaped relationship in non-major producing areas. (4) Conclusions: This essay offers several solutions and advice, including strengthening environmental regulation legislation and encouraging breeding industry advancements.

AB  - European deer keds, Lipoptena cervi (Linnaeus, 1758), are hematophagous ectoparasitic flies known to bite cervids and noncervids, including humans. To prevent deer keds from landing and biting hosts, 5 commercially available insect repellents (DEET, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), picaridin, and permethrin) and water control were evaluated to determine repellency efficacy and postexposure mortality of deer keds. While there was a significant difference between the groups tested, a post hoc analysis revealed that no treatment was significantly different from the water control. Deer ked survival was different amongst the treatments, with deer keds exposed to permethrin dying much sooner than those exposed to other treatments or control (median survival for permethrin = 0.58 h). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that deer keds exposed to DEET or IR3535 had similar survival rates (4.82 and 5.15 h, respectively). Still, there were significantly lower survival times for DEET compared to OLE (6.33 h) and picaridin (15.00 h). Deer keds exposed to the water control survived the longest (23.12 h). Overall, deer ked repellency was not significantly different from the control, but permethrin-treated clothes can effectively kill deer keds in a short amount of time, thereby protecting those who recreate outdoors or encounter animals carrying deer keds.

AB  - Qaidam Cashmere goat is one of the few animals that can survive in the harsh environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the adjacent alpine areas. It has a strong adaptability, thus shaping the genetic diversity of goat phenotype, morphology, physiology and other aspects. However, the molecular basis behind these genetic mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we conducted genome-wide studies of genetic variation in two different morphologies and geographical coordinates in indigenous Chinese goats to identify selective signaling in genomic regions. In the present study, we resequenced 10 high-altitude Chinese indigenous goat breeds and compared them with low-altitude goats. By combining theta pi and Fst values, we identified 1277 overlapping selection regions that may contribute to the wool fiber traits, reproductive performance, and high-altitude adaptation of goats. Candidate genes enriched in selected regions are associated with the phenotypes in cashmere fiber traits ( IGFBP3, TNF, ROCK1, WNT10B, KITLG), reproduction traits (CAMK2D, IL-18, ESR1, ANAPC13), body size (POMC), hypoxic adaptation (TH, ACER1, GNB1, HIF1A) and disease (IL-10). This study provided valuable genetic information for the basis of biological characteristics and genetic improvement of breeds.

AB  - This study investigates the link between high growth, benefit corporations, and intellectual capital. The last is particularly relevant in high-growth companies called "gazelles." Moreover, it is assumed to play a pivotal role in benefit corporations whose purpose-driven mission is to pursue and integrate economic, social-environmental, and ethical benefits. Drawing from this theoretical background, we identified four benefit corporations among 2183 Italian gazelles founded in 2014 with a minimum employee number equal to 10 in 2015 and 2016 and with a growth of sales and employees of 20% in 2018 and 2019. A qualitative-based methodology, a multiple case study relative to Italian benefit corporations that showed an interesting increasing dynamic in the last two years, 2020-2021, has been carried out to deeply investigate salient traits of the virtuous circle that a benefit corporation triggers. Findings point out that the high-growth benefit corporations balance public purposes and economic goals through a sustainable business model, taking advantage of the intangible resources made available by the group's companies and sharing them with stakeholders, enriching the context in which they operate through direct actions to support the community and the area.

AB  - Simple Summary Clinical and anatomopathological evaluations of animals experimentally inoculated with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and 7 days later with Lawsonia intracellularis were performed and compared to single-infected pigs. Co-infected animals were more affected and had more severe lesions when compared to single-infected pigs. The intestinal microbiome of pigs from co-infected animals demonstrated a difference in some genera compared to other groups before and after inoculation and certain genera were evaluated in each group.Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Lawsonia intracellularis coinfection has been observed in the diagnostic routine; however, no studies have evaluated their interaction. This study aimed to characterize lesions and possible synergisms in experimentally infected pigs. Four groups of piglets, coinfection (CO), B. hyodysenteriae (BRA), L. intracellularis (LAW), and negative control (NEG), were used. Clinical signals were evaluated, and fecal samples were collected for qPCR. At 21 days post infection (dpi), all animals were euthanized. Gross lesions, bacterial isolation, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and fecal microbiome analyses were performed. Diarrhea started at 12 dpi, affecting 11/12 pigs in the CO group and 5/11 pigs in the BRA group. Histopathological lesions were significantly more severe in the CO than the other groups. B. hyodysenteriae was isolated from 11/12 pigs in CO and 5/11 BRA groups. Pigs started shedding L. intracellularis at 3 dpi, and all inoculated pigs tested positive on day 21. A total of 10/12 CO and 7/11 BRA animals tested positive for B. hyodysenteriae by qPCR. A relatively low abundance of microbiota was observed in the CO group. Clinical signs and macroscopic and microscopic lesions were significantly more severe in the CO group compared to the other groups. The presence of L. intracellularis in the CO group increased the severity of swine dysentery.

AB  - Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) infect sheep and goats resulting in significant economic losses. This study evaluated for the first time the predicted conformational structure of the SRLV-capsid-protein 25 (SRLV-p25) and analyzed the antigenicity of recombinant protein (SRLV-rp25) in mice by coupling to an immunostimulatory complexes based on glycyrrhizinic acid liposomes (GAL) and tested plasma from goats and sheep naturally infected. Analysis in silico and conformational structure of SRLV-p25 (genotype B-FESC-752) showed similar characteristics to other lentiviral capsids. The efficient expression of SRLV-rp25 was confirmed by Western blot. The humoral immune responses in mice showed an increased level of antibodies from day 21 to 35 of the SRLV-rp25-GAL and SRLV-rp25-ISCOM (R) groups and the cellular immune response showed no significant difference in IL-10 levels (P >.05), however, a significant difference (P <.001) was observed when comparing SRLV-rp25-GAL with SRLV-rp25 groups. Immunoreactivity toward SRLV-rp25 revealed 61% of positive samples from naturally infected goats and sheep.

AB  - Process-based ecosystem models, such as ecosys, can be useful tools to gain insights and accurately project nitrous oxide (N2O) inventories in national, regional and global scales, and to explore potential emission reduction strategies. Our objectives are to investigate how the ecosys model simulate the effects of fall and spring slurry injections on N2O production and if de-watering slurry could become a potential N2O mitigation strategy for both fall and spring injections. The ecosys model was used to simulate hourly N2O fluxes from 2014 to 2017 in a cropping system with and without slurry (fall and spring additions) in comparison with field measurements in Alberta, Canada. Furthermore, we performed simulations of de-watered fall and spring slurry applications in the same scenarios. Our results showed ecosys adequately simulated soil temperatures and moisture contents at 10 and 20 cm depths [correlation coefficients (r) >= 0.929 for temperatures; r >= 0.529 for moistures]. The divergences of modelled and measured soil water contents during spring thaws could be attributed to uncertainties in model inputs for soil hydrological parameters as well as uncertainties in field measurements. The model captured reasonably well the dynamics of N2O fluxes from soils receiving fall and spring slurry (r = 0.356). However, the concurrent discrepancies of N2O fluxes between modelled and measured values during the wetter spring thaw of 2017 might be a result of an unsatisfactory simulation of snowmelt infiltration and runoff. Compared to whole slurry, simulated de-watered slurry resulted in considerable reductions in cumulative N2O emissions by 16-36 and 23-29% for fall and spring slurry injections, respectively. The model results indicate that de-watering slurry would potentially be an efficient emission mitigation strategy; however, there is still a paucity of studies addressing the feasibility of dewatering as a practice and further research can focus on this knowledge gap.

AB  - Sequential herbivory leads to a multitude of effects on plants, influencing processes like growth, physiology, defense, and fitness. However, whether the sequential herbivore attack can elicit any transgenerational consequences is poorly examined. In this study, we show evidence of transgenerational impacts of sequential herbivory by two chewing herbivores, fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda , FAW) and soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includens , SL) on soybean (Glycine max ) progeny. Seeds from the parents subjected to different herbivore sequences (SL-FAW: initial attack by SL followed by FAW and FAW-SL: FAW followed by SL) were used for the transgenerational experiment. Our main hypothesis was that parental sequential herbivory would exert transgenerational effects on progeny traits leading to potential trade-offs. Also, herbivore identity and sequence of attack would critically influence these outcomes. A comprehensive investigation of early growth, physiological performance, physical defense (trichomes) and fitness of the progeny was then carried out. Our results revealed that early growth traits like germination, root morphology, and nitrogen/protein content were similar among maternal treatments; however, significant transgenerational impacts of the sequential attack of SL-FAW were observed in physiological and fitness traits. Notably, no transgenerational effects were observed in physical defenses (trichome density), suggesting an investment in physiology and fitness traits over physical defenses. Collectively, the results confirm that the sequence and identity of herbivore attack in the parental generation can critically shape transgenerational plant responses in soybean, providing novel insights on crop performance under multiple biotic stresses.

AB  - Simple Summary: In order to increase the growth performance and make up for the lack of high-quality roughage, farmers are accustomed to adopting high-concentration diets during the fattening period of ruminants. The long-term consumption of high-concentration diets induces a series of nutritional metabolic diseases. In production practice, the major mutton sheep fattening region (e.g., Jiangsu, China) generally uses diets with a concentrate ratio of up to 80% to 90% during the fattening period, and reports of cases of nutritional metabolic diseases are also rare. This seems to indicate that sheep and goats are more adaptable to high-concentration diets than cattle. Our work shows that high-concentrate diets can significantly promote the digestion of nutrients; the liver enhances the adaptability of goats to high-concentration diets by regulating the expression of genes involved in nutrient metabolism and toxin clearance. Therefore, the liver plays a vital role in the adaptation of ruminants to high-concentration diets. The results here can lay the foundation for the rational application of high-concentration diets in production.
   The objective of this study was to determine the effect of high-concentrate diets on the blood parameters and liver transcriptome of goats. Eighteen goats were allocated into three dietary treatments: the high level of concentrate (HC) group, the medium level of concentrate (MC) group, and the low level of concentrate (LC) group. The blood parameters and pathological damage of the gastrointestinal tract and liver tissues were measured. In hepatic portal vein blood, HC showed higher LPS, VFAs, and LA; in jugular vein blood, no significant differences in LPS, VFAs, and LA were recorded among groups (p > 0.05). Compared to the LC and MC groups, the HC group showed significantly increased interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and diamine oxidase in jugular vein blood (p < 0.05). Liver transcriptome analysis discovered a total of 1269 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three groups and most of them came from the HC vs. LC group. There were 333 DEGs up-regulated and 608 down-regulated in the HC group compared to the LC group. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly focused on the regulation of triacylglycerol catabolism, lipoprotein particle remodeling, and cholesterol transport. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the liver of the HC group enhanced the metabolism of nutrients such as VFAs through the activation of AMPK and other signaling pathways and enhanced the clearance and detoxification of LPS by activating the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. A high-concentrate diet (HCD) can significantly promote the digestion of nutrients; the liver enhances the adaptability of goats to an HCD by regulating the expression of genes involved in nutrient metabolism and toxin clearance.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) plantations have been rapidly expanding in recent years in developing countries, but there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of woodland conversion to tea plantations and tea plantation aging on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in subtropical regions, which may be a critical issue for accurately estimating the regional C balance in tea planting areas. Thus, in this study, we selected four tea plantations with ages ranging from 5 to 23 years, along with an adjacent mature pine forest (PF, more than 60 years of age), to investigate the effects of woodland conversion to tea plantations and stand age on SOC. Lignin phenols and amino sugars were used to distinguish the contributions of plant-derived C and microbial-derived C to SOC. The results showed that when PF is converted to a tea plantation, 54.12% of the SOC content in the topsoil is lost, with reductions of 84.77% in plant-derived C and 10.23% in microbial-derived C; however, there is a slight increase in microbial-derived C in the deep-layer soil. The tea planting age only has a negative effect on microbial-derived C in the topsoil. Additionally, the plant aboveground biomass, ratio of carbon to nitrogen, total nitrogen concentration, and clay-silt content are key environmental variables influencing SOC accrual, explaining 59.8% of the total variance. SOC and plant-derived C are thus implicated in the quick response to decreasing plant inputs with land conversion and do not accumulate with increasing tea plantation age under the current tea plantation management practices. Generally, more attention should be focused on SOC loss with woodland conversion to tea plantations at the regional scale, and more effective practices can be applied to enhance SOC accrual in subtropical tea plantations.

AB  - Intensive livestock farming substantially impacts the environment, especially farm and slurry management. Slurries are significant sources of greenhouse gases and ammonia. The present study was conducted in an intensive livestock production system in Galicia, Spain. The measurements were taken at six different farms in that region along with one control using common management practices in Galicia without the addition of a bio-activator. This study aimed to quantify GHGs and NH3 fluxes and their reductions during slurry treatment using a dynamic chamber through FTIR analysis and to examine the potential of usage of bio-activators for slurry management. In addition, gas concentrations were measured at the barns and compared with their slurry management and architectural volume to obtain influences on their management and the architectural volume of the barns. Additionally, the effects of using a bio-activator in the barns inside the facility areas were addressed. Moreover, qPCR analysis was conducted to understand the correlations between syncoms and methanogen populations when a bio-activator is added to the slurry with at least a 30% reduction in methanogenic populations. The outcomes suggest encouraging results for GHG reductions in the livestock sector, giving farmers future options for climate change mitigation among their standard practices.

AB  - In this study, the collected fish species were identified based on morphological observations and then evaluated by DNA barcoding. The COI gene has been recognized as a biological marker for fish species identification and the objective of this study is to analyze the variable region of the COI gene in subunit I. The mitochondrial cytochrome (COI) oxidase subunit I gene was analyzed as a suitable molecular maker for the identification of three specimens of the fish species Hipposcarus harid, widely distributed in the Red Sea. The COI gene sequences in the variable region revealed variations among the fish species. The COI gene sequences in the variable region were similar to the variable region of Hipposcarus harid collected from the Northern Red Sea and all three were named: H. harid H13, H. harid H2c, and H. harid H12. The identification of the fish species collected from the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia would help ichthyologists improve the management, conservation and monitoring of economically important long-nose parrotfish species in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Herbivores can drastically alter the morphology of macroalgae by directly consuming tissue and by inflicting structural wounds. Wounds can result in large amounts of tissue breaking away from macroalgae, amplifying the damage initially caused by herbivores. Herbivores that commonly wound macroalgae often occur over only a portion of a macroalga's lifespan or geographic range. However, we know little about the influence of these periodic or regional occurrences of herbivores on the large-scale seasonal and geographical patterns of macroalgal morphology. We used the intertidal kelp Egregia menziesii to investigate how the kelp's morphology and the prevalence of two prominent kelp-wounding herbivores (limpets and amphipods) changed over two seasons (spring and summer) and over the northern extent of the kelp's geographic range (six sites from central California to northern Washington). Wounds from limpets and amphipods often result in the kelp's fronds being pruned (intercalary meristem broken away), so we quantified kelp size (combined length of all fronds) and pruning (proportion of broken fronds). We found similar results in each season: herbivores were most likely to occur on large, pruned kelp regardless of site; and limpets were the dominant herbivore at southern sites, while amphipods were dominant at northern sites. Despite the geographic shift in the dominant herbivore, kelp had similar levels of total herbivore prevalence (limpets and/or amphipods) and similar morphologies across sites. Our results suggest that large-scale geographic similarities in macroalgal wounding, despite regional variation in the herbivore community, can maintain similar macroalgal morphologies over large geographic areas.</p>

AB  - Since the 1990s Namibia's Conservancies have been depicted as one of the most successful examples of Community Conservation. The growth in game numbers caused by the conservation programme, however, has led to an increase in Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) incidents. These include damages to crops and to infrastructure, the killing of livestock, attacks on humans, and higher levels of psychological stress among affected populations. Local voices often express the feeling that neither compensation payments nor conservation-related benefits outweigh HWC costs. Furthermore, HWC has territorial impacts: it is leading to more restricted access to some areas of land and it reinforces government and NGO discourses in favour of conservation rather than agropastoral land uses. Through the analysis of some specific case-studies we will try to understand these processes, to provide a nuanced view of events on the ground and to explore the potentialities and difficulties of combining wildlife and agropastoral activities on the same lands. It will be shown how, even in reasonably successful conservation schemes, it is difficult to provide rural residents with benefits that would offset HWC costs, and how, most importantly, contrary to the initial Community Conservation ideas of coexistence of human and wildlife populations in open areas, HWC and the measures advocated to prevent it are pushing for stricter boundaries and growing enclosure of separate areas for humans and fauna.

AB  - Although the Atlantic Forest is considered a humid environment, plants that grow on rock outcrops present adaptive strategies, which correlate with tolerance to desiccation. Colleters are secretory structures that protect meristems and developing organs from dehydration and attack by herbivores or pathogens. Colleters are com-mon in Gentianaceae; however, there is little research from an anatomical perspective. This study evaluated three Prepusa species (P. connata, P. hookeriana, and P. viridiflora) that are endemic to rock outcrops associated with the Atlantic Forest to investigate the distribution, anatomy, and histochemical composition of secretion of the their colleter throughout leaf growth and maturation. Samples of young, mature, and senescent leaf bases were collected, fixed, and processed following routine techniques in anatomical and micromorphological studies. In the three species, the colleters are located at the base of the leaves, on the adaxial surface. They are non-vascularized and have a short peduncle and a multicellular secretory portion coated by the cuticle. They develop asynchronously, as they are active in young leaves, and cease their activity in fully expanded leaves, but they are not deciduous. They have intercellular spaces, in which polysaccharide and protein secretions accu-mulate. Moreover, lipids were observed only in P. hookeriana and P. connata. Phenolic compounds are common and occur during colleter senescence, which is characterized by total cell collapse. Even though this study examined congeneric species from similar environments, the results confirm alterations in secretion composition and structural and chemical changes throughout leaf growth and maturation.

AB  - Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are biting nuisances and arbovirus vectors of both public health and veterinary significance in Trinidad. We compared sampling methods to define the behaviour and bionomics of adult Culicoides populations at a commercial dairy goat farm. Three static trap designs were compared: (a) Centre for Disease Control (CDC) downdraft UV trap; (b) CDC trap with an incandescent bulb and (c) CDC trap with semiochemical lure consisting of R-(-)-1-octen-3-ol and CO2 (no bulb). Sweep netting was used to define diel periodicity. A total of 30,701 biting midges were collected using static traps, dominated by female Culicoides furens (>70% of trap collections across all three designs). There was no significant difference in the Margalef's index between the three traps; however, trap designs A and C collected a significantly greater number of individuals than trap B, and trap C gained highest species richness. The greatest species richness and abundance of Culicoides collected by sweep net was observed between 6:00 and 6:15 pm and notable differences in the crepuscular activity pattern of several species were identified. Comparative data on Culicoides species richness, abundance, sex and reproductive status is discussed and can be used to improve surveillance strategies, research designs and risk management.

AB  - While the international conservation discourse is making the case for reframing human-wildlife interactions from human-wildlife conflict (HWC) to coexistence, the latter remains an elusive goal for countries in the Global South grappling with escalated frequency and severity of HWC. Cohabitating in the same landscape as priority conservation species, it has been a fait accompli for poor and marginalized communities in India to bear the disproportionate burden of HWC with serious implications on their lives and well-being as well as for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We make the case that while HWC has typically been framed as a conservation issue, it also merits equal attention as a serious sustainable development issue requiring an extension of the rights-based approach to its management. This is critical for achieving coexistence as well as in the interests of justice and the central promise to "leave no one behind" of the SDGs.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is known as the rooftop of the planet. Its hypoxic atmosphere in low oxygen partial pressure, extreme seasonal climate variation, and aridity poses severe challenges as harsh living environments for pre-historic human to occupy in such high-altitude niches. However, the Lake Qinghai is the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau and the basin has rich water, mineral, and wild food resources, and prehistoric human occupied the Lake Qinghai Basin long before local farming was in practice. In this paper we present results of faunal assemblages associated with variable stone artifacts and pottery shards with bone collagen accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) dates from 3 new archaeological sites to investigate human occupation history in the southern Lake Qinghai Basin. The AMS 14C dating results reveal that the occupation occurs intermittently from the late Glacial to entire Holocene. Through compilation and synthesis of regional archae-ological records, we found that prehistoric humans went through 3 phases of subsistence strategies: 1) hunting large and medium ungulates; 2) hunting medium ungulates; 3) foraging small size mammals with birds and fish diets. At the end, prehistoric humans increasingly adapted to forage and consume caprinaes species (goat), which represents a precursor of domestication or semi-domestication of wild animals in the Lake Qinghai Basin. We further attribute the utilization of caprinaes animal resources to the lower limbs of toe and phalange bones with low nutritious values to advanced social organization that implied prehistoric humans separated hunting activity from protein processing practices. Our investigation of zooarchaeology with reliable bone collagen AMS 14C dates could become a novel approach to study adaptation strategy and social structure changes of prehistorical Tibetan humans.

AB  - We used single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) data to investigate the genetic structure, diversity, and relationship between native and foreign cross bred goats. The Korean native black goat (KNBG) has four different strains; however, this differentiation is based solely on external factors. To differentiate KNBGs from foreign crossbred goats (CGs), we used the Illumina Goat SNP50K BeadChip to perform genome analysis. We found an SNP marker that could distinguish between breeds and strains of KNBGs, as well as between KNBGs and CGs. We extracted genetic data from 506 goats and identified 45,836 common SNPs. To identify the distinguishing SNPs, we calculated the allele frequency difference for each breed, and analyzed the absolute value of the frequency difference between randomly selected breeds using the top 10, 20, 30, 50, and 150 SNPs. The data were used to represent the genetic structure of KNBGs and CGs goats, and principal component analysis revealed a distinguishing marker between them. As the SNP value increased, the markers became more distinct. Our findings can provide insights into the genetic information about the KNBGs strains, and SNP data will serve as the basis for future genetic selection.

AB  - foraging groups of reef fishes, although relatively common in occurrence, have historically received little attention. Most studies on this topic have been descriptive accounts of specific associations. In this study, we collected data on mixed-species foraging groups seen in the Lakshadweep islands, resulting in a dataset of 1289 groups. Data was collected from both reefs and lagoons of three islands (Kadmat, Kavaratti, and Agatti) within the Lakshadweep Archipelago over a period of three years. Cluster analysis revealed nine categories based on species composition in groups: parrotfish, juveniles, surgeonfish (small), surgeonfish (large), Anampses spp., wrasses, Parupeneus macronema, Parupeneus barberinus, and other goatfish groups. The clusters are named based on the nuclear species or most frequently seen species within the groups. These groups are distinct not only in terms of composition but also other parameters such as behavior (shoaling or attendant groups), habitat affinity, and group cohesion. Groups comprising herbivorous species such as parrotfish and surgeonfish were almost entirely shoaling in nature (large groups without nuclear individuals), whereas goatfish and wrasses tended to form smaller attendant associations. Groups also occupied different habitat typest for example, parrotfish and P. barberinus groups were seen mostly in lagoons while surgeonfish, wrasses, and P. macronema groups were more abundant on reefs. Our findings suggest that mixed-species foraging groups in fishes are comprised of distinct compositional categories that vary in behavior, cohesion, and habitat affinity.

AB  - Long ncRNAs regulate a complex array of fundamental biological processes, while its molecular regulatory mechanism in Leydig cells (LCs) remains unclear. In the present study, we established the lncRNA LOC102176306/miR-1197-3p/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) regulatory network by bioinformatic prediction, and investigated its roles in goat LCs. We found that lncRNA LOC102176306 could efficiently bind to miR-1197-3p and regulate PPARGC1A expression in goat LCs. Downregulation of lncRNA LOC102176306 significantly supressed testosterone (T) synthesis and ATP production, decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial complex I and complex Ill, caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited the proliferation of goat LCs by decreasing PPARGC1A expression, while these effects could be restored by miR-1197-3p inhibitor treatment. In addition, miR-1197-3p mimics treatment significantly alleviated the positive effects of lncRNA LOC102176306 overexpression on T and ATP production, antioxidant capacity and proliferation of goat LCs. Taken together, lncRNA LOC102176306 functioned as a sponge for miR-1197-3p to maintain PPARGC1A expression, thereby affecting the steroidogenesis, cell proliferation and oxidative stress of goat LCs. These findings extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of T synthesis, cell proliferation and oxidative stress of LCs.

AB  - The chronic exposure of livestock to lead (Pb) pollution in historical mining areas may represent significant and unnecessary costs for farmers and primary producers, in addition to important food safety risks. Here, we evaluate the effect of mineral supplements, in the form of a commercial mineral block (MB), to reduce Pb bioavailability and toxicity in sheep through an experimental approach under real farming conditions in an abandoned mining area. Blood, fecal Pb levels, and soil ingestion, along with different blood and plasma biomarkers were studied. Experiment 1 was carried out with 3-months-old female lambs, n = 54, fenced in two contiguous MB and non-MB-supplemented plots. After 20 days of treatment, blood Pb level was lower in MB-supplemented sheep than in those that were non-MB-supplemented. Experiment 2 was carried out with 2-months-old female lambs, n = 34, fenced in a single plot and MB-supplemented during the first 20 days of experiment. After MB supplementation, blood Pb level in sheep was also reduced by almost half, falling below the threshold of subclinical intoxication, and then increased again after 20 days without MB. Experiment 3 was carried out with adult rams, n = 10, fenced in a single MB-supplemented plot during the first 20 days of experiment. In this case, blood Pb level decreased by day 40. Soil ingestion was not reduced by MB supplementation in any of the experiments. MB supplementation favored antioxidant status by increasing SOD activity and reducing GPX activity and MDA levels. In conclusion, the MB supplementation seemed to reduce Pb bioavailability by increasing its fecal excretion, but renal excretion and bone deposition may also have favored the reduction of blood Pb concentration. Mineral supplements may be a new easy-to-apply and cost-effective way to reduce livestock exposure in Pb polluted sites.

AB  - Human-mediated biological invasions can lead to introgressive hybridization events between lineages that have evolved independently, with potential for evolutionary, ecological, economic and social impacts. This study provides evidence for the ongoing spread and hybridization between two major invasive and destructive termite pest species, Coptotermes gestroi and C. formosanus in Florida. Heterospecific courtship behaviour between alates (winged reproductive caste) of the two species has led to the establishment of F1 hybrid colonies in the field, which have matured and produced F1 hybrid alates. Laboratory backcross attempts confirmed the possibility for F1 hybrid female alates to establish viable F2 colonies with males of either parental species. With the recent documentation of introgressive hybridization between the two species in Taiwan, the current study confirms its independent occurrence in Florida, demonstrating that both Coptotermes species can hybridize in areas where their distributions overlap. In Florida, the proximity of field-established hybrid colonies to the large leisure boat industry implies that Florida populations of C. gestroi, C. formosanus and their hybrids will continue to serve as a bridgehead source of propagules for further dispersal beyond their current distribution, with a potential for F1 hybrids to spread outside of Florida.

AB  - Background Scrophularia oxyrhyncha (Scrophulariaceae), endemic to southwest Spain, is one of the species of the genus whose distribution across the Iberian Peninsula is most limited. In this study, we analyzed its reproductive system by evaluating its fruit and seed set after different treatments, floral phenology, reproductive success, and the predation level of two populations in the Extremadura region (Spain), inhabiting different substrates (quartzitic in the San Serv & aacute;n population, granitic in the Cornalvo population) between 2019 and 2022.ResultsScrophularia oxyrhyncha presents protogyny, it is self-compatible but requires the presence of pollinators to produce offspring which, in quite a high percentage, would result from geitonogamous pollinations. The two populations did not differ significantly in their reproductive behaviour throughout the years studied, and both presented a spring synchronous pattern, somewhat longer in the San Serv & aacute;n population; this was probably due to the existence of two short second flowering periods caused by sheep predation suffered by individuals. The main threat to the populations was cattle grazing and, to a lesser extent, caterpillars.ConclusionsCattle grazing decreased reproductive success and altered the floral display in such a way that there was a flowering time-pollinator activity mismatch. The decline in reproductive success due to vertebrate predation depended on the time at which such predation occurred, with the most severe being late predation, that is, after peak flowering. Finally, we recommend that the pertinent authorities adopt measures to ensure the conservation and survival of the populations of this endemic species in Extremadura.

AB  - We present a fast and reliable genetic method for sexing Pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) via high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of amplicons obtained through real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RT). This method employs the KY1/KY2 primer set to amplify an informative fragment of the Amelogenin gene that accurately determines the sex of Pampas deer. This approach is effective for analyzing noninvasive samples with low DNA quality and quantity. Additionally, this new PCR-RT protocol can be easily adapted for sexing non-invasive samples from other deer and ungulate species.

AB  - Pig farming plays a crucial socioeconomic role in the European Union, which is one of the largest pork exporters in the world. In Portugal, pig farming plays a key role in regional development and the national economy. To ensure future sustainability and minimize environmental impacts, it is essential to identify the most deleterious pig production activities. This study carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) of pig production using a conventional system in central Portugal to identify the unitary processes with the greatest environmental impact problems. LCA followed the ISO 14040/14044 standards, covering the entire production cycle, from feed manufacturing to waste management, using 1 kg of live pig weight as the functional unit. The slurry produced is used as fertilizer in agriculture, replacing synthetic chemical fertilizers. Results show that feed production, raising piglets, and fattening pigs are the most impactful phases of the pig production cycle. Fodder production is the stage with the greatest impact, accounting for approximately 60% to 70% of the impact in the categories analyzed in most cases. The environmental categories with the highest impacts were freshwater ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, and marine ecotoxicity; the most significant impacts were observed for human health, with an estimated effect of around 0.00045 habitants equivalent (Hab.eq) after normalization. The use of more sustainable ingredients and the optimization of feed efficiency are effective strategies for promoting sustainability in the pig farming sector.

AB  - Host shift is ecologically advantageous and a crucial driver for herbivore insect speciation. Insects on the nonnative host obtain enemy -free space and confront reduced competition, but they must adapt to survive. Such signatures of adaptations can often be detected at the gene expression level. It is astonishing how bark beetles cope with distinct chemical environments while feeding on various conifers. Hence, we aim to disentangle the six -toothed bark beetle (Ips sexdentatus) response against two different conifer defences upon host shift (Scots pine to Norway spruce). We conducted bioassay and metabolomic analysis followed by RNA-seq experiments to comprehend the beetle's ability to surpass two different terpene-based conifer defence systems. Beetle growth rate and fecundity were increased when reared exclusively on spruce logs (alternative host) compared to pine logs (native host). Comparative gene expression analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to digestion, detoxification, transporter activity, growth, signalling, and stress response in the spruce -feeding beetle gut. Transporter genes were highly abundant during spruce feeding, suggesting they could play a role in pumping a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds or allelochemicals out. Trehalose transporter (TRET) is also up -regulated in the spruce -fed beetle gut to maintain homeostasis and stress tolerance. RTqPCR and enzymatic assays further corroborated some of our findings. Taken together, the transcriptional plasticity of key physiological genes plays a crucial role after the host shift and provides vital clues for the adaptive potential of bark beetles on different conifer hosts.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a common method for managing liquid manure and other biomasses, generating biogas as a renewable energy source. The resulting digestate can be processed into organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient recycling, but its environmental impact warrants investigation. In this study, a life cycle assessment was conducted to examine the impact of fertilizers derived from cattle slurry and grass-clover co-digestion on global warming (measured in CO2 equivalents) compared to untreated cattle slurry (CA). The different treatments analyzed include CA, digestate, liquid fractions (LFs) from digestate separation, and an enriched liquid nitrogen-sulfur product derived from post-processing of biogas and drying of the solid fraction. The functional units of this study were 100 kg of total nitrogen in the final organic fertilizer (FU1) with the cradle-to-processing gate boundary, and the harvesting of 1 ton of spring barley dry matter (FU2) with the cradle-to-field application boundary. The carbon footprint ranged from 24% to 49% of the baseline scenario for FU1, and from -6% to 177% of the baseline scenario for FU2. The main contributors to the carbon footprint of fertilizers included greenhouse gas emissions from storage and field application. However, biogas production from anaerobic digestion, together with the concurrent mitigation of CH4 emissions during storage, contributed most to a reduction in the overall global warming potential associated with anaerobic digestate and its LF. This study showed large climate prospects in replacing untreated slurry as organic fertilizer with alternatives resulting from its anaerobic digestion and post-treatment.

AB  - The intestinal microbiome plays critical, interactive roles in host nutrition and metabolism and may be involved in the known growth advantage of hybrids. In a previous study, we obtained healthy F1 hybrids (PS) by crossing carnivorous Percocypris pingi (PP, male) and herbivorous Schizothorax wangchiachii (SW, female) and found that the PS hybrids exhibited a growth advantage and that their feeding traits were similar to those of omnivorous S. davidi (SD). In this study, we compared the intestinal histology and anatomy of four fish lines (PP, PS, SW, SD) and, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, constructed a map of their intestinal microbiome to explore host -influenced intestinal microbiome community composition among them under the same diet. We found that the intestinal anatomical and histological traits of PS and SD were similar, and intermediate between PP and SW, but closer to SW. Although PS and SD have similar feeding traits, their intestinal microbiome composition varied remarkably and, notably, the SD microbiome was closer to that of SW, indicating that phylogenetic effects may play a stronger role in gut microbiome development than the effects of feeding traits. Cetobacterium and Aero-monas were the predominant components of the intestinal microbiome in the four fishes, the former was more abundant in PP, and the latter was more abundant in SW and SD. The relative abundances of Cetobacterium and Aeromonas were lower in PS than in the other three fish lines, but the relative abundances of other microor-ganisms were generally higher in the PS microbiome, which led to more OTUs and higher alpha diversity. In addition, trypsin activity and amylase activity were strongly positively correlated with the relative abundance of Cetobacterium and Aeromonas, respectively. Although the digestive enzyme activities of PS showed hybrid weakness, its intestinal microbial diversity was higher, which may be related to its growth advantage.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying nitric oxide (NO)-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and its impact on yak muscle tenderness during post-mortem aging. The Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle of yak were incubated at 4 degrees C for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 72 h after treatment with 0.9% saline, NO activator, or a combination of the NO activator and an HIF-1 alpha inhibitor. Results indicated that elevated NO levels could increase HIF-1 alpha transcription to achieve stable expression of HIF-1 alpha protein (P < 0.05). Additionally, elevated NO triggered HIF-1 alpha S-nitrosylation, which further upregulated the activity of key glycolytic enzymes, increased glycogen consumption, accelerated lactic acid accumulation, and decreased pH (P < 0.05). These processes eventually improved the tenderness of yak muscle during post-mortem aging (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that NO-induced activation of HIF-1 alpha S-nitrosylation enhanced glycolysis during post-mortem aging and provided a possible pathway for improving meat tenderness

AB  - Reducing the total mission time is essential in wildlife surveys owing to the dynamic movement of animals throughout their migrating environment and potentially extreme changes in weather. This paper proposed a multi-UAV path planning method for counting various flora and fauna populations, which can fully use the UAVs' limited flight time to cover large areas. Unlike the current complete coverage path planning methods, based on sweep and polygon, our work encoded the path planning problem as the satisfiability modulo theory using a one-hot encoding scheme. Each instance generated a set of feasible paths at each iteration and recovered the set of shortest paths after sufficient time. We also flexibly optimized the paths based on the number of UAVs, endurance and camera parameters. We implemented the planning algorithm with four UAVs to conduct multiple photographic aerial wildlife surveys in areas around Zonag Lake, the birthplace of Tibetan antelope. Over 6 square kilometers was surveyed in about 2 h. In contrast, previous human-piloted single-drone surveys of the same area required over 4 days to complete. A generic few-shot detector that can perform effective counting without training on the target object is utilized in this paper, which can achieve an accuracy of over 97%.

AB  - Substrate-borne vibrational communication is commonly used by herbivorous insects to communicate intraspecific information. This form of communication is underexplored and many discoveries of the form and functional significance of these vibrations have yet to be made. Here, we add redmilk weed beetles, Tetraopes tetrophthalmus(Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) to the record of arthro-pods that communicate with these plant-borne vibrations. Red milkweed beetles, like other cerambycids, commonly use stridulation to produce audible squeaks when in stressful situations and can also produce plant-borne vibrations when in contact with conspecifics. These beetles engage in fights for territory which ultimately results in mating opportunities (i.e., contests). We placed beetles into three sex-ratio treatments: male-male (contests), male-female (copulatory courtship),or male-male-female (contests and copulatory courtship). We first describe contests and copulatory courtship behaviours. We then used laser vibrometry and found that red milkweed beetles communicate by producing plant-borne vibrational signals composed of low-frequency rumbles and high-frequency clacks during male-male contests and copulatory courtship. We compared the spectral and temporal features of the vibrations between the two pre-copulatory contexts. We found that vibrational signals were shorter and had a higher fundamental and dominant frequencies when beetles engaged in contests compared to copulatory courtship behaviours. Our results show that these beetles use plant-borne vibrations as context-dependent signals that communicate different information under these two pre-copulatory scenarios. Our data suggests that these context-dependent signals may help beetles gain access to mates and prolong copulation.

AB  - The Paleocene Paskapoo Formation in Alberta, Canada, offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into insect diversity at that time. This fossil insect-rich formation has yielded a variety of fossil arthropod specimens, including several wings of Odonata related to the genus Alloaeschna Wighton and Wilson, 1986. Here, we demonstrate that morphological characters previously used to separate three species are instead the result of intraspecific variability. We reinforce this demonstration using two examples of high variability and plasticity in modern species of the family Aeshnidae. Accordingly, we reinterpreted the taxonomic position of Alloaeschna marklae Wighton and Wilson, 1986 syn. nov. and Alloaeschna quadrata Wighton and Wilson, 1986 syn. nov. as junior synonyms of Alloaeschna paskapooensis Wighton and Wilson, 1986. In addition, we describe the first occurrence of a zygopteran in the Paskapoo Formation, namely Albertalestes paskapooensis gen. et sp. nov. (Synlestidae). Importantly, this new taxon is the first representative of the family found in North America. We also reconstructed the relationships within the Synlestidae under Bayesian inferences with a newly assembled matrix. Finally, we discuss the biogeography of the clade considering its fossil record using parsimony ancestral state reconstruction.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D5282228-2D59-46E9-B712-3DC5A71C42FD

AB  - Gastrointestinal infections present major challenges to ruminant livestock systems, and gut health is a key constraint on fitness, welfare, and productivity. Fecal biomarkers present opportunities to monitor animal health without using invasive methods, and with greater resolution compared to observational metrics. Here we developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for three potential fecal biomarkers of gut health in domestic ruminants: two immunological (total immunoglobulin [Ig]A and total IgG) and one inflammatory (lactoferrin). We analytically validated the assays, then evaluated whether they could be used as a biomarker of clinically diagnosed gastrointestinal pathologies in cattle (Bos taurus), and finally compared them with helminth fecal egg counts in sheep (Ovis aries). The analytes were detected above the lower limits of detection in cattle, sheep, and goats. Fecal IgA and lactoferrin were higher in cattle with infectious pathologies (strongyles, coccidiosis and symptomatic Johne's disease) compared to healthy controls. Lactoferrin was additionally higher in animals with infectious pathologies compared to noninfectious pathologies, and to asymptomatic Johne's cases. No significant relationships were found with sheep fecal egg counts. These initial findings suggest that fecal IgA and lactoferrin may be useful biomarkers of poor gastrointestinal health in cattle, and that fecal lactoferrin is specific to active inflammation caused by infectious agents. These could be incorporated into the growing suite of noninvasive ecoimmunological tools and used to understand ruminant gut health in a range of species. Applications include improving treatment regimens for gastrointestinal infections, and understanding wildlife physiological responses to infectious challenges.

AB  - Depression, a prevalent mental disorder with significant socioeconomic burdens, underscores the urgent need for safe and effective non-pharmacological interventions. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed the pivotal role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of depression. Concurrently, exercise, as a cost-effective and accessible intervention, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay among exercise, gut microbiota modulation, and depression, elucidating the mechanistic pathways through which exercise ameliorates depressive symptoms via the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Depression is characterized by gut microbiota alterations, including reduced alpha and beta diversity, depletion of beneficial taxa (e. g., Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Coprococcus), and overgrowth of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic bacteria (e. g., Morganella, Klebsiella, and Enterobacteriaceae). Metagenomic analyses reveal disrupted metabolic functions in depressive patients, such as diminished synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), impaired tryptophan metabolism, and dysregulated bile acid conversion. For instance, Bifidobacterium longum deficiency correlates with reduced synthesis of neuroactive metabolites like homovanillic acid, while decreased Coprococcus abundance limits butyrate production, exacerbating neuroinflammation. Furthermore, elevated levels of indole derivatives from Clostridium species inhibit serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, contributing to depressive phenotypes. These dysbiotic profiles disrupt the MGB axis, triggering systemic inflammation, neurotransmitter imbalances, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity. Exercise exerts profound effects on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and metabolic activity. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that sustained aerobic exercise increases alpha diversity, enriches SCFA-producing genera (e. g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia, and Akkermansia), and suppresses pathobionts (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Streptococcus). For example, a meta-analysis of 25 trials involving 1 044 participants confirmed that exercise enhances microbial richness and restores the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, a biomarker of metabolic health. Notably, endurance training promotes Veillonella proliferation, which converts lactate into propionate, enhancing energy metabolism and delaying fatigue. Exercise also strengthens intestinal barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1, occludin), thereby reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation and systemic inflammation. However, excessive exercise may paradoxically diminish microbial diversity and exacerbate intestinal permeability, highlighting the importance of moderate intensity and duration. Exercise ameliorates depressive symptoms through multifaceted interactions with the gut microbiota, primarily via 4 interconnected pathways. First, exercise mitigates neuroinflammation by elevating anti-inflammatory SCFAs such as butyrate, which suppresses NF-kappa B signaling to attenuate microglial activation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Animal studies demonstrate that voluntary wheel running reduces hippocampal TNF-alpha and IL-17 levels in stress-induced depression models, while fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from exercised mice reverses depressive behaviors by modulating the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway.
   Second, exercise regulates neurotransmitter dynamics by enriching GABA-producing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, thereby counteracting neuronal hyperexcitability. Aerobic exercise also enhances the abundance of Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus thermophilus, which facilitate 5-HT and dopamine synthesis. Clinical trials reveal that 12 weeks of moderate exercise increases fecal Coprococcus and Blautia abundance, correlating with improved 5-HT bioavailability and reduced depression scores. Third, exercise normalizes HPA axis hyperactivity by reducing cortisol levels and restoring glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. In rodent models, chronic stress-induced corticosterone elevation is reversed by probiotic supplementation (e. g., Lactobacillus), which enhances endocannabinoid signaling and hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, exercise upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via microbial metabolites like butyrate, promoting histone acetylation and synaptic plasticity. FMT experiments confirm that exercise-induced microbiota elevates prefrontal BDNF expression, reversing stress-induced neuronal atrophy. Fourth, exercise reshapes microbial metabolic crosstalk, diverting tryptophan metabolism toward 5-HT synthesis instead of neurotoxic kynurenine derivatives. Butyrate inhibits indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), a key enzyme in the kynurenine pathway linked to depression. Concurrently, exercise-induced Akkermansia enrichment enhances mucin production, fortifies the gut barrier, and reduces LPS-driven neuroinflammation. Collectively, these mechanisms underscore exercise as a potent modulator of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, offering a holistic approach to alleviating depression through microbial and neurophysiological synergy. Current evidence supports exercise as a potent adjunct therapy for depression, with personalized regimens (e. g., aerobic, resistance, or yoga) tailored to individual microbiota profiles. However, challenges remain in optimizing exercise prescriptions (intensity, duration, and type) and integrating them with probiotics, prebiotics, or FMT for synergistic effects. Future research should prioritize largescale randomized controlled trials to validate causality, multi-omics approaches to decipher MGB axis dynamics, and mechanistic studies exploring microbial metabolites as therapeutic targets. The authors advocate for a paradigm shift toward microbiota-centric interventions, emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between physical activity and gut ecosystem resilience in mental health management. In conclusion, this review underscores exercise as a multifaceted modulator of the gut-brain axis, offering novel insights into non-pharmacological strategies for depression. By bridging microbial ecology, neuroimmunology, and exercise physiology, this work lays a foundation for precision medicine approaches targeting the gut microbiota to alleviate depressive disorders.

AB  - Aerospace breeding is a breeding technique that utilizes a spacecraft to position plants in a space environment for mutagenesis, which is conducive to rapid mutagenesis for the screening of superior plant varieties. In this study, tea trees with aviation mutagenesis (TM) and those without aviation mutagenesis (CK) were selected as research subjects to analyze the effects of aviation mutagenesis on the growth, physiological properties, and hormone metabolism of tea trees, and to further screen the characteristic hormones and validate their functions. The results showed that the leaf length, leaf width, and leaf area of TM tea trees were significantly larger than those of CK. The growth indexes, the photosynthetic physiological indexes (i.e., chlorophyll content, intercellular CO2 concentration, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and photosynthetic rate), and the resistance physiological indexes (i.e., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and soluble sugar) were significantly higher in TM than in CK. Hormone metabolome analysis showed that four characteristic hormones distinguished CK from TM, namely, l-tryptophan, indole, salicylic acid, and salicylic acid 2-O-beta-glucoside, all of which were significantly more abundant in TM than in CK. These four characteristic hormones were significantly and positively correlated with the growth indexes, tea yield, and the photosynthetic and resistance physiological indexes of tea trees. The leaf area, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and superoxide dismutase activity of tea tree seedlings after spraying with the four characteristic hormones were significantly increased, in which salicylic acid and salicylic acid 2-O-beta-glucoside were more favorable to increase the leaf area and superoxide dismutase activity, while l-tryptophan and indole were more favorable to increase the leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate. It can be observed that aviation mutagenesis improves the accumulation of the characteristic hormones of tea trees, enhances their photosynthetic capacity, improves their resistance, promotes their growth, and then improves the tea yield.

AB  - Theory predicts that plants invest in defences proportional to the value or amount of tissue at risk. Domatia-bearing plants house predatory arthropods that defend against insect and fungal attack. Though leaf domatia represent a direct investment in the defence of leaf tissues, it remains unknown whether domatia production scales with amount of tissue at risk. I investigated how domatia investment scales with leaf size in 20 species of trees and shrubs from the south-west Pacific. Large-leaved species produced more domatia than smaller leaved species. However, domatia production did not consistently scale with leaf area among individuals of the same species, illustrating that trends in domatia investment are scale-dependent. Overall results suggest the processes modulating the allocation of resources to defence at the interspecific level are distinct from those operating at the intraspecific level.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the potential biological mechanisms of improved growth performance associated with potential changes in the metabolic profiles and intestinal microbiome composition of weaned pigs fed various feed additives. Three separate 42 day experiments were conducted to evaluate the following dietary treatments: chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine (PC), herbal blends, turmeric, garlic, bitter orange extract, sweet orange extract, volatile and semi-volatile milk-derived substances, yeast nucleotide, and cell wall products, compared with feeding a non-supplemented diet (NC). In all three experiments, only pigs fed PC had improved (p < 0.05) ADG and ADFI compared with pigs fed NC. No differences in metabolome and microbiome responses were observed between feed additive treatments and NC. None of the feed additives affected alpha or beta microbiome diversity in the ileum and cecum, but the abundance of specific bacterial taxa was affected by some dietary treatments. Except for feeding antibiotics, none of the other feed additives were effective in improving growth performance or significantly altering the metabolomic profiles, but some additives (e.g., herbal blends and garlic) increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of potentially protective bacterial genera that may be beneficial during disease challenge in weaned pigs.

AB  - In the Northeast Atlantic deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis) trawl fishery, the bycatch of juvenile fish and shrimp represents a problem. This study evaluated if inserting a 200 mm mesh size top-panel in the last three sections of the tapered upper belly section of the trawl could reduce bycatch of juveniles while maintaining the catch efficiency for deep-water shrimp. The bycatch species investigated were Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), redfish (Sebastes spp.) and polar cod (Boreogadus saida). The bycatch of Greenland halibut and the smallest polar cod was significantly reduced, while no effect was found for redfish. The large mesh panel did not lead to a significant loss of deep-water shrimp. The results of this study illustrate how a simple modification of a fishing gear can mitigate the bycatch problem in a shrimp fishery, without significant losses of the target species.

AB  - Intensive semen collection often leads to "kidney yang deficiency" in male yaks, with symptoms like lethargy and poor semen quality. Our modified "Yijing Fang" was tested. Eight 3 - 6-year-old male yaks with this condition were split into treatment and negative control groups; four healthy yaks were a blank control. The treated yaks got the formula in feed for 5 days, then a 20-day break, repeating 3 times over 65 days. Semen was collected, and cAMP, cGMP, T/E2 levels, and mitochondrial apoptosis factors were analyzed. Results showed the formula boosted semen quality. cAMP and testosterone rose (p < 0.01), cGMP and estradiol fell (p < 0.01), cAMP/cGMP and T/E2 ratios climbed (p < 0.01). Bcl-2 upregulated, Bax, Cyt-C, and Caspase-3 downregulated (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the modified "Yijing Fang" is effective for yak reproduction, enhancing hormone secretion and reducing sperm apoptosis. Long-term studies are needed.

AB  - Plankton plays a prominent role in the bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg). The MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE campaign was carried out in spring 2019 along a north-south transect including coastal and offshore areas of the Mediterranean Sea. Sampling of sea water and plankton by pumping and nets was carried out in the chlorophyll maximum layer. Two size-fractions of phytoplankton (0.7-2.7 and 2.7-20 mu m) and five of zooplankton (between 60 and >2000 mu m) were separated, and their total mercury (THg) and monomethylmercury (MMHg) contents were measured. Bioconcentration of THg was significantly higher in the smallest phytoplankton size-fraction dominated by Synechococcus spp. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of MMHg in zooplankton was influenced by size, food sources, biochemical composition and trophic level. MMHg was biomagnified in the plankton food web, while THg decreased toward higher trophic levels. Higher MMHg concentrations were measured in oligotrophic areas. Plankton communities in the Southern Mediterranean Sea had lower MMHg concentrations than those in the Northern Mediterranean Sea. These results highlighted the influence of environmental conditions and trophodynamics on the transfer of Hg in Mediterranean plankton food webs, with implications for higher trophic level consumers.

AB  - Fuel composition, i.e. Pu content, minor actinide (MA) content, oxygen-to-metal (O/M) ratio, etc., affects the irradiation behavior of MA-bearing mixed oxide (MOX) for fast reactor. To evaluate the O/M dependence of pore migration regarding fuel restructuring at the beginning of irradiation, we are developing BISON for MOX in cooperation with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and have installed a pore migration model considering vapor pressure of vapor species and thermal conductivity for MOX. The O/M dependence of fuel restructuring observed in MA-bearing MOX irradiation in the experimental fast reactor Joyo was evaluated by a two-dimensional (2-D) analysis. To solve partial differential equations for energy conservation and advection diffusion equations to calculate temperature and pore migration, respectively, a correlation of thermal conductivity as a function of porosity, temperature, deviation from stoichiometry, Am content and Np content was used. In addition, the pore migration velocity was calculated by using a correlation depending on vapor pressure applying Rand-Markin's model. Four MA-bearing MOX test pins with different O/M ratio and pellet/cladding gap size were irradiated in B14 test in Joyo to study the effects of O/M ratio and gap size on irradiation behavior at the beginning of irradiation. In post-irradiation examinations (PIE), a remarkable restructuring was observed in stoichiometric fuels, and a discrepancy in central void diameter among various O/M ratios. This restructuring behavior could be evaluated by considering the influence of O/M ratio on vapor pressure. Also, a central void is assumed to offset from the geometric center to the larger-gap side due to the pellet eccentricity, but the PIE results were inconsistent in this regard. It is expected that the irradiated pellet might displace to another side during sample preparation in PIE from a reverse offset location during irradiation by comparing the result of 2-D analysis and radial profile of fuel density.

AB  - Background One main anthropogenic activity through which aggregate stability and elements are impacted in soils is through fertilization. Inputs of phosphate fertilizers to soils, for instance, have direct impacts on other elements in soils. Organic fertilizer sources are also known to markedly influence the availability of microelements. However, the extent to which different combination ratios of organic and chemical fertilizers affect the availability of these microelements in paddy soil aggregates is not clear. Aim Therefore, this study examined aggregate stability and the distribution pattern of various extractable aluminum, and iron oxides as influenced by a long-term varied combinations of pig manure with chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizer in a rice-managed paddy. Method Mehlich 3, dithionite, oxalate, and pyrophosphate solutions were used to extract oxides of Al and Fe in bulk soil, and aggregates under long-term fertilizer combinations, which included unfertilized CK (control), chemical NPK, 30% chemical NPK + 70% pig manure, 50% chemical NPK + 50% pig manure, and 70% chemical NPK + 30% pig manure in a randomly complete block design. Results The highest manure treatment (70% manure) markedly increased total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in contrast to other treatments. Soil pH was higher in all manure-treated fertilizers than in chemical NPK fertilizer likely because organic matter (OM) neutralized the protons. Additionally, the highest manure treatment led to the creation of more macroaggregates (2-0.25 mm), which translated into higher aggregate stability indices such as mean weight diameter (MWD), and geometric mean diameter (GMD) compared to other treatments. It was also noted that the 70% manure treatment in comparison with other treatments, was associated with higher concentrations of extractable Al and Fe oxides. It was, however, not clear if the changes in extractable metals detected in this treatment resulted from OM-driven redistribution of metals or if the manure contained some Al and Fe itself. Conclusion The 70% manure treatment increased TOC, TN, pH, and aggregate stability indices (higher MWD and GMD). This fertilizer treatment was also associated with more extractable Al and Fe oxides. For more sustainable rice-managed paddies, the 70% manure treatment should be considered over the other fertilizer combinations.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper is a literature review on the reproductive technologies used in male Neo-tropical hystricomorphic rodents. It is the first of two literature reviews to be completed in order to aid future experiments on the estrus synchronization and artificial insemination of the agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). To improve efficient reproduction, reproductive technologies are commonly used in domesticated animals; therefore, it is wise to explore the feasibility of their application on Neo-tropical rodents, an alternative meat source with the potential to aid in conservation and wildlife farming. However, there must first be a proper understanding of their reproductive anatomy, before reproductive technologies can be utilized. The penis of the agouti and the paca (Cuniculus paca), for example, were found to be covered in penile spines with two keratinized spines and two lateral penile cartilages on either side of the glans penis, unlike the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). Different methods can be used to collect semen from these animals and, based on the performed review, it has been shown that coconut water powder (ACP-123) is a good diluent for both the agouti and the paca, giving higher spermatozoa parameters compared with those obtained via electro ejaculation. This review, which is the first of two, focuses on the male reproductive anatomy and reproductive technologies used in Neo-tropical hystricomorphic rodents with the potential for domestication, which are the agouti (Dasyprocta leporina), the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and the paca (Cuniculus paca). We consider over seventy references spanning from 1965 to 2020, with the majority of work being done in the past twenty years. Knowledge of the reproductive tract and reproductive technologies is critical to the conservation and preservation of these species. Although all three animals had similarities in their anatomy, such as no overt scrotums and testes located intra-abdominally in the inguinal region, some had unique features-for example, the agouti and the paca had penile spines, and two lateral penile cartilages. High spermatogenic efficiency was noted in the agouti and the paca, making them good candidates for increasing their reproductive performance in conservation programs. A review of the literature has shown that there is increasing work taking place on the reproductive technologies used in these animals; however, a lot of work is still lacking, as, to the author's knowledge, standard protocols and artificial insemination procedures are yet to be established.

AB  - Farm activities contribute to approximately one-third of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Most of the GHG in the atmosphere comes from carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The main objective of this research is to investigate direct and indirect GHG emission in five different agroecosystems, contrasted by tillage agricultural, farm practices (oat and maize-fava and vetch).CO2, N2O y CH4 concentrations were measured using two closed static chambers. Total biomass and production costs were determined. Indirect emissions were calculated from fuel used in producing and packing of synthetic fertilizers and herbicide, and sheep manure mineralization. The results showed that CO2 was the gas that most contributes to GHG emissions followed by the CH4 and NO2. The agrosystem with reduce tillage and synthetic inputs had the highest emissions (979 CO2 eq kg ha- 1). Agrosystems using synthetic inputs (conventional and reduce tillage) showed higher indirect emissions (958 and 856 CO2 eq kg ha � 1 respectively). Maize in monoculture produced more than the systems with rotation or intercropping. Reduced tillage with intercropping and organic inputs was the most expensive to produce but had the least gas emission per dollar invested and per kilogram of biomass produced while conventional tillage agrosystems with organic or synthetic inputs stored little carbon in the soil, produced less biomass per unit area and presented higher CO2 eq emissions per unit of biomass.

AB  - Juvenile diet can profoundly affect subsequent adult development, morphology and reproductive investment. Yet, little is known about how juvenile diet affects adult investment into chemical-based sexual signalling, perhaps due to the historical assumption that pheromone production is not costly. We explored how juvenile diet influenced the reproductive investment of adults in the gumleaf skeletonizer moth, Uraba lugens. Juveniles were reared on different host plant species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus moorei) and on E. moorei host plants with different fertilizer treatments (fertilized and non-fertilized). These juvenile diets differ in foliage carbon and nitrogen content. Several adult life history traits were influenced by juvenile diet, including body size in females, and longevity in males. However, we found no evidence from Y-maze olfactometer assays that diet affected the attractiveness of female pheromones to males. Finally, host plant species affected male pre-copulatory investment: males reared on E. moorei had longer antennae, but less dense sensilla. Combined, our experiments suggest that the effects of juvenile diet on investment in reproductive traits, including those associated with signalling, differ between males and females. Females allocate nutrients to adult body size, which determines fecundity. In contrast, males allocate nutrients to adult longevity and antennae size, both of which improve mate search and mating success.

AB  - Host plant specialization is a major force driving ecological niche partitioning and diversification in insect herbivores. The cyanogenic defences of Passiflora plants keep most herbivores at bay, but not the larvae of Heliconius butterflies, which can both sequester and biosynthesize cyanogenic compounds. Here, we demonstrate that both Heliconius cydno chioneus and H. melpomene rosina have remarkable plasticity in their chemical defences. When feeding on Passiflora species with cyanogenic compounds that they can readily sequester, both species downregulate the biosynthesis of these compounds. By contrast, when fed on Passiflora plants that do not contain cyanogenic glucosides that can be sequestered, both species increase biosynthesis. This biochemical plasticity comes at a fitness cost for the more specialist H. m. rosina, as adult size and weight for this species negatively correlate with biosynthesis levels, but not for the more generalist H. c. chioneus. By contrast, H. m rosina has increased performance when sequestration is possible on its specialized host plant. In summary, phenotypic plasticity in biochemical responses to different host plants offers these butterflies the ability to widen their range of potential hosts within the Passiflora genus, while maintaining their chemical defences.

AB  - In broad-leaved trees, growth and plant defense chemicals have originated from photosynthates. Therefore, defense chemicals should be efficiently distributed in a leaf against herbivory, especially when the leaves are exposed to long-term biotic and abiotic stresses. To reveal this phenomenon, we examined the distribution of phenolic compounds, in particular tannins in the leaves of juvenile and adult Siebold's beech (Fagus crenata Blume) under various light conditions by both chemical and histochemical analyses. The cotyledons and first true leaves of seedlings mainly included tannins in the upper and lower epidermis. By contrast, tannins were distributed in all tissues of the sun leaves of saplings (except in spongy tissue) and adult trees under higher light intensity, whereas phenolic compounds, but not tannins, were mainly present in palisade parenchyma cells and bundle sheath cells of the sun leaves of adult trees under lower light intensity. Furthermore, in adult trees, there were no changes in the distribution of phenolic compounds irrespective of the increase in the concentration of condensed tannins from June to September. These findings showed that the distribution of phenolic compounds in beech leaves changes from juvenile to adult trees and is also strongly affected by light conditions.

AB  - 1. Animal social networks are often constructed from point estimates of edge weights. In many contexts, edge weights are inferred from observational data, and the uncertainty around estimates can be affected by various factors. Though this has been acknowledged in previous work, methods that explicitly quantify uncertainty in edge weights have not yet been widely adopted and remain undeveloped for many common types of data. Furthermore, existing methods are unable to cope with some of the complexities often found in observational data, and do not propagate uncertainty in edge weights to subsequent statistical analyses.2. We introduce a unified Bayesian framework for modelling social networks based on observational data. This framework, which we call BISoN, can accommodate many common types of observational social data, can capture confounds and model effects at the level of observations and is fully compatible with popular methods used in social network analysis.3. We show how the framework can be applied to common types of data and how various types of downstream statistical analyses can be performed, including non-random association tests and regressions on network properties.4. Our framework opens up the opportunity to test new types of hypotheses, make full use of observational datasets, and increase the reliability of scientific inferences. We have made both an R package and example R scripts available to enable adoption of the framework.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of Suidae, i.e., domestic pigs and wild boars, caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The development of cross-protective vaccines against ASF is imperative for effective disease control, particularly in regions where ASF is endemic, potentially featuring multiple circulating ASFV isolates. It was shown that the intranasal administration of a low dose of ASFV-PSA-1NH (immunotype IV, genotype I) to pigs led to minimal manifestation of clinical signs of ASF and the formation of a high level of protection against the heterologous strain ASFV-Stavropol 01/08 (seroimmunotype VIII, genotype II).Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of Suidae, i.e., domestic pigs and wild boars, caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The development of cross-protective vaccines against ASF is imperative for effective disease control, particularly in regions where ASF is endemic, potentially featuring multiple circulating ASFV isolates. The investigation of non-hemadsorbing naturally attenuated isolates and laboratory recombinant strains with a deletion in the EP402R gene has attracted interest. Our study aimed to assess the impacts of various administration routes and doses of the naturally attenuated ASFV-PSA-1NH (immunotype IV, genotype I) isolate on the manifestation of clinical signs of ASF and the level of protection against the heterologous ASFV-Stavropol 01/08 strain (seroimmunotype VIII, genotype II). The results demonstrated that the intranasal administration of a low dose of ASFV-PSA-1NH to pigs minimized the clinical signs of ASF and established a high level of protection against the heterologous strain ASFV-Stavropol 01/08. Despite the challenges in standardizing the dosage for intranasal administration, this approach appears as a viable alternative in ASF vaccination.

AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions from manure management on livestock farms are a key source of greenhouse gas emissions in some regions and for some production systems, and the opportunities for mitigation may be significant if emissions can be adequately documented. We investigated a method for estimating CH4 emissions from liquid manure (slurry) that is based on anaerobic incubation of slurry collected from commercial farms. Methane production rates were used to derive a parameter of the Arrhenius temperature response function, lnA', representing the CH4 production potential of the slurry at the time of sampling. Results were used for parameterization of an empirical model to estimate annual emissions with daily time steps, where CH4 emissions from individual sources (barns, outside storage tanks) can be calculated separately. A monitoring program was conducted in four countries, i.e., Denmark, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, during a 12-month period where slurry was sampled to represent barn and outside storage on finishing pig and dairy farms. Across the four countries, lnA' was higher in pig slurry compared to cattle slurry (p < 0.01), and higher in slurry from barns compared to outside storage (p < 0.01). In a separate evaluation of the incubation method, in-vitro CH4 production rates were comparable with in-situ emissions. The results indicate that lnA' in barns increases with slurry age, probably due to growth or adaptation of the methanogenic microbial community. Using lnA' values determined experimentally, empirical models with daily time steps were constructed for finishing pig and dairy farms and used for scenario analyses. Annual emissions from pig slurry were predicted to be 2.5 times higher than those from cattle slurry. Changing the frequency of slurry export from the barn on the model pig farm from 40 to 7 d intervals reduced total annual CH4 emissions by 46 %; this effect would be much less on cattle farms with natural ventilation. In a scenario with cattle slurry, the empirical model was compared with the current IPCC methodology. The seasonal dynamics were less pronounced, and annual CH4 emissions were lower than with the current methodology, which calls for further investigations. Country-specific models for individual animal categories and point sources could be a tool for assessing CH4 emissions and mitigation potentials at farm level.

AB  - We propose a conceptual model that describes the in situ formation of androstenedione in agricultural soil from a phytosterol, beta-sitosterol, released after crop harvest and soil fertiliser amendment. Based on the recorded agricultural practice at a spring barley field, beta-sitosterol and androstenedione concentrations were modelled over the year. While decomposition of crop residues created low soil levels, the application of pig slurry led to an androstenedione soil concentration of 54 mu g kg(-1). The elevated soil concentration of androstenedione is not due to the introduction of the endocrine disruptor in the fertiliser, but a result of the addition of large concentrations of beta-sitosterol as a natural precursor. The limited available data on beta-sitosterol and androstenedione concentration in soil prohibited their accurate prediction by our model. However, the potential implication of endocrine-disrupting steroid hormones being formed in situ from currently little considered phytosterols justifies a conceptual description and further research.

AB  - Rhinoclemmys punctularia punctularia is the only turtle of the family Geoemydidae with part of its range in Brazil. The species is semi-aquatic and widely distributed across the Amazon basin but is still poorly studied. We evaluated aspects of the population structure, habitat use, seasonal activity, and diet of the species during one year, from the beginning of the rainy season to the end of the dry season, in two headwater localities in the Tocantins and Tapaj??s river basins, in the state of Par??, Brazil. We captured 45 individuals, 14 in the Tocantins basin and 31 in the Tapaj??s basin. The size-class frequency distributions of captured individuals did not differ between the two samples. The turtles were most frequently captured in first-order streams, followed by lentic (third-order dammed streams) and second-order streams. The capture rate did not vary significantly between sampling periods (start and peak of the rainy season; start and end of the dry season). The trapping effort to capture a single individual was much higher in the Tapaj??s basin (1,215 trap-hours) than in the Tocantins basin (136 trap-hours). Overall, the low capture rates confirm the secretive nature of the species in Amazonia and its apparent rarity. The individuals analyzed in this study consumed mainly plants.

AB  - Implementing a ban on fishing specific taxa is difficult enough without the added complexity of the taxa being primarily obtained as incidental catch. Most measures for restricting capture and trade to sustainable levels are directed towards targeted species, while overlooking the needs of incidentally caught species. Our study investigates the exploitation and conservation of seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) in India, which have been primarily obtained in bycatch globally, in the context of a ban on their catch and trade. We found that seahorse extraction continues, with annual catches of around 13 million seahorses, based on estimates from the locations we surveyed along the coast of mainland India. Most of these animals were perceivably obtained by non-selective fishing gear operating along the sea bottom, close to the shore, at lower latitudes and shallower depths, particularly in biogenic habitats. We found that the state with the highest catch and trade of seahorses was also the state where the largest number of fishers provided unprompted comments about the national ban. Our work indicates the serious limitations of extraction and trade bans on species that are taken incidental to other extractive activities, a message that should also apply to terrestrial and freshwater species.

AB  - Composting can convert organic materials into stable humus (HS), resulting in high-fertility organic fertilizers that were widely used in the treatment of agricultural wastes. Therefore, it would be beneficial to strengthen the degree of composting humification by exploring the formation law and the main influencing factors of composting humification for different agricultural wastes. In this study, straw, cabbage, chicken manure, and pig manure were used as research objects, and the industrial mixed-material strip-stack composting and the single-material laboratory reactor composting were carried out, respectively. The results showed that the industrial mixed-material composting mode was beneficial to the continuation of the high-temperature period for composting (the heat lasts for 20 days), and the high lignin treatment T2 (straw + chicken manure composting) helped to promote the degradation of lignin and formation of humic acid (HA). At the end of composting, the absolute degradation of lignin in T2 treatment increased by 13.18% and 120.02% (p < 0.01) compared with T1 (straw + cabbage + chicken manure) and T3 (straw + pig manure) treatments, respectively (p < 0.01), and the humic acid (HA) content increased by 11.78% and 26.59% (p < 0.05). In the single-material laboratory reactor composting system, the continuous high-temperature period (31 days) contributed to the degradation of the composting materials and the formation of HA in the straw (TS) composting treatment; at the end of composting, the absolute degradation amount of TS lignin increased by 137.98%, 170.99%, and 196.82% compared with TV (cabbage), TC (chicken manure), and TP (pig manure) treatments (p < 0.01), and the HA content increased by 281.76%, 377.57%, and 460.71% (p < 0.01), respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that temperature was the main environmental factor affecting the decomposition and humification process of composting organic materials; the increase of lignin absolute degradation was helpful to promote the formation of HA. This study found that temperature was the main environmental factor that drove lignin degradation and promoted the humification process of agricultural waste composting; the lignin content in the composting material was the basis for the formation of HA, and the absolute degradation amount of lignin was the main material factor that promoted the humification process.

AB  - This study examines the effects of two-stage fermented traditional Chinese medicine by-products (TCMP) on Hu sheep's growth, blood traits, and immunity. Aspergillus niger was used for aerobic fermentation (60% moisture, 28 degrees C, 7 days), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum for anaerobic fermentation (room temperature, 4 days). Before fermentation, the product contained 2.79 +/- 0.10 mg/g of reducing sugars, 47.33 +/- 0.13 mg/g of total sugars, 27.21 +/- 0.35 mg/g of amino acids, and 190.31 +/- 4.87 mg/g of crude fiber. After fermentation, the product contained 23.56 +/- 0.59 mg/g of reducing sugars, 63.79 +/- 0.65 mg/g of total sugars, 131.34 +/- 1.78 mg/g of amino acids, and 120.31 +/- 5.94 mg/g of crude fiber. Post-fermentation, reducing sugars, total sugars, and amino acids increased significantly (P < 0.01), while crude fiber decreased (P < 0.01). Sixty Hu sheep rams (24.65 kg +/- 1.55 kg) were divided into 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% TCMP groups. Over 60 days, TCMP groups showed higher weight gain and lower feed-to-weight ratio (P < 0.01). Blood analysis revealed lower Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Globulin (GLB), Indirect Bilirubin (IBIL), and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (P < 0.05) and higher Testosterone (TE), Insulin-like Growth Factor-I(IGF-I), and Immunoglobulin M (IGM) levels (P < 0.05) in TCMP groups. TCMP positively impacts Hu sheep's growth and immunity.

AB  - Intracellular calcium stores (ICS) play a dynamic role in neuronal calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis both by buffering Ca2+ excess in the cytoplasm or providing an additional source of Ca2+ when concentration increase is needed. However, in spite of the large body of evidence showing Ca2+ as an essential second messenger in many signaling cascades underlying synaptic plasticity, the direct involvement of the intracellular Ca2+-release channels (ICRCs) in memory processing has been highly overlooked. Here we investigated the role of the ICRC inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) activity during different memory phases using pharmacological inhibition in the dorsal hippocampus during contextual fear conditioning. We first found that post-training administration of the IP3R antagonist 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) impaired memory consolidation in a dose and time-dependent manner. Inhibiting IP(3)Rs also disrupted memory retrieval. Contextual fear memory reconsolidation or extinction, however, were not sensitive to IP3R blockade. Taken together, our results indicate that hippocampal IP(3)Rs play an important role in contextual fear memory consolidation and retrieval.

AB  - The global livestock system puts increasing pressures on ecosystems. Studies analyzing the ecological impacts of live-stock supply chains often explain this pressure by the increasing demand for animal products. Food regime theory pro-poses a more nuanced perspective: it explains livestock-related pressures on ecosystems by systemic changes along the supply chains of feed and animal products, notably the liberalization of agricultural trade. This study proposes a frame-work supporting empirical analyses of such claims by differentiating several steps of livestock supply chains. We recon-structed "trilateral" livestock supply chains linking feed production, livestock farming, and final consumption, based on the global flows of 161 feed and 13 animal products between 222 countries from 1986 to 2013. We used the em-bodied Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (eHANPP) indicator to quantify pressures on ecosystems linked to these trilateral livestock supply chains. We find that livestock induced 65 % of agriculture's pressure on eco-systems, mostly through cattle grazing. Between 1986 and 2013, the fraction of livestock-related eHANPP that was traded internationally doubled from 7.1 % to 15.6%. eHANPP related to the trade of feed was mostly linked to soybean imported for pig meat production, whereas eHANPP associated to traded animal products was mostly linked to cattle meat. eHANPP of traded animal products was lower but increased faster than eHANPP of feed trade. eHANPP was highest at the feed production level in South and North America, and at the consumption level in Eastern Asia. In Northern Asia and Eastern Europe, eHANPP was lowest at the animal products production level. In Western Europe, the eHANPP was equal at the animal products production and consumption levels. Our findings suggest that options to reduce livestock's pressures on ecosystems exist at all levels of the supply chain, especially by reducing the production and consumption in high-consuming countries and regulating international supply chains.

AB  - The use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) to control weeds has increased exponentially in recent decades, and their residues and degradation products have been found in soils across the globe. GBH residues in soil have been shown to affect plant physiology and specialised metabolite biosynthesis, which, in turn, may impact plant resistance to biotic stressors. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the interactive effects between soil GBH residues and herbivory on the performance, phytohormone concentrations, phenolic compound concentrations and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of two woodland strawberry ( Fragaria vesca ) genotypes, which were classified as herbivore resistant and herbivore susceptible. Plants were subjected to herbivory by strawberry leaf beetle ( Galerucella tenella ) larvae, and to GBH residues by growing in soil collected from a field site with GBH treatments twice a year over the past eight years. Soil GBH residues reduced the belowground biomass of the susceptible genotype and the aboveground biomass of both woodland strawberry genotypes. Herbivory increased the belowground biomass of the resistant genotype and the root -shoot ratio of both genotypes. At the metabolite level, herbivory induced the emission of several VOCs. Jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and auxin concentrations were induced by herbivory, in contrast to salicylic acid, which was only induced by herbivory in combination with soil GBH residues in the resistant genotype. The concentrations of phenolic compounds were higher in the resistant genotype compared to the susceptible genotype and were induced by soil GBH residues in the resistant genotype. Our results indicate that soil GBH residues can differentially affect plant performance, phytohormone concentrations and phenolic compound concentrations under herbivore attack, in a genotype -dependent manner. Soil GBH altered plant responses to herbivory, which may impact plant resistance traits and species interactions. With ongoing agrochemical pollution, we need to consider plant cultivars with better resistance to polluted soils while maintaining plant resilience under challenging environmental conditions.

AB  - Invasive species are a leading cause of global biodiversity decline. Larvae of the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae: Phycitinae) consume prickly pear cactus species (Opuntia; Cactaceae) in its native South American range. High host specificity made C. cactorum an appropriate biological control agent of Opuntia species, which have become invasive weeds around the world. This biological control program was successful. Ironically, the success of cactus weed biological control facilitated a series of events which led to C. cactorum invasion of North America where Opuntia diversity is tremendous. In 2017, C. cactorum established along the southeast Texas coast. In 2020, we began monitoring C. cactorum dispersal towards south and south-west Texas with cactus moth pheromone traps. Our objectives were to document the extent of the invasion and calculate dispersal rates towards commercial Opuntia-growing regions in Mexico. There are four overlapping moth flight peaks in Texas. Between 2017 and 2022, the C. cactorum populations invaded over 27,000 km2 in south-east and south-central Texas at a dispersal rate up to 47 km year. Since 2022, this dispersal rate slowed as the moth invasion front came into contact with the Tamaulipan thornscrub region of south Texas where Opuntia density is high and native cactus moth species are attacked by a diverse assemblage of parasitoids. We present data on the density of native cactus moth species in Texas which shows that their density increases west and south-west of the area currently occupied by C. cactorum. These data suggest that apparent competition may be occuring between C. cactorum and native cactus moth species via shared parasitoids. This hypothesis is not mutually exclusive of other biological barriers that may contribute to explaining why the Texas C. cactorum dispersal rate has slowed significantly. We conclude with a discussion about how to leverage these data to support future deployment of C. cactorum biological control agents in Texas.
   Las especies invasoras son una de las principales causas del disminuci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad global. Las larvas de la polilla del cactus, Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae: Phycitinae) consumen especies de cactus nopal (Opuntia; Cactaceae) en su rango nativo de Sudam & eacute;rica. Alta especificidad de hu & eacute;sped hizo que C. cactorum fuera un agente de control biol & oacute;gico usado para las especies de Opuntia que fueron invasoras en todo el mundo. Este programa de control biol & oacute;gico fue exitoso. El & eacute;xito del control biol & oacute;gico de de cactus facilit & oacute; una serie de eventos que llevaron a la invasi & oacute;n de C. cactorum en Am & eacute;rica del Norte donde la diversidad de Opuntia en Am & eacute;rica del Norte es tremenda. En 2017, C. cactorum se estableci & oacute; a lado de la costa sureste de Texas. En 2020, comenzamos a monitorear la dispersi & oacute;n de C. cactorum hacia el sur y suroeste de Texas con trampas de feromonas. Nuestros objetivos eran documentar la extensi & oacute;n de la invasi & oacute;n y calcular las tasas de dispersi & oacute;n hacia las regiones comerciales de cultivo de Opuntia en M & eacute;xico. Entre 2017 y 2022, las poblaciones de C. cactorum invadieron m & aacute;s de 27,000 km2 en el sureste y centro-sur de Texas a una tasa de dispersi & oacute;n de hasta 47 km por a & ntilde;o. Desde 2022, esta tasa de dispersi & oacute;n se ha desacelerado a medida que el frente de invasi & oacute;n de la polilla entr & oacute; en contacto con la regi & oacute;n de matorral espinoso tamaulipeco del sur de Texas, donde la densidad de Opuntia es alta. Presentamos datos sobre la densidad de especies nativas de polillas del cactus en Texas que muestran que su densidad aumenta hacia el oeste y suroeste del & aacute;rea actualmente ocupada por C. cactorum. Estos datos sugieren que est & aacute; ocurriendo una competencia aparente con las especies nativas de polillas del cactus a trav & eacute;s de parasitoides compartidos. Esta hip & oacute;tesis no es excluyente de otras barreras biol & oacute;gicas que pueden a explicar por qu & eacute; la tasa de dispersi & oacute;n de C. cactorum en Texas ha disminuido. Concluimos con una discusi & oacute;n sobre c & oacute;mo aprovechar estos datos para apoyar el futuro liberaci & oacute;n de agentes de control biol & oacute;gico de C. cactorum en Texas.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the metabolism of multiparous female yaks during the late perinatal period and identify its effects on reproductive recovery in order to explain the low reproduction rate of yaks. Eight multiparous female yaks were randomly selected as the sample, and serum was collected from the yaks every 7 days from the day of delivery until 28 days after the delivery (five time points). The presence of serum metabolic profiles and reproductive hormones was identified using ELISA. The key metabolites were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and a dynamic metabolic network representation was created using bioinformatics analysis. A total of 117 different metabolites were identified by calculating the fold change of the metabolite expression at each time point. The dynamic metabolic network was created to represent the activities of the key metabolites, metabolic indexes and reproductive hormones. The initial efficiency of the glucose metabolism in the late perinatal period was found to be low, but it increased during the final period. The initial efficiencies of the lipid and amino acid metabolisms were high but decreased during the final period. We inferred that there was a postpartum negative energy balance in female yaks and that the synthesis and secretion of estrogen were blocked due to an excessive fatty acid mobilization. As a result, the reproductive hormone synthesis and secretion were maintained at a low level in the late perinatal period, and this was the main reason for the delayed recovery of the reproductive function postpartum. However, the specific mechanism needs to be further verified.

AB  - Exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) can trigger the induced resistance of plants to herbivores. This study aimed to investigate the genetic variation of 13 cucumber cultivars in response to the exogenous application of JA for inducing resistance to the vegetable leafminer, Liriomyza sativae, in the field. The plants were treated with 0 (control), 10, or 50 mu M of JA and exposed to natural infestation by L. sativae. Exogenous application of JA-induced resistance to L. sativae, but its effects varied across the cultivars. The most prominent decrease in plant damage (34.7%), leaf damage (78.2%), and the number of larval mines (58%) were observed in Argeto, 14cu4141, and Aroma with 50 mu M JA, respectively. The plants sprayed with JA had more leaf thickness, trichome density, and phenol content compared to control plants. Soheil and Beit Alpha2 had the greatest increase in leaf thickness (89.50%) and trichome density (74.42%) at 10 mu M JA, respectively. The highest increase of phenol content (14.70%) was seen in Emparator upon treatment with 50 mu M JA. Insect damage showed significant negative correlations with leaf thickness and phenol content. Our results indicate that crop cultivars that respond better to treatment should be determined to use JA in pest management programs.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Skeletal muscle development and meat quality are key traits of considerable importance to consumers and farmers. In the past, second-generation sequencing technology has been used to study genes regulating muscle development and meat quality. However, with the limitation of read length, goat transcriptome was constructed mainly on the basis of the merging of short reads, resulting in an insufficient understanding of goat transcriptome structures. Identification of full-length transcript structure was still a challenge. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid sequencing was conducted that combined the long-reading character of third-generation sequencing with the quantification ability of second-generation sequencing. By comparing the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles, genes and transcript isoforms regulating meat quality and muscle development of goat were identified. A large number of novel loci and isoforms were identified in the goats. Functional annotation of these genes showed that they were associated with skeletal muscle development and lipid metabolism.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Domestic goats are commonly reared for meat and milk production in several regions of the world. However, the genetic mechanism underlying muscle development and meat quality of goats is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify known and novel genes regulating muscle development and meat quality of goats using second- and third-generation sequencing technologies. To achieve this, the meat quality and transcriptomes of longissimus dorsi (LD) and biceps femoris (BF) muscle tissues of Lingqiu Greyback goats were examined and compared. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and isoforms (DEIs) were functionally annotated. Results showed that 45,574 full-length transcripts covering 18,491 loci were characterized, and 12,566 genes were co-expressed in all samples. Differential expression analysis identified 231 DEGs, including 45 novel genes in the LD and BF muscles of the goats. Additionally, 1173 DEIs were found, in which 642 novel isoforms were identified in this study. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of the DEGs and DEIs revealed that some of them were associated with muscle growth and lipid metabolism. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the transcriptomic diversity underlying meat quality and muscle development of goat.</p>

AB  - Movement behavior is an important contributor to habitat selection and its incorporation in disease risk models has been somewhat neglected. The habitat preferences of host individuals affect their probability of exposure to pathogens. If preference behavior can be incorporated in ecological niche models (ENMs) when data on pathogen distributions are available, then variation in such behavior may dramatically impact exposure risk. Here we use data from the anthrax endemic system of Etosha National Park, Namibia, to demonstrate how integrating inferred movement behavior alters the construction of disease risk maps. We used a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model that associated soil, bioclimatic, and vegetation variables with the best available pathogen presence data collected at anthrax carcass sites to map areas of most likely Bacillus anthracis (the causative bacterium of anthrax) persistence. We then used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to distinguish foraging and non-foraging behavioral states along the movement tracks of nine zebra (Equus quagga) during the 2009 and 2010 anthrax seasons. The resulting tracks, decomposed on the basis of the inferred behavioral state, formed the basis of step-selection functions (SSFs) that used the MaxEnt output as a potential predictor variable. Our analyses revealed different risks of exposure during different zebra behavioral states, which were obscured when the full movement tracks were analyzed without consideration of the underlying behavioral states of individuals. Pathogen (or vector) distribution models may be misleading with regard to the actual risk faced by host animal populations when specific behavioral states are not explicitly accounted for in selection analyses. To more accurately evaluate exposure risk, especially in the case of environmentally transmitted pathogens, selection functions could be built for each identified behavioral state and then used to assess the comparative exposure risk across relevant states. The scale of data collection and analysis, however, introduces complexities and limitations for consideration when interpreting results.

AB  - BackgroundThermogenic beige adipocyte displays a remarkable ability in mammals to adapt to cold environments, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear, especially in pigs that lack functional UCP1.ResultsMultilocular beige adipocytes were observed in both Tibetan pigs (cold-tolerant) and Bama pigs (cold-sensitive) after short-term cold exposure (4 degrees C for 3 days). Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of adipose tissues, including subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissues (IAT) and perirenal adipose tissues (PAT), from both pig breeds at room temperature and cold treatment conditions, we discovered two cell subpopulations specific to Tibetan pigs, PDGFR alpha+EBF2High in IAT and ADIPOQ+HIF1AHigh in both depots. PDGFR alpha+EBF2High cells were characterized as potential beige precursors, while ADIPOQ+HIF1AHigh cells were found to express highly thermogenic-related genes. Despite the decrease of the lipogenic subpopulation and the increase of the lipolytic and the thermogenic subpopulations observed in both pig breeds upon cold treatment, Tibetan pigs exhibited stronger cellular and molecular responses compared to Bama pigs. Remarkably, cold-induced de novo beige adipogenesis and white adipocyte browning, likely occurred in Tibetan pigs, while Bama pigs relied more heavily on white browning. Moreover, BMP7, which was highly expressed in the PDGFR alpha+EBF2High subpopulation, positively regulates porcine beige thermogenic capacity.ConclusionsOur data offers a comprehensive and unprecedented perspective on the heterogeneity and plasticity of adipose tissues of pigs and broadens the understanding of beige fat biology in mammals.

AB  - As the global population rises, agriculture and industry are under increasing pressure to become more sustainable in meeting this growing demand, while minimizing impacts on global emissions, land use change, and biodiversity. The development of efficient and symbiotic local bioeconomies can help to respond to this challenge by using land, resources, and side streams in efficient ways tailored to the needs of different regions. Green biorefineries offer a unique opportunity for regions with abundant grasslands to use this primary resource more sustainably, providing feed for cows, while also generating feed for monogastric animals, along with the co-production of biomaterials and energy. The current study investigates the impact of a green biorefinery co-product, leaf protein concentrate (LPC), for input to a pig farm, assessing its impact on pig diets, and the extended impact on the bioenergy performance of the pig farm. The study found that LPC replaced soya bean meal at a 50% displacement rate, with pigs showing positive performance in intake and weight gain. Based on laboratory analysis, the resulting pig slurry demonstrated a higher biogas content and 26% higher biomethane potential compared with the control slurry. The findings demonstrate some of the local synergies between agricultural sectors that can be achieved through extended green biorefinery development, and the benefits for local bioeconomy actors.

AB  - The goat breeding industry on the Tibetan Plateau faces strong selection pressure to enhance fertility. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop goat lines with higher fertility and adaptability. The ovary, as a key organ determining reproductive performance, is regulated by a complex transcriptional network involving numerous protein-coding and non-coding genes. However, the molecular mechanisms of the key mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network in goat ovaries remain largely unknown. This study focused on the histology and differential mRNA/miRNA/lncRNA between Chuanzhong black goat (CBG, high productivity, multiple births) and Tibetan goat (TG, strong adaptability, single birth) ovaries. Histomorphological analysis showed that the medulla proportion in CBG ovaries was significantly reduced compared to TG. RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq analysis identified 1218 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 100 DE miRNAs, and 326 DE lncRNAs, which were mainly enriched in ovarian steroidogenesis, oocyte meiosis, biosynthesis of amino acids and protein digestion, and absorption signaling pathways. Additionally, five key mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks regulating goat reproductive performance were identified, including TCL1B-novel68_mature-ENSCHIT00000010023, AKAP6-novel475_mature-ENSCHIT00000003176, GLI2-novel68_mature-XR_001919123.1, ITGB5-novel65_star-TCONS_00013850, and VWA2-novel71_mature-XR_001919911.1. Further analyses showed that these networks mainly affected ovarian function and reproductive performance by regulating biological processes such as germ cell development and oocyte development, which also affected the plateau adaptive capacity of the ovary by participating in the individual immune and metabolic capacities. In conclusion, we identified numerous mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks involved in regulating ovarian function and reproductive performance in goats. This discovery offers new insights into the molecular breeding of Tibetan Plateau goats and provides a theoretical foundation for developing new goat lines with high reproductive capacity and strong adaptability to the plateau environment.

AB  - Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous homozygous genomic segments that provide valuable insights into population history, selection pressures, and inbreeding levels. However, the global distribution of ROH and their implications for pig domestication and breeding are not yet fully understood. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from 1203 pigs across 49 breeds to characterize ROH patterns worldwide. European commercial pigs exhibited longer and more numerous ROH segments than Asian indigenous breeds, indicative of stronger artificial selection and higher inbreeding. Crossbreeding led to a reduction in ROH burden, with greater reductions observed when parental genetic divergence was larger. Notably, Asian and European pigs displayed distinct ROH islands, reflecting divergent selection pressures. Functional analysis revealed that these ROH islands were associated with growth, immunity, and reproduction. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic diversity and selection history of global pig populations, providing valuable insights for future breeding strategies.

AB  - Anaerobic gut fungi (AGF; Neocallimastigomycota) are crucial for the degradation of plant biomass in herbivores. While extensively studied in mammals, information regarding their occurrence, diversity, and community structure in nonmammalian hosts remains sparse. Here, we report on the AGF community in fecal samples of 13 domesticated ostriches. The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is an herbivorous, flightless, hindgut-fermenting member of the class Aves (birds). Illumina-based metabarcoding targeting the D2 region of the large ribosomal subunit (28S rRNA) revealed a uniform AGF community with low alpha diversity in the fecal samples. The community was mostly comprised of sequences potentially representing two novel species in the genus Piromyces, and a novel genus in the Neocallimastigomycota. Sequences affiliated with these novel taxa were absent or extremely rare in datasets derived from mammalian and tortoise samples, indicating a strong pattern of AGF-host association. One Piromyces strain (strain Ost1) was successfully isolated. Transcriptomics-enabled molecular dating analysis suggested a divergence time of approximate to 30Mya, a time frame in line with current estimates for ostrich evolution. Comparative gene content analysis between strain Ost1 and other Piromyces species from mammalian sources revealed a high degree of similarity. Our findings expand the range of AGF animal hosts to include members of the birds (class Aves), highlight a unique AGF community in the ostrich alimentary tract, and document the occurrence of a strong pattern of fungal-host association in ostriches, similar to previously observed patterns in AGF canonical mammalian hosts.

AB  - Dental pathologies are described for four extinct rhinoceroses Coelodonta antiquitatis (Blumenbach, 1799) and Stephanorhinus hemitoechus (Falconer, 1868) of the Late Pleistocene Weichselian Glacial (MIS 3-5 d), Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis Ja euro ger, 1839 of the Late Pleistocene Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e), and Ste-phanorhinus hundsheimensis (Toula, 1902) from the Middle Pleistocene Cromerian Mosbach Interglacial (MIS 11) which material is mainly from the Rhine Valley megafauna migratory channel of Central Europe. All three extinct and even extant rhinoceros share similar ontogenetic P4 pathologic misplacement pa-thologies. Those caused in some cases further dental abnormalities impacting the lower jaw dentition, even in rare cases including complete deformation of the lower jaw. In the browsing Stephanorhinus (S. kirchbergensis, S. hundsheimensis) the P4 is more commonly misplaced; in the Mid-Pleistocene Mos-bach S. hundsheimensis are three examples with similar misplacements on the right and left maxillaries, which have a similar genetic pool background of a local palaeopopulation. The grazer rhinoceros C. antiquitatis has a further pathology type with loss or even genetically pre-assessed non-development of the first upper or lower PM premolars or last M molars. The strong wear, damage, and loss of the anterior premolars in elderly individuals as ontogenetically based pathology, seem to result from intensive grazer and opal phytoliths abrasion. This loss finally resulted in irregularities of the permanent dentition and influenced wear stages and irregular abrasion angles of the tooth rows, affecting the upper and lower rows each others.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AimWe present the first global database of movement patterns of terrestrial invertebrates, focusing on active dispersal and foraging movements. We depict interspecific variations in movement distances among invertebrates and assess potential drivers of these variations. We finally contrast our results with those of previous vertebrate studies.LocationWorldwide.MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis using 176 studies. They provided 411 movement estimates: 175 foraging movement estimates for 101 species, 51 families and 19 orders, and 236 dispersal estimates for 131 species, 53 families and 16 orders. These estimates were complemented by several organism functional traits: body mass, diet, locomotion mode and by environmental variables of the study sites: temperature and NDVI. We computed allometric relationships between movement distances and body mass both globally and separately for each taxonomic order with sufficient data. We tested the relative influence of the co-variables on movement distances through model selection.ResultsWe reveal a general positive allometric relationship between movement distance and body mass that holds across most taxonomic orders. We evidence a strong phylogenetic signal in movement distances that translates in variable allometries of movement distances with body mass across taxonomic orders. We further find that interspecific variations of movement distances are primarily correlated with functional differences rather than environmental conditions. Locomotion mode is the most important explanatory variable of both dispersal and foraging distances, with larger distances among flying individuals followed by walking and crawling ones for a given body mass. Surprisingly, trophic guild has a low predictive power of invertebrate movement distances as opposed to vertebrates, with unclear differences between invertebrate carnivores, herbivores and decomposers.Main ConclusionsOur study provides general allometric equations for terrestrial movement distances of invertebrates. It further reveals important functional drivers of their interspecific variation in space use with a dominant role of their evolutionary history.

AB  - Soil forms the foundation for biotic and abiotic activities that shape landscapes over time. Effective communication and understanding of soil profiles, contents, and interactions with other systems such as vegetation and climate are crucial for multidisciplinary research and projects involving soil. A robust, comprehensible, and extendable visualization system is required to enhance communication across diverse disciplines, including landscape architecture, agronomy, and ecology.This paper introduces the BeingAliveLanguage, an innovative, extensible visualization system for soil-centric information within a multidisciplinary communication framework. The system employs a fractal-based visual language to effectively convey vital soil information to professionals in various fields engaged in architecture, landscape design, and urban planning projects. The corresponding software, developed as a plugin for the RhinoGrasshopper CAD environment, allows users to automatically generate easily understandable soil-centered diagrams using a node-based programming language. Designed to enhance communication in landscape, geoscience, and agriculture-related fields, the system provides critical information to support the design and decision-making process. We showcase the system's efficacy through two extensions and by utilizing the tool in multiple real-world projects.

AB  - Acrostichum danaeifolium, a Neotropical fern, occurs preferentially in marshy areas or at the margins of lakes and mangroves. Microlepidoptera larvae burrow through the petioles of the fern, preferentially on the non-expanded leaves. The galleries in the petiole create a new microhabitat, harboring a rich fauna of arthropods. The aim of the present study was to assess the richness of ants associated with its petiole. The study was conducted in a population of A. danaefolium from the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Southeastern Brazil. Six collections were carried out every two months (2009-2010), three in the dry and three in the rainy season. The leaves were divided into three development stages: non-expanded leaves (NEL), expanded leaves (EL) and senescent leaves (SL). Seven leaves from each phase were randomly collected from seven individuals. A total of fifteen ant species were recorded. The species with the highest frequency and density in fern petioles were Camponotus crassus and Crematogaster curvispinosa. The highest ant richness and abundance was found in senescent leaves. The high number of ants found in the petioles of Acrostichum danaefolium qualifies it as a potential key species in the marshes and flooded areas where it occurs.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep production is a very important sector in the rural economy and food security of people in the mountains area of Montenegro. The local and autochthonous sheep breeds are very specific and represent a very valuable genetic resource. Many of these sheep breeds are characterized by a permanent decreasing trend of the population size, as well as uncontrolled crossing with other breeds. Consequently, some of them are at risk of extinction and need to be included in the program of ''in situ'' conservation. The characterization of these breeds is mostly based on the investigation of the morphometric and production traits. This study focused on the genetic characterization of all known Montenegrin breeds and populations by using microsatellite markers. The obtained results should provide an important step for the establishment of an adequate strategy for the conservation and sustainable use of the sheep population. The preservation of breeds makes an important contribution to the preservation of Montenegrin traditional products and contributes to the sustainable development of overall sheep production. The Montenegrin sheep population mostly consists of local breeds and their crossbreeds that are very valuable from their genome preservation point of view. The aim of this study was the investigation of the genetic diversity of seven Montenegrin sheep breeds (Jezeropivska-JP, Sora-SOR, Zetska zuja-ZZ, Bardoka-BAR, Sjenicka-SJ, Ljaba-Lj, and Piperska zuja-PIP) using 18 microsatellite sets of markers. The genotyping was done for 291 samples from seven populations using the multiplex amplification of sequences with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The parameters of genetic diversity were estimated using several software tools. In total, 243 alleles were found, with a range of 6 to 25 by locus. The mean observed heterozygosity (Ho), polymorphism information content (PIC), and Fis values (fixation index) per marker were 0.728, 0.781, and -0.007, respectively. The mean number of alleles per breed varied from 4.889 in ZZ to 10.056 in JP. The highest Ho was estimated for JP (0.763) and the lowest for ZZ (0.640). The genetic structure showed close relations between SOR and JP, and both of them with SJ, while ZZ, LJ, and PIP were more distanced. This study provides useful indicators for the development of further in-depth studies and the creation of appropriate conservation programs.

AB  - Chinese Assam tea ( Camellia sinensis var. assamica ) is an important tea crop with a long history of cultivation in Yunnan, China. Despite its potential value as a genetic resource, its genetic diversity and domestication/breeding history remain unclear. To address this issue, we genotyped 469 ancient tea plant trees representing 26 C. sinensis var. assamica populations, plus two of its wild relatives (six and three populations of C. taliensis and C. crassicolumna , respectively) using 16 nuclear microsatellite loci. Results showed that Chinese Assam tea has a relatively high, but comparatively lower gene diversity ( H S = 0.638) than the wild relative C . crassicolumna ( H S = 0.658). Clustering in STRUCTURE indicated that Chinese Assam tea and its two wild relatives formed distinct genetic groups, with considerable interspeci fic introgression. The Chinese Assam tea accessions clustered into three gene pools, corresponding well with their geographic distribution. However, NewHybrids analysis indicated that 68.48% of ancient Chinese Assam tea plants from Xishuangbanna were genetic intermediates between the Puer and Lincang gene pools. In addition, 10% of the ancient Chinese Assam tea individuals were found to be hybrids between Chinese Assam tea and C. taliensis . Our results suggest that Chinese Assam tea was domesticated separately in three gene pools (Puer, Lincang and Xishuangbanna) in the Mekong River valley and that the hybrids were subsequently selected during the domestication process. Although the domestication history of Chinese Assam tea in southwestern Yunnan remains complex, our results will help to identify valuable genetic resources that may be useful in future tea breeding programs.

AB  - In early 2019, Cote d'Ivoire launched a national inventory of its forests and wildlife, accompanied by socio-economic surveys among farmers. The inventory was deployed throughout the country and provides a large amount of information. It shows that the state of the country's forests and fauna is severely degraded and that industrial crops (cocoa, rubber and oil palm in the south, cashew and cotton in the centre and north) have become dominant. The total forest area in Cote d'Ivoire is estimated at 2.97 million hectares in 2020 (7.85 million ha in 1986) i.e. 9.2% of the total area of the country, includ-ing 2.88 million hectares of natural forest and just over 92,000 hectares of reforesta-tion. The average annual deforestation rate since 1986 is 2.8%. The forest area in state forests, known as classified forests, is now only 13.3%, whereas the creation of classified forests in the 1970s was intended to preserve and manage forests sustainably. The scar-city, and even disappearance, of commercial species means that it is no longer possible for timber extraction operations to comply with sustainable management criteria. Pro-tected areas (national parks and reserves) now contain only 32.2% of forest. The wildlife observation transects deployed throughout the country have shown that common spe-cies (such as the greater cane rat, bushbuck and hare) are still present, but that large mammals (antelopes, elephants, monkeys) only survive in a few protected areas and classified forests, with population sizes that are often critical. Finally, the socio-eco-nomic analysis shows that human popula-tion in Cote d'Ivoire's classified forests are 50% allogenic, 28% indigenous and 22% for-eigners: cocoa accounts for the largest share of crop trees, which are mainly introduced species. In rural areas, most crop trees (76%) are native species (mainly cashews), 13% are introduced species and 11% non-native. The state of forest ecosystems and their wild-life is alarming, but taking strong measures quickly could improve the situation, at least in the best-preserved sectors. The contin-uation of regular inventory campaigns will be essential to assess the impacts of these measures.

AB  - Background and aimsApplying organic amendments is an efficient agronomic practice for increasing crop productivity in saline-alkali farmlands. However, it remains unclear whether and how microbiota assist crops in nutrient uptake under the application of organic amendments.MethodsA field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of organic amendments on sunflower nutrient uptake and the underlying microbial mechanisms in a saline-alkali farmland. We considered three fertilization treatments, without organic amendment (CK), lignite-based organic amendment of 4.5 t ha-1 (LBF), and sheep manure fertilizer of 5 t ha-1 (SMF).ResultsIn relation to the CK, the LBF and SMF increased sunflower nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, as well as yield, with the LBF performing better than the SMF. After applying the LBF and SMF, the sunflower rhizosphere enriched nine and six stable beneficial microbes, respectively, such as, Pseudomonas, MND1, Penicillium, and Mortierella, over more than two years. The LBF and SMF improved rhizosphere growth-promoting functions, including nitrogen fixation, organic phosphorus mineralization, and inorganic phosphorus solubilization, in relation to the CK. The stable beneficial microbes were positively associated with multiple nitrogen and phosphorus metabolic processes, indicating their potential role in facilitating sunflower nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. Moreover, these microbes may play a pivotal role in enhancing the stability of the microbial co-occurrence network, which could be positively related to sunflower nitrogen and phosphorus uptake.ConclusionThe application of organic amendments could promote crop nutrient uptake by assisting crops in recruiting stable beneficial soil microbes, which may facilitate nitrogen and phosphorus transformations and enhance microbial community stability in a saline-alkali farmland.

AB  - Soil stability is a characteristic property and is frequently used as an indicator of soil quality. Considering the large variation among stability tests, existing studies usually employ more than one stability test in order to better understand soil behavior against various disruptive forces. The main purposes of this study were to evaluate the impact of aggregate disruptive mechanisms (slaking, clay swelling, mechanical breakdown, and cavitation) on soils developed under different plant species. We aimed as well to compare the results of three renowned soil stability methods: modified Yoder (Yod), Le Bissonnais (LB) and Ultrasonic agitation (UA) on surface (0-20 cm) and subsurface (20-40 cm) soils. Overall, soils of three plant communities developed under eight plant species were investigated. These include forestland (Quercus wutaishansea, Pinus tubulaeformis, Platycladus orientalis, and Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubland (Sophora viccifolia, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Rosa xanthina) and grassland (Stipa bungeana). The mean weight diameter (MWD) was used as a stability parameter for modified Yoder's and Le Bissonnais' methods. In contrast, specific dispersion energies (SE) at the initial (10%, w/w), middle (50%, w/w) and final (90%, w/w) stages of aggregate disruption were used as stability parameters by the UA method. The results of MWD (Yod) indicated that surface and subsurface soils were in the range of 1.23-2.86 mm, which accounted for medium (0.8-1.3 mm) to very stable (>2 mm) soils. Among the three LB tests (fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and wet stirring (WS)), the order of aggregate disruption was FW > WS > SW, suggesting that FW was the most destructive among the three tests with the lowest MWD value (0.45 mm, unstable soil). SW showed the highest MWD values (0.82-2.82 mm), and most of the soils were ranked in the stable (1.3-2 mm) to very stable (>2 mm) range. The MWD trend of WS was similar to FW test. Although the range of SE at three levels was different: SE10 (8.1-29.4 J g(-1)), SE50 (53.0-193.4 J g(-1)), and SE90 (176-642 J g(-1)), they all showed a similar association with soil characteristics and stability parameters of other tests. The strong positive correlation of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), fine root biomass (FRB), and clay contents, and the negative correlation of soil water content (SWC) with the five tests, indicated that these five factors were the major characteristics responsible for the resistance of the studied soils against different destructive mechanisms (p < 0.05-0.01). Overall, the results of all five tests indicated that soil under Quercus wutaishansea (QW) was the most stable, while that under Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) was the most unstable. Although all methods were based on different breakdown mechanisms, initial and final soil fractions and parameters, they were strongly positively correlated with each other. This indicated that all these tests were equally good at stability assessment, with some distinctions and limitations.

AB  - Simple Summary Alternative feed additives could offer nutritional strategies that help to prevent metabolic disorders in ruminants by exerting beneficial effects on the animals' metabolic and immune statuses. In particular, organic acids (OA), such as citric acid and sorbic acid, and pure botanicals (PB), such as thymol and vanillin, have been widely used in the field of animal nutrition for their positive effects on production performances and known effects on metabolic and immune statuses. Since no information is available on goats, the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of OA/PB supplementation on the metabolic status and milk parameters of dairy goats. The results showed that the metabolic status of the treated goats was not negatively affected by the OA/PB supplementation. Moreover, OA/PB increased the milk fat content and the milk coagulation index, which are favorable effects in relation to the technological properties of milk. These findings encourage further studies on OA/PB supplementation in the dairy goat diet. The microencapsulated mixture of organic acids and pure botanicals (OA/PB) has never been evaluated in goats. The aim of this study was to extend the analysis to mid-late lactating dairy goats, evaluating the effects of OA/PB supplementation on the metabolic status, milk bacteriological and composition characteristics, and milk yield. Eighty mid-late lactating Saanen goats were randomly assigned to two groups: one group was fed the basal total balanced ration (TMR) (CRT; n = 40) and the other was fed a diet that was TMR supplemented with 10 g/head of OA/PB (TRT; n = 40) for 54 days during the summer period. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was recorded hourly. On days T0, T27, and T54, the milk yield was recorded, and blood and milk samples were collected during the morning milking. A linear mixed model was used, considering the fixed effects: diet, time, and their interaction. The THI data (mean +/- SD: 73.5 +/- 3.83) show that the goats did not endure heat stress. The blood parameters fell within the normal range, confirming that their metabolic status was not negatively influenced by OA/PB supplementation. OA/PB increased the milk fat content (p = 0.04) and milk coagulation index (p = 0.03), which are effects that are looked on as favorable by the dairy industry in relation to cheese production.

AB  - A series of greenhouse experiments was conducted to evaluate the effect of Plasmodiophora brassicae virulence on clubroot development and propagation of resting spores in 86 plant species from 19 botanical families. Plants were artificially inoculated with two isolates of P. brassicae, which were virulent on clubroot-resistant oilseed rape cultivar Mendel [pathotype 1; P1 (+)] or avirulent on this cultivar (P1). Clubroot severity and the number of resting spores inside the roots were assessed 35 days post inoculation. Typical clubroot symptoms were observed only in the Brassicaceae family. P1 (+)-inoculated species exhibited more severe symptoms (two- to 10-fold more severe), bigger galls (1.1- to 5.8-fold heavier), and greater numbers of resting spores than the Pl-inoculated plants. Among all Brassica species, Bunias orientalis, Coronopus squamatus, and Raphanus sativus were fully resistant against both isolates, whereas Camelina sativa, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Coincya monensis, Descurainia sophia, Diplotaxis muralis, Erucastrum gallicum, Neslia paniculata, Sinapis alba, Sinapis arvensis, Sisymbrium altissimum, Sisymbrium loeselii, and Thlaspi arvense were highly susceptible. Colvingia orientalis, Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Hirschfeldia incana, Iberis amara, Lepidium campestre, and N. paniculata were completely or partially resistant to P1 isolate but highly susceptible to P1 (+). These results suggest that the basis for resistance in these species may be similar to that found in some commercial cultivars, and that these species could contribute to the buildup of inoculum of virulent pathotypes. Furthermore, the pathogen DNA was detected in Alopecurus myosuroides, Phacelio ionoccafolia, Papaver rhoeas, and Pisum sativum. It can be concluded that the number and diversity of hosts for P. brassicae are greater than previously reported.

AB  - Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotioycetes are three classes of endophytes that colocalize with tea (Camellia sinensis). Overall, the diversity indexes in this study indicated a greater abundance of fungal endophytes in roots and stems. Taking the production system into account, conventional tea plantations exhibit lower diversity compared to organic tea plantations. Notably, the influence of agrochemicals had the largest impact on the fungal endophyte communities within roots and young leaves. Despite the limited fungal diversity in conventional plantations, three fungal endophytes were isolated from tea in this culture system: Diaporthe sp., YI-005; Diaporthe sp., SI-007; and Eurotium sp., RI-008. These isolated endophytes exhibited high antagonistic activity (93.00-97.00% inhibition of hypha growth) against Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum, the causal agent of gummy stem blight disease. On the other hand, endophytic fungi isolated from tea in an organic system-Pleosporales sp., SO-006 and Pleosporales sp., RO-013-established the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; 0.65 +/- 0.06 mu g/mL) and assist the solubilizing phosphorus (5.17 +/- 1.03 mu g/mL) from the soil, respectively. This suggested that the level of diversity, whether at the tissue level or within the farming system, did not directly correlate with the discovery of beneficial fungi. More importantly, these beneficial fungi showed the potential to develop into biological agents to control the devastating diseases in the cucurbit family and the potential for use as biofertilizers with a wide range of applications in plants. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are no restrictions limiting the use of fungal endophytes solely to the plant host from which they were originally isolated.

AB  - In this paper a simple age-structured model is constructed to analyze how a wildlife population creating hunting value, but also damage costs, is influenced by predation. The model may exemplify a moose population causing forest browsing damage and exposed for predation by wolf or other big carnivores within a Scandinavian institutional setting. However, it can also fit to other ecological and institutional settings as in North America and other parts of Europe. Two age classes of the prey population, immature and mature animals, are included. The paper provides several results, including a characterizing of the optimal harvesting scheme, and how the harvest and stock composition are influenced by damage costs. It is also shown how the damage costs influence the economic loss of predation. The paper also demonstrates that these results may be rather sensitive to certain conditions, including the timing of the events (e.g., damage costs and predation) over the year cycle.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the cladistics and population structure analysis of Rhipicephalus microplus ticks infesting buffaloes in Haryana, India, as well as the assessment of the anti-tick efficacy of the ethanolic extracts of Cassia fistula (bark, pod pulp, and flowers) against R. microplus larvae. The molecular characterization and population structure analysis were performed by targeting the amplification of the partial mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene, whereas anti-tick efficacy was evaluated using a larval packet test. The sequences generated herein revealed a homology of 98.26-100% to the GenBank-archived R. microplus sequences. In population structure analysis, high haplotype (0.500 +/- 0.265) and low nucleotide (0.002 +/- 0.001) diversities were recorded for the sequences generated in this study. Significantly negative neutrality indices were recorded for the overall dataset. The extracts were found to significantly affect mortality rates in a dose-dependent manner, and the ethanolic extracts of the bark, pod pulp, and flowers of C. fistula exhibited median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 27.989, 40.457, and 49.43 mg/mL, respectively. The LC50 value recorded for the combination of the ethanolic extracts of the bark, flower, and pod pulp of C. fistula was 19.724 mg/mL, whereas the synthetic acaricide ivermectin had an LC50 value of 351.56 mg/mL. In conclusion, R. microplus populations infesting cattle and buffalo hosts in India exhibited negligible genetic differentiation and high gene flow between them. Additionally, the combination of all C. fistula extracts could serve as a potential substitute for the synthetic acaricide.

AB  - Spring frost damage (SFD), defined as the disaster during the period of newly formed tea buds in spring caused by lower temperature and frost damage, is a particular challenge for tea plants (Camellia sinensis), whose capacity to adapt to extreme weather and climate impacts is limited. In this paper, the region of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) in China was selected as the major tea plantation study area, and the study period was focused on the concentrated occurrence of SFD, i.e., from March to April. By employing the standard lapse rate of air temperature with elevation, a minimum temperature (Tmin) estimation model that had been previously established was used based on reconstructed MYD11A1 nighttime LST values for 3 x 3 pixel windows and digital elevation model data. Combined with satellite-based Tmin estimates and ground-based Tmin observations, the spatiotemporal characteristics of SFD for tea plants were systematically analyzed from 2003 to 2020 in the MLRYR. The SFD risks at three scales (temporal, spatial, and terrain) were then evaluated for tea plants over the MLRYR. The results show that both SFD days at the annual scale and SFD areas at the daily scale exhibited a decreasing trend at a rate of 2.7 days/decade and 2.45 x 10(4) ha/day, respectively (significant rates at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, respectively). The period with the highest SFD risk appeared mainly in the first twenty days of March. However, more attention should be given to the mid-to-late April time period due to the occurrence of late SFD from time to time. Spatially, areas with relatively higher SFD days and SFD risks were predominantly concentrated in the higher altitude areas of northwestern parts of MLRYR for both multi-year averages and individual years. Fortunately, in regions with a higher risk of SFD, the distribution of tea plants was relatively scattered and the area was small. These findings will provide helpful guidance for all kinds of people, including government agencies, agricultural insurance agencies, and tea farmers, in order that reasonable and effective strategies to reduce losses caused by spring frost damage to tea plants may be recommended and implemented.

AB  - The effect of sex-biased dispersal in mammalian ecology and evolution can be elucidated by focusing on maternally or paternally inherited DNA polymorphisms. In sika deer, the genetic structure of the maternal lineage has been clarified by studies based on mitochondrial DNA variation. However, the genetic structure of the paternal lineage has not been well analyzed due to the limited number of point mutations in Y chromosome sequences. In this study, we focused on mutations of highly polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the Y chromosome and developed 16 Y chromosome SSR markers to evaluate male-biased dispersal in sika deer. In total, 55 alleles and 31 multi-locus haplotypes were detected from these 16 loci, revealing clear genetic differentiation among populations (F '(ST) = 0.783). In particular, there were unique alleles for the native individuals on Tanegashima and Yakushima Islands and introduced exotic individuals from Taiwan. These markers are highly useful for evaluating not only historical male-mediated dispersal, genetic structure, and demography of the native populations in Japan, but also the impact of artificial introductions on hybridization, especially the introgression of alleles from escaped farmed individuals to native populations.

AB  - The Liujiawa site is located in the Agricultural-Nomadic Transitional Zone in Northern China (ANTZNC), inhabited during the early Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 bc). Little is known about the diets of its inhabitants or agricultural management practices due to scant historical descriptions. In this study, lipid analysis was conducted on pottery sherds collected from two residential areas within the Liujiawa site. The results offer direct evidence for the processing of millet and ruminant and non-ruminant carcass products by the commoners of the Liujiawa community. The individual delta C-13 values of fatty acids with positive fluctuation indicate that some ruminant animals and pigs were fed C-4 plants as fodder. The routine consumption of ruminant meat by the common inhabitants also reflects a more diverse food source than that proposed in historical descriptions that have suggested dietary heterogeneity between the upper and lower classes: cattle or ovicaprid meat was not a singular privilege enjoyed by the noble classes. On the contrary, commoners also consumed the meat as a food source. Moreover, direct evidence of dairy processing has been found for the first time in pottery residues from an archaeological site within ANTZNC, strongly indicating that milk had been incorporated into the diet as an additional source of food.

AB  - This study explores the perceived influence of climate change on the health of Hamer pastoralists and their livestock in south-western Ethiopia. A combination of focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted with Hamer communities as well as local health workers, animal health workers and non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff. Thematic framework analysis was used to analyse the data. Reductions in rangeland, erratic rainfall, recurrent droughts and loss of seasonality were perceived to be the biggest climate challenges influencing the health and livelihoods of the Hamer. Communities were travelling greater distances to access sufficient grazing lands, and this was leading to livestock deaths and increases in ethnic violence. Reductions in suitable rangeland were also precipitating disease outbreaks in animals due to increased mixing of different herds. Negative health impacts in the community stemmed indirectly from decreases in livestock production, uncertain crop harvests and increased water scarcity. The remoteness of grazing lands has resulted in decreased availability of animal milk, contributing to malnutrition in vulnerable groups, including children. Water scarcity in the region has led to utilisation of unsafe water sources resulting in diarrhoeal illnesses. Further, seasonal shifts in climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria were also acknowledged. Poorly resourced healthcare facilities with limited accessibility combined with an absence of health education has amplified the community's vulnerability to health challenges. The resilience and ambition for livelihood diversification amongst the Hamer was evident. The introduction of camels, increase in permanent settlements and new commercial ideas were transforming their livelihood strategies. However, the Hamer lack a voice to express their perspectives, challenges and ambitions. There needs to be collaborative dynamic dialogue between pastoral communities and the policy-makers to drive sustainable development in the area without compromising the values, traditions and knowledge of the pastoralists.

AB  - The Global Tiger Recovery Program has identified enhancing prey populations as a crucial component in achieving its target of doubling wild tiger (Panthera tigris) numbers, as prey density is a key determinant of tiger density. We estimate prey abundance and ecological carrying capacity (ECC) of tigers in the 1579 km(2) Chitwan-Parsa source site complex within a globally significant tiger conservation landscape in south-central Nepal. Surveying 605.1 km of line transects in the Terai plains and Chure hills of Chitwan-Parsa, we estimated an overall density of 55.43 (36.98-83.45) ungulates/km(2), and a biomass of 244,630 (151,520-334,270) kg/100 km(2) of five abundant ungulates. Chitwan supports 71.58 (49.02-104.71) and Parsa 30.91 (18.70-51.19) ungulates/km(2). The prey base can support 177 (119-263) adult tigers based on energetic requirement models. The tiger ECC was similar to 3.5x higher in Chitwan than in Parsa at a park level. Although opportunities for further recovery of tiger and prey through targeted habitat management exist, the current population of 170 tigers indicates that this population has likely reached its current ECC. We recommend that policymakers and park managers change focus from increasing tiger numbers to developing pre-emptive conflict mitigation strategies to allow the site to retain the successes it has realized.

AB  - The great majority of plants gain access to soil nutrients and enhance their performance under stressful conditions through symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The benefits that AMF confer vary among species and taxonomic groups. However, a comparative analysis of the different benefits among AMF has not yet been performed. We conducted a global meta-analysis of recent studies testing the benefits of individual AMF species and main taxonomic groups in terms of plant performance (growth and nutrition). Separately, we examined AMF benefits to plants facing biotic (pathogens, parasites, and herbivores) and abiotic (drought, salinity, and heavy metals) stress. AMF had stronger positive effects on phosphorus nutrition than on plant growth and nitrogen nutrition and the effects on the growth of plants facing biotic and abiotic stresses were similarly positive. While the AMF taxonomic groups showed positive effects on plant performance either with or without stress, Diversisporales were the most beneficial to plants without stress and Gigasporales to plants facing biotic stress. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of different AMF species and taxonomic groups on plant performance and useful insights for their management and use as bio-inoculants for agriculture and restoration.

AB  - The tendency to show the renewal effect of extinction appears as an intra-individually stable, reproducible processing strategy associated with differential patterns of BOLD activation in hippocampus, iFG and vmPFC, as well as differential resting-state functional connectivity between prefrontal regions and the dorsal attention network. Also, pharmacological modulations of the noradrenergic system that influence attentional processing have partially different effects upon individuals with (REN) and without (NoREN) a propensity for renewal. However, it is as yet unknown whether REN and NoREN individuals differ regarding microstructural properties in attention-related white matter (WM) regions, and whether such differences are related to noradrenergic processing. In this diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis we investigated the relation between microstructural properties of attention-related WM tracts and ABA renewal propensity, under conditions of noradrenergic stimulation by means of the noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine, compared to placebo. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was higher in participants with noradrenergic stimulation (ATO) compared to placebo (PLAC), the effect was predominantly left-lateralized and based on the comparison of ATO REN and PLAC REN participants. In REN participants of both treatment groups, FA in several WM tracts showed a positive correlation with the ABA renewal level, suggesting higher renewal levels were associated with higher microstructural integrity. These findings point towards a relation between microstructural properties of attentionrelated WM tracts and the propensity for renewal that is not specifically dependent on noradrenergic processing.

AB  - Effective waste management in dairy buffalo farming is vital to ensure the health and productivity of a farm and its farmers, as well as to minimize negative environmental impacts. This study examined the waste management practices of dairy buffalo farmers in Nueva Ecija, Philippines in relation to their socio-economic status and farm profile. Fifty-nine dairy buffalo farmers were interviewed face-to-face using pre-tested semistructured questionnaires to gather data on their socio-demographic and economic profiles, farm profiles, and waste management system. Principal Component Analysis and binary regression were used to determine correlation between socio-economic status and farm profile with their manure management systems. Eighty percent of the respondents practiced stockpiling while 12% practiced vermi-composting. The liquid waste is disposed of via open channels going to rice fields, rivers, creeks, irrigation canals, forage areas, or vacant lots. The non-biodegradable farm waste is either buried, burned, thrown in a vacant area, reused, sold or given to garbage collectors. The regression model revealed that the significant determinant of manure management system was animal holding (p<0.05) which indicates that as the animal holding of the dairy farmers increased by 1 unit, there was a .23 increase in the probability that the dairy farmers will practice stockpiling. The agencies concerned need to intensify efforts to disseminate suitable, cost-effective, efficient and sustainable interventions related to waste management for dairy buffalo farms.

AB  - AimsJapanese encephalitis (JE) is endemic in India. Although pigs are considered important hosts and sentinels for JE outbreaks in people, limited information is available on JE virus (JEV) surveillance in pigs.Methods and ResultsWe investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of JEV seroprevalence and its association with climate variables in 4451 samples from pigs in 10 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, over 10 years from 2013 to 2022. The mean seroprevalence of IgG (2013-2022) and IgM (2017-2022) was 14% (95% CI 12.8-15.2) and 10.98% (95% CI 9.8-12.2), respectively. Throughout the region, higher seroprevalence from 2013 to 2017 was observed and was highly variable with no predictable spatio-temporal pattern between districts. Seroprevalence of up to 60.8% in Sant Kabir Nagar in 2016 and 69.5% in Gorakhpur district in 2017 for IgG and IgM was observed, respectively. IgG seroprevalence did not increase with age. Monthly time-series decomposition of IgG and IgM seroprevalence demonstrated annual cyclicity (3-4 peaks) with seasonality (higher, broader peaks in the summer and monsoon periods). However, most variance was due to the overall trend and the random components of the time series. Autoregressive time-series modelling of pigs sampled from Gorakhpur was insufficiently predictive for forecasting; however, an inverse association between humidity (but not rainfall or temperature) was observed.ConclusionsDetection patterns confirm seasonal epidemic periods within year-round endemicity in pigs in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Lack of increasing age-associated seroprevalence indicates that JEV might not be immunizing in pigs which needs further investigation because models that inform public health interventions for JEV could be inaccurate if assuming long-term immunity in pigs. Although pigs are considered sentinels for human outbreaks, sufficient timeliness using sero-surveillance in pigs to inform public health interventions to prevent JEV in people will require more nuanced modelling than seroprevalence and broad climate variables alone.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to disrupt phenological synchrony among interacting species that vary in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. The phenological synchrony observed between winter moth Operophtera brumata caterpillars and oak leafing in spring has become an emblematic test case of this phenomenon, with caterpillars seemingly advancing their phenology more than their host-plant. However, work on this trophic interaction-and on phenological mismatch more widely-routinely overlooks the potential for trophic generalism to buffer the negative effects of mismatch. In the largest study of its kind-using over 3500 individuals reared from egg to pupa-I tested the performance of winter moth caterpillars from four UK populations across nine host-plant species, and considered how adaptation to locally abundant host-plants may modulate performance in different populations. I found that caterpillars survive and grow well across a range of host-plant species, with some evidence of a host-plant by population interaction in performance. Contrary to widespread assumptions, oak seems a relatively poor host-plant species. Occupying a broad trophic niche may help consumers like the winter moth exploit a narrow phenological niche, whereby phenological variation among host-plant species buffers them against asynchrony with any one particular host-plant species. Determining the significance of trophic generalism in the ecology of consumers is a crucial first step towards assessing its role as a potential buffering mechanism and, hence, evaluating the true threat posed by mismatch.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries often lack historical shark and ray catch information, hampering their management. We reconstructed historical catch trends and current fishing pressure by combining local ecological knowledge, satellite-based vessel counts, and a short-term landing-site survey. To test the effectiveness of this method, we focused on the Bijag & oacute;s Archipelago (Guinea-Bissau, West Africa), where historical fisheries data are lacking. Benthic rays (stingrays [Dasyatidae] and butterfly rays [Gymnura spp.]), benthopelagic rays (duckbill eagle rays [Aetomylaeus bovinus] and cownose rays [Rhinoptera marginata]), guitarfish (Glaucostegus and Rhinobatos spp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae), and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.) declined in abundance by 81.5-96.7% (species dependent) from 1960 to 2020. Fishing effort increased annually: fishing trip duration by 42.0% (SE 3.4), numbers of fishing vessels at sea as perceived by fishers by 36.3% (1.0) (1960-2020), and number of vessels by 12.0% (1.1) (2007-2022). We estimated that in 2020, fishing vessels collectively captured 61-264 sharks and 522-2194 rays per day in the archipelago, depending on the proportion of the fishing fleet that was active (i.e., low fleet activity of 18% and high fleet activity of 80%). We advocate for reducing shark and ray catches by regulating fleet size, reinforcing boundaries of protected areas, and collecting fisher-dependent information on shark and ray landings to safeguard these vulnerable species and coastal livelihoods. We demonstrated the effectiveness of using this 3-pronged approach to provide baseline data on shark fisheries, a common challenge in areas with small-scale fisheries and limited research capacity.

AB  - Ascomycetous yeast species in the genus Wickerhamomyces (Saccharomycetales, Wickerhamomycetaceae) are isolated from various habitats and distributed throughout the world. Prior to this study, 35 species had been validly published and accepted into this genus. Beneficially, Wickerhamomyces species have been used in a number of biotechnologically applications of environment, food, beverage industries, biofuel, medicine and agriculture. However, in some studies, Wickerhamomyces species have been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen. Through an overview of diversity, taxonomy and recently published literature, we have updated a brief review of Wickerhamomyces. Moreover, two new Wickerhamomyces species were isolated from the soil samples of Assam tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) that were collected from plantations in northern Thailand. Herein, we have identified these species as W. lannaensis and W. nanensis. The identification of these species was based on phenotypic (morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics) and molecular analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of a combination of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) of ribosomal DNA genes support that W. lannaensis and W. nanensis are distinct from other species within the genus Wickerhamomyces. A full description, illustrations and a phylogenetic tree showing the position of both new species have been provided. Accordingly, a new combination species, W. myanmarensis has been proposed based on the phylogenetic results. A new key for species identification is provided.

AB  - Composting can convert livestock manure into organic fertilizers. However, composting with forced aeration does not allow for large - scale composting due to power consumption. Therefore, this study investigated different powerless - ventilation conditions to improve the performance of large - scale facultative composting. Under the powerless-ventilation with double-membranecovered and addition of cornstalks treatment, the maturity of compost was most effective (GI reached 118 %). The conditions of powerless - ventilation with membrane covering and cornstalk addition can reduce CH4 emissions by 84.47 % and HAS emissions by 28.08 %. The doublemembrane- covered treatment was less effective in reducing gas emission compared with singlemembrane-covered. Among the composting conditions, the powerlessventilation with membranecovered and addition of cornstalks could achieve the best effect of promoting maturity and reducing emissions. The nutrient contents of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium increased by 6.21 %, 18.14 %, and 13.22 % under the conditions of powerless-ventilation with membrane-covered and addition of cornstalks. Optimizing the large-scale composting process is an important means to reduce the emission of pollutant gases. This study can provide scientific basis for the large-scale treatment of agricultural waste

AB  - Cupressaceae fossil tree stumps from the early Oligocene Lihe coal mine in southwestern China contain abundant quartz-petrified damage traces. The wood fossils were assigned to Taxodioxylon (very similar to extant Taxodium) based on wood anatomy analysis. Within the woods, three types of arthropods- and one fungusmediated ichnofossils LHIF 1???4 (Lihe wood ichnofossils 1???4) were observed. The boring wood types for LHIF 1???3 are comparable to extant longicorn beetles (Cerambycidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), and wood wasps (Siricidae). The polyporous structured traces of LHIF 4 were attributed to the invasion of stem canker fungus (Polyporaceae). This first-ever report of Taxodium-like fossil from the Oligocene of southwestern China points to Yunnan serving as a refugium for some lineage of gymnosperms at that time. Furthermore, the extensive traces of arthropods and fungus discovered from the fossil wood have filled a gap in fossil records for insect herbivory in this region. The wood stumps and decomposers suggest a swamp-like environment. The disappearance of Taxodium after the Oligocene supports incremental aridification and changes in winter season temperature conditions, which shifted the late Paleogene mixed deciduous broad-leaved and needle-leaved forest into the present evergreen broad-leaved forest.

AB  - Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) have gained relevance in ecological studies and population monitoring, allowing non-invasive remote sampling without the need to capture and handle animals. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and radioimmunoassays (RIAs) are commonly used for FGM determination. Although these methods should be validated for each species, nonvalidated tests are still widely used to determine FGMs in wildlife. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a predictive method requiring calibration against reference methods used to assess FGMs in wildlife. EIAs and RIAs have been utilized to determine FGMs in chamois (Rupicapra spp.), a medium-sized mountain ungulate. This study aims to assess the potential of NIRS to determine FGMs and to evaluate the correlation among analytical methods used to determine FGMs in chamois. Faecal samples from 125 Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra) and 125 Pyrenean chamois (R. pyrenaica pyrenaica) were collected from the field, frozen at - 20 C-degrees, lyophilized, grounded, and scanned using a NIRSystems 5000 monochromator over a 1108-2492 nm wavelength. After this non-destructive NIRS analysis, FGMs were extracted and analysed using four immunoassays previously used in chamois studies: a 125-I-corticosterone RIA, a cortisol EIA, and two 11-oxoetiocholanolone EIAs (72a and 72T). Only the 11-oxoetiocholanolone 72T EIA has been validated for Alpine chamois. NIRS predictions were calibrated and cross-validated for each of the four immunoassays. The correlation among the four immunoassays was assessed using Spearman's rank. The coefficient of determination for NIRS calibration (R2) values ranged from 0.37 to 0.75, and the ratio of performance to deviation values from 1.2 to 1.6. Therefore, NIRS could not predict FGM concentration in chamois faeces. This could be due to the complexity and variability of the FGM detected by the immunoassays as reference methods, and by potential interference of other compounds in the faecal matrix. The correlation among the immunoassays was low overall. As a conclusion, NIRS cannot be recommended for measuring FGMs in chamois. The low correlation among the immunoassays used for FGM determination raises concern about the reliability of previous studies using non-validated methods in chamois. Only biologically

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the population fluctuation of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) on three Capsicum annuum L. (Solanaceae) cultivars (red delta star, yellow delta star and chili omega 62). Experimental trials were carried out under high plastic-net house conditions during two seasons, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. The feeding effects of T. urticae on some biochemical compounds of C. annuum were estimated. Densities of egg and mobile stages on the three test cultivars increased gradually from initial count in March 15th and reached peak at last week of November of two seasons, except densities of eggs on red delta reached peak at last week of October. In both growing seasons, the highest population densities of T. urticae were observed on red delta star, while the lowest densities were on chili omega 62. Correlation coefficient of T. urticae densities levels with total carotenoids, carbohydrates and proteins of tested C. annuum cultivars showed positive relationship and a reverse one with total lipids, chlorophyll, phenolic, flavonoids and alkaloids compounds.

AB  - Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns provide a global challenge to livestock producers. Due to the lack of information on the exact relationship between weather patterns and production output, livestock producers may struggle to adjust to these changing environmental conditions. This study therefore evaluated the feasibility of modelling the impact of weather conditions both within and across production seasons on production output in two divergently selected lines of Merino ewes. Production data collected from the high and low line of the Elsenburg Merino flock between 1993 and 2021 were related to weather data recorded by a weather station on the farm. The weather data included temperature, relative humidity and rainfall readings. Multiple linear regressions between uncorrelated weather variables and production parameters (conception, lambing, multiple offspring and survival percentages, average weaning weight and weight weaned per ewe) were derived to quantify the relationship between weather and production. Within production season, weather conditions during mating significantly affected lambing (R-2 = 0.332) and multiple offspring percentages (R-2 = 0.316) in the high line and lambing percentage (R-2 = 0.205) in the low line. Lambing period weather affected average weaning weight in the high line (R-2 = 0.230) and survival percentage in the low line (R-2 = 0.193). Significant amounts of the variation (R-2 = 0.180-0.306) in various production traits for both lines were also accounted for by the fitting of regression models of weather conditions in the preceding year to current production performance. This indicates the presence of weather-related carry-over effects. It therefore appears that using weather data to predict production output, both within and between production seasons, may be a viable management tool to aid producers in decision making. More work is required before these models are suitable for general uptake.

AB  - Shading is an effective agronomic technique to protect tea plants from intense sunlight. However, there are currently very few studies on more effective shading methods to improve the quality of summer tea. In this study, 'Longjing43' plants were grown under four different shading treatments for 14 days, with no shading as the control. Among the four shading treatments, double-layer-net shadings had the most positive impact on the tea quality, resulting in higher levels of amino acids but lower levels of tea polyphenols. Additionally, double-layer-net shadings provided more suitable microenvironments for tea plants. The tea leaves in T4 (double nets 50 cm above the plant canopy) contained 16.13 mg center dot g(-1) of umami and sweet amino acids, which was significantly higher than in other treatments. T4 had the lowest air temperature and the most suitable and stable soil water content. Interestingly, the ratio of red light to far-red light in T4 was only 1.65, much lower than other treatments, which warrants further study. In conclusion, the microenvironment induced by shading can greatly affect the tea quality, and double-layer-net shading is better for improving the quality of summer tea.

AB  - The paper aims to valorise winery waste into a co-composting process with natural clinoptilolite zeolite to improve the agronomic value of compost and simultaneously achieve sustainable recycling of organic wastes. The innovation of this study lies in the role of natural zeolite in winery waste valorisation and recycling.The winery waste materials after the harvest were composted in the presence of natural clinoptilolite zeolite at the following rates: (1) zeolite 0% wastes 100% (0Z, control); (2) zeolite 10%: waste 90% (10Z); (3) zeolite 30%:waste 70% (30Z). The experimentation was set up in Tuscany-Italy, characterised by a typically Mediterranean semiarid climate. We evaluated the response of chemical and biochemical properties to different rates of zeolite in the winery waste composting process.The presence of zeolite at the two rates (10Z and 30Z) during the composting of winery wastes enabled higher retention of nutrients (N, P and K), enzymatic activity and humification of the organic matter concerning control compost (0Z). In addition, in zeolite based-composts, a decrease in electrical conductivity and an increase in germination index were observed, thus indicating the improvement of the agronomic quality of the compost.Moreover, the winery waste-based compost with zeolite mainly responds to the threshold level of the current EU Fertiliser Regulation (1009/2019), which promotes the EU Market production and using fertilisers from recycled biowaste.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) has been extinct from the UK since the late medieval period. Recently, the idea of a reintroduction of the species has entered the public sphere. While reintroduction receives support from the public, there is significant opposition to the idea within the UK farming community. This study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the attitudes of UK farmers towards the reintroduction of the lynx. The theory of planned behavior was also used to predict farmers' intention to cull lynx in the case of a reintroduction and the drivers behind this. Results indicated negative attitudes towards reintroduction among UK farmers. Older people, those from potential reintroduction areas, and sheep farmers, those whose income is dependent on farming and those with higher perceived knowledge of lynx, had more negative attitudes. Women were significantly more afraid of lynx than men. We also revealed that many farmers intended to hunt lynx in the case of a reintroduction, with attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control being significant predictors of intended behavior. Stronger protective laws for lynx could reduce intention to cull. Additionally, active management and regulation of the lynx population can facilitate harmonious coexistence. These findings suggest that high levels of legal protection and strategies that aim to encourage social norms against illegal culling of lynx, reduce capability to kill lynx (through policies relating to the use of equipment that can be used to kill lynx), or aim to change attitudes to culling lynx could help reduce the perceived conflict of farmers with regard to lynx reintroduction and increase the success of a reintroduction.

AB  - For many years, tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing new industrial tuna fisheries, while their adverse impacts on threatened marine species have received relatively little attention. In tuna fisheries, bycatch is the major anthropogenic threat to marine megafauna in general, particularly sharks. Research on the development of gear technology for bycatch reduction and potential mitigation measures helped tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations adopt bycatch reduction management measures. After reviewing past research on the development of mitigation measures for pelagic longline and tropical purse seine fisheries based on pelagic species' behaviours, we describe promising new approaches integrating recent technological breakthroughs. New innovations include autonomous underwater vehicles carrying cameras along with miniaturized sensors, aerial drones, computer simulation of fishing gear geometry, environmental DNA assays, computer visualizations and deep learning. The successful application of such tools and methods promises to improve our understanding of factors that influence capture, escape and stress of caught species. Moreover, results emerging from recent ethological research explaining the power of social connection and learning in the "fish world" such as social learning from congeners, habituation to deterrents, and how past fishery interactions affect responses to fishing gear should be taken into account when developing technical mitigation measures.

AB  - Low genomic diversity is generally indicative of small population size and is considered detrimental by decreasing long-term adaptability. 1-6 Moreover, small population size may promote gene flow with congeners and outbreeding depression. 7-13 Here, we examine the connection between habitat availability, effective population size ( N e ), and extinction by generating a 40 3 nuclear genome from the extinct blue antelope ( Hippotragus leucophaeus ). Historically endemic to the relatively small Cape Floristic Region in southernmost Africa, 14,15 populations were thought to have expanded and contracted across glacial -interglacial cycles, tracking suitable habitat. 16-18 However, we found long-term low N e , unaffected by glacial cycles, suggesting persistence with low genomic diversity for many millennia prior to extinction in -AD 1800. A lack of inbreeding, alongside high levels of genetic purging, suggests adaptation to this long-term low N e and that human impacts during the colonial era (e.g., hunting and landscape transformation), rather than longer -term ecological processes, were central to its extinction. Phylogenomic analyses uncovered gene flow between roan ( H. equinus ) and blue antelope, as well as between roan and sable antelope ( H. niger ), approximately at the time of divergence of blue and sable antelope (x-1.9 Ma). Finally, we identified the LYST and ASIP genes as candidates for the eponymous bluish pelt color of the blue antelope. Our results revise numerous aspects of our understanding of the interplay between genomic diversity and evolutionary history and provide the resources for uncovering the genetic basis of this extinct species' unique traits.

AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the population dynamics and diversity indices of three invasive species; the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), the silver leaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn. (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the onion thrips Thrips tabaci Lindman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) on four tested plants; Siberian (Russian) kale Brassica napus var. pabularia L., Italian (Tuscan) kale Brassica oleracea var. palmifolia L. (Brassicaceae), spearmint Mentha spicata L. and Saudi Mint Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae); in addition to evaluating a proposed IPM protocol in two experimental sites (Om Saber, Beheira Governorate and Kom Oshim, Fayoum Governorate). The proposed IPM program consisted using predatory mites; Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot, and Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski & Amitai) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), a green pesticide, and an entomopathogenic compound. Samples were collected from tested plants for two seasons to calculate pest population dynamics, and diversity indices, before and after IPM treatments. The resulting data showed statistically significant fluctuation, population dynamics, abundance, distribution, and diversity indices of the three targeted pest species recorded on the four tested plants. The proposed IPM protocol resulted in a significant reduction percentage when A. swirskii was used compared to other tactics. It is discussed that abiotic and biotic factors together help in explaining why various pest species build their communities rapidly and increase their parameters that become above the Economic Injury Level (EIL). Such factors are hypothesized to affect the plant-arthropod, predator-herbivore, predator-predator, and tri-trophic interactions. The proposed protocol recommends the consideration of application timing and merging tactics together to get maximum efficiency.

AB  - Applying selenium (Se) fertilizer is the only way to alleviate soil Se deficiency. Although effects of nanoselenium foliar application on plant growth and stress resistance have been extensively investigated, soil application of nanoselenium on soil microorganisms and their relationship with crop quality and soil health remains unclear. In this study, a steady-state homogeneous nanoparticle of epigallocatechin gallate Se (ESe) was synthesized, and a pot experiment was conducted applying ESe at five concentrations (0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1)) to the tea planattion soil. The study revealed a significant increase in Se concentration in soil and tea with ESe application and identified 2.43-7.8 mg kg(-1) as the safe and optimal range for soil application. Specifically, the moderate dose of ESe improved the tea quality [reduced tea polyphenols (TP), increased free amino acids (AA), and reduced TP/AA] and soil quality index (SQI). Besides, in marure tea leaves, antioxidant enzyme activities [promote catalase (CAT) superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD)] increased, while level of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O-2(-))] decreased with ESe application. The 16S rRNA of the soil bacteria showed that ESe application significantly changed the community structure of soil bacteria but did not alter the diversity of the bacteria and the abundance of dominant taxa (phylum and genus levels). Statistical analysis of the taxonomic and functional profiles (STAMP) detected 21 differential taxa (genus level), mainly low-abundance ones, under the ESe application. Linear regression and random forest (RF) modeling revealed that the low-abundance bacterial taxa were significantly correlated with SQI (R-2 = 0.28, p < 0.01) and tea quality (R-2 = 0.23-0.37, p < 0.01). Thus, the study's findings suggest that ESe application affects soil and tea quality by modulating the low-abundance taxa in soil. The study also highlights the crucial role of low-abundance bacterial taxa of the rhizosphere in regulating soil functions under the ESe application.

AB  - The speciose scarinine clade of coral reef parrotfishes display significant variation in trophic cranial morphology, yet are often described as generalist herbivores. The hypothesis that many parrotfishes target micro-photoautotrophs is a new framework within which to clarify parrotfish diets. Here, we investigate the dietary targets of Scarus rubroviolaceus using the feeding substrata extraction method and then compare the results to fourteen other syntopic parrotfish species. Scarus rubroviolaceus were followed on snorkel until repeated biting was observed. A 22 mm x 20 mm core was extracted around the bite. We identified and quantified the bite core biota by scraping the top 1 mm from bite cores for microscopy and 16S/18S small subunit rRNA metabarcoding. Filamentous cyanobacteria density on S. rubroviolaceus bite cores did not differ from the other fourteen parrotfish species, Calothrix (Nostocales) being the most frequently observed filamentous cyanobacteria for all fifteen parrotfish species. The 18S metabarcoding analysis detected the encrusting, endolithic sponge taxon Clionaida in the S. rubroviolaceus bite cores. We investigated the possibility of spongivory across all fifteen parrotfish species including an analysis of sponge-associated microbiota detected on the bite cores. This revealed a new axis of trophic partitioning with varying levels of spongivory amongst the fifteen Indo-Pacific parrotfish species. The bite cores of Cetoscarus ocellatus, Chlorurus spilurus, Chlorurus microrhinos, Scarus frenatus and S. rubroviolaceus particularly indicated spongivory. Our findings develop our understanding of parrotfish diet and provide further evidence that parrotfishes are specialized feeders and partition benthic trophic resources.

AB  - The Yak (Bos grunniens) is a special breed of livestock predominantly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in beef cattle is a vital indicator of meat quality. In this study, RNA-Seq and Protein-Seq were respectively employed to sequence the transcriptome and proteome of the longissimus dorsi (LD) tissue from 4-year-old yaks with significant differences in IMF content under the same fattening conditions. Five overlapping genes (MYL3, ACADS, L2HGDH, IGFN1, and ENSBGRG00000000-926) were screened using combined analysis. Functional verification tests demonstrated that the key gene ACADS inhibited yak intramuscular preadipocyte (YIMA) differentiation and proliferation, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis gene expression, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Furthermore, co-transfection experiments further demonstrated that interfering with ACADS reversed the effect of PPAR alpha agonists in promoting lipid differentiation.

AB  - Quantitative food web analyses can provide insights into the specificity of consumers such as herbivores, parasites and parasitoids. Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.

AB  - Simple Summary Reproductive seasonality is a major factor affecting buffalo breeding. The rationale of this work derives from the hypothesis that the reduced cleavage and blastocyst rates observed during the non-breeding season could be due to a suboptimal follicular environment. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of season on the lipid profile of the ovarian follicle in the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. For this purpose, abattoir-derived ovaries were collected during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and the apolar phase of follicular components was analyzed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of seasonal variations in lipid content of the buffalo ovarian follicle, including follicular fluid, follicular and cumulus cells, and oocytes. The results undoubtedly demonstrated significant seasonal variations in the lipid profile, including triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids, in the different biological matrices analyzed. Interestingly, an increased amount in the total level of non-esterified fatty acids in the follicular fluid was also observed during the non-breeding season. The results allow a better understanding of the physiology of the ovarian follicle in buffalo and unveil some causes of reduced oocyte competence during the non-reproductive season, laying the groundwork for further studies and corrective strategies. The reduced oocyte competence recorded during the non-breading season (NBS) is one of the key factors affecting the profitability of buffalo farming and limits the IVEP efficiency. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate whether season influences the lipid content within the ovarian follicle in the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. Abattoir-derived ovaries were collected during the breeding season (BS) and the NBS, and different matrices (follicular fluid, oocytes, cumulus and follicular cells) were recovered. After the extraction of the apolar fraction, all samples were analyzed by H1 nuclear magnetic resonance and FF samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Seasonal differences in lipid composition were observed in all matrices. In particular, during the NBS, the triglyceride content was higher in the follicular fluid and in the oocytes but reduced in the follicular cells. Both cholesterol and phospholipids were reduced in the follicular fluid and follicular cells during the NBS. Furthermore, the total amount of non-esterified fatty acids was significantly increased in the follicular fluid. The seasonal variation in lipid profile of the follicle may, in part, account for the reduced buffalo oocyte competence during the NBS, due to the critical role played by lipids in regulating ovarian functions.

AB  - The genetic regulation of hair density in animals remains poorly understood. The Dazu black goat, characterized by its black coarse hair and white skin, provides a unique model for dissecting coarse hair density (CHD). Using high-resolution micro-camera imaging, this study analyzed 905 skin images, 33 skin transcriptomes, 272 whole-genome sequences, and 182 downloaded transcriptomes. Morphological assessment from juvenile to adult stages revealed the thickening of hair shafts accompanied by a progressive decline in density, largely attributable to rapid surface expansion of the trunk skin. Transcriptomic comparison between high-and low-CHD individuals identified 572 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A genome-wide association study detected 25 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (P<9.07e-8) P <9.07e-8) and mapped 48 annotated genes, with the most prominent association signal located near GJA1 on chr9.15931585-18621011. Literature review and Venn analysis highlighted six genes ( GJA1 , GPRC5D, , CD1D, , CD207, , TFAM, , and CXCL12) ) with documented roles in skin and hair biology, and three genes ( GJA1 , GPRC5D, , and ATP6V1B1) ) overlapped with DEGs. Multiple-tissue transcriptomic profiling, western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and skin single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed that GJA1 and GPRC5D were highly and specifically expressed in skin, particularly within hair follicles. Expression was localized predominantly to follicular stem cells and dermal papilla cells, suggesting a significant role in folliculogenesis and structural maintenance. Cross-validation using four public datasets further demonstrated positive correlations between GJA1 and GPRC5D expression and hair follicle density. The innovative micro-camera application allowed the elucidation of spatiotemporal patterns and genes associated with CHD, thereby addressing a significant knowledge gap in animal hair density.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the seasonal effect on the metabolomic profile of the ovarian follicle in Italian Mediterranean buffalo to unravel the causes of the reduced competence during the non-breeding season (NBS). Samples of follicular fluid, follicular cells, cumulus cells and oocytes were collected from abattoir-derived ovaries during breeding season (BS) and NBS and analyzed by 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures of the Discriminant Analysis showed clear separation into seasonal classes and Variable Importance in Projection method identified differentially abundant metabolites between seasons. Seasonal differences were recorded in metabolite content in all analyzed components suggesting that the decreased oocyte competence during NBS may be linked to alteration of several metabolic pathways. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that differences in the metabolites between the seasons were linked to glutathione, energy generating and amino acid metabolism and phospholipid biosynthesis. The current work allows the identification of potential positive competence markers in the follicular fluid as glutathione, glutamate, lactate and choline, and negative markers like leucine, isoleucine and beta-hydroxybutyrate. These results form a major basis to develop potential strategies to optimize the follicular environment and the IVM medium to improve the competence of oocytes during the NBS. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Floral development depends on multifactor processes related to genetic, physiological, and ecological pathways. Plants respond to herbivores by activating mechanisms aimed at tolerating, compensating, or avoiding loss of biomass and nutrients, and thereby survive in a complex landscape of interactions. Thus, plants need to overcome trade-offs between development, growth, and reproduction vs. the initiation of anti-herbivore defences. This study aims to assess the frequency of phloem-feeding herbivores in wild populations of the Etruscan honeysuckle (Lonicera etrusca Santi) and study their effects on floral development and reproduction. The incidence of herbivory by the honeysuckle aphid (Hyadaphis passerinii del Guercio) was assessed in three wild populations of the Iberian Peninsula. The effect of herbivory on floral morphology, micromorphology of stigmas and pollen, floral rewards, pollination, and fruit and seed set were studied. The herbivory by aphids reduces the size of flowers and pollen. Additionally, it stops nectar synthesis and causes malformation in pollen and microstructures of stigmas, affecting pollination. As a consequence, fruit set and seed weight are reduced. This work provides evidence of the changes induced by phloem-feeding herbivores in floral development and functioning that affect the ecological processes necessary to maintain the reproductive success of plants.

AB  - The fencing of protected areas is increasing worldwide. However, the implementation of fences for conservation has outpaced scientific assessment of their effectiveness, non-target impacts, and long-term costs. We assessed landscape predictors of fence crossing sites and employed camera traps over a one-year period to investigate wildlife responses to a conservation fence around Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Specifically, we measured the impact of the fence on wild mammal movement, and the temporal impacts of fence maintenance on wildlife crossings and behavior. Cameras captured more than 65,000 detections of animals approaching fences, with 3626 observed crossings over 2818 trap nights at 19 sites. Using these data, we developed a guide to classifying fence-specific mammal behaviors. Thirty-eight wild mammal species approached known weak points in the fence, and 27 species were recorded crossing the fence. No single environmental variable predicted detection or fence crossing points for all species, but seasonality, human activity, habitat visibility, and proximity to an adjacent protected area were each correlated with species-specific crossing locations. Additionally, breaches of repaired fence-crossing locations occurred within days of maintenance. We conclude that popular, ?one-size-fitsall?, conservation fence designs may be ineffective and costly for restraining movement of many wildlife species. We recommend that those deploying conservation fences start with clearly articulated management goals, that fence maintenance be informed by taxa-specific tendencies to breach fences, and that managers consider the strategic creation of wildlife corridors, overpasses, or ungulate-proof fences to link fenced protected areas with surrounding habitat.

AB  - Lethal trapping of island invasive rodents is a critical practice used by management organizations to protect native biota. Carcass detection from lethal trapping is dependent on the trapping method, carcass palatability, and scavengers present. Goodnature A24 self-resetting rat traps are an effective tool in remote areas and complex terrain because traps can be visited at 4-6 month intervals and produce multiple carcasses during that interval. The goal of this study was to determine whether we are a) underestimating target mortality with carcass counts and b) failing to detect non-target mortality between A24 trap checks at two field sites on the island of Kauai. Both sites have established Goodnature A24 trap grids with 300 A24s deployed by the Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project (KFBRP), and one site is fenced to exclude invasive ungulates. KFBRP conducts routine trap checks every four months, finding 0-3 rat or mouse carcasses at each trap. We assumed that traps kill more animals than indicated by carcass counts because 75% of traps have counters to record when traps fire, and counter tallies usually exceed carcass counts. In 2018 and 2019, several bird carcasses were found under traps; therefore, we needed to investigate the likelihood that non-target mortality went undetected. In May 2019, we placed 60 carcasses (30 non-native birds and 30 rats) at a fenced site, and 60 carcasses (30 bird, 30 rat) at an unfenced site, in both gulches and uplands. Carcasses were periodically surveyed for 120 days after deployment. The unfenced site had greater removal rates, notably in gulches; 33 of 60 carcasses remained detectable, compared to 52 of 60 carcasses at the fenced site. Bird and rat carcasses did not differ in persistence, and taxon did not affect scavenger preference. These results suggest that significant non-target mortality has not gone undetected in our A24 trap grid because we are likely to detect most target and non-target carcasses after four months in fenced areas, and especially upland unfenced areas. However, we are less likely to detect carcasses in the unfenced gulches where ungulate scavengers are prevalent, and increased monitoring may be needed in such gulches.

AB  - Sheep have a sensitive threshold for bitterness, which may affect feed selection. Previous research attempted to classify sheep according by bitter sensitivity by measuring fluid intake of the compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) at various concentrations over a 14-d period. Although successful, the study was laborious, lengthy, required multiple layers of acclimation and testing, and accommodated a limited number of animals. Accord-ingly, a more efficient test is needed to classify bitter-taster status of sheep. The objective of this experiment was to develop a more rapid and refined method to assist in identification of PTC-taster status in rams utilizing only two concentrations of PTC-mixture over a 2-day test period. Mature Targhee, Rambouillet, Polypay, and composite-breed rams (n = 44), were equally stratified into three barns and subjected to 4-d acclimation, 2-d sham, and 2-d testing phases. The sham phase was conducted to determine if ethanol (delivery vehicle for PTC) influenced voluntary fluid intake or behavior; no effect (P >= 0.13) was observed. The 2-d test phase was a side-by-side preference study between water and one of two concentrations (0.20 and 2.03 mM) of PTC-mixture delivered on alternate days. Video surveillance was conducted to evaluate the number and duration of ap-proaches to the PTC-mixture and subsequent sniffing, head bobbing, jerking, shaking, and lip movements, smacking, and licking behaviors. Overall, intake of PTC-mixture was less (P < 0.001) than water intake. The PTC-taster classifications were determined based on average PTC intake relative to +/- 1.0 standard deviation of the study population mean and used to sort rams into super-(n = 9), intermediate (n = 29), or non-(n = 6) PTC-taster classifications. The amount of time spent drinking either PTC-mixture or water was different (P < 0.001) amongst PTC-taster classifications and correlated with both water (r = 0.23, P = 0.028) and PTC-mixture (r = 0.46, P < 0.001) intake. Head bobbing (P = 0.035) and lip smacking (P < 0.001) were associated with PTC intake across all classes. Super-tasters appeared to utilize sense of smell (sniffing) more frequently to identify PTC-mixture than the intermediate or non-tasters (P <= 0.012). Non-tasters did not exhibit behavioral differences (P >= 0.12) regardless of solution type. The streamlined methodology outlined in this study will help facilitate future studies aimed at better understanding forage selection and consumption in sheep.

AB  - The recycling of agricultural organic wastes into fields is as a viable strategy to increase crop yields while mitigating pollution and fostering environmental protection. However, the effects of various organic amendments on crop productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be comprehensively assessed. Thus, in this study, we conducted a field experiment from 2019 to 2022 in the North China Plain, investigating the effects of recycling straw, pig manure, and biogas residue and applying chemical nitrogen fertilizer as a control on crop yields, GHG emissions, and the synergistic effects of yield benefits, agricultural operational costs, and environmental benefits in a wheat-maize cropping system. The results revealed a disparity in the effects of different organic amendments on crop yields. Compared to chemical fertilizers, pig manure significantly enhanced yield and stability (5.82 %), whereas straw significantly decreased the yield of wheat and maize. The addition of organic amendments stimulated GHG emissions, with treatments involving pig manure resulting in the highest emissions, which significantly increased by 39.87 % compared to those of the control. Straw, manure, and biogas residue increased the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the cropping system. Biogas residue and straw applications increased the in GHGI during the wheat season, whereas the application of manure significantly increased the GHGI during the maize season. The synergy indices for yield - agricultural activity cost and yield GHG cost during the wheat season and across years for pig manure incorporation both had a value of 10, indicating its advantage in average crop yield during the wheat season and throughout the year. The findings of the study indicated that the incorporation of organic materials not only achieves high yield benefits but also maintains lower GHG costs and agricultural activity costs. Although soil GHG emissions increased, pig manure incorporation remained the optimal nitrogen application strategy when the comprehensive factors of yield benefits, agricultural activity costs, and GHG costs were considered.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the metal(loid)s phytoextraction potential of trees: Betula pendula Roth, Pinus sylvestris L. and the shrub Salix viminalis L. Plants of different ages were selected from a post-industrial area with an unusually high content of calcium (Ca) and trace elements in the soil. The content of 39 metal(loid)s in trees and shrub organs and physicochemical soil parameters were determined. A comparison of these species with control plants was also an object of the study. The polluted soil was characterized by worse physicochemical conditions and a much higher content of almost all the analyzed elements in comparison with the control. The older the plants, the greater their total biomass, with the control plant biomass being significantly greater in each case for all treated plants. According to the total content of all determined elements jointly, the most enriched was the oldest, a 7-year-old specimen of S. viminalis. The obtained results suggest that the high Ca concentration and the alkaline reaction (8.83) of polluted soil limit the uptake of most elements by tested plants. It can be concluded that despite the reduction of biomass, this limitation allows plants to better adapt and survive under challenging conditions. Excessive concentration of elements, even nutrients such as Ca, may act as an inhibitory factor for the uptake of other elements. Moreover, phytoextraction ability may significantly vary in different woody plant species and ages, which is an essential practical aspect in dendroremediation application. Novelty statement That is probably the first study to date of trees and shrubs differing in age and growing on post-industrial soil contaminated with calcium (Ca) and selected toxic metals/metalloids. The obtained results show that an alkaline reaction (less than 9) of soil and an unusually high Ca concentration may help the studied tree species to adapt/survive in unfavorable habitat conditions (high concentration of toxic elements). The efficiency of phytoextraction of toxic elements was so high that, especially for forest animals (roe-deer) that consume, e.g., willow shoots, it could pose a serious threat to health and life, both for them and potentially for humans.

AB  - The tick Ixodes ricinus (Ixodida: Ixodidae, Linnaeus) is the main vector of several pathogens including Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (agent of Lyme borreliosis) and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Its distribution depends on many factors including suitable habitat, climate and presence of hosts. In this study, we present records of I. ricinus bites on humans, dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; Carnivora: Canidae, L.) and cats (Felis catus; Carnivora: Felidiae, L.) in the United Kingdom (UK) obtained through the Tick Surveillance Scheme between 2013 and 2020. We divided the UK into 20 km x 20 km grids and 9.2% (range 1.2%-30%) of grids had at least one record every year since 2013. Most regions reported a yearly increase in the percentage of grids reporting I. ricinus since 2013 and the highest changes occurred in the South and East England with 5%-6.7% of new grids reporting I. ricinus bites each year in areas that never reported ticks before. Spatiotemporal analyses suggested that, while all regions recorded I. ricinus in new areas every year, there was a yearly decline in the percentage of new areas covered, except for Scotland. We discuss potential drivers of tick expansion, including reforestation and increase in deer populations.

AB  - The present work was carried out to quantify camelina germination niche under salinity and temperature (T) stress using halotime and halothermal time models. Seed germination (SG) time courses were recorded at six constant temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C) and at each of the following levels of NaCl concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM). Halotime model could well describe the germination time courses across a range of NaCl concentrations (R2 = 0.79- 0.91). The median base NaCl concentration was approximately constant (231 mM) at suboptimal T followed by a linear decrease, with the rate of 17.4 mM degrees C-1, under supra-optimal T. However, the germination rate increased with increasing T, reaching its maximum at a fixed optimum temperature (To = 20 degrees C), independent of NaCl concentration. Then it decreased linearly for T > To and intercepted the x-axis at the ceiling temperature values of 33.5 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 22 degrees C under 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. Consequently, based on model estimation the adequate soil T for SG of camelina should be in the range of 0.4 degrees C-33.5 degrees C, and the To is 20 degrees C. Besides, the salinity should be less than 231 mM.

AB  - Camera trapping for detecting wildlife is increasingly used as a primary method of non-invasive wildlife monitoring. Yet understanding among researchers and conservationists on how camera trap make, and model affect detection rates is limited. Published studies often fail to make clear why a given camera trap model was chosen or what specifications or parameters were used to capture target species within a given study area, prohibiting replicability. Here we present a comparison of predator and herbivore detection efficacy using three makes and models of camera trap at differing price ranges, year of release (hereafter vintages) and specifications. We used a passive monitoring survey design at six sites in open field conditions across the Flow Country, Northern Scotland. Detection efficacy varied substantially between grades and vintages of camera traps and depended on species captured. Older models of camera with lower trigger speed and night vision range performed particularly poorly for nocturnal predatory mammal detection. This has implications for how researchers, conservationists, developers and other users approach experimental design and analyses, but also on the conclusions that may be drawn from studies. We caution against using the results of one or more camera trap studies using different makes and models of cameras to inform experimental design or policy interventions.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the impact of dietary inclusion of Moringa oleifera leaf meal (MLM) as a substitution for soybean meal on nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, rumen enzyme activity, blood metabolites, growth-related hormones, and growth performance of buffalo calves. Thirty buffalo calves eight to nine months of age with an average body weight of approximately 153.7 +/- 0.97 kg were randomly distributed through three dietary treatments (ten calves/treatment). MLM inclusion rates were 15% (M15) and 20% (M20), replacing soybean meal by 50 and 75% in the concentrate mixture, respectively. The results indicated that, digestibility of dry matter, organic matter (OM), and crude fiber (CF) increased significantly (p < 0.05) with MLM inclusion, while the digestibility of crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) reduced significantly (p < 0.05) with MLM addition. Dietary supplementation with MLM significantly affected (p < 0.001) rumen fermentation by reducing ruminal enzymes, ruminal ammonia-N, total protozoa, and acetate/propionate ratio and increasing acetic, propionic, and butyric acids and total volatile fatty acid concentrations (p < 0.001). Furthermore, dietary inclusion of 15% MLM significantly improved (p < 0.001) final body weight, dry matter intake of feed, daily weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, blood metabolites, and plasma insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I). It can be concluded that MLM is a multi-purpose protein supplement that provides some nutritional and therapeutic advantages when replacing 50% of soybean meal. Dietary supplementation of 15% MLM improved rumen fermentation, growth performance, blood metabolites, plasma IGF-I and mitigated ammonia and methane without any adverse effects in growing buffalo calves.

AB  - Conservation genetics pinpoint the use of biological materials collected without stressing wildlife and antlers seem to fit with this need. In the State Nature Reserve "Bosco della Mesola", Northern Italy, occurs the only native red deer population of peninsular Italy, recently recognized as a distinct subspecies (Cervus elaphus italicus) and characterized by peculiar phenotype. We tested the applicability of a simple and inexpensive biomolecular protocol to obtain information for the conservation of endangered deer with no stress for animals. DNA obtained by drilling both well preserved and highly degraded antlers was amplified with three types of molecular markers to get comprehensive information at individual, population and species level. Our results pointed out that only the seal yielded amplifiable DNA. The study attested that weathered antlers can be a suitable source of DNA not only in dry but also in Mediterranean climates, characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations. Antlers are an efficient and cost-effective non-invasive sampling for molecular genetic studies on rare or threatened species of cervids. We tested and provided easy to use and cheap laboratory protocols implementing all the previous knowledge.

AB  - Simple Summary We investigated the behavioral responses of five African ungulates to cheetah reintroduction in a semi-arid system affected by bush encroachment. Visitation rates, duration of stay, and activity patterns of ungulates at waterholes were compared with and without cheetah presence. During cheetah presence, visits to waterholes were rare for medium-sized species, but frequent for large-sized species, and visits were longer for small- and large-sized ungulates, possibly indicating increased vigilance. No differences in daily or seasonal activity at waterholes were found, which may be due to permanent and therefore predictable water availability. Further research into long-term behavioral consequences of trophic rewilding is recommended to maximize the success of recovery programs and minimize negative effects. The restoration of ecosystems through trophic rewilding has become increasingly common worldwide, but the effects on predator-prey and ecosystem dynamics remain poorly understood. For example, predation pressure may impose spatiotemporal behavioural adjustments in prey individuals, affecting herbivory and predation success, and therefore potentially impinging on the long-term success of trophic rewilding through apex predator reintroduction. Predation risk might have detrimental effects on prey through displacement from water or other vital resources. We investigated how five species of African ungulates responded behaviourally to changes in predation risk, following cheetah releases in the system. We grouped ungulates by body size to represent preferred prey weight ranges of the cheetah and examined changes in visitation rates, duration of stay, and activity patterns at waterholes with and without cheetah presence. During cheetah presence, visitation rates of ungulates were low for medium-sized species but high for large-sized species, suggesting that the species within the cheetah's preferred prey weight range adjusted behaviourally to minimize waterhole visits. Visits to waterholes were longer for small- and large-sized ungulates with cheetah presence, possibly indicating increased vigilance, or a strategy to maximize water intake per visit while minimizing visits. We did not detect significant differences in circadian or seasonal activity in waterhole visits, which may be attributable to the need of ungulates to access water year-round in our semi-arid study system and where migration was impeded due to physical barriers (fencing). We recommend further research into the long-term behavioural consequences of trophic rewilding on prey populations and trophic cascades to assist the success of recovery programs and to minimize potential detrimental effects at target sites.

AB  - The proportion of acidic purple soils has increased. Consequently, an effective method for amelioration of acidic purple soils is urgently needed. A 40 day incubation experiment using apple tree biochar, fermented sheep manure and chicken manure was conducted to assess the effects of organic materials on the acidity and fertility of acidic purple soil. The results showed that application of organic materials increased soil pH and decreased soil-exchangeable acidity. All of the treatments increased soil-exchangeable and water-soluble base cations after incubation. Specifically, biochar increased soil pH and reduced exchangeable acidity more than the other two fermented manures, because biochar was rich in carbonates and other alkaline substances. The concentration of soil available K was significantly higher under biochar than manure addition, while the opposite was true for soil available P and N, with a higher increase in soil available P in the manure treatments. By evaluating the soil fertility using a fuzzy comprehensive method, it was found that the fermented livestock manure enhanced soil fertility more strongly than biochar. Considering the effectiveness of soil amendments and production cost, applying a large amount of fermented organic fertilizer is an effective approach to the amelioration of acidified purple soil.

AB  - The stocky skeletons and post-cranial anatomy of many extinct kangaroos indicate that they might have engaged in varied locomotor behaviors, rather than bipedal hopping, as their primary mode of locomotion. This study investigates support for this idea by estimating femoral bone perfusion, which is a correlate of locomotor intensity, in extinct kangaroos compared to living hopping species. Femur blood flow rates can be estimated from the sizes of nutrient foramina on the femur shaft of living and extinct species, without preservation of soft tissue. Estimated femur blood flow rates among the extinct Macropus, Protemnodon and Sthenurinae (Sthenurus, Simosthenurus and Procoptodon) are not significantly different from one another but are significantly greater than in living hopping macropods after accounting for the effect of body mass, consistent with their purportedly different locomotor style. The giant sthenurines have more robust femora than extrapolated from data of living hopping macropods, possibly due to the larger sthenurines requiring relatively stronger leg bones to support their heavier body weights, especially if loaded onto a single limb during bipedal striding.

AB  - This study aims to analyse the effect of selected variation factors on the ejaculate characteristics of boars and to characterise changes in ejaculate characteristics in Landrace, Large White, Duroc, and Pietrain boars during their use for artificial insemination. The original value of this work lies in the estimation of the percentage share of individual components of variability in shaping the traits of boar ejaculate. A total of 943 ejaculates collected from 77 boars used for artificial insemination were analysed. This study began when the boars were at 8-9 months old. Ejaculates were collected in nine consecutive months from the start of the boars' use. Immediately after collection, they were analysed for ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, percentage of sperm with progressive motility, total number of spermatozoa, and number of insemination doses per ejaculate. The results were analysed according to three criteria: breed of boar (Landrace, Large White, Duroc, and Pietrain), age of boar (up to 10 months, 11-13 months, 14-17 months, and more than 17 months), and season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). The analysis of the variation in ejaculate characteristics took into account the share of each factor (boar breed, boar age, and season) in the variation, as well as the interactions between factors. The effects of the three factors and interactions between them were calculated using an ANOVA (analysis of variance). The variation was shown to depend mainly on the breed and age. These two factors and the interaction between them determine about 80% of the variation in ejaculate characteristics. The season also has an effect, but its share in the influence of variation on ejaculate characteristics is relatively small. Ejaculates from Landrace boars are the most favourable for insemination, with a large volume, a relatively high sperm concentration, and the highest number of sperm. The highest number of insemination doses can be prepared from Landrace ejaculates-on average, 2.7-6.7 more doses than from the other breeds. Duroc boar ejaculates are most distinctive, with a very low volume but a very high sperm concentration and the highest sperm motility. The ejaculates of Pietrain boars showed the opposite pattern, with the largest volume but the lowest sperm concentration. The sexual development of young boars, expressed as an increase in ejaculation performance, progresses during their first year of insemination use.

AB  - Many social mammals form discrete social communities within larger populations. For nonterritorial, polygynous, size-dimorphic species, sex-and age-class differences in life-history requirements might mediate differences in social connectedness and transitions among communities. We conducted social network analysis and community detection with an extensive data set of 1081 individually identified wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, over 5 years to test predictions that adult males and young of both sexes show greater social connectedness (degree, closeness and betweenness centrality) and transition more often among social communities than adult females, which form stronger and more stable relationships. We also expected that young animals would be more socially connected than adults. Using both static and dynamic network clustering techniques, we detected four distinct mixed-sex social communities, which we termed 'super-communities' to differentiate this apex level of social organization from intermediate-level female-only communities. Most (similar to 70%) giraffes remained within their same super-community, and those (usually adult males) that visited a different super-community often returned to their original super-community. Males-both adults and calves-had higher social centrality scores than females, and adult males were closer to all other individuals in the network and transitioned among super-communities twice as often as females and calves, reflecting their roaming reproductive strategy of seeking females in oestrus. Of all age and sex classes, young males had the most social ties and highest betweenness (moved most often among groups), which we attributed to social exploration prior to natal dispersal. Overall, female giraffes have stronger social associations than males, but males exceed females in measures of social connectedness, reflecting differences in reproductive and life-history profiles. Our findings suggest that giraffe translocations that do not consider sociality are likely to break up established social associations and potentially reduce fitness.

AB  - Omega -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (co3-PUFA) are central to the growth and reproduction of aquatic consumers. Dissolved nutrients in aquatic ecosystems strongly affect algal taxonomic composition and thus the production and transfer of specific co3-PUFA to consumers at higher trophic levels. However, most studies were conducted in nutrient -poor, oligotrophic lakes, leading to an insufficient understanding of how water nutrients affect algal co3-PUFA and their trophic transfer in consumers in highly eutrophic lakes. We conducted a field investigation in a highly eutrophic lake and collected basal food sources (phytoplankton, periphyton and macrophytes) and aquatic consumers (invertebrates, zooplankton and fish), and measured their fatty acid (FA) composition. Our results showed that periphyton and phytoplankton were both important sources of co3-PUFA supporting the highly eutrophic lake food web. High water nutrient levels led to low co3-PUFA levels in phytoplankton and periphyton, resulting in decreased nutritional quality. Consequently, 0)3-PUFA of invertebrates and zooplankton reflected variations in 0)3-PUFA of phytoplankton and periphyton, respectively. The 0)3-PUFA levels of fish decreased as phytoplankton and periphyton 0)3-PUFA decreased. Among fish, the Redfin Culter ( Cultrichthys erythropterus ) and Bar Cheek Goby ( Rhinogobius giurinus ) exhibited significantly higher levels of EPA and DHA compared to the Pond Loach ( Misgurnus anguillicaudatus ), which may have been caused by their different feeding modes. Decreases in the 0)3-PUFA levels of basal food sources may be one of the causes leading to the reduction of trophic links in aquatic food webs. Our study elucidated the sources and fate of 0)3-PUFA in highly eutrophic lakes, complemented previous studies in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes, and emphasized the role of high -quality food sources. Our results offer new perspectives for the conservation and management of highly eutrophic lake ecosystems.

AB  - The Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is an herbivorous fish that has been stocked throughout the United States for aquatic plant control, commonly to manage hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata. Triploid Grass Carp were purported to have a mean life span of about 11 years based on otolith-assigned ages and mortality estimates for fish associated with large stocking efforts through which aquatic plants were eliminated. Recent studies in aquatic systems where preferred foods were not eliminated have found that Grass Carp may live up to 30 years or more, but information about growth and mortality is lacking. About 130,000 Grass Carp have been stocked since 1995 to manage hydrilla in combination with fluridone application in Lake Gaston, Virginia-North Carolina, USA. Hydrilla coverage peaked at about 1,300 ha in 2003 and was reduced to about 130 ha by 2014. Since 2006, a total of 419 Grass Carp have been collected for age and growth analysis. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate von Bertalanffy growth function parameters that incorporated the effects of a linear trend in year, hydrilla abundance, or Grass Carp density and to assess population changes. Fish that were stocked in 1995 persisted through 2017. Mean maximum length (L-infinity) of Grass Carp decreased by about 200 mm with an increasing number of Grass Carp per hectare of hydrilla, and fish reached maximum size earlier in life. Indirect mortality estimates derived from growth parameters increased with Grass Carp density. Because preferred food availability affects mortality rates, stocking numbers should vary accordingly to maximize the effectiveness of hydrilla control programs.

AB  - The nutrient use efficiency in integrated crop-livestock systems under system fertilization may be related to soil structural variations caused by grazing. These hypothetical cause-effect relationships are not known, which reflects a limited understanding of the underlying processes. This study evaluated the association between soil structural quality and system fertilization efficiency of phosphorus and potassium in an integrated crop-livestock system and a pure crop system. The treatments were two fertilization strategies (system fertilization and crop fertilization) in a factorial scheme with two production systems (an integrated crop-livestock system and a pure crop system) distributed in a randomized block design with four replicates. In the pure crop system, soybean was grown followed by Italian ryegrass as a non-grazed cover crop. In the integrated crop-livestock system, the ryegrass was grazed by sheep. In the crop fertilization strategy, phosphorus and potassium were applied at the soybean planting, and nitrogen in the ryegrass establishment. In the system fertilization strategy, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were applied during the establishment of ryegrass. Soil physical quality indices were calculated for the beginning, middle, and end of the pasture phase (2020) and at the soybean harvest (2021). Forage and soybean production were also evaluated. Based on the soil physical quality index, the soil's ability to perform its physical functions decreased from 94% under an integrated crop-livestock system to 89% under a pure crop system. The results indicated higher total forage production (36%) and soybean yield (13%) in the system fertilization strategy as compared to the crop fertilization strategy. Moreover, the integrated croplivestock system produced more forage (31%) and soybean grains (15%) than the pure crop system. The study provides the first evidence that higher structural quality of soils in an integrated crop-livestock system favors crop yields at all stages of production. However, the nutrient use efficiency in system fertilization is only partially explained by the soil's physical quality.

AB  - Though there is consent that poaching is an important driver of wildlife declines in many African forests, we lack a deeper understanding of the factors behind population patterns in Afrotropical landscapes to inform conservation management. We surveyed line transects in four Cameroonian sites of different protection status in 2013/2014, namely Korup National Park, Banyang Mbo Wildlife Reserve, one timber concession and a section of an unprotected agroforestry matrix, and used data from 2007 for trend assessment. We used GLMs to identify predictors for mammal distribution based on a set of variables. While species compositions showed complex trend patterns, it is noteworthy that chimpanzee and elephant abundances declined significantly in the Banyang Mbo Wildlife Reserve. Although landscape management type affected the distribution of most mammal species, anthropogenic or environmental variables were strong predictors. Chimpanzee, elephant and drill abundances were higher at a larger distance to settlements. Vegetation density positively affected a number of species, including chimpanzee and red colobus. Several species were more abundant in rough terrain, probably because of reduced poaching. Our results suggest that protected areas in Southwest Cameroon had a mitigating effect on wildlife declines, mainly due to their remoteness and habitat quality, rather than management interventions.
   Bien qu'il soit admis que le braconnage est un facteur important du declin de la faune dans de nombreuses forets africaines, nous n'avons pas une comprehension plus approfondie des facteurs a l'origine des modeles de population dans les paysages afro-tropicaux, afin d'informer la gestion de la conservation. Nous avons etudie des transects lineaires dans quatre sites camerounais de differents statuts de protection en 2013/2014, notamment le parc national de Korup, la reserve de faune de Banyang Mbo, une concession forestiere et une section d'une matrice agroforestiere non protegee, et nous avons utilise les donnees de 2007 pour evaluer les tendances. Nous avons utilise des GLM pour identifier les indicateurs de la distribution des mammiferes sur la base d'un ensemble de variables. Si la composition des especes presentait des tendances complexes, il convient de noter que l'abondance des chimpanzes et des elephants a diminue de maniere considerable dans la reserve de faune de Banyang Mbo. Bien que le type de gestion du paysage ait affecte la distribution de la plupart des especes de mammiferes, les variables anthropogeniques ou environnementales etaient des indicateurs importants. Les abondances de chimpanzes, d'elephants et de forets etaient plus elevees a une plus grande distance des habitations. La densite de la vegetation a eu un effet positif sur un certain nombre d'especes, notamment le chimpanze et le colobe rouge. Plusieurs especes etaient plus abondantes sur les terrains accidentes, probablement en raison du braconnage limite. Nos resultats suggerent que les zones protegees dans le sud-ouest du Cameroun ont eu un effet attenuant sur le declin de la faune, principalement en raison de leur eloignement et de la qualite de l'habitat, plutot que des interventions de gestion.

AB  - Plants have evolved a variety of defences to reduce losses to herbivores and pathogens. The benefits of these may, however, be modified by resistance evolution in antagonists, changes in antagonist fauna, context-dependent "costs of defence", and by interactions between antagonists. In Barbarea vulgaris (Brassicaceae), the so-called "G-type" produces triterpenoid saponins that deter important specialist insect herbivores, whereas the "P-type" produces other saponins and are not insect-resistant. In contrast, P-type plants are predominantly resistant to the biotroph pathogen Albugo sp., causing white blister rust, whilst most G-type plants are susceptible. In a field experiment with F-3 hybrids between G and P-plants, we tested whether the two resistances are functionally coupled, leads to less disease and herbivory and to better plant performance, and whether insect herbivores and the pathogen interact in their effects on plant performance. The Albugo and insect resistances varied continuously between the F-3 plants and mapped to different linkage groups, indicating independent mechanisms and evolution. Plants with high Albugo resistance produced more biomass and survived better than more susceptible plants. Albugo DNA was detected in surface-sterilized green siliques, indicating systemic and sometimes non-symptomatic infection. Plants with high insect resistance were slightly less damaged by herbivores, but did not grow or survive better than more susceptible plants. Interactions between Albugo and insect herbivores did not affect plant performance. In contrast to the Albugo resistance, which clearly benefited the plants, our results show that the saponin-based insect resistance did convey any benefit under the given conditions despite its deterrent effects in controlled experiments.

AB  - Sociality is also evolved in parthenogenetic herbivorous hemipteran aphids, encompassing species with complex life history traits and significant social diversity. Owing to their interesting biological characteristics comparing to other social insect groups, social aphids can be a good model for studying insect sociality. Here, we review the species, behavior, and trait diversity of social aphids, and present recent findings on environmental, physiological, and molecular regulations of caste differentiation and behavior in social aphids. We propose the unique value of social aphids in investigating the evolution and mechanisms of insect sociality as well as future research directions using the social aphid model, including social evolution, caste differentiation, behavioral polymorphism, morphological plasticity, physical mechanics, and interspecific interactions.

AB  - Litter size in pigs is affected by factors such as ovulation number, embryonic survival, and uterine environment conditions. Endometrial epithelial and stromal cells represent the first site of contact between the embryo and sows; therefore, dynamic changes in the growth and development of these cells are among the major factors affecting the intrauterine environment and implantation. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B (BMPR1B) is a receptor of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family that has been identified as a candidate gene for reproductive traits in pigs. In our previous study, we used whole-genome resequencing to identify BMPR1B as a candidate gene affecting sow litter size in Taihu pigs and revealed the transcriptional regulation of BMPR1B in the endometrium. However, the functional role of BMPR1B in the growth and development of the endometrium in pigs has not been comprehensively elucidated. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and immortalized Meishan pig endometrial cells, and systematically explored the biological function of BMPR1B using a cell model. BMPR1B promoted cell proliferation and migration of endometrial stromal cells but inhibited that of endometrial epithelial cells. Transcriptome sequencing revealed potential pathways through which BMPR1B influences the growth and development of endometrial cells, including vascular system development, gland morphology, cell migration and adhesion, and reproductive system development. Moreover, the outstanding uterine function of Meishan pigs from endometrial genomic aspects was performed elucidated through CUT&Tag experiments. Most biological processes, including reproductive system development, embryonic morphogenesis, and angiogenesis, were enriched by genes that were differentially bound by enhancer markers. These findings provide a valuable resource for future research on the mechanisms underlying the excellent uterine function in Meishan pigs.

AB  - Current conceptual metacommunity models predict that the consequences of local selective pressures on community structure increase with spatial isolation when species favored by local conditions also have higher dispersal rates. This appears to be the case of freshwater insects in the presence of fish. The introduction of predatory fish can produce trophic cascades in freshwater habitats because fish tend to prey upon intermediate predatory taxa, such as predatory insects, indirectly benefiting herbivores and detritivores. Similarly, spatial isolation can limit dispersal and colonization rates of predatory insects more strongly than of herbivores and detritivores, thus generating similar cascading effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that the effect of introduced predatory fish on insect community structure increases with spatial isolation by conducting a field experiment in artificial ponds that manipulated the presence/absence of fish (the redbreast tilapia) at three different distances from a source wetland. Our results showed that fish have direct negative effects on the abundance of predatory insects but probably have variable net effects on the abundance of herbivores and detritivores because the direct negative effects of predation by fish may offset indirect positive ones. Spatial isolation also resulted in indirect positive effects on the abundance of herbivores and detritivores but this effect was stronger in the absence rather than in the presence of fish so that insect communities diverged more strongly between fish and fishless ponds at higher spatial isolation. We argue that an important additional mechanism, ignored in our initial hypothesis, was that as spatial isolation increases fish predation pressure upon herbivores and detritivores increases due to the relative scarcity of predatory insects, thus dampening the positive effect that spatial isolation confers to lower trophic levels. Our results highlight the importance of considering interspecific variation in dispersal and multiple trophic levels to better understand the processes generating community and metacommunity patterns.

AB  - Most herbivorous insects are host-plant specialists that evolved detoxification mechanisms to overcome their host plant's toxins. In the evolutionary arms-races between Pieridae butterflies and Brassicaceae plants, some plant species have evolved another defence against the pierids: egg-killing. Underneath the eggs, leaves develop a so-called hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. Whether some butterflies have evolved oviposition strategies to counter-adapt against egg-killing remains to be studied. In this study, we assessed the oviposition site location of Pieridae butterflies on their natural host plants. We described the plant tissue on which we located the eggs of the most common Pieridae in the Netherlands: Gonepteryx rhamni, Anthocharis cardamines, Pieris rapae, P. napi, P. brassicae and P. mannii. Additionally, we assessed expression of HR-like cell death in response to the deposited butterfly eggs. We found that both A. cardamines and G. rhamni mainly oviposited on the floral stem and the branch, respectively, and oviposited on host plants from lineages not expected to kill pierid eggs. Accordingly, no HR-like cell death was seen. All Pieris eggs found were located on leaves of their host, the only tissue found to express HR-like cell death. Furthermore, each Pieris species was found to at least occasionally oviposit on Brassica nigra. This was the only plant species in this survey that expressed HR-like cell death in response to the eggs of P. rapae, P. napi and P. brassicae. Our observations demonstrate that HR-like cell death remains an effective defence strategy against these Pieris species and as such did not find evidence for the hypothesized counterstrategies. Surveying certain key species and disentangling the micro-evolution of oviposition strategies within a species would allow us to further investigate potential counter-adaptations that evolved against HR-like cell death. This study provides the basis for further investigation of potential counter-adaptations to egg-killing defences.
   We screened six Pieridae butterfly species that are commonly found in the Netherlands by documenting their host plant selection, oviposition sites and plant response to oviposition. In agreement with previous screenings in the greenhouse, egg deposition induces leaf necrosis only in certain lineages and tissues. Only Pieris species were vulnerable to egg-killing responses by some of their host plants. These findings suggest that egg-killing leaf necrosis might have evolved as a novel mechanism to combat specialist herbivores that are adapted to their host plants' toxins.image

AB  - Higher temperatures expected in a future warmer climate could adversely affect the growth and development of mosquitoes. This study investigated the effects of elevated temperatures on longevity, gonotrophic cycle length, biting rate, fecundity, and body size of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) eggs obtained from laboratory established colonies were reared under eight temperature regimes (25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, and 40 degrees C), and 80 +/- 10% RH. All adults were allowed to feed on a 10% sugar solution soaked in cotton wool; however, some mosquitoes were provided blood meal using guinea pig. Longevity was estimated for both blood-fed and non-blood-fed mosquitoes and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. One-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of temperature on gonotrophic cycle length, biting rate, and fecundity. Adult measurement data were log-transformed and analyzed using ordinary least square regression with robust standard errors. Increasing temperature significantly decreased the longevity of both blood-fed (Log-rank test; X-2(4) = 904.15, P < 0.001) and non-blood-fed (Log-rank test; X-2(4) = 1163.60, P < 0.001) mosquitoes. In addition, the fecundity of mosquitoes decreased significantly (ANOVA; F(2,57) = 3.46, P = 0.038) with an increase in temperature. Body size (beta = 0.14, 95% CI, 0.16, 0.12, P < 0.001) and proboscis length (beta = 0.13, 95% CI, 0.17, 0.09, P < 0.001) significantly decreased with increasing temperature from 25 to 34 degrees C. Increased temperatures expected in a future warmer climate could cause some unexpected effects on mosquitoes by directly influencing population dynamics and malaria transmission.

AB  - Greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from organic and mineral fertilizer application in agriculture contribute significantly to ecosystem eutrophication and global warming. To reduce ammonia emissions from slurry, acidification using sulfuric acid is one of the most effective practices, but the costs for machinery as well as requirements concerning environmental and labour safety are a challenge for small farms. For this reason, there is a rising interest in sustainable and cost-effective alternative slurry amendments, particularly bio-acidification and mineral amendments. Research on the subject has focused primarily on reducing ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions during slurry storage, leaving the impact on emissions following fertilizer application to soil-plant systems largely unexplored. Therefore, this study evaluates the effect of the three different slurry amendments cheese whey, sauerkraut juice, and leonardite on ammonia, nitric oxide, and greenhouse gas (methane, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide) emissions from soil-plant mesocosms. After slurry application, emissions were measured for nine days using an automated incubation system and mesocosms received 80 kg N ha-1 untreated slurry or a mixture of slurry and amendment. Amending slurry with cheese whey significantly reduced ammonia emissions by 91 % and nitrous oxide by 23 %. Sauerkraut juice significantly decreased ammonia emissions by 92 % but significantly increased nitrous oxide emissions compared to slurry treatment. Leonardite reduced ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions insignificantly. These findings suggest that bio-acidification of slurry using cheese whey or sauerkraut juice is the most effective method for reducing ammonia emissions following fertilizer application in soil-plant mesocosms. A large variability particularly of nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and ammonia emissions from soil cores receiving unamended fertilizer indicated the importance of field-scale experiments to further verify the findings at larger scales and at natural soil environmental conditions.

AB  - Slash walls are an effective forest management practice to prevent deer herbivory and promote forest regeneration following a timber harvest. However, the material cost, i.e. amount of wood material, needed for quality slash walls is unknown or at best based on highly uncertain empirical estimation. Quantifying how total and merchantable timber wood volume varies with width and height across slash walls will facilitate future planning and application of slash walls. In this study, we estimated wood volume per unit length (similar to 30.48 m) from total stem cross-sectional area in 40 randomly selected cut-through passages cut into 14 slash walls located at Cornell University's Arnot Teaching and Research Forest (ATRF) in south-central New York. Within each passage we used Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) to identify individual stems and obtain cross-sectional surface area. We found that TLS derived stem diameters were highly consistent with manual stem diameter measurements for 10 selected wall passages (N = 308, R-2 = 0.933, RMSE = 1.881 cm). However, TLS tends to underestimate total cross-sectional area due to omission of small stem cross-sections (diameter < 5.08 cm). Cross-sections of small stems often have a low number of total points even when point density is high, especially when they are not facing the scanner. They are also more vulnerable to occlusion (i.e., lack of points due to blocking by other stems). TLS-based wood volume estimates were similar across both short and tall slash walls in the study with an average volume of 21.34 m(3)/30 m for short slash walls and 21.50 m(3)/30 m for tall slash walls, corresponding to 16.9 t dry biomass /30 m and 17.0 t dry biomass /30 m respectively. The small difference in woody volume was due to tall slash walls achieving additional height mainly through non-compacted small diameter crown and brush tops that have little woody volume. Average merchantable (diameter > 15.24 cm) and non-merchantable (diameter < 15.24 cm) timber fraction was 68.75 % and 31.35 % for short slash walls and 65.04 % and 34.96 % for tall slash walls. We further assessed slash wall height and width using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) for eight other tall slash walls. We found TLS measurements are representative of whole slash wall height and width variability based on ALS measurements. Our results provide novel data and methodology to estimate the construction cost of slash walls which are critical for optimizing slash wall applications.

AB  - Plant defense elicitors (PDEs) are chemicals that stimulate plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores. Previous work shows that PDEs acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) and harpin alpha beta protein (harpin) can induce the pathogenesis-related gene PR-1 in plants and suppress herbivorous arthropods. In this study, we tested the potential for these PDEs to induce PR-1 in pear, Pyrus communis L. (Rosaceae) orchards and suppress pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola (Forster) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), and spider mites, Tetranychus spp. (Acari: Tetranychidae). In 2017, we compared densities of each pest on mature pear trees following a single application of either an ASM product (Actigard; Syngenta), a harpin product (Employ; Plant Health Care), or no PDE treatment in four commercial and two research center orchards. In 2018, we sampled pear psylla and used qPCR to assess PR-1 induction in pear leaf samples before and after PDE treatments at one commercial orchard. Neither PDE treatment showed evidence of pest suppression in either year, and no differences in PR-1 expression were detected. Potted greenhouse trees treated with ASM in 2019 showed higher PR-1 expression relative to untreated trees, verifying that our procedures can detect induction and suggesting that a single PDE application was sufficient to induce PR-1 in potted but not mature pear trees. We conclude that plant defense elicitors may contribute to pear pest suppression in some contexts, but effects are unlikely to be strong or consistent. Our results highlight the need for field experiments to advance plant defense elicitor knowledge towards effective field applications.

AB  - As a result of co-evolution between plants and herbivores, related plants often interact with similar herbivore communities. Variation in plant-herbivore interactions is determined by variation in underlying functional traits and by ecological and stochastic processes. Hence, typically, only a subset of possible interactions is realised on individual plants. We show that insect herbivore communities assembling on individual plants are structured by plant phylogeny among 12 species in two phylogenetic lineages of Brassicaceae. This community sorting to plant phylogeny was retained when splitting the community according to herbivore feeding guilds. Relative abundance of herbivores as well as the size of the community structured community dissimilarity among plant species. Importantly, the amount of intraspecific variation in realised plant-herbivore interactions is also phylogenetically structured. We argue that variability in realised interactions that are not directly structured by plant traits is ecologically relevant and must be considered in the evolution of plant defences.

AB  - In Finland, the distribution area of the taiga tick, Ixodes persulcatus (Schulze, 1930), is nested within a broader area of distribution of a congeneric species, the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Acari: Ixodidae). We assess whether distinct environmental adaptations or dispersal history provides a more parsimonious explanation for the differences in the distributions of the two common and medically important ixodids in Finland. We used an innovative spatially constrained randomization procedure to analyze whether crowdsourced occurrence data points of the two tick species had statistically different associations with any of the 28 environmental variables. Using points of presence in a region of species co-occurrence, we built Maxent models to examine whether environmental factors or dispersal history could explain the absence of I. persulcatus in a part of the range of I. ricinus in Finland. Five environmental variables-number of inhabitants, road length, elevation above sea level, proportion of barren bedrock and boulders, and proportion of unsorted glacial deposits-were significant at p <= .05, indicating greater between-species difference in original than in the randomized data. Of these variables, only the optimum value for unsorted glacial deposits was higher for I. persulcatus than for I. ricinus. Maxent models also predicted high relative habitat suitability (suitability >80%) for I. persulcatus south of its current, sharply bounded distribution range, suggesting that the species has not fulfilled its distribution potential in Finland. The two most common and medically relevant ixodids in Finland may colonize habitats with different environmental conditions. On the contrary, the recent establishment and ongoing dispersion of I. persulcatus in Fennoscandia rather than environmental conditions cause the southernmost distribution limit of the species in Finland.

AB  - Mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is a devastating forest insect pest that has killed millions of hectares of pines in western North America over the past two decades. Like other bark beetles, MPB vectors ophiostomatoid fungal species, some of which are pathogenic to host pine species. The phytopathogenicity of these fungal symbionts has sparked considerable debate regarding their role in facilitating MPB attack success. We tested the hypothesis that MPB ophiostomatoid fungal associates like Grosmannia clavigera (Robinson-Jeffrey and Davidson) Zipfel, de Beer and Wingfield contribute to overwhelming host defenses during MPB mass attack. We compared responses of mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) trees growing in natural stands that were mass attacked by MPB with those inoculated with G. clavigera by examining host defense hormones, secondary metabolites, and gene expression profiles. The jasmonate and ethylene signatures of necrotrophic pathogen-triggered response were identified in G. clavigera-inoculated trees, but only the jasmonate signature of a herbivore-triggered response was measured in MPB-attacked trees. Several G. clavigera-induced changes in pine phenolic metabolite profiles and phenolic biosynthesis gene expression patterns were absent in MPB-attacked pines. These findings indicate that ophiostomatoid fungi like G. clavigera are not a major factor in overwhelming host defenses during MPB mass attack. Instead, fungal pathogenicity likely is more important in aiding MPB colonization and development within the host tree. Phenolics appear to play a larger role in the host response to G. clavigera than to MPB, although phenolics may also influence MPB feeding and behavior. Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Simple Summary
   Studies in animal communication have shown that many species have individual distinct calls. These individual distinct vocalizations can play an important role in animal communication because they can carry important information about the age, sex, personality, or social role of the signaler. Although we have good knowledge regarding the importance of individual vocalization in social living mammals, it is less clear to what extent solitary living mammals possess individual distinct vocalizations. Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus) are solitary living forest dwellers that inhabit tropical habitats. We recorded the vocalizations of 14 adult Malayan tapirs (six females and eight males) living in seven European zoos to answer the question of whether Malayan tapirs possess individually distinct vocalizations. Apart from sex-related differences, we found significant differences in the harmonic calls of all subjects. Surprisingly, kinship had no influence on call similarity, whereas familiar animals exhibited significant higher similarity in their harmonic calls compared to unfamiliar or related subjects. The results support the view that solitary animals could have individual distinct calls, like highly social animals. These new insights in the acoustic communication of tapirs provide a solid base to use bioacoustics as conservation tools to protect this endangered species.

Although we have good knowledge regarding the importance of individual vocalization in social living mammals, it is less clear to what extent solitary living mammals possess individual distinct vocalizations. We recorded and analyzed the vocalizations of 14 captive adult Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus) (six females and eight males) to answer this question. We investigated whether familiarity or relatedness had an influence on call similarity. In addition to sex-related differences, we found significant differences between all subjects, comparable to the individual differences found in highly social living species. Surprisingly, kinship appeared to have no influence on call similarity, whereas familiar subjects exhibited significantly higher similarity in their harmonic calls compared to unfamiliar or related subjects. The results support the view that solitary animals could have individual distinct calls, like highly social animals. Therefore, it is likely that non-social factors, like low visibility, could have an influence on call individuality. The increasing knowledge of their behavior will help to protect this endangered species.

AB  - Direct fossil preservation of leaf damage, arthropod mouthparts, and vertebrate teeth has understandably led to a focus on oral processing of plant material when considering the evolution of herbivory in deep time. Here, nutrient stoichiometry is advocated as an important alternative constraint on the evolution of herbivory. Most life possesses C:N ratios of approximately 7:1, but uniquely among land plants, that ratio can be skewed to 1,000:1 in some tissues due to the abundance of cell wall structural polymers that lack nitrogen entirely. Since the superabundance of carbon is unevenly distributed between and within plant organs and tissues, avoidance is a viable strategy for herbivores, but availability is dependent on herbivore body size. Sub-millimeter herbivores can attack plants cell-by-cell, avoiding cell wall consumption entirely in favor of cell contents, thereby presenting little stoichiometric distinction between herbivory and consumption of animals, fungi, or unicellular life. Insect-sized herbivory at least allows avoidance of the most carbon-rich/nutrient-poor tissues within a plant organ. However, vertebrate sizes prevent such selectivity. The increasing challenges of nutrient stoichiometry with increasing herbivore body size are recapitulated through time in the fossil record. The first herbivores were microherbivores that can avoid cell wall consumption-present already with their first opportunity for fossil preservation in the Early Devonian. Tissue-specific consumption by insect herbivores followed in the Carboniferous. One hundred fifty million years would pass after the first microherbivory record before vertebrate herbivory would reach its modern prevalence.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) with liquid-stored semen is the most prevalent and efficient assisted reproduction technique in the modern pork industry. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component X (PDHX) was demonstrated to be associated with sperm metabolism and affected the boar sperm viability, motility, and fertility. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinases (PDKs) are the key metabolic enzymes that regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activity and also the conversion from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. In the present study, two PDK inhibitors, Dichloroacetate (DCA) and Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), were added to an extender and investigated to determine their regulatory roles in liquid-stored boar sperm at 17 degrees C. The results indicated that PDK1 and PDK3 were predominantly located at the head and flagella of the boar sperm. The addition of 2 mM DCA and 0.5 mM 4-PBA significantly enhanced the sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity (PMI), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and ATP content. In addition, DCA and 4-PBA exerted their effects by inhibiting PDK1 and PDK3, respectively. In conclusion, DCA and 4-PBA were found to regulate the boar sperm metabolic activities via PDK1 and PDK3. These both can improve the quality parameters of liquid-stored boar sperm, which will help to improve and optimize liquid-stored boar semen after their addition in the extender.

AB  - Quantifying trade-offs within populations is important in life-history theory. However, most studies focusing on life-history trade-offs focus on two traits and assume trade-offs to be static. Our work provides a framework for understanding covariation among multiple traits and how population density influences the traits. Using detailed individual-based data for Soay sheep, we find density strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and distribution of lifetime reproductive success (LRS). At low density, a trade-off between juvenile survival and growth structures life-history variation, whereas at equilibrium density, trade-off between reproduction and juvenile survival is the major structuring axes. Contrary to Lomnicki's prediction, we find that at high density, there is little variation in the LRS over the sizes (large juveniles and adults) that contribute to reproduction. Our results advance an understanding of dynamic nature of trade-offs offer insights into how high-density limits diversity of individual life histories and have implications for evolution via density-dependent selection.

AB  - Understanding how urbanisation and habitat fragmentation influence wildlife is critical for biodiversity conservation. Fragmentation and population isolation can reduce genetic diversity, yet few studies have assessed these genetic impacts in urbanised environments. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), widespread across eastern Australia, often inhabit landscapes shaped by urbanisation. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from scat and tissue samples, we compared genetic characteristics of kangaroo populations in urban and non-urban areas across three regions. We assessed the influence of habitat isolation on genetic diversity and relatedness at 18 study sites. Overall, urban populations did not show significantly lower genetic diversity than those in less developed areas (p > 0.05; Urban mean H-O = 0.196, Non-urban mean H-O = 0.188). However, populations fully isolated by roads, buildings, and fences exhibited reduced genetic diversity and increased inbreeding. Additionally, significant genetic differences were observed among regions. These findings suggest that while urbanisation alone may not always reduce genetic diversity, complete physical isolation poses greater risks to population genetic health. This study highlights how urban landscape features can shape the genetics of large terrestrial mammals and underscores the need for spatially informed urban planning and management strategies that maintain or restore habitat connectivity.

AB  - Purpose When optimizing at the slaughterhouse for low environmental impact of the products, the share of the animal that goes to human consumption, by-products, or waste can potentially be affected by the allocation method. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the results of environmental impact of Danish pork production due to the applied allocation methods at slaughterhouse level and evaluate the consequences of applying these different methods.
   Methods The present study followed a cradle-to-slaughterhouse gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The functional unit was 1 kg of pork for human consumption, and four impact categories were included in the study: global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, and resource use. The analysis was performed using four different allocation methods at the slaughterhouse level: (1) mass allocation, (2) economic allocation, (3) system expansion, and (4) biophysical allocation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted within some of the allocation methods, i.e., the effect of price fluctuations within the economic allocation method and the effect of using different avoided products to handle by- products from the slaughterhouse within the system expansion method.
   Results Depending on the allocation method applied at the slaughterhouse level, the carbon footprint of pork varies between 2.87 and 4.35 kg CO2- eq/kg edible meat product. The sensitivity analysis showed that the LCA results per kg edible meat product were stable when using economic allocation despite price fluctuations of the relative prices between edible products and inedible by-products. However, the different allocation methods react differently when the share of the animal used for human food increases. Increasing the share of the animal used for human consumption has the potential to lower the environmental impact per kg of edible meat product.
   Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of including the slaughterhouse stage to ensure a resource efficient management of the upstream environmental burdens generated from the production of the animal. Slaughterhouses can play a significant role in mitigating the environmental impacts of the pork production if a higher share of the animal is used for human consumption. In this regard, allocation methods slaughterhouse level should be incentivizing and able to capture these effects.

AB  - Mouth morphology plays a crucial role in determining the trophic ecology of fish and sometimes underpins important lineage diversification. Freshwater teleost fish species belonging to the genus Labeobarbus, commonly found in Africa, exhibit intra- and interspecific variation and differences in the lower jaw occurring within and between species, respectively. Different phenotypes include a curved U-shape ('rubberlips'), a straight lower jaw ('chiselmouth') and an intermediate morphology known as the smiling phenotype. In some cases, smiling originates from hybridisation between chiselmouth and rubberlips. However, the trophic relationships of different mouth morphologies in the Labeobarbus taxa are still not well understood, particularly in the Congo Basin. Understanding the trophic ecology of Labeobarbus can enhance understanding of adaptive processes in morphologically diverse lineages. This study aims to investigate how differences in mouth morphology among multiple Labeobarbus species in the Luhoho River (Upper Congo Basin) link with different trophic niche uses. We combined information from gut morphometry, gut contents and stable isotope analyses on 202 fish specimens representing six species across four tributaries of the Middle Luhoho. All approaches consistently revealed trophic niche partitioning between chiselmouth and rubberlip species, respectively, more herbivorous/detritivorous and more insectivorous on the omnivory spectrum. In addition, trophic differences were also found between species within each mouth phenotype. Interestingly, the trophic niche of the smiling phenotype differed strongly from those of other phenotypes at all sites except for L. paucisquamatus, for which the trophic niches overlapped in Tchinganda. The pattern of trophic niche of Labeobarbus suggests subtle strategies to partition feeding resources when they occur across a narrow hydrographic scale.

AB  - Once introduced in a new range, alien plants likely escape specialist natural enemies of their native range, but still have to cope with resident generalist enemies in the invaded habitats. Here we designed a suite of lab experiments to assess whether the generalist aphid pest Aphis fabae was able to feed, survive, reproduce and establish colonies on five vascular plant species invasive to Europe: Erigeron canadensis, Solidago canadensis, Galinsoga quadriradiata, Senecio inaequidens and Reynoutria japonica. We specifically monitored (1) aphids probing behavior using the Electrical Penetration Graph technique, (2) their short-term survival and fecundity rate in clip-cages, and (3) their ability to settle and establish colonies over a period of five weeks. Our results revealed a gradient in the suitability of invasive plants for A. fabae. Senecio inaequidens was the only species with immediate palatability, allowing reproduction and durable colonization. Galinsoga quadriradiata and R. japonica were not immediately palatable but did allow reproduction of the insect. Erigeron canadensis and S. canadensis both appeared as unsuitable hosts for A. fabae. Our results further supported the "Behavioural Constraint Hypothesis" and the high plasticity in generalist herbivore insects by demonstrating that the time needed for A. fabae to recognize G. quadriradiata as a suitable food source under lab conditions was very short. From an agronomical point of view, this study suggests that some alien plants could serve as reservoirs for crop pests, while others could act as lethal traps.

AB  - We collected nighttime behavioral data by observing a group of white-headed langurs (Trachy-pithecus leucocephalus), comprising 16 individuals in a limestone forest in Guangxi Chongzuo National Nature Reserve, China, from October 2016 to August 2017. We recorded various aspects of the langurs' nighttime behavior, including the duration of entering/leaving sleeping sites, the duration of remaining in sleeping sites, the duration and frequency of movement, and the number and size of sleeping clusters in sleeping sites. The primary aim was to investigate thermoregu-lation strategy in these primates at night. By applying thermoregulation hypotheses, we aimed to elucidate the underlying factors driving seasonal changes in white-headed langurs' nighttime behavior. All individuals spent 7.53 & PLUSMN; 1.16 min on entering sleeping sites, and spent 9.70 & PLUSMN; 3.05 min on leaving sleeping sites, which could be a response to predation risk. Movement throughout the night was observed in most individuals. Sleeping clusters were formed by white-headed langurs during the night, with larger clusters sizes occurring in the cold season (4.68 & PLUSMN; 0.69) compared with the hot season (3.59 & PLUSMN; 0.77). Additionally, langurs prolonged their stay in sleeping sites during the cold season (12.36 & PLUSMN; 0.63 h) compared with the hot season (11.20 & PLUSMN; 0.63 h), potentially as a thermoregulation strategy to combat low temperature. Our findings indicate that temperature, rainfall, day length and food availability influence the nighttime behavior of white-headed langurs, highlighting the importance of ecological variables in deter-mining primate nocturnal behavioral responses. The observed changes in white-headed langurs' nighttime behavior strongly support their inclination toward behavioral strategies that minimize thermoregulation costs in limestone forests.

AB  - The caterpillars of the Lepidoptera are important herbivores as most of them belong to serious agricultural and forestry pests. To adapt to their habitats and feeding host plants, the larvae utilize uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) to metabolize plant defensive compounds and insecticides. However, information on the UGT gene family in Achelura yunnanensis remains scarce. Here, we characterized the UGT genes through gene identification, phylogenic analyses, and comprehensive expression profiles regarding sexes, tissues, and stages. Transcriptome analyses led to the yields of 50 transcripts encoding UGTs in A. yunnanensis, representing a comparable gene number compared to those in other lepidopteran species. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a low amino acid identity of 28.23% among 31 full-length AyunUGTs, but some members shared relatively high conservation (>50% identities) with a phylogenetically clustered distribution. In addition, the majority of AyunUGTs possessed conserved residues involved in the catalysis and sugar-donor binding. Combining RNA sequencing and PCR approaches, a number of AyunUGTs were found to have the expression in chemosensory or detoxification tissues, possibly associated with the sensing of odorant molecules and the metabolism of toxic chemicals. More importantly, at least 27 AyunUGTs displayed detectable expression in reproductive tissues of both sexes. This study identifies candidate A. yunnanensis UGTs responsible for detoxification, olfaction, and reproduction, allowing us to address putative roles of UGTs in the adaptation of larvae to the habitats and feeding hosts.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of vermicompost on the biological and microbial properties of lettuce rhizosphere in an agricultural field in Samsun, Turkey. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomised design (CRD) and included four vermicompost dosages (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) and two application methods (with and without plants). Batavia lettuce was selected as the test plant due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions and nutrient deficiencies. The study evaluated the changes in organic matter (OM), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), carbon dioxide (CO2), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and catalase activity (CA) in the rhizosphere of lettuce plants treated with different vermicompost levels (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%). The findings showed that vermicompost application significantly increased chlorophyll content in lettuce plants, with the highest content observed in plants treated with V1 compared to the control. Different vermicompost concentrations also influenced chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll levels, with positive effects observed at lower concentrations than the control. Plant height and fresh weight were highest in plants treated with V2, indicating the positive impact of vermicompost on plant growth. Additionally, vermicompost application increased plant dry weight and improved soil properties such as pH, organic matter content, and microbial activity. The findings showed that vermicompost increased the rhizosphere's microbial biomass and metabolic activity, which can be beneficial for plant growth and disease suppression. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of organic amendments on soil properties and the microbial community in the rhizosphere, which can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. Overall, the results suggest that vermicompost can be used as an effective organic amendment for enhancing plant growth and improving soil properties in agricultural fields. Moreover, based on the data, it can be suggested that a dose between 1% and 2% vermicompost is beneficial for the overall growth of plants.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the effect of 40% inclusion of artichoke by-product silage (AB) in dairy goat diets on milk yield, composition and animal health status during a full lactation period compared to an isoenergetic and isoproteic mixed ration based on alfalfa hay and a cereal and legume mixture. Milk yield was not affected by the dietary treatments, and neither was body weight. AB treatment reduced whey protein (0.38 vs. 0.42%, p < 0.05) and milk urea concentrations (687 vs. 773 mg/L, respectively, p < 0.001), and did not affect total true protein (3.22 vs. 3.24% p > 0.05) or other macro-composition variables. AB treatment showed higher milk concentrations of Ca (p < 0.05), Mn (p < 0.01), Cu (p < 0.01) and Zn (p < 0.001) compared to the control group (C). Slight differences were observed in milk fatty acid profile without any negative effects (p > 0.05) on the blood cholesterol and glucose of goats. The AB group reduced blood urea due to its high dietary total phenol content. However, it had a positive effect on beta-hydroxybutyrate (p < 0.05) and nonesterified fatty acids (p > 0.05). It was concluded that 40% artichoke by-product inclusion in dairy goat feed for the whole lactation period (23 weeks) is a sustainable solution, reducing feeding cost by 12.5% per kg of dry matter, contributing to a better circular economy without any negative repercussions on the productivity and health of Murciano-Granadina dairy goats.

AB  - Sampling fecal droppings (scat) to genetically identify individual animals is an established method for monitoring mammal populations and could be highly useful for monitoring reptile populations. Whereas existing protocols for obtaining DNA from reptile scat focus on analyses of whole, fresh scat deposited during animal handling, the collection of scat naturally deposited by reptiles in situ, as required for non-invasive population monitoring, requires protocols to extract highly degraded DNA. Using surface swabs from such scats can reduce PCR inhibition and increase genotyping success. We report on three related but independently designed studies of DNA analyses from scat swabs of herbivorous reptiles under natural desert conditions: two free-ranging desert tortoise species (Agassiz's desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, California, US, and Morafka's desert tortoise, G. morafkai, Arizona, US) and the common chuckwalla (Sauromalus atar) (Arizona, US, and Sonora, MX). We analyzed samples from both tortoise species with the same set of 16 microsatellites and chuckwalla samples with four mtDNA markers; studies also varied in swab preservation medium and DNA extraction method. Microsatellite amplification success per sample, defined as >= 9 loci with amplification, was 15% for the study of Agassiz's desert tortoise and for the study of 42% Morafka's desert tortoise. For chuckwallas, we successfully amplified and sequenced 50% of samples. We recovered fragments up to 400 bp for tortoises and 980 bp for chuckwallas from scat swab samples. This study indicates that genotypes can successfully be obtained from swabs of scat from herbivorous reptiles collected in the field under natural environmental conditions and emphasizes that repeat amplifications are necessary for the genetic identification of individuals from non-invasive samples.

AB  - Simple Summary Eastern grey kangaroos, like most wildlife, are facing an increasingly uncertain future under rapid climate change. How individuals and populations cope with extreme climatic events will influence their capacity to adapt and persist. Here, we analyzed how drought impacted eastern grey kangaroo populations by focusing on their body condition, demography, activity rates at water points, and the likelihood of parasitic infections. We found that body condition was lower as environmental conditions became more extreme and that fewer males in the population were observed. The proportion of juveniles within the population increased as more favorable conditions returned. Kangaroos with poor body conditions were more likely to become hosts to ticks, while higher parasite egg burdens in scats occurred in autumn. Our study has shown that the impacts eastern grey kangaroos face during climatic events such as drought can be severe and may have long-term consequences. Extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods are expected to become more intense and severe under climate change, especially in the southern and eastern parts of Australia. We aimed to quantify the relationship between body condition scores (BCS), demography, activity rate, and parasitic infections of eastern grey kangaroos on a large conservation property under different climate extremes by employing camera traps established at artificial water points (AWPs). The survey period included a severe drought, broken by a significant flooding event. Climatic and environmental conditions were documented using remotely sensed indices of moisture availability and vegetation productivity. These conditions were found to affect all health and population parameters measured. BCS, juvenile proportions, and sex ratios were most correlated with 6-month lags in climatic conditions, while the activity rate of kangaroos at AWPs was most correlated with vegetation productivity. Ticks were mostly found on individuals with a poorer BCS, while the concentration of parasitic eggs in feces was higher in autumn than in spring. Our study offers a glimpse into some of the environmental drivers of eastern grey kangaroo populations and their health, information that may become increasingly important in today's climate. It further emphasizes the importance of this knowledge for wildlife conservation efforts appropriate to managing the impact of climate change alongside other threats.

AB  - Sequential drought and heat stress pose a growing threat to forest ecosystems in the context of climate change, yet systematic evaluation methods for woody plants remain limited. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive screening platform for identifying woody plant species tolerant to sequential drought and heat stress among 27 native species growing in Korea. A sequential stress protocol was applied: drought stress for 2 weeks, followed by high-temperature exposure at 45 degrees C. Physiological indicators, including relative water content (RWC) and electrolyte leakage index (ELI), were used for preliminary screening, supported by phenotypic observations, Evans blue staining for cell death, and DAB staining to assess oxidative stress and recovery ability. The results revealed clear differences among species. Chamaecyparis obtusa, Quercus glauca, and Q. myrsinaefolia exhibited strong tolerance, maintaining high RWC and low ELI values, while Albizia julibrissin was highly susceptible, showing severe membrane damage and low survival. DAB staining successfully distinguished tolerance levels based on oxidative recovery. Additional species such as Camellia sinensis, Q. acuta, Q. phillyraeoides, Q. salicina, and Ternstroemia japonica showed varied responses: Q. phillyraeoides demonstrated high tolerance, T. japonica showed moderate tolerance, and Q. salicina was relatively sensitive. The integrated screening system effectively differentiated tolerant species through multiscale analysis-physiological, cellular, and morphological-demonstrating its robustness and applicability. This study provides a practical and reproducible framework for evaluating sequential drought and heat stress in trees and offers valuable resources for urban forestry, reforestation, and climate-resilient species selection.

AB  - Insect feeding induces physiological and biochemical changes in host plants. Indeed, symptom severity often depends on insect density. Recently, the carrot psyllid, Bactericera trigonica, has negatively affected carrot production in Mediterranean countries. The present study was conducted to evaluate effects of psyllid nymphal density on photosynthetic pigments and biochemical parameters of carrot leaves. Also, changes to physico-chemical parameters of carrot juice in response to insect feeding were quantified. A significant decrease in leaf weight, total number of leaves, root weight, chlorophyll (a + b) and carotenoid content was recorded in response to elevated infestations of B. trigonica. A positive correlation was observed between psyllid feeding and proline, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of leaves. A significant increase of titratable acidity was also observed in carrot juice obtained from infested plants, while total soluble solids decreased as number of attacking insects increased. Results indicate that the stress response of carrot plants to psyllid infestation depended on nymphal density.

AB  - Documenting the host use of vector species is important for understanding the transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens. Biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae: Culicoides) are vectors of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) worldwide. However, relative to mosquitoes and many other vector groups, host associations of this group are poorly documented. In this study, we used PCR-based bloodmeal analysis to determine species-level host associations of 3,603 blood-engorged specimens belonging to 18 Culicoides species at 8 deer farms in Florida, USA. We used a binomial mixed model with a Bayesian framework to compare the effect of host composition on the feeding patterns of Culicoides spp. and employed the Morisita-Horn Index to investigate the similarity of host use between farms for Culicoides stellifer and Culicoides insignis. Results show that the estimated probability of Culicoides spp. feeding upon white-tailed deer depends on the availability of cattle or exotic game and demonstrates differences in host-feeding selection among species. Culicoides insignis had high host similarity across farms suggesting that its host-use patterns are somewhat conserved. Culicoides stellifer had lower host similarity across farms suggesting that it is a more opportunistic feeder. White-tailed deer are fed upon by many Culicoides species on deer farms in Florida, and while most Culicoides species feed on white-tailed deer, the ratio of white-tailed deer bloodmeals to other bloodmeals is likely influenced by host availability. Culicoides spp. taking a majority of their bloodmeals from farmed white-tailed deer should be assessed for their vector competence for EHDV and BTV.

AB  - Background Camellia oleifera (C.oleifera) is one of the most important wood oil species in the world. C.oleifera was propagated by nurse seedling grafting. Since the morphology of rootstocks has a significant impact on grafting efficiency and seedling quality, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanism of morphogenesis for cultivating high-quality and controllable rootstocks. However, the genomic resource for this species is relatively limited, which hinders us from fully understanding the molecular mechanisms of seed germination in C.oleifera. Results In this paper, using transcriptome sequencing, we measured the gene expression in the C.oleifera cotyledon in different stages of development and the global gene expression profiles. Approximately 45.4 gigabases (GB) of paired-end clean reads were assembled into 113,582 unigenes with an average length of 396 bp. Six public protein databases annotate 61.5% (68,217) of unigenes. We identified 11,391 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout different stages of germination. Enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in hormone signal transduction and starch sucrose metabolism pathways. The gravitropism regulator UNE10, the meristem regulators STM, KNAT1, PLT2, and root-specific transcription factor WOX11 all have higher gene expression levels in the CAM2 stage (seed soaking), which indicates that the cotyledon-regulated program for germination had initiated when the seeds were imbibition. Our data showed differentially reprogrammed to multiple hormone-related genes in cotyledons during C.oleifera seed germination. Conclusion Cotyledons play vital roles, both as the main nutrient provider and as one primary instructor for seed germination and seedling growth. Together, our study will significantly enrich the genomic resources of Camellia and help us understand the molecular mechanisms of the development in the seed germination and seedling growth of C.oleifera. It is helpful to culture standard and superior quality rootstock for C.oleifera breeding.

AB  - Fallback foods (FBF), categorized into staple and filler types, are suboptimal food sources chosen by animals in response to a scarcity of preferred food items during specific periods. Using lichens as FBF by Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) represents a distinctive ecological adaptation and evolutionary development within nonhuman primates. This study delves into the annual dietary choices of the species to address issues, elucidate the nutritional value, and understand the ecological significance of lichens for this primate species, which resides at the highest altitudes and experiences the coldest weather among global primates. The findings reveal that the lichens consumed by the monkeys serve as the staple FBF, with Bryoria spp. and Usnea longissima being the primary dietary species. The former is the preferred choice, providing higher digestible fiber (neutral detergent fiber) levels but lower tannin, fat, ADF, and energy levels. During the dry season, lichens dominate as the monkeys' primary food and nutritional resources. In the wet season, they act as a fundamental food selection rather than an ideal dietary choice, substituting nutrients from fruits, seeds, and leaves. Compared to other Asian colobine counterparts, this species exhibits the highest lichen consumption but the lowest proportions of leaves, flowers, and seeds. This study provides valuable evidence and information for developing or amending conservation strategies and guidelines for the dietary management of captive breeding of monkeys, one of the world's critically endangered primate species.

AB  - Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs) are somatic cells surrounding the oocyte that play an important role in oocyte growth, meiotic maturation, ovulation, and fertilization in mammals. Therefore, revealing the molecular mechanisms related to the development and function of CGCs is essential for further understanding the regulatory network in female reproduction. MSX2 belongs to the highly conserved msh homeobox gene family and plays diverse roles in different biological processes. This study cloned the coding sequence (CDS) of the yak MSX2 gene and detected the abundance and localization of MSX2 in the major female reproductive organs. The results indicated that the CDS of this gene included 747 base pairs and encoded 248 amino acids. The abundance of MSX2 mRNA was highly expressed in the luteal phase of the yak ovary during the estrous cycle, and MSX2 protein was widely expressed in different female reproductive organs, including the ovary, corpus luteum, uterus, and oviduct. Repressing MSX2 abundance in yak CGCs declined the cell viability and defective steroidogenesis. Several genes abundances related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and sterogenesis also changed after MSX2 knockdown. MSX2 overexpression had the opposite effect on cell viability in yak CGCs. These results reveal the specific mechanism by which MSX2 regulates the development and function of yak CGCs and give novel and valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in yak reproduction.

AB  - In 2020, nearly 400 elephants died within the Okavango Delta region in Botswana, creating the worst-ever elephant mass die-off event in history. This catastrophic event was widely blamed on toxic cyanobacterial blooms after lab results showed the presence of toxin-forming cyanobacteria in inland waters of the Delta. However, it did not explain why we saw this mass die-off of elephants in 2020 and not in previous years. We conducted a landscape-wide time-series analysis using freely available European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 and NASA's Landsat-8 satellite data. We used existing bio-optical models, Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index and Green Line Height, as proxies for chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin (cyanobacteria) concentrations. We found that 2020 was an exceptional year for cyanobacteria blooms in the Okavango Delta region compared to the past three years (2017-2019). Bloom phenology indicated that the cyanobacteria blooms initiated in SeptemberOctober 2019, experienced an exponential growth reaching peak in January-February 2020, and eventually senescing in June 2020. This being a notoriously data-scarce region of the world, we did not have any means to perform site-specific validation of the models. Although magnitude and timeline of the blooms coincided with the timeline of elephant death reports, our study do not confirm it to be the trigger. For the first time, we show the widespread nature of these blooms across the landscape, which may have increased the toxin exposure for elephants. We theorize that 2020 might have been the first year for such a mass die-off event, but it will certainly not be the last because warming trends under changing climate are creating increasingly suitable conditions for these blooms to be pervasive and ubiquitous. Through this preliminary study, we demonstrate the critical need for frequent and comprehensive monitoring of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the Delta to avoid another such event in the future.

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate the effect of the type of male castration (surgical vs. immunological) on the characteristics of Teruel dry-cured hams.
   Area of study: Teruel and Zaragoza (Spain).
   Material and methods: A total of 14 dry-cured hams from Duroc x (Landrace x Large White) male pigs intended for the Spanish Protected Designation of Origin 'Teruel ham' were used. Half of them belonged to surgical castrated males (SCM) and the other half to immunocastrated males (IM). Ham weight losses during processing, physical and chemical characteristics were analyzed.
   Main results: There were no differences (p>0.05) due to the type of castration in ham weight losses throughout processing, thickness of subcutaneous fat, marbling, maximum stress and intramuscular fatty acid profile. However, hams from IM presented lower (p<0.05) chroma than those from SCM. The type of castration had limited influence on chemical composition; only potassium nitrate and retinol contents were affected (p<0.05), being lower in IM than in SCM. For volatile compounds, IM showed lower (p<0.05) percentages of total alcohols and sulfur compounds and higher (p=0.012) proportion of total acids than SCM. All the hams had negligible androstenone content but IM presented higher (p<0.05) skatole and indole concentrations than SCM, being these levels low.
   Research highlights: The type of castration in male pigs seems to have scarce influence on the quality of Teruel drycured hams, and therefore, immunocastration could be considered as a possible alternative to surgical castration. Additional key words: barrow; immunological castration; processing losses; physical measurements; chemical composition; dry-cured ham.

AB  - Shared use of rangelands by livestock and wildlife can lead to disease transmission. To align agricultural livelihoods with wildlife conservation, a multipronged and interdisciplinary approach for disease management is needed, particularly in data-limited situations with migratory hosts. Migratory wildlife and livestock can range over vast areas, and opportunities for disease control interventions are limited. Predictive frameworks are needed which can allow for identification of potential sites and timings of interventions. We developed an iterative three-step framework to assess cross-species disease transmission risk between migrating wildlife and livestock in data-limited circumstances and across social-ecological scales. The framework first assesses risk of transmission for potentially important diseases for hosts in a multi-use landscape. Following this, it uses an epidemiological risk function to represent transmission-relevant contact patterns, using density and distribution of the host to map locations and periods of disease risk. Finally, it takes fine-scale data on livestock management and observed wildlife-livestock interactions to provide locally relevant insights on disease risk. We applied the framework to characterize disease transmission between livestock and saiga antelopes Saiga tatarica in Central Kazakhstan. At step 1, we identified peste-des-petits-ruminants as posing a high risk of transmission from livestock to saigas, foot-and-mouth disease as low risk, lumpy skin disease as unknown and pasteurellosis as uncertain risk. At step 2, we identified regions of high disease transmission risk at different times of year, indicating where disease management should be focussed. At step 3, we synthesized field surveys, government data and literature review to assess the role of livestock in the 2015 saiga mass mortality event from pasteurellosis, concluding that it was minimal. Synthesis and applications. Our iterative framework has wide applicability in assessing and predicting disease spill-over at management-relevant temporal and spatial scales in areas where livestock share space with migratory species. Our case study demonstrated the value of combining ecological and social information to inform management of targeted interventions to reduce disease risk, which can be used to plan disease surveillance and vaccination programmes.

AB  - The focus on the bioactive effects of plants concerns mainly ruminal microflora for the modulation of rumen fermentation with very little emphasis placed on their consequences on health parameters, including antioxidative and immune stimulating effects. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of supplementing phytogenic feed additives composed of a mixture of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) and poplar (Populus deltoides) leaf-meal (EPLM) on immune response, antioxidant status, metabolic profile, enteric methane production, growth performance, and nutrient utilization in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves. In vitro studies with graded doses of EPLM extract revealed a reduction in total gas and methane production with an increased proportion of propionate without affecting feed degradability. In the in vivo experimentation, eighteen female buffalo calves (10-14 months old, avg. body weight 131.68 +/- 7.50 kg) were divided into three groups (CONT, EPLM-1, and EPLM-2) of six each in a completely randomized design. Treatment groups were supplemented with a blend (1:1) of dry grounded eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) and poplar (Populus deltoids) leaves (50 g, EPLM-1; 150 g, EPLM-2). Feed intake and growth rate of buffalo calves fed on different feeding regimens did not differ (p > 0.05). Haemato-biochemical parameters reveal no variations (p > 0.05) among groups, irrespective of period of collection, except the concentration of blood urea, which was decreased (p < 0.05) in both treatment groups as compared to the control. The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased (p < 0.05) in EPLM supplemented animals as compared to CONT. The extent of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was reduced (p < 0.05) with increased level of EPLM in the diet. The total thiol group (T-SH) was also increased with the supplementation of leaves in the diet. The mean absolute values for skin thickness following the intra-dermal injection of PHA-P were increased (p < 0.05) in all the supplemented animals relative to CONT. However, there was no significant difference among the calves fed graded levels of these feed additives in the diet. The Ab titer against Pasteurella multocida vaccine was higher (p < 0.05) on both day 45 and 90 in both treatments, irrespective of the level of additive supplemented. The enteric methane production was reduced in EPLM supplemented buffaloes; however, digestibility of all the nutrients remained comparable (p > 0.05) among the animals. It may be concluded that blends of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) and poplar (Populus deltoides) leaf-meal (50 g/h/d) containing 3.19 g, 2.30 g, and 0.71 g of total phenolics, tannin phenolics, and condensed tannins, respectively, can be used as the phytogenic feed additive for improving antioxidant status and immunity of buffalo calves, and mitigating enteric methane production without affecting performance and nutrient utilization.

AB  - Proteins from insect production represent an interesting (environmentally friendly) option or supplement to commercial livestock farming. At present, however, the larval stages of T. molitor (mealworm) and A. diaperinus (buffalo worm) have been authorized as food for human consumption EU-wide, as have the nymph and adult stages of Locusta (L.) migratoria (Locusta migratoria, Linnaeus, 1758) and Acheta (A.) domesticus (house cricket, Acheta domesticus, Linnaeus, 1758). However, there is the problem that insects that are recognizable as a whole tend to be avoided by consumers, especially in the European region, as they are reminiscent of living things and can cause aversion and disgust in consumers. Against this background, in the present study, five batches of two types of cooked sausages were produced: on the one hand, with turkey, and on the other hand, with pork lean meat as a base. In different formulations, 10% and 20% of the meat contents (turkey or pork) in these meat products were replaced by deep-frozen, pulverized T. molitor and A. diaperinus larvae. The effects of the addition of these insects in the products on the microbiological and physicochemical parameters of these cooked sausages, compared to a product without insect content, directly after heating, were investigated. After production, a storage trial was also carried out to determine whether possible insect ingredients could influence the growth of inoculated bacterial species (Bacillus (B.) cereus, Escherichia (E.) coli, Listeria (L.) monocytogenes, and Campylobacter (C.) jejuni) and how the addition of insect larvae affectsthe sensory and physicochemical properties during storage. The study showed that the products with insects had reduced lightness (turkey p C = 0.025), increased yellowness (pork p S = 0.0009, p C < 0.0001 and turkey p C = 0.0027) and a reduced red color (pork p S < 0.0001, p C = 0.0001) after heating when compared to the cooked sausages without insects. However, no significant differences between the various cooked sausages with or without insects in terms of cooking loss, firmness, and protein, ash, and fat or water contents were found. The microbiological tests showed, on the one hand, that the prior microbial reduction (e.g., in the form of blanching) of the insect larvae was essential in order to guarantee the flawless microbiological quality of the cooked sausages and, on the other hand, that the addition of insects to the cooked sausages did not significantly affect the growth of the inoculated bacterial species and that no sensory differences could be detected during storage. Despite the significant color effects on the product, A. diaperinus and T. molitor larvae would be suitable as protein or meat alternatives in cooked sausages, but they would have to undergo pre-treatment, primarily with regard to microbiological safety. The extent to which a complete replacement of meat is possible has to be investigated in further studies.

AB  - Research on immune response in polar fauna is gaining great importance due to different scenarios of environmental change. Total leukocyte counts in blood smears are one of the most widespread practices and provide useful information about the health status of individuals. However, there is no methodological agreement for these analyses. Total leukocyte counts can be performed at x400 magnification in optical microscopy using 10,000 erythrocytes for standardizing. However, counting such number of erythrocytes is costly and time-consuming. Here, we describe a new technique to simplify leukocyte counts in blood smears from Antarctic wildlife based on the number of microscope fields instead of the number of erythrocytes which reduces considerably the time spent. We have counted total leukocytes using both methods in the three penguin species of the genus Pygoscelis-Adelie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus)-and four Antarctic mammal species: crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), and southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) for validation. Our results show a high correlation between the total leukocyte counts using 10,000 erythrocytes or 10 microscope fields for standardizing. These results show the reliability of the latter method for counting the total number of leukocytes in different species of birds and mammals saving time and effort.

AB  - Hunting can influence the abundance and distribution of animals and act as a source of conflict among recreational user groups. Thus, land managers benefit from tools that can generate information about when and where hunting occurs. We used passive acoustic monitoring to examine spatiotemporal patterns of hunting-related gunshots at 91 locations in a protected area in Alberta, Canada. We compared 2 methods for detecting gunshots from recordings: a recognizer that used complex pattern recognition and an energy detector that detected loud sounds regardless of their acoustic features. The recognizer primarily detected faint sounds, and multiple observers showed low levels of agreement (37%) with respect to whether sounds were gunshots or not, suggesting it produced ambiguous data. The recognizer also missed many loud, clear gunshots for unknown reasons. The energy detector, in contrast, detected loud sounds upon which observers showed near-unanimous agreement (99%) on their identity. Gunshots missed by the energy detector could be because they were too quiet (i.e., too far away to be detected). Thus, despite detecting fewer gunshots overall, the energy detector produced higher quality data that were easier to interpret. We analyzed 249 gunshots detected with the energy detector, and found that hunting was concentrated near vehicle access points and peaked on Saturdays, and that hunters largely abided by local regulations prohibiting Sunday hunting. We compared energy detector results with remote cameras, which revealed similar spatiotemporal patterns of hunting effort. Passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to allow hunting activity to be mapped and monitored with unprecedented resolution.

AB  - Hyalomma ticks are important vectors of pathogens affecting human and animal health. This study aimed to assess the outputs of three molecular markers (16S, 12S rRNA, and COI) for accurate tick species molecular identification, genetic diversity assessment, and phylogenetic positioning of Hyalomma tick specimens from Tunisia. A total of 20 tickspecimens were collected from different hosts including cattle, camels, and turtles in nine Tunisian governorates. Morphological diagnosis confirmed five Hyalomma species: H. scupense, H. marginatum, H. excavatum, H. aegyptium, and H. dromedarii. Molecular analysis confirmed species' identification and revealed varying levels of genetic diversity within each species. Within the H. scupense and H. aegyptium species, low genetic diversity was observed, with no variable sites detected in the 16 S and 12 S rRNA markers, except for a single site in H. aegyptium's COI marker. H. marginatum isolates showed moderate diversity, with no variable sites in the 16S and 12S rRNA markers, and four variable sites in the COI marker. In contrast, H. excavatum and H. dromedarii isolates exhibited higher diversity, with variable sites identified in all three markers (16S, 12S rRNA, and COI). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that, with the exception of H. scupense, the COI marker exhibited superior discriminatory power compared to the 16 S and 12 S rRNA markers. This enabled the discernment of distinct genetic clusters within each species. These findings underscore the importance of utilizing multiple molecular markers for confirming morphological diagnosis and specifically highlight the significance of the COI marker in assessing the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Hyalomma ticks. By employing these markers, particularly COI, valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics and epidemiological significance of Hyalomma ticks can be gained, facilitating targeted control measures against tick-borne diseases.

AB  - The rapidly developing technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) extends to the availability of aerial surveys for wildlife research and management. However, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight (VLOS) seriously affect the design of surveys, as flight paths must be concentrated within small sampling blocks. Such a design is inferior to spatially unrestricted randomized designs available if operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) are allowed. We used computer simulations to assess whether the VLOS rule affects the accuracy and precision of wildlife density estimates derived from drone collected data. We tested two alternative flight plans (VLOS vs. BVLOS) in simulated surveys of low-, medium- and high-density populations of a hypothetical ungulate species with three levels of effort (one to three repetitions). The population density was estimated using the ratio estimate and distance sampling method. The observed differences in the accuracy and precision of estimates from the VLOS and BVLOS surveys were relatively small and negligible. Only in the case of the low-density population (2 ind./100 ha) surveyed once was the VLOS design inferior to BVLOS, delivering biased and less precise estimates. These results show that while the VLOS regulations complicate survey logistics and interfere with random survey design, the quality of derived estimates does not have to be compromised. We advise testing alternative survey variants with the aid of computer simulations to achieve reliable estimates while minimizing survey costs.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) plays critical roles in oocyte maturation and embryonic development; however, the specific pathway by which FGF10 promotes in vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes remains elusive. The present study was aimed at investigating the mechanism underlying effects of the FGF10-mediated extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway on oocyte maturation and embryonic development in vitro. MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126, alone or in combination with FGF10, was added to the maturation culture medium during maturation of the cumulus oocyte complex. Morphological observations, orcein staining, apoptosis detection, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to evaluate oocyte maturation, embryonic development, and gene expression. U0126 affected oocyte maturation and embryonic development in vitro by substantially reducing the nuclear maturation of oocytes and expansion of the cumulus while increasing the apoptosis of cumulus cells. However, it did not have a considerable effect on glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that blocking the MEK/ERK pathway is detrimental to the maturation and embryonic development potential of buffalo oocytes. Overall, FGF10 may regulate the nuclear maturation of oocytes and cumulus cell expansion and apoptosis but not glucose metabolism through the MEK/ERK pathway. Our findings indicate that FGF10 regulates resumption of meiosis and expansion and survival of cumulus cells via MEK/ERK signaling during in vitro maturation of buffalo cumulus oocyte complexes. Elucidation of the mechanism of action of FGF10 and insights into oocyte maturation should advance buffalo breeding. Further studies should examine whether enhancement of MEK/ERK signaling improves embryonic development in buffalo.

AB  - The Pacific seahorse (Hippocampus ingens) is a teleost fish native to the Pacific Ocean. In Mexico they are protected by national legislation; however, there are no studies regarding their commercial use or population status. From a conservation perspective they are a threatened fish and from a socio-economic aspect they represent a source of income for many fishing communities. The integration of these two points of view requires, among other things, the recognition that fishers have knowledge and skills that can help implement conservation strategies and management plans for seahorses and their habitats. The objective was to document the knowledge of fishers from Sinaloa about the fishing status and current commercialization of wild populations of H. ingens. For this, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation were carried out with 112 participants in the two main ports of the state of Sinaloa (Mazatlan and Topolobampo) from July to August 2021. The data obtained were coded and then, through content analysis, systematized results were obtained that allowed a qualitative and quantitative analysis. The species was found to be caught using six different fishing gears (catch per unit effort, CPUE = 0.07-1.24 seahorses per boat per day) and have an important financial value. Most fishers catch seahorses incidentally, but three of them mentioned targeting them directly. Fishers perceive a decrease in catches and in the size of the Pacific seahorse, as well as an increase in prices. The information analysed indicates that seahorse populations in Sinaloa are exploited and have economic value, despite current regulations. This study shows that the exploitation of seahorses in Sinaloa is unsustainable and requires the implemention of collaborative management strategies (e.g. stakeholder management, the establishment of marine protected areas, sustainable harvest practices, community-based enforcement efforts, educational campaigns, research, and conservation partnerships) that fully take into account the knowledge and practice of local fishers of Sinaloa and Mexico.

AB  - Sambi ND, Limbongan Y, Pata'dungan AM. 2023. Effect of dolomite and pig manure on growth and production of carrots (Daucus carota). Nusantara Bioscience 14: 22-29. This study aims to see how dolomite and pig manure affect carrot (Daucus carota L.) plant development and taproot production. The research was conducted from May to August 2021 in the Padangiring Village, Rantetayo Sub-district, Tana Toraja District, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Three levels of dolomite in combination with four levels of pig manure were used: control (no treatment), and dolomite at 3 tons/ha, 6 tons/ha, and pig manure at control (no treatment), and 20 tons/ha, 30 tons/ha, and 40 tons/ha. The optimal dolomite level of 3 tons/ha significantly influenced plant height, the number of leaves, taproot length, and taproot diameter but had no significant effect on individual taproot weight, plot taproot weight, or taproot weight per hectare. The optimal pig manure dose of 4 kg/plot (40 tons/ha) showed a substantial influence on all investigated variables. The interaction between dolomite and pig manure substantially influenced taproot length but had no effect on the other observable variables. The optimum treatment combination was 3 tons/ha of dolomite with 40 tons/ha of pig manure, yielding 38.67 tons/ha of carrot taproots. Thus, commercial carrot growth and production may be boosted by a combination of dolomite and pig manure.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) losses from livestock slurry stores substantially contribute to agricultural emissions to the atmosphere. Gas release from slurry storage facilities is driven by interactions between store operations and meteorological conditions. This study quantifies the abating effect of an impermeable semifloating cover as an emission mitigation technique at a farm-scale slurry storage tank. Emissions were measured over 1 yr and compared with the preceding 2 yr of measurements with the uncovered tank. In this novel approach, emission data were aggregated to categories within 1 h measuring intervals according to five key factors influencing emissions (time span after agitation and tank-filling level as surrogates for natural crust occurrence; the meteorological parameters precipitation, air temperature, and wind speed) for the two consecutive measurement campaigns with and without the cover. The emission abatement effect of the cover was determined by emission modeling of the entire measuring campaign based on measuring intervals of the uncovered and the covered tank where the aggregated categories of influencing factors were equal. The resulting average emission abatement was 48%. An average abatement of 37 and 54% was achieved during periods with and without a surface crust, respectively. The emission reduction was less with low tank filling level due to higher air exchange through openings of the cover. The presented approach is applicable to evaluate emission mitigation techniques for single farm-scale stores. With adequate measurement duration, it is appropriate to produce reliable emission data reflecting the complex interactions between emissions and influencing factors occurring at real-world storage facilities.

AB  - The application of animal manure contributes greatly to improving soil fertility and maintaining/increasing wheat yield; however, it is rarely used in China's wheat production. This distortion emphasizes the importance of comprehensive analysis of manure use from theoretical and practical perspectives. A meta-analysis on China's wheat production was therefore conducted to quantify the effects of animal manure applications (SNM: substituting chemical N fertilizer by manure under the same total N input; AMCF: additional manure based on the same chemical fertilizer) on wheat productivity, environmental costs, and economic profits, and a large-scale farmer survey was performed to explore the reasons for the low manure-use rate. Overall, soil organic carbon (SOC) content in SNM and AMCF increased by 21% and 32%, respectively, relative to using chemical fertilizer alone (control). For SNM, yield increased by 5-8% when chemical N fertilizer was substituted with manure at < 15% and 15-30%. For AMCF, yield increased by 14% with a 69% increase in total N input. NH3 volatilization and NO3 residual at wheat harvest in SNM reduced by 24% and 21%, respectively, but N2O emissions and estimated GHG emissions increased by 41% and 14%, respectively. NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, NO3- residue, and estimated GHG emissions in AMCF increased by 12-50%. There was no impact to net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) when using pig manure and chicken manure, while the NEEB associated with SNM and AMCF reduced by 13-74% when using cow manure and commercial manure. Although applying manure has the capability to increase SOC and yield, only 1% of N comes from manure in wheat production, which mainly results from low economic profits. Policies and investment incentives that increase economic profits and minimize environmental costs will be crucial to facilitating the widespread use of manure.

AB  - Drought alters plant traits in ways that affect herbivore performance. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the plant-derived mechanisms that mediate insect responses to drought. Water stress occurs along gradients of intensity, and the impacts of drought intensity on plant-insect interactions is understudied. Here, we assessed aphid performance on wheat plants exposed to a gradient of water stress and measured plant nutrients and phytohormones that may mediate aphid response to drought. We show that water stress reduced aphid performance, and the negative effect grew stronger as the magnitude of water stress increased. The plant response to water limitation was not consistent across the stress gradient and was reliant on the trait measured. Water limitation did not affect whole-plant nitrogen; however, water limitation did reduce amino acid concentration and increase sugars, but only under high stress intensity. The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA), and the expression of their associated gene transcripts, were also differentially affected by water stress intensity. In well-watered conditions, aphid feeding increased concentrations of the defense-related hormones SA and JA over time; however, any amount of water limitation prevented aphid induction of JA. Although aphids may experience a reprieve from JA-related defenses in stressed conditions, SA levels remain high in response to aphid feeding, indicating aphids are still vulnerable to SA-related defenses. Any level of water stress also increased the expression of a callose-associated gene transcript, a physical defense that impairs feeding. Thus, poor aphid performance on mildly-stressed plants was correlated with increased plant defenses, whereas poor performance on highly-stressed plants was correlated with stronger plant defense induction and reduced plant nutritional quality. Understanding the mechanisms driving aphid and plant performance under water stress conditions can improve our ability to predict how aphid populations will respond to climate change.

AB  - The hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) form a cognitive map that facilitates spatial navigation. As part of this map, MEC grid cells fire in a repeating hexagonal pattern across an environment. This grid pattern relies on inputs from the medial septum (MS). The MS, and specifically GABAergic neurons, are essential for theta rhythm oscillations in the entorhinal-hippocampal network; however, the role of this population in grid cell function is unclear. To investigate this, we use optogenetics to inhibit MS-GABAergic neurons and observe that MS-GABAergic inhibition disrupts grid cell spatial periodicity. Grid cell spatial periodicity is disrupted during both optogenetic inhibition periods and short inter-stimulus intervals. In contrast, longer inter-stimulus intervals allow for the recovery of grid cell spatial firing. In addition, grid cell phase precession is also disrupted. These findings highlight the critical role of MS-GABAergic neurons in maintaining grid cell spatial and temporal coding in the MEC.

AB  - Simple Summary The history of the Romanov breed goes back more than a century, with the first mention being made in 1802. This breed has unique qualities, such as a good resistance to harsh environments, high litter size, polyestrousity, early maturation and excellent fur coat qualities. In this work, we highlighted several genetic markers involved in these characteristics. The high ovulation rate of the Romanov breed is probably linked to the polymorphism recorded in two genes located on different chromosomes. The breed's adaptation to the harsh environment of its breeding area in the Russian Federation could be associated to a high level of heterozygosity. In addition, the dilemma of its obscure origin was also addressed by comparison with other Russian breeds of different productive orientations. The Romanov breed was evaluated using immunological and genetic markers. The seven blood group systems were characterized with a greater accuracy than in previous works on sheep in the Russian Federation, and were compared to eight ruminant species. Unlike other breeds, Romanov sheep shows a higher frequency of HBA than HBB alleles. There are 3-4 genotypes at the transferrin locus whereas in other breeds 6-11 genotypes have been found. At the albumin locus, the majority of the identified genotypes were heterozygotes, unlike in the other breeds studied. In the prealbumin locus, the Romanov breed was the only one where all the genotypes were heterozygous. We speculate that polymorphism at two loci (BMP-15 and BMPR1B) could effect on the high ovulation rates of Romanov sheep. Based on different genetic markers, the prevalence of heterozygotes in the Romanov sheep could determine their higher viability. A cluster analysis showed the close proximity of 12 populations of the Romanov breed, as the breeding stock come from the Yaroslavl region.

AB  - Even though seagrasses are clonal plants, they also invest substantial energy in sexual reproduction. However, little is known about the development of the reproductive structures of seagrasses and their complex interactions with ambient conditions. Here, we describe the structural and physiological changes during development in the fruit pericarp of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum, and their possible role in defense mechanisms. The fruit exocarp develops protuberances with a monostratified epidermis. The parenchyma below the exocarp epidermis, consists of chlorenchyma with abundant chloroplasts and cells that, in the early stages of development of the fruit, accumulate proanthocyanins and other diverse phenolic compounds, in the course of development, vary in quantity and solubility. During the intermediate and late stages of development, when the fruit emerges above the sediment, idioblasts with oxalate crystals are formed. Changes during the fruit development in morphology, phenolic compounds and oxalate crystal deposits, may be related to various metabolic processes to maintain homeostasis, such as downregulation of photosynthetic ROS. At the same time, these changes may also provide defense mechanisms against herbivores. Parrotfish appear undeterred by phenolic compounds in the exocarp of young manually exposed fruits; but they do not consume the pericarp of mature fruits (naturally emerged above the sediments) with oxalate crystals. These findings suggest that timing and integration of morphological and metabolic changes during fruit development guarantee both successful development and protection of the seeds.

AB  - Recovery of biobased fertilizers derived from manure to replace synthetic fertilizers is considered a key strategy to close the nutrients loop for a more sustainable agricultural system. This study evaluated the nitrogen (N) fertilizer value of five biobased fertilizers [i.e., raw pig manure (PM), digestate (DIG), the liquid fraction of digestate (LFD), evaporator concentrate (EVA) and ammonia water (AW)] recovered from an integrated anaerobic digestion-centrifugation-evaporation process. The shoot and root growth of maize (Zea mays L.) under biobased fertilization was compared with the application of synthetic mineral N fertilizer, i.e., calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN). The non-invasive technologies, i.e., minirhizotron and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based spectrum sensing, were integrated with the classic plant and soil sampling to enhance the in-season monitoring of the crop and soil status. Results showed no significant difference in the canopy status, biomass yield or crop N uptake under biobased fertilization as compared to CAN, except a lower crop N uptake in DIG treatment. The total root length detected by minirhizotron revealed a higher early-stage N availability at the rooting zone under biobased fertilization as compared to CAN, probably due to the liquid form of N supplied by biobased fertilizers showing higher mobility in soil under dry conditions than the solid form of CAN. Given a high soil N supply (averagely 70-232 kg ha(-1)) in the latter growing season of this study, the higher N availability in the early growing season seemed to promote a luxury N uptake in maize plants, resulting in significantly (p < 0.05) higher N concentrations in the harvested biomass of PM, LFD and AW than that in the no-N fertilized control. Therefore, the biobased fertilizers, i.e., PM, LFD, EVA and AW have a high potential as substitutes for synthetic mineral N fertilizers, with additional value in providing easier accessible N for crops during dry seasons, especially under global warming which is supposed to cause more frequent drought all over the world.

AB  - Fish scales absorb different elements into the calcified matrix from surrounding waters as well as from the foods consumed. Scales microchemistry is drawing rising attention for its applicability in a wide range of fields, including environmental and ecological studies. The article represents an elemental analysis of the scales of five commercially important coastal fishes: Tenualosa ilisha, Sillaginopsis panijus, Lates calcarifer, Otolithoides pama, and Rhinomugil corsula. The concentrations of different essential and trace elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and their distribution on scales was mapped using micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF). The detected elements were categorized into five groups based on their overall mean concentrations: the most, considerable, moderate, low, and least available. The concentration (mg kg-1) of Ca was the highest (107472.32-181002.76) followed by P (41572.43-79042.02) among the elements in the studied fish scales, independent of species. The hierarchy of the overall mean concentration of elements was Ca>P>S>Mg>Na>K>Sr>Zn>Fe>Al>Ba>Mn>Cu>Cr. Element concentrations varied across fish feeding habits and habitats. Carnivore fish were found to have higher concentrations of K, Sr, and lower Fe than that in planktivore fish. The concentrations of Cr, Fe, S, Sr, and Zn were higher in demersal fish's scales, whereas pelagic fish were found to have higher levels of Al, Ba, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and P. Element: Ca ratios, especially Sr: Ca, Mn: Ca, and Ba: Ca ratios, have potential implications as habitat signatures. Typically, fish otoliths are used for environmental and ecological purposes that involve cutting and sacrificing the sample. Employing scales instead could be a non-lethal alternative, crucial for sustainable fisheries management, especially for rare, vulnerable, or migratory fish.

AB  - Qianbei Ma goats are one of the three most valued local goat breeds in Guizhou, China; furthermore, it has lower litter size performance. The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) of PLIN2 gene and lambing performance. The bioinformatics analysis, DNA sequencing, RT-qPCR and correlation analysis methods were used to analyse the evolutionary relationship of PLIN2 protein in 13 species, to detect the expression pattern of PLIN2 gene in the gonad axis of Qianbei sheep, to explore the dominant genotype of PLIN2 related to lambing traits and to screen molecular markers related to lambing performance to guide the breeding of Qianbei Ma goats. Results showed that the Qianbei Ma goat PLIN2 protein had the closest genetic relationship with sheep and the furthest from mice, there were significant or extremely significant differences in the expression levels of the PLIN2 gene in the gonadal axis of the mothers of single- and multi-lamb groups. Compared with the reference sequence, four SNPs were found, which were g.1006 C -> A and g.1171 A -> G in the first and second intron regions of the PLIN2 gene, g.8514 C -> T in the exon 8 region and g.9122 A -> T in the 3 ' UTR. The correlation analysis showed that g.1006 C -> A, g.8514 C -> T and g.9122 A -> T had significant indigenous effects on the lambing performance of Qianbei Ma goats (p < .05). The number of third births for diploid H2H5 was significantly higher than that of diploid H1H2, and the number of first to third births for diploid H2H5 was large and stable. The results showed that PLIN2 gene could be used as a candidate gene related to lambing traits of Qianbei Ma goat.

AB  - The emergence of flowers marked an important development in plant evolution. Flowers in many species evolved to attract animal pollinators to increase fertilisation chances. In leaves, silicon (Si) discourages herbivores, for example by wearing down mouthparts. Flowers are essentially modified leaves and hence may also have the capacity to accumulate Si. If Si in flowers discourages animal visitors as it does in leaves, Si accumulation may be disadvantageous for pollination. Whether flowers accumulate Si, and what the implications may be, was not known for many species. We analysed leaves and flowers of different taxa, separated into their different anatomical parts. Flowers mostly have low Si concentrations in all parts (mean +/- SE of BSi in mg g(-1) was 0.22 +/- 0.04 in petals, 0.59 +/- 0.24 in sepals, 0.14 +/- 0.03 in stamens, 0.15 +/- 0.04 in styles and stigmas and 0.37 +/- 0.19 in ovaries for a subset of 56 species). In most cases, less Si was accumulated in flowers than in leaves (mean +/- SE of BSi in mg g(-1) was 1.51 +/- 0.55 in whole flowers vs. 2.97 +/- 0.57 in leaves in 104 species) though intriguing exceptions are found, with some species accumulating more Si in flowers than leaves. The large variation in concentration among flowers across the taxa examined, with a particularly high concentration in grass inflorescences, tantalisingly suggests differences in the use of Si for flowers across plant groups. We conclude that the study of the functions of Si for flowers warrants more attention, with pollination strategy a potential contributing factor.

AB  - Syngnathid fishes often experience a reduction in brood size and an increase in immunity during pregnancy. Researchers have studied the polygamous broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) and revealed that some eggs from low-quality females in the male's brood pouch serve as nurse eggs that are absorbed by the father. It is unclear whether nurse eggs also exist in other syngnathid fishes, especially in monogamous syngnathid fishes. In monogamous syngnathid fishes, the male pouch only carries eggs from a single female. Thus, the question remains: do some eggs of monogamous syngnathid fishes also serve as nurse eggs? And if so, are these nurse eggs impaired eggs, or are they viable eggs that are consumed by the brooding father? In the present study, we used the monogamous lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) and asked whether nurse eggs exist in this species. We also explored whether nurse eggs potentially originate from viable versus inviable eggs. Using isotope labeling, we found that nutrients from embryos could be transferred to brooding fathers. Furthermore, we also found that brooding fathers with limited food had a higher isotope content and a smaller brood size compared to individuals with sufficient food. These results have demonstrated that nurse eggs exist in the lined seahorse, and also suggested that the brooding fathers actively consume viable embryos to absorb nutrients in response to low food availability. These findings help us better understand parent-embryo conflict, filial cannibalism, and male-only care in teleost fishes.

AB  - During ontogeny, animals often undergo significant shape and size changes, coinciding with ecological shifts. This is evident in parrotfishes (Eupercaria: Labridae), which experience notable ecological shifts during development, transitioning from carnivorous diets as larvae and juveniles to herbivorous and omnivorous diets as adults, using robust beaks and skulls for feeding on coral skeletons and other hard substrates. These ontogenetic shifts mirror their evolutionary history, as parrotfishes are known to have evolved from carnivorous wrasse ancestors. Parallel shifts at ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels may have resulted in similar evolutionary and ontogenetic allometric trajectories within parrotfishes. To test this hypothesis, using micro-computed tomography (mu CT) scanning and three-dimensional geometric morphometrics, we analyse the effects of size on the skull shape of the striped parrotfish Scarus iseri and compare its ontogenetic allometry to the evolutionary allometries of 57 parrotfishes and 162 non-parrotfish wrasses. The young S. iseri have skull shapes resembling non-parrotfish wrasses and grow towards typical adult parrotfish forms as they mature. There was a significant relationship between size and skull shapes and strong evidence for parallel ontogenetic and evolutionary slopes in parrotfishes. Our findings suggest that morphological changes associated with the ecological shift characterizing interspecific parrotfish evolution are conserved in their intraspecific ontogenies.

AB  - Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen (N) with specialized cells (heterocysts). Resource competition theory and some evidence suggest that such cyanobacteria can dominate when the supply of available dissolved N is low relative to that of phosphorus (P). To probe this notion, a recently introduced mathematical model of cyanobacteria that differentiate heterocysts was paired with a model of non-fixing algal competitors. With sufficiently low abiotic loss rates, dominance by cyanobacteria was predicted at low N:P supply ratios, coexistence for intermediate ratios, and dominance by algae at high ratios. Heterocysts do not reproduce, so differentiation is demographically costly, and at abiotic loss rates exceeding about 0.18 d(-1), cyanobacteria are predicted to be competitively excluded for all N:P supply ratios examined. The demographic cost of heterocyst production is also predicted to impact competitive dynamics in the presence of herbivores. Cyanobacteria are highly susceptible to apparent competition from algae, even when they are the less-preferred food of herbivores. Algae dominate at highest and lowest N:P supply ratios, and cyanobacteria at intermediate ratios, with two non-contiguous intervals of coexistence. In addition to these unexpected results, this study illustrates how planktonic community processes could determine whether nitrogen fixation contributes significantly to planktonic nitrogen supply.

AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the dynamics of the metabolism of one of the active metabolites of vitamin D-25OHD3 and its effect on the metabolism of total and ionized calcium in pregnant and lactating goats. The subject of the study was Zaanen and Laman goats: pregnant (75-90 and 120-140 days of pregnancy) and lactating animals (0-2 and 15-25 days after kidding). The content of 25OHD3 in the blood serum of goats was in the range of 9.8-54.2 ng/mL, including 10.4-32.4 ng/mL in the pregnant animals (75-140 days) and 9.8-54.2 ng/mL in the lactating animals (0-25 days). The dynamics of calcidiol in the blood serum of the pregnant goats was characterised by a 1.35-fold increase in its concentration on the 120-140th days compared to the animals 75-90 days of kidding, with maximum values on the 0-2nd day safter kidding and a decrease in its content on the 15-25th days of lactation. In clinically healthy goats with optimal serum calcium content, the total concentration of 25OHD3 ranged from 10.4 to 54.2 ng/mL, including 10.4-32.4 ng/mL in the pregnant animals and 12.1-54.2 ng/mL in the lactating animals. In the sub-clinical course of hypocalcaemia, the serum calcidiol content in the blood of goats was in the range of 9.8-29.8 ng/mL, including in pregnant animals-from 11.0 to 21.0 ng/mL, during the first 15-25th days of lactation-9.8-29.8 ng/mL. At the optimal content of ionised calcium in the blood serum of goats, the concentration of calcidiol was in the range of 10.4-54.2 ng/mL, against 9.8-29.8 ng/mL in animals with hypocalcaemia. There is a positive correlation between the values of 25OHD3 and total calcium in the blood serum of goats with subclinical hypocalcaemia.

AB  - In the present study, molecular identification and genotypic characterization of H. contortus was carried out targeting 28S-18S rRNA intergenic spacer. Faecal samples of Gaddi goats were collected and subjected to qualitative screening. The samples exhibiting the presence of strongyle type eggs were introduced to faecal culturing. The larvae retrieved were molecularly confirmed as of H. contortus species and the phylogenetics was performed. For the estimation of evolutionary divergence in between the present study isolates with the GenBank archived sequences, maximum composite likelihood model was employed. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity indices and Fu's Fs were also estimated. Approximately 260 bp size amplicons retrieved were confirmatory for the presence of H. contortus species. Phylogenetic analysis also accentuated that present parasite isolates were of H. contortus only. The nucleotide diversity (p) obtained was 0.06696, whereas, haplotype diversity was 0.92549 [95% CI: 0.77778-1.0000]. In between the isolates, Fu's Fs statistic value was positive (1.566), evidencing a deficiency of alleles, which would have happened due to recent population bottleneck. The recovered representative sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers LC600315-LC600317.To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report of phylogeny and haplotype diversity of H. contortus isolated from Gaddi goats of North India. The present study would also serve the basis for future detailed molecular epidemiological studies using discriminative markers for the assessment of genetic diversity in different populations of H. contortus in different hosts of the study area.

AB  - Simple Summary Cashmere goats are valuable genetic resources which are famous for their high-quality fiber. Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) refer to uninterrupted sequences of homozygous genotypes present within the DNA sequence of an individual. To enhance the preservation, improvement and enduring utilization of this valuable genetic resource, we performed a comprehensive study on the genetic variance, degree of inbreeding, patterns of ROHs and selected genes situated in ROH islands which are associated with economic attributes in goats via whole-genome sequencing analysis. Our research showed that the Inner Mongolia cashmere goat possesses a notably high level of genetic diversity and presented the lowest inbreeding coefficient. On the contrary, the highest Froh and lowest levels of diversity were observed in wild goats compared to domesticated goats. The analysis of selection signal through ROHs identified some genes related to meat, fiber and milk production; fertility, disease and cold resistance and adaptability; and body size and growth.Abstract Cashmere goats are valuable genetic resources which are famous worldwide for their high-quality fiber. Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) have been identified as an efficient tool to assess inbreeding level and identify related genes under selection. However, there is limited research on ROHs in cashmere goats. Therefore, we investigated the ROH pattern, assessed genomic inbreeding levels and examined the candidate genes associated with the cashmere trait using whole-genome resequencing data from 123 goats. Herein, the Inner Mongolia cashmere goat presented the lowest inbreeding coefficient of 0.0263. In total, we identified 57,224 ROHs. Seventy-four ROH islands containing 50 genes were detected. Certain identified genes were related to meat, fiber and milk production (FGF1, PTPRM, RERE, GRID2, RARA); fertility (BIRC6, ECE2, CDH23, PAK1); disease or cold resistance and adaptability (PDCD1LG2, SVIL, PRDM16, RFX4, SH3BP2); and body size and growth (TMEM63C, SYN3, SDC1, STRBP, SMG6). 135 consensus ROHs were identified, and we found candidate genes (FGF5, DVL3, NRAS, KIT) were associated with fiber length or color. These findings enhance our comprehension of inbreeding levels in cashmere goats and the genetic foundations of traits influenced by selective breeding. This research contributes significantly to the future breeding, reservation and use of cashmere goats and other goat breeds.

AB  - Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) have been an important component of livestock agricultural production for thousands of years. Preserving genetic diversity within livestock populations maintains a capacity to respond to changing environments and rapidly evolving pathogens. MHC genetic diversity can influence immune functionality at individual and population levels. Here, we focus on defining functional MHC class I haplotype diversity in a large cohort of Scottish Blackface sheep pre-selected for high levels of MHC class II DRB1 diversity. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing with three independent sets of barcoded primers we identified 134 MHC class I transcripts within 38 haplotypes. Haplotypes were identified with between two and six MHC class I genes, plus variable numbers of conserved sequences with very low read frequencies. One or two highly transcribed transcripts dominate each haplotype indicative of two highly polymorphic, classical MHC class I genes. Additional clusters of medium, low, and very low expressed transcripts are described, indicative of lower transcribed classical, non-classical and genes whose function remains to be determined.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is an important parasite in sheep and the abuse of anti-helminthics has resulted in a rapid resistance. Little is known about the abomasal microbiota in sheep and the relation to local parasitism. This study aimed to identify bacteria in the abomasum of sheep, through the abomasal content, abomasal mucosa, and adult H. contortus parasites, in high and low parasitism. Eight sheep naturally infected with H. contortus were classified as high (n = 4) and low infection (n = 4). Samples of abomasal contents, abomasal mucosa, and adult H. contortus parasites were collected. Samples were pooled to form six groups, three in each level of parasitism: high infection/abomasal contents (HC), high infection/mucosa (HM), high infection/parasites (HP); low infection/abomasal contents (LC), low infection/mucosa (LM), and low infection/parasites (LP). Molecular identification of bacteria was performed by the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene. A similar distribution of phyla was observed between pools HC/LC and HP/LP. For pools HM/LM, there was a significant difference (p = 0.01) in the proportion of phyla observed. The bacterial phyla predominant for libraries HC/LC were Firmicutes (82% and 62%) and Bacteroidetes (10.4% and 17.6%); for HM/LM, Firmicutes (76.9% and 56%) and Proteobacteria (10.2% and 38.4%); and for HP/LP, Proteobacteria (42.8% and 55%) and Firmicutes (31.6% and 40%). We observed differences about the samples analyzed, suggesting that there are various bacterial communities closely associated with the different materials analyzed, even from the close environment.

AB  - Differential expression of genes is key to mediating developmental and stress-related plant responses. Here, we addressed the regulation of plant metabolic responses to biotic stress and the developmental variation of defense-related genes in four species of the genus Datura with variable patterns of metabolite accumulation and development. We combine transcriptome profiling with phylogenomic techniques to analyze gene expression and coexpression in plants subjected to damage by a specialist folivore insect. We found (1) common overall gene expression in species of similar chemical profiles, (2) species-specific responses of proteins involved in specialized metabolism, characterized by constant levels of gene expression coupled with transcriptional rearrangement, and (3) induction of transcriptional rearrangement of major terpene and tropane alkaloid genes upon herbivory. Our results indicate differential modulation of terpene and tropane metabolism linked to jasmonate signaling and specific transcription factors to regulate developmental variation and stress programs, and suggest plastic adaptive responses to cope with herbivory. The transcriptional profiles of specialized metabolism shown here reveal complex genetic control of plant metabolism and contribute to understanding the molecular basis of adaptations and the physiological variation of significant ecological traits.

AB  - Molecular methods to understand host feeding patterns of arthropod vectors are critical to assess exposure risk to vector-borne disease and unveil complex ecological interactions. We build on our prior work discovering the utility of PCR-Sanger sequencing blood meal analysis that work well for soft ticks (Acari: Argasidae), unlike for hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae), thanks to their unique physiology that retains prior blood meals for years. Here, we apply blood meal metabarcoding using amplicon deep sequencing to identify multiple host species in individual Ornithodoros turicata soft ticks collected from two natural areas in Texas, United States. Of 788 collected O. turicata, 394 were evaluated for blood meal source via metabarcoding, revealing 27 different vertebrate hosts (17 mammals, five birds, one reptile, and four amphibians) fed upon by 274 soft ticks. Information on multiple hosts was derived from 167 individual O. turicata (61%). Metabarcoding revealed mixed vertebrate blood meals in O. turicata while same specimens yielded only one vertebrate species using Sanger sequencing. These data reveal wide host range of O. turicata and demonstrate the value of blood meal metabarcoding for understanding the ecology for known and potential tick-borne pathogens circulating among humans, domestic animals, and wildlife such as relapsing fever caused by Borrelia turicatae. Our results also document evidence of prior feeding on wild pig from an off-host soft tick for the first time in North America; a critical observation in the context of enzootic transmission of African swine fever virus if it were introduced to the US. This research enhances our understanding of vector-host associations and offers a promising perspective for biodiversity monitoring and disease control strategies.

AB  - Herbivory has long been considered an important component of biotic resistance against macroalgae invasions in marine habitats. However, most of the studies on herbivory of invasive algae refer only to consumption by strictly herbivorous organisms, whereas consumption by omnivorous species has been largely ignored and rarely quantified. In this study, we assess whether the commonest omnivorous sparid species in the Mediterranean Sea are consuming the highly invasive alga, Caulerpa cylindracea, and determine both, its importance in their diet and their electivity toward it as a source of food. Our results confirm that three of the four fish species studied regularly consume C. cylindracea, but in most cases, the importance of C. cylindracea in the diet is low. Indeed, the low electivity values indicate that all species avoid feeding on the invasive alga and that it is probably consumed accidentally. However, despite animals and detritus being the main food for these sparid species, several individual specimens were found to have consumed high amounts of C. cylindracea. This suggests a potential role that these fish species, being really abundant in shallow rocky bottoms, may play in controlling, to some extent, the abundance of the invader.

AB  - Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) are a non-rodent primate-like species sometimes used for biomedical research involving hepatitis virus infections and toxicology. Genome analysis has indicated similarities between tree shrews and humans in the numbers of cytochromes P450 (P450 or CYP), which constitute a family of important drug-metabolizing enzymes; however, P450s have not been fully investigated in tree shrews. In this study, we identified CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and CYP1D1 cDNAs from tree shrew liver and compared their charac- teristics with dog, pig, and human CYP1As. The deduced amino acid sequences of tree shrew CYP1s were highly identical (82-87 %) to human CYP1s. In tree shrews, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were preferentially expressed in liver, whereas CYP1D1 mRNA was preferentially expressed in kidney and lung. In contrast, CYP1B1 mRNA was expressed in various tissues, with the most abundant expression in spleen. Among the tree shrew CYP1 mRNAs, CYP1A2 mRNA was most abundant in liver, and CYP1B1 mRNA was most abundant in kidney, small intestine, and lung. All tree shrew CYP1 proteins heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed caffeine and estradiol in a similar manner to tree shrew liver microsomes and human, dog, and pig CYP1 proteins. These results suggest that tree shrew CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and CYP1D1 genes, different form human pseudogene CYP1D1P, are expressed in liver, small intestine, lung, and/or kidney and encode functional drug-metabolizing enzymes important in toxicology.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we elucidated the changes in metabolites and microbial communities in pregnant ewes during early gestation, and tried to find new biomarkers to predict early pregnancy in sheep. Significant differences were found in the blood biochemical parameters and blood metabolites, but not in the faecal microbial community. At the same time, five potential pregnancy biomarkers were found to predict early pregnancy in ewes. These detected differences will provide a scientific theoretical basis for the rational nutritional regulation of farmers, and these newly discovered biomarkers will promote the development of technology for detecting early pregnancy in sheep in highly cold areas.Abstract Ewes undergo complex metabolic changes during pregnancy. Understanding the specific process of these changes is a necessary prerequisite in ewes for regulating and intervening in order to maintain pregnancies. However, there have been relatively few studies on the specific changes that occur in nutritional metabolism in pregnant ewes during early gestation, especially for some landrace ewes in highly cold areas. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) elucidate the changes in metabolites and microbial communities in pregnant ewes during early gestation using metabolomics and 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon sequencing approaches, and to (2) discover novel early pregnancy-induced biomarkers in the blood and faeces. Rams were placed together with ewes on D0 and removed on D45. During early gestation, blood and faecal samples were collected from ewes in a highly cold area for analysing the metabolites and microbial communities; these were retrospectively classified as the early gestation pregnant (EP) ewe group or the nonpregnant (NP) ewe group based on the lambing status recorded during the expected delivery period. The differences in the plasma biochemical parameters, plasma metabolites, and faecal microbial communities of pregnant and nonpregnant ewes were characterised. The GC, IL-6, O-acetyl-l-serine, L-glutamine, and 6-acetamido-2-oxohexanoic acid were screened out as potential biomarkers for evaluating the occurrence of early pregnancy. These novel early pregnancy-induced metabolites discovered in ewes might allow for the development of technologies to detect early pregnancies in sheep in highly cold areas.

AB  - Waterbirds as nutrient vectors can cause high phosphorus loading in shallow inland aquatic ecosystems. The main goal of this study was to determine the causal relationships between the characteristic physico-chemical properties of intermittent (temporary) alkaline soda pan (playa) ecosystems and specific (surface and volume-related) P loading of waterbirds by in situ field investigation, estimation as well as laboratory experiments using standard methods. In addition, our aim was to estimate the contribution of groundwater and precipitation to the total phosphorus pool of soda pans in Hungary.
   The estimated high specific external P loading of waterbirds (mean: 185 mg P/m(2)/y, 3.32 mg P/L/year) can explain the majority of the hypertrophic TP pool (mean: 5.17 mg/L, 64%) in soda pans, which is mediated by large-bodied herbivorous (e.g. geese and ducks) and medium-bodied omnivorous (e.g. gulls) waterbirds, who are important external nutrient importers and major phosphorus source. The results also confirm the hypothesis that groundwater (3%) and precipitation (5%) together account for a smaller estimated (8% in this study) contribution to the hypertrophic TP pool in soda pans, while the contribution of waterbirds (64% in this study) to the TP is much higher (64-100%). In this study, the remaining part of TP (maximum 28%) pool can be explained by internal P sources. Soda pans are characterized by physical and chemical characteristics coupled with high densities of waterbirds, as biotic mediators of external P sources, which together cause the maintenance of high concentrations of P-forms. The extreme guanotrophication by high P loading of herbivorous waterbirds causing a hypertrophic state is in contradiction with the limited primary production of natural soda pans. This unique phenomenon can be explained by the multiple impact of prevailing extreme physico-chemical drivers (intermittent hydrological cycle, shallow water depth, high turbidity, salinity, alkalinity) and by the specific nutrient cycle of these alkaline soda ecosystems.

AB  - Forest grazing by free -roaming livestock is a common practice in many countries. The forestry sector sees the practice as unfortunate owing to several reasons, such as damages inflicted by grazing in young plantations. Concerning Norway spruce forests, a tree species known to develop wood decay with high frequency followed from stem bark damage, there is a strong perception among foresters that the trampling damage caused by livestock on the superficial root system of this tree leads to decay. Because of the very limited scientific documentation available on this topic, we pursued a clarification by investigating three 38- to 56 -year -old Norway spruce forests used for silvopasture. Two types of injuries were observed on exposed roots: bark cracks characterized by resin exudation, and injuries involving localized bark peeling and exposure of the underlying wood. These injuries occurred up to 250 cm away from the root collar, with the sector 50 -150 cm away from the root collar showing the highest incidence of injuries. In two of the forest stands, wood within the injured root areas was primarily colonized by the wound parasite Corinectria fuckeliana or species of the order Helotiales, fungi that do not cause wood decay. Wood colonization of injured roots by Heterobasidion species, the most frequent wood decay fungi of Norway spruce, was common in the third stand, but only in a few cases it was possible to deduce that the colonization had probably initiated via trampling injuries on roots. In a few cases, an injury was located at stem base at the root collar height along paths used by animals, and in such cases, it was obvious that stem colonization by Heterobasidion species had initiated via the wound. The relatively small amount of data warrants caution when drawing conclusions. Considering the high establishment frequency of decay via stem bark wounds of Norway spruce observed in previous studies, our data would suggest that roots are generally better equipped to defend themselves upon infliction of superficial wounds than stem of this tree species. The likelihood of trampling injuries leading to decay may vary considerably between different stands, this presumably depending on the level of local propagule pressure by pathogenic wood decay fungi and the frequency of damages close to root collar.

AB  - The carnation tortrix moth, Cacoecimorpha pronubana (Hubner, [1799]) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is one of the most economically important insect species affecting the horticultural industry in the UK. The larvae consume foliage, flowers or fruits, and/or rolls leaves together with silken threads, negatively affecting the growth and/or aesthetics of the crop. In order to understand the polyphagous behaviour of this species within an ornamental crop habitat, we hypothesized that different host plant species affect its life history traits differently. This study investigated the effects of the host plant species on larval and pupal durations and sizes, and fecundity (the number of eggs and the number and size of egg clutches). At 20 degrees C, 60% RH and a 16L:8D photoperiod larvae developed 10, 14, 20 and 36 days faster when reared on Christmas berry, Photinia (Rosaceae), than on cherry laurel, Prunus laurocerasus (Rosaceae), New Zealand broadleaf, Griselinia littoralis (Griseliniaceae), Mexican orange, Choisya ternata (Rutaceae), and firethorn, Pyracantha angustifolia (Rosaceae), respectively. Female pupae were 23.8 mg heavier than male pupae, and pupal weight was significantly correlated with the duration of larval development. The lowest and the highest mean numbers of eggs were produced by females reared on Pyracantha (41) and Photinia (202), respectively. Clutch size differed significantly among moths reared on different host plants, although the total number of eggs did not differ. This study showed that different ornamental host plants affect the development of C. pronubana differently. Improved understanding of the influence of host plant on the moth's life history parameters measured here will help in determining the economic impact that this species may have within the ornamental plant production environment, and may be used in developing more accurate crop protection methodologies within integrated pest management of this insect.

AB  - Understanding the immunogenetic basis of coronavirus (CoV) susceptibility in major pathogen reservoirs, such as bats, is central to inferring their zoonotic potential. Members of the cryptic Hipposideros bat species complex differ in CoV susceptibility, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the best understood genetic basis of pathogen resistance, and differences in MHC diversity are one possible reason for asymmetrical infection patterns among closely related species. Here, we aimed to link asymmetries in observed CoV (CoV-229E, CoV-2B and CoV-2Bbasal) susceptibility to immunogenetic differences amongst four Hipposideros bat species. From the 2072 bats assigned to their respective species using the mtDNA cytochrome b gene, members of the most numerous and ubiquitous species, Hipposideros caffer D, were most infected with CoV-229E and SARS-related CoV-2B. Using a subset of 569 bats, we determined that much of the existent allelic and functional (i.e. supertype) MHC DRB class II diversity originated from common ancestry. One MHC supertype shared amongst all species, ST12, was consistently linked to susceptibility with CoV-229E, which is closely related to the common cold agent HCoV-229E, and infected bats and those carrying ST12 had a lower body condition. The same MHC supertype was connected to resistance to CoV-2B, and bats with ST12 were less likely be co-infected with CoV-229E and CoV-2B. Our work suggests a role of immunogenetics in determining CoV susceptibility in bats. We advocate for the preservation of functional genetic and species diversity in reservoirs as a means of mitigating the risk of disease spillover.

AB  - When foraging on a specific range of fruits or seeds, animals can represent a natural selection force, affecting plant population realized fecundity. Most studies have focused on characteristics of dispersed seeds, but the higher predation of seeds of specific size or shape is also an important force that influences the populations' realized fecundity and can help to understand patterns of plants genetic variability. In the Brazilian Pantanal, we investigated the predation of Acuri (Attalea phalerata) palm fruits by macaws, whose seeds go intact through tapirs digestive tract and then are deposited on latrines, where they are often consumed by seed predators. We found 251 fruits, containing between 1 and 5 seeds per fruit; 170 were intact and 81 had been partially damaged by macaws, mostly those containing 3 or 4 seeds per fruit and with thin endocarps. We argue that the higher consumption of fruits with these traits reflects a trade-off in the energy spent by macaws to open the fruits and the energy provided by them. Higher predation on 3-4 seeded fruits favors the selection of 1-2 seeded fruits, revealing a selection force opposed to the one exerted by bruchids and small rodents, which favors multi-seeded palm fruits.

AB  - Animal behavioural responses to the environment ultimately affect their survival. Monitoring animal fine-scale behaviour may improve understanding of animal functional response to the environment and provide an important indicator of the welfare of both wild and domesticated species. In this study, we illustrate the application of collar-attached acceleration sensors for investigating reindeer fine-scale behaviour. Using data from 19 reindeer, we tested the supervised machine learning algorithms Random forests, Support vector machines, and hidden Markov models to classify reindeer behaviour into seven classes: grazing, browsing low from shrubs or browsing high from trees, inactivity, walking, trotting, and other behaviours. We implemented leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess generalizable results on new individuals. Our main results illustrated that hidden Markov models were able to classify collar-attached accelerometer data into all our pre-defined behaviours of reindeer with reasonable accuracy while Random forests and Support vector machines were biased towards dominant classes. Random forests using 5-s windows had the highest overall accuracy (85%), while hidden Markov models were able to best predict individual behaviours and handle rare behaviours such as trotting and browsing high. We conclude that hidden Markov models provide a useful tool to remotely monitor reindeer and potentially other large herbivore species behaviour. These methods will allow us to quantify fine-scale behavioural processes in relation to environmental events.

AB  - Mammals display a wide range of coat colors, with the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R) playing a pivotal role in the genetic regulation of pigmentation. In this study, we investigated MC1R genetic variants in goat populations from four Asian countries to identify genetic factors associated with coat color variation. The complete coding sequence of MC1R was analyzed to detect variants and determine genotypes in goats from Nepal (n = 122), the Philippines (n = 110), Cambodia (n = 30), and Kazakhstan (n = 30). Seven variants were identified, three of which were novel, while four had been previously reported in other goat populations. Among the novel variants, a frameshift mutation (c.147delG) unique to Nepalese goats was predicted to cause substantial disruption of the MC1R protein structure, suggesting its potential role in coat color determination. Additionally, two known missense variants (c.676A > G and c.801C > G) were inferred to affect MC1R function and may contribute to pigmentation variation. Further investigations with larger sample sizes are warranted to clarify the phenotypic effects of these genotypic variants and to better understand the genetic basis of coat color in goats.

AB  - Objectives We evaluate the potential of paired isotopic analysis of bone carbonate and collagen to examine the diet of post-medieval human and animal populations from England (17th-19th c.), including, for the first time, manufacturing towns in northern England. The potential for identifying C-4 crop consumption is explored alongside regional and local patterning in diet by sex and socioeconomic status.Materials and Methods Humans (n = 216) and animals (n = 168) were analyzed from sites in London and northern England for both carbon and nitrogen isotopes of bone collagen (??C-13(coll), ??N-15(coll)). Isotopic analysis of bone carbonates (??C-13(carb), ??O-18(carb)) was carried out on all humans and 27 animals, using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance to assess diagenesis.Results Variations in diet were observed between and within different populations by geographical location and socioeconomic status. Three pigs and one cow consumed C-4 resources, indicating the availability of C-4-fed animal protein. Londoners consumed more animal and marine protein and C-4 resources. Middle- and upper-class populations from both London and northern populations also had greater access to these foods compared to those of lower status in the same regions.Discussion This substantial multi-isotope dataset deriving from bone carbonate and collagen combined from diverse post-medieval urban communities enabled, for the first time, the biomolecular identification of the dynamics of C-4 consumption (cane sugar/maize) in England, providing insight into the dynamics of food globalization during this period. We also add substantially to the animal dataset for post-medieval England, providing further insight into animal management during a key moment of agricultural change.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of Elephantopus scaber extract on the GIFT (genetic improvement of farmed tilapia) strain of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. A total of 800 tilapia with an initial body weight of 1.34 +/- 0.09 g each were randomly divided into five groups. The tilapia in the control group (E0 group) were fed on a basal diet only. Meanwhile, tilapia in the four experimental groups were fed on a basal diet supplemented with 1 g/kg (E1 group), 3 g/kg (E2 group), 5 g/kg (E3 group), and 7 g/kg (E4 group) of E. scaber extract for 10 weeks. Results showed that the survival rate was higher in the experimental groups than in the control group. Compared with the control group, some growth parameters (FW, WGR, SGR, VSI, and HSI) were significantly improved in the E1 group and E2 group. The crude lipid content in the dorsal muscle and liver was lower in the E1 group than in the control group. After E. scaber extract supplementation, activities of immunity-related en-zymes (ACP, AKP, T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and LZM) in plasma, liver, spleen and head kidney, and expressions of immunity-related genes (IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and CCL-3) in liver, spleen and head kidney showed various degrees of improvement, while MDA content and Hsp70 expression level were decreased. The survival rate of tilapia increased in all the supplementation groups after Streptococcus agalactiae treatment. E. scaber extract addition changed the species composition, abundance, and diversity of intestinal microbiota in tilapia. These results demonstrate that E. scaber extract supplementation in diet can improve the growth, immunity, and disease resistance of GIFT against S. agalactiae. E. scaber extract supplementation can also change intestinal microbiota and reduce crude lipid content in dorsal muscle and liver. The above indicators show that the optimal dose of E. scaber extract for GIFT is 1 g/kg.

AB  - Purpose: This study examines the potential of transforming buffalo mozzarella cheese whey, a significant byproduct in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dairy production, into valuable resources. The focus is on utilizing whey as both a functional food for human consumption and a soil fertilizer, addressing waste management issues and promoting economic and environmental sustainability. Method: A multi-faceted approach was used to explore the applications of the produced edible film based on buffalo mozzarella cheese whey. The research included: An LC-MS/MS detailed assessment of the whey's composition to identify beneficial substances, focusing on amino acids. Evaluation of whey as a soil fertilizer by analyzing its nutrient content, including nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, and magnesium, through ICP-OES. Results: The analysis revealed that buffalo mozzarella cheese whey is rich in amino acids and proteins, beneficial for human health, including cardiovascular disease prevention and immune system support. This makes whey a promising functional food ingredient. Additionally, whey contains essential nutrients for plant growth. Using whey as a soil fertilizer enhanced soil quality and reduced the need for synthetic fertilizers. Conclusion: The study confirms that buffalo mozzarella cheese whey can be effectively repurposed as both a functional food and a soil fertilizer. This dual application not only adds value to an otherwise waste product but also promotes economic growth and environmental sustainability. Implementing cheese whey in these capacities can enhance human health through nutritional benefits and support sustainable agricultural practices by improving soil fertility and reducing dependence on synthetic inputs.

AB  - The continuous record offered by deep-sea sediments has been extensively used to constrain shifting continental and oceanographic conditions. Yet, past fluctuations in deep-sea benthic conditions and bottom-currents are in numerous parts of the globe scarcely documented, one such example being the South Australian margin. Indeed, though variations in surface water masses and continental aeolian dust and river outflow are well documented in the area, little is known about benthic environments and their dynamics during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. We focus here on benthic foraminiferal assemblages sampled from a sediment core recovered at 2420 m depth from a small plateau south of Kangaroo Island within the underwater Murray Canyons Group (South Australian margin). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages show a distinct separation between interglacial and glacial periods over the last 94 ka, and indicate that the benthic environment was well-ventilated and oligotrophic during glacial periods, whilst being rather marked by reduced oxygenation associated to higher food input during the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage 5a-c. We demonstrate that autochtonous deep-sea benthic foraminiferal communities neither respond to changes in the Murray River's discharges, nor do they follow variations in aeolian dust input from South Australia. Instead, the deep-sea and the terrestrial realm appear decoupled. Moreover, our obser-vations suggest that bottom-water slope currents were stronger during the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage 5a-c. We propose that this strengthening was triggered by an intensification of the poleward-circulating deep eastern boundary current transporting carbon-rich Indian Deep Water. In contrast, glacial seafloor conditions, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum, may reflect a greater influence and a shoaling of oxygen-rich Antarctic Bottom Water of South Australia. This bottom-water shift would follow the northward displacement of the Subtropical and Subantarctic Fronts and coincide with a withering influence of the Leeuwin Current within surface waters.

AB  - BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical disorder with complex etiology and poor prognosis, and currently lacks specific and effective treatment options. Mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction is a prominent feature in AKI, and modulation of mitochondrial morphology may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for AKI.MethodsWe induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in mice (bilateral) and Bama pigs (unilateral) by occluding the renal arteries. ATP depletion and recovery (ATP-DR) was performed on proximal renal tubular cells to simulate in vitro IRI. Renal function was evaluated using creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, while renal structural damage was assessed through histopathological staining. The role of Drp1 was investigated using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation techniques. Mitochondrial morphology was evaluated using confocal microscopy.ResultsRenal IRI induced significant mitochondrial fragmentation, accompanied by Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) translocation to the mitochondria and Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616 in the early stages (30 min after reperfusion), when there was no apparent structural damage to the kidney. The use of the Drp1 inhibitor P110 significantly improved kidney function and structural damage. P110 reduced Drp1 mitochondrial translocation, disrupted the interaction between Drp1 and Fis1, without affecting the binding of Drp1 to other mitochondrial receptors such as MFF and Mid51. High-dose administration had no apparent toxic side effects. Furthermore, ATP-DR induced mitochondrial fission in renal tubular cells, accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in the translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. This process facilitated the release of dsDNA, triggering the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and promoting inflammation. P110 attenuated mitochondrial fission, suppressed Bax mitochondrial translocation, prevented dsDNA release, and reduced the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Furthermore, these protective effects of P110 were also observed renal IRI model in the Bama pig and folic acid-induced nephropathy in mice.ConclusionsDysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics mediated by Drp1 contributes to renal IRI. The specific inhibitor of Drp1, P110, demonstrated protective effects in both in vivo and in vitro models of AKI.

AB  - Plant specialized metabolites are species-specific compounds that help plants adapt and survive in constantly changing ecological environments. Nectar contains various specialized metabolites, essential for maintaining nectar homeostasis. In this study, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to compare the sugar composition between spoilage nectar and natural nectar, with further analysis of variations in color, odor, pH, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. Microbial strains in Camellia reticulata nectar were isolated and identified using the spread plate method coupled with DNA sequencing. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was implemented to characterize metabolite differences between spoilage and natural nectars. Subsequent in vitro experiments were conducted to validate the effects of screened nectar metabolites on the isolated microbial strains. The results showed that some C. reticulata nectar could spoil and deteriorate, which disrupted nectar homeostasis and significantly reduced the pollination efficiency by pollinators. Spoilage nectar had significant differences in color, odor, sugar composition, pH, and H2O2 content compared to natural nectar. The number of microbial species and quantity in spoilage nectar were much higher. The H2O2 content in natural nectar could reach (55.5 +/- 1.80) mu M, while it was undetectable in spoilage nectar. A total of 15 distinct microbial strains and 364 differential metabolites were isolated and identified from two types of nectar. In vitro experiments demonstrated that H2O2 could inhibit all the bacteria in C. reticulata nectar except Serratia liquefaciens. 12-Methyltetradecanoic Acid inhibited Bacillus subtilis, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, and Rothia terrae, and Myristic Acid only inhibited Rothia terrae. The nectar metabolites screened in this study had no effect on the nectar specialist yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii. In conclusion, the findings of this study revealed that C. reticulata nectar regulates the growth of microorganisms through its metabolites to maintain nectar homeostasis and prevent spoilage. This study improves the understanding of the physiological mechanisms of C. reticulata in maintaining nectar homeostasis and provides theoretical support for controlling nectar diseases and sustaining the reproductive fitness of C. reticulata. Future research could focus on further exploring the complex interactions between different metabolites in C. reticulata nectar and a wider range of microorganisms. Moreover, the development of practical applications based on these findings, such as the development of natural preservatives for nectar-related products or the optimization of pollination efficiency in C. reticulata cultivation, could be an important area for future exploration.

AB  - Diet and habitat use impose mechanical constraints that may impact head morphology and bite force. Skinks (Scincidae) comprise the largest family of lizards with similar to 1700 species currently described. They also show an important morphological and ecological diversity. Using phylogenetically informed analyses, we studied the interrelationships between ecology (diet, habitat use), head morphology and bite force in these lizards. Our results show a strong link between body size, bite force and diet, with herbivorous species being larger and biting harder than species from other dietary groups. Despite a lack of differences in body size and head morphology, omnivorous species bite harder than insectivorous species, in order to process the fibrous plant material that is part of their diet. Overall, lineages that evolved greater bite forces also showed an increase in relative head height allowing for more vertically oriented jaw muscles. Moreover, we find evidence for correlated evolution between bite force and head length: skinks that bite harder tend to have shorter jaws that likely provide a greater mechanical advantage when biting at the tip of the jaw. Surprisingly, habitat use does not appear to be correlated with morphological traits or bite force, but this needs to explored further.

AB  - This study uses tooth meso- and microwear together with bone collagen stable isotope ratios (carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulphur (delta S-34)) to investigate diet and human utilization of two middle Holocene (similar to 5 ka cal B.P.) populations of wild horses, Equus ferus from northwest Europe. The results of the mesowear analysis places one population (Ginnerup, Denmark) amongst extreme grazers and the other (H & uuml;de I, NW Germany) amongst less-abrasion dominated grazers. These are contrasted by microwear, which suggest that both populations were killed, when browsing. The low microwear scratch variation in the Ginnerup population suggests that the duration of the mortality event(s) was short and confined to the same season. The mesowear analysis further suggests that the horses at H & uuml;de I included more browse in their diet than at Ginnerup. This is supported by depleted delta C-13 values in the H & uuml;de I population. The delta S-34 values also differ between the two sites. The higher values at Ginnerup (a coastal site) compared to H & uuml;de I (an inland site) is interpreted as an effect of marine-influenced sulphur-enriched rainfall. Furthermore, the rather consistent delta S-34 values at the two sites respectively suggest that the horses killed were from locally available herds. In general, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope values of horses and other animals from Ginnerup and contemporary nearby sites show tendencies towards more depleted values in the horses and other wild herbivores than in livestock. We suggest that this is a result of niche partitioning and hunting pressure. The results presented here further our understanding of some of the youngest known never-domesticated populations of wild horses Equus ferus in northwest Europe.

AB  - In ecosystems, plants are continuously challenged by combined stress conditions more than by a single biotic or abiotic factor. Consequently, in recent years studies on plant relationships with multiple stresses have aroused increasing interest. Here, the impact of inoculation with fungal pathogens with different lifestyles on Arabidopsis plants response to the following infestation with the invasive crop pest Eurydema oleracea was investigated. In particular, as fungal pathogens the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea and the biotroph Golovinomyces orontii were used. Plants exposed to B. cinerea, but not to G. orontii, showed reduced herbivore feeding damage. This difference was associated to different hormonal pathways triggered by the pathogens: G. orontii only induced the salicylate-mediated pathway, while B. cinerea stimulated also the jasmonate-dependent signalling, which persisted for a long time providing a long-term defence to further herbivore attack. In particular, the lower susceptibility of B. cinerea-infected Arabidopsis plants to E. oleracea was related to the stimulation of the JA-induced pathway on the production of plant volatile compounds, since treatment with VOCs emitted by B. cinerea inoculated plants inhibited both insect plant choice and feeding damage. These results indicate that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi modulate host volatile emission, thus affecting plant response to subsequent insect, thereby increasing the knowledge on tripartite plant-microbe-insect interactions in nature.

AB  - Today's livestock agriculture faces major changes in domestic pig husbandry-besides animal health and productivity, aspects of animal welfare and animal-friendly husbandry systems for pigs increasingly gain attention. To get a basic and current overview of the behavior of pigs in a near-natural habitat, we studied two groups of 20 domestic fattening pigs kept in two free-range forest enclosures in southern Germany. The pigs had ad libitum access to supplementary concentrate feed (CF), green fodder (GF), water and shelters. During the 6-month observation period, we found that the pigs showed no biphasic activity rhythm. The activity phase began at ca. 05:15 and ended at 21:00 in summer, and it shortened in winter. The peak of activity was between 14:00 and 18:00. The individual behaviors were assessed on 16 observation days during three direct-observation-intervals each (morning: 08:00 to 10:00; midday: 12:00 to 14:00; evening: 16:00 to 18:00). In the course of a day, some of the occurring behaviors such as rooting and locomotion continually increased from morning to evening. In contrast, resting occurred the least in the evening. Feed and water uptake were observed without noticeable influence of the daytime during the entire daylight period. Despite ad libitum availability of CF and GF at the feeding place, the pigs spent only about 13% of the observation time eating (including food uptake in the forest), with the total time and average duration being greater for GF than for CF uptake. Furthermore, the pigs spent about 24% of the time rooting. Thus, rooting seems to be an essential behavior of domestic pigs without the primary motivation of hunger. Resting made up 47% of the total observation time. The remaining 16% of the observation time was spent with several short-lasting active behaviors, such as interacting with the environment, locomotion, playing and comfort behavior. Based on the results of our study, we provide recommendations for adequate management practices in modern, animal-friendly pig stalls and free-range enclosures. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change-induced environmental stressors, including ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) and extreme heat stress (HS), pose serious health risks, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases. PM2.5 exacerbates cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, while HS increases mortality and worsens air pollution. Combined exposure may amplify these effects, especially in vulnerable populations at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In our experimental study using a mouse model of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), we explored the combined effects of extreme weather conditions, particularly exposure to ambient PM2.5 and HS. Our research indicated that even short, repeated exposure to these environmental stressors disrupts brain energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory functions, which we found to be associated with altered hippocampal synaptic functions. Additionally, we find that key mechanisms associated with impaired intestinal permeability and gut dysbiosis are affected, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to climate change communication may also disrupt the gutbrain axis, as in part evidenced in our study by peripheral changes in immune and inflammatory signaling. Moreover, despite significant disruptions in metabolic and immune-inflammatory pathways, we observed no acceleration of cognitive decline in the young asymptomatic EOAD mice subjected to short, repeated exposure to extreme heat and environmental PM2.5. These findings highlight the potential role of climate change in promoting risk factors like neuroinflammation and gut-brain axis dysfunction due to gut microbiome dysbiosis in the onset and progression of AD, particularly in asymptomatic individuals at risk for developing the condition.

AB  - Characterizing the mutational diversity of viruses can shed light on both intra-host and between-host evolutionary processes. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of five different strains of Influenza A virus H1N1 isolated from humans, ducks, and pigs. We detected positive selection that led to the evolution and fixation of virus variants at the intra-host level. Among the strains studied, A/mallard/Balkhash/6304/2014 was the most affected by intra-host dynamics, with 143 substitutions, while A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) had the least, with only one substitution. A/California/04/09 had the highest frequency of distribution in the HA epitope sites. We also detected amino acid substitutions in immunodominant antigenic regions of A/WSN/1933, mallard, and swine influenza strains. We detected a total of 19 shared substitutions across both the inter-host and intra-host levels. The sequences of the different strains showed different patterns of gene expression. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the HA and NA segments of the 26 GenBank isolates showed incongruences with other phylogenetic trees based on other IAV segments. We also identified amino acid changes in critical regions of the studied isolates, which could provide valuable information on the contingency of novel recombinants with different morphogenesis, infectivity, and behavior against antivirals. Our results show that influenza A viruses (IAVs) could potentially adapt more efficiently within their host organisms, mostly in wild birds. This underlines the importance of certain population characteristics, such as the elimination of genetic bottlenecks, as a means to expand their ability to infect new hosts.

AB  - Due to the natural biochar aging, the improvement of soil quality and immobilization of soil pollutants achieved by biochar may change; understanding the dynamic evolution of the in situ performance of biochar in these roles is essential to discuss the long-term sustainability of biochar remediation. Therefore, in this study, combined biochar from co-pyrolysis of pig manure and invasive Japanese knotweed - P1J1, as well as pure pig manure - PM - and pure Japanese knotweed - JK - derived biochar were applied to investigate their remediation performance in a high As- and Pb-polluted soil with prolonged incubation periods (up to 360 days). Biochar application, especially P1J1 and PM, initially promoted soil pH, dissolved organic carbon, and EC, but the improvements were not constant through time. The JK-treated soil exhibited the highest increase of soil organic matter (OM), followed by P1J1 and then PM, and OM did not change with aging. Biochar, especially P1J1, was a comprehensive nutrient source of Ca, K, Mg, and P to improve soil fertility. However, while soluble cationic Ca, K, and Mg increased with time, anionic P decreased over time, indicating that continuous P availability might not be guaranteed with the aging process. The total microorganism content declined with time; adding biochars slowed down this tendency, which was more remarkable at the later incubation stage. Biochar significantly impeded soil Pb mobility but mobilized soil As, especially in PM- and P1J1-treated soils. However, mobilized As gradually re -fixed in the long run; meanwhile, the excellent Pb immobilization achieved by biochars was slightly reduced with time. The findings of this study offer fresh insights into the alterations in metal(loid)s mobility over an extended duration, suggesting that the potential mobilization risk of As is reduced while Pb mobility slightly increases over time.

AB  - Food security and environmental sustainability are two hot topics nowadays. Chemical pesticides used with no discretion threaten human health and ecosystem functioning and, thus, ecological alternatives for herbivorous pest control are required. An environmentally friendly alternative to chemical pesticides is biological control-the use of natural enemies to control pest populations. Ladybirds (known as ladybugs in North America) are iconic biological control agents used against several herbivorous pests, such as aphids and scale insects, among others. However, small-sized ladybirds such as Scymnus are still poorly studied, and there is only one case of a biological control program using species in this genus. In the Azores archipelago (Portugal), 30% of ladybird species are small, but present in high population densities; therefore, despite their size, their ability to help to regulate prey population densities is expected to be important. In this work, we studied the life cycle of Scymnus nubilus on two new prey species: aphids that attack agricultural and forestry plants. The biological performance of the ladybird predator on the new prey tested was the best obtained to date. Our results agree with other studies focusing on the use of Scymnus ladybirds as biocontrol agents and suggest that the predator can contribute to the control of aphid pests. Life tables are an important tool to forecast the performance of biological control agents used in pest management programs, and they are often assessed in terms of population growth. In the present study, the suitability of the aphids Aphis fabae Scopoli and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) for the ladybird predator Scymnus nubilus Mulsant was assessed for the first time. For this, we evaluated and compared the life history traits of immature individuals and adults of the predator fed single-aphid diets and the consequences of the single-aphid diets for the demographic parameters. Scymnus nubilus that were fed A. fabae were significantly more fecund and presented a shorter immature development time than those fed M. persicae. The predators fed A. fabae had a significantly higher net reproductive rate, an intrinsic and finite rate of increase, while their doubling time was significantly lower than that of those fed M. persicae. The aphid species used in this study are new additions to the essential prey list of the ladybird, with the predator presenting a better biological performance than that found on the previously known essential prey species.

AB  - Several interventions have been promoted in dry areas to improve food and nutrition insecurity. However, studies on the key drivers influencing adoption and uptake are limited. Therefore, research was undertaken to investigate farmers' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes on an integrated crop-dairy goat farming system in Elgeyo Marakwet. A cross-sectional study entailing a household survey of 201 respondents, six key informant interviews and eight focus group discussions was undertaken. This study utilized a multi-stage sampling procedure to sample the farmers and calculated the sample size using Krejcie and Morgan tables. Quantitative data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS software version 22, while qualitative data were analysed using N-vivo software version 10 through the Framework Analysis method. The findings show that drought (84.6%), change in rainfall pattern (77.6%), farm size (57.2%), unavailability of quality seeds (52.2%), fodder acreage (58.7%), diseases (69.7%) and pest severity (68.7%) are the principal drivers for adoption of the integrated crop-dairy goat farming system. Dairy goats are associated with women in this community since they are regarded as small animals and have no monetary value, hence increasing the participation of women in the access, control and decision making of agricultural resources. To increase adoption, strategies focusing on improving water supply, quality seeds, agro-veterinary services and production are advocated.

AB  - The dairy industry is currently one of the most important industrial sectors in the world, and due to the high demand for products, is considered the largest source of industrial wastewater in the food sector. Whey wastewater is the most abundant liquid by-product and is characterized by a high concentration of organic load. Thus, the treatment of cheese whey wastewater before discharge is considered important. Therefore, the processes of electrocoagulation (EC), electrooxidation (EO), as well as their combination (EC/EO) have been purposefully used for the treatment of goat cheese wastewater. The main parameters (current density (mA/cm2), agitation (rpm), pH, and operating time (min)) affecting the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were studied for each process. Whey effluent was treated under the optimal conditions of EC with aluminum electrodes, and EO with a boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD), removing 40.5% and 55.3% of COD, respectively. The combined use of EC/EO eliminated 82.4% of COD in a total time of 90 min. Total nitrogen (TN), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-), and phosphate (PO4-3) pollutants were also determined. The aroma profile of the raw substrate changed during the electrochemical processes. The determination of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in raw and treated (EC, EO, and EC/EO) goat whey wastewater was monitored using a thermal desorption unit followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) after extraction of VOCs using the HiSorb technique. Coupling electrochemical technologies increased odor emissions from goat cheese whey wastewater.

AB  - Buffalos are increasingly used for milk production, but milking them is challenging due to their temperament and strong cow-calf relationship. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the milking behaviours and temperament score in Anatolian buffaloes and the effects of milking temperament score on the milking traits of cows. The study was performed on 43 lactating primiparous and multiparous Anatolian buffaloes at a commercial farm in Turkiye. At milking, each buffalo cow was scored using a temperament scoring system (1: docile, 2: restless, 3: nervous and 4: aggressive) that assessed the animal's reactivity on days 6, 30, 60 and 90 of lactation after calving. Additionally, the milking time (MT), milk flow rate (MFR) and milk yield per milking (MYM) of the cows were measured. The MT and MYM were measured using a digital chronometer and scales, respectively. The increase in the temperament score of the cows during milking was significantly positively correlated with the frequency of vocalising, kicking, stepping, defecating, urinating and pulling the teat cup off. In general, it was observed that Anatolian buffalo cows were restless during milking. The temperament score on day 6 of lactation was higher than during other periods. However, the milking temperament score of the buffaloes decreased rapidly during the later periods of lactation, i.e., the buffalo cows adapted to the milking procedures over time. The temperament score of cows with parity of <= 2 was higher than those with a parity of >= 4 on day 6 of lactation. Moreover, a statistically significant decrease in the MFR and MYM values of cows with an increasing temperament score was determined for all lactation periods. Except for on day 30 of lactation, the MT values of the cows also increased as the temperament score increased for the other lactation periods. An increase in the temperament score of the cows during milking was negatively correlated with the MYM and MFR values of the buffalo cows and was positively correlated with the MT on day 6 of lactation. Moreover, similar statistically significant correlations were observed between the temperament score and the milking characteristics (MYM, MT and MFR) on days 6, 30, 60 and 90 of lactation. These results suggest that the temperament score of the buffalo cows had an adverse effect on the MFR, MYM and MT values at various stages of lactation.

AB  - HIV-1 is a highly host-specific retrovirus that infects humans but not most nonhuman primates. Thus, the lack of a suitable primate model that can be directly infected with HIV-1 hinders HIV-1/AIDS research. In the previous study, we have found that the northern pig-tailed macaques (NPMs) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection but show a nonpathogenic state. In this study, to understand this macaque-HIV-1 interaction, we assembled a de novo genome and longitudinal transcriptome for this species during the course of HIV-1 infection. Using comparative genomic analysis, a positively selected gene, Toll-like receptor 8, was identified with a weak ability to induce an inflammatory response in this macaque. In addition, an interferon-stimulated gene, interferon alpha inducible protein 27, was upregulated in acute HIV-1 infection and acquired an enhanced ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication compared with its human ortholog. These findings coincide with the observation of persistently downregulated immune activation and low viral replication and can partially explain the AIDS-free state in this macaque following HIV-1 infection. This study identified a number of unexplored host genes that may hamper HIV-1 replication and pathogenicity in NPMs and provided new insights into the host defense mechanisms in cross-species infection of HIV-1. This work will facilitate the adoption of NPM as a feasible animal model for HIV-1/AIDS research.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess positive or negative impacts of anaerobic digestion (AD) on water quality using a systemic approach. To this end, we used the agro-hydrological model Topography-based Nitrogen Transfer and Transformation (TNT2), a spatially explicit model that simulates nitrogen and water flows at the watershed scale on a daily time step. Four scenarios were constructed and analyzed: a baseline before the introduction of AD (S0), AD with adjusted fertilization (S1), AD with unadjusted fertilization (S2), and agroecological AD (S3). The results showed that, when spreading practices were similar and an equivalent amount of effective nitrogen was applied, digested pig slurry generally had a predicted amount of nitrate leaching similar to that of undigested pig slurry. In addition, replacing catch crops with energy cover crops had little impact on water quality. Scenario S3 was the most favorable one for water quality and biogas production, but not for soil organic nitrogen storage and food and feed production. This study's strength is its systemic approach, which considered both environmental and agronomic aspects to assess the scenarios.

AB  - The average daily weight gain (ADG) is considered a crucial indicator for assessing growth rates in the swine industry. Therefore, investigating the gastrointestinal microbiota and serum metabolites influencing the ADG in pigs is pivotal for swine breed selection. This study involved the inclusion of 350 purebred Yorkshire pigs (age: 90 +/- 2 days; body weight: 41.20 +/- 4.60 kg). Concurrently, serum and fecal samples were collected during initial measurements of blood and serum indices. The pigs were categorized based on their ADG, with 27 male pigs divided into high-ADG (HADG) and low-ADG (LADG) groups based on their phenotype values. There were 12 pigs in LADG and 15 pigs in HADG. Feces and serum samples were collected on the 90th day. Microbiome and non-targeted metabolomics analyses were conducted using 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Pearson correlation, with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment, was employed to assess the associations between these variables. The abundance of Lactobacillus and Prevotella in LADG was significantly higher than in HADG, while Erysipelothrix, Streptomyces, Dubosiella, Parolsenella, and Adlercreutzia in LADG were significantly lower than in HADG. The concentration of glutamine, etiocholanolone glucuronide, and retinoyl beta-glucuronide in LADG was significantly higher than in HADG, while arachidonic acid, allocholic acid, oleic acid, phenylalanine, and methyltestosterone in LADG were significantly lower than in HADG. The Lactobacillus-Streptomyces networks (Lactobacillus, Streptomyces, methyltestosterone, phenylalanine, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, glutamine, 3-ketosphingosine, L-octanoylcarnitine, camylofin, 4-guanidinobutyrate 3-methylcyclopentadecanone) were identified as the most influential at regulating swine weight gain. These findings suggest that the gastrointestinal tract regulates the daily weight gain of pigs through the network of Lactobacillus and Streptomyces. However, this study was limited to fecal and serum samples from growing and fattening boars. A comprehensive consideration of factors affecting the daily weight gain in pig production, including gender, parity, season, and breed, is warranted.

AB  - The global climate crisis has shifted the building industry toward the ecological use of materials, often based on renewable sources. Properties of such materials, as well as their behavior in structures, need to be constantly verified both theoretically and experimentally. This article focuses on the influence of vapor retarder on the moisture content of timber log wall structures with sheep wool insulation. Moisture content was verified experimentally during the period of over 2 years with monitoring sensors and insulation samples weighing. Results show that vapor retarder has a positive and statistically significant impact on the moisture content of sheep wool insulation and log structure, depending on the season and position of insulation in the structure. The moisture content of the log structure does not exceed 16%, confirming no risk of biodegradation during the monitored period. This case study can help further the knowledge of log structure design and provide insight into the hygrothermal properties of sandwich structures.

AB  - Not all boar sperm samples survive cryopreservation well. A method of eliminating damaged sperm might enable more cryopreserved boar semen to be used for pig breeding. In this study we investigated the use of Magnetic Activated Cell sorting (MACS) to eliminate damaged sperm from thawed boar semen samples. The thawed samples were mixed with Dead cell removal particles and were applied to the column in a SuperMACS II. Different fractions were collected: Original sample (O), Flow-through (FT), and Eluate (E). Sperm membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining with SYBR 14 and propidium iodide, or 5 ', 6, 6 '-tetrachloro-1, 1 ', 3, 3 '-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide, or hydroethidine and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, respectively. The FT samples had increased membrane integrity, a greater proportion of sperm with high mitochondrial membrane potential and a greater proportion of sperm negative for hydrogen peroxide than O samples (P<0.0001), which in turn had increased membrane integrity than E samples (P <0.0001). However, differences were seen between boars. The FT samples had increased values of live, superoxide positive sperm than O samples (P <0.0001) and O samples had greater values than E samples (P <0.0001), while there was no effect of boar. Sperm quality was best in the FT fraction, comprising approximately 32% of the sperm sample. In conclusion, although there were differences between boars, MACS separation can improve sperm quality in thawed semen samples. It would be interesting to see if this improvement is reflected in fertility outcomes.

AB  - After retrieval, reactivated memories may destabilize and require restabilization processes to persist, referred to as reconsolidation. The reminder-extinction procedure has been proposed as a behavioral reconsolidation-based intervention to persistently attenuate threat-conditioned memories. After the presentation of a single reminder trial, the conditioned threat memory may enter a labile state, and extinction training during this window can prevent the return of conditioned threat responses. However, findings on this reminder-extinction procedure are mixed and its effectiveness may be subject to boundary conditions, including memory strength. Here, we systematically investigate whether more intense threat memories are less susceptible to disruption through a reminder-extinction procedure. Using a Pavlovian auditory threat conditioning procedure at three different shock intensities, rats acquired conditioned threat responses of variable "strength." Rats subsequently underwent either extinction preceded by a reminder or standard extinction. Although different shock intensities led to different strength threat memories, all groups showed reinstatement of conditioned threat responses irrespective of shock intensity or reminder condition. Hence, regardless of the intensity of the threat memory, the reminder procedure was ineffective in preventing the return of threat responses in rats. We thus find no evidence that threat memory intensity is a potential modulator of the effectiveness of the reminder-extinction procedure.

AB  - The study of azo dyes degradation products and their harmfulness is an important topic because their diffusion in the environment is still a serious problem. We investigated the reduction by pig liver microsomal fraction of four bis-azo dyes, Acid Red 73, Acid Red 150, Direct Red 24, and Direct Red 28, in anaerobic condition. These complex molecules, different for position/nature of substituent groups and for the group interposed between the two azo bonds, allowed to investigate the correlation between substrate molecular structure and action of a subcellular fraction representative of the xenobiotic degradation by a living organism and the consequent possible appearance of harmful reaction products. Dyes were first carefully purified to eliminate interferences in the enzymatic assays. The reduction products were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Acid Red 73 and Acid Red 150 were markedly reduced with production of harmful aromatic amines, while Direct Red 24 and Direct Red 28 were neither reduced to their synthesis amines nor to other amines. These results suggest that azo dyes with a benzidine derivative group are not degraded by microsomal fraction and therefore molecules with a similar structure could be classified with a lower risk index not producing any harmful catabolic product.

AB  - Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops grown in the Western Himalayas of India but its production is challenged by the insect "cereal leaf beetle (CLB)". This study explores the impact of domestication and modern crop improvement on wheat's defense mechanisms against the CLB, a global threat to wheat cultivation. Sixteen diverse wheat genotypes having different ploidy levels were investigated, including wild wheat, landraces, mutants, advanced breeding lines, commercial varieties, and a Rye grass genotype. Genotypes with resistance genes, landraces, and wild wheat exhibited the lowest CLB infestation and oxidative damage. These genotypes displayed enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, such as peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and increased plant secondary metabolite (phenol and tannin) production upon CLB infestation. Resistant durum wheat demonstrated moderate responses and exhibited higher levels of flavonoid production. On the other hand, susceptible durum wheat genotypes, commercial variety Shalimar Wheat-02 (SW-2), showed high CLB infestation, ROS production, reduced antioxidant enzyme and secondary metabolite production. This may be because modern varieties like SW-2 were not selected for insect resistance. These findings emphasize the significance of preserving genetic diversity from wild wheat and landraces to bolster wheat breeding programs against pests such as CLB. This study underscores the need to harness ancestral wheat lines to enhance insect pest resistance in modern wheat cultivars.

AB  - Simple Summary In the Puna region of Argentina, llama fibre production has enormous social, economic and environmental potential, but is still in its early stages of development. For this reason, classification and quality analysis systems used today are still deficient. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy is a technological resource used in the agroindustry for quality analysis of organic compounds. In this work we studied the feasibility of this technology to evaluate the mean fibre diameter, which is one of the most important quality parameters in the textile industry. Despite some limitations, which are mainly related to fibre heterogeneity, the results obtained were encouraging as spectroscopy could be used in screening programmes as a sustainable, fast and low-cost method to improve fibre quality validation. Llama fibre has the potential to become the most valuable textile resource in the Puna region of Argentina. In this study near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was evaluated to predict the mean fibre diameter in llama fleeces. Analyses between sets of carded and non-carded samples in combination with spectral preprocessing techniques were carried out and a total of 169 spectral signatures of llama samples in Vis and NIR ranges (400-2500 nm) were obtained. Spectral preprocessing consisted in wavelength selection (Vis-NIR, NIR and discrete ranges) and multiplicative and derivative pretreatments; spectra without pretreatments were also included, while modified partial least squares (M-PLS) regression was used to develop prediction models. Predictability was evaluated through R-2: standard cross validation error (SECV), external validation error (SEV) and residual predictive value (RPD). A total of 54 calibration models were developed in which the best model (R-2 = 0.67; SECV = 1.965; SEV = 2.235 and RPD = 1.91) was obtained in the Vis-NIR range applying the first derivative pretreatment. ANOVA analysis showed differences between carded and non-carded sets and the models obtained could be used in screening programs and contribute to valorisation of llama fibre and sustainable development of textile industry in the Puna territory of Catamarca. The data presented in this paper are a contribution to enhance the scarce information on this subject.

AB  - Co-infestations by herbivores, a common situation found in natural settings, can distinctly affect induced plant defenses compared to single infestations. Related tritrophic interactions might be affected through the emission of changed blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In a previous study, we observed that the infestation by red spider mite (Oligonychus ilicis) on coffee plants facilitated the infestation by white mealybug (Planococcus minor), whereas the reverse sequence of infestation did not occur. Here, we examined the involvement of the jasmonate and salicylate pathways in the plant-mediated asymmetrical facilitation between red spider mites and white mealybugs as well as the effect of multiple herbivory on attractiveness to the predatory mite Euseius concordis and the ladybug Cryptolaemus montrouzieri. Both mite and mealybug herbivory led to the accumulation of JA-Ile, JA, and cis-OPDA in plants, although the catabolic reactions of JA-Ile were specifically regulated by each herbivore. Infestation by mites or mealybugs induced the release of novel volatiles by coffee plants, which selectively attracted their respective predators. Even though the co-infestation by mites and mealybugs resulted in a stronger accumulation of JA-Ile, JA and SA than the single infestation treatments, the volatile emission was similar to that of mite-infested or mealybug-infested plants. However, multiple infestation had a negative impact on the attractiveness of HIPVs to the predators, making them less attractive to the predatory mite and a repellent to the ladybug. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms of the susceptibility induced by mites, and the effect of multiple infestation on each predator.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In temperate and subtropical ecosystems, goats are classified as seasonal-polyestrous, generating a seasonality in their products (i.e., milk, meat). In order to abolish or reduce this reproductive seasonality, exogenous hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), have been used to stimulate the development of ovarian follicles, triggering ovulation, corpus luteum formation, while increasing serum progesterone levels, fetal growth, prolificacy, and kidding rate. We tested the possible effect of two doses of hCG (i.e., 100 vs. 300 IU) in the improvement of the luteal function and embryo implantation in anovulatory goats subjected to an estrus induction protocol, and then, to a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol (FTAI). The highest values for fecundity rate, corpus luteum area, as well as embryonic efficiency index 1, were favored in goats treated with 300 IU hCG 14 days post-artificial fertilization. The embryonic efficiency and the index embryonic implantation efficiency were favored in goats treated with 300 IU hCG 7 and 14 days post-artificial insemination. This work contributes to explore the most suitable use of exogenous hormones that favor the out-of-season reproductive outcomes in goats and to boost the embryo implantation efficiency.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect of two doses of hCG (100 and 300 IU) applied at two different times (7 and 14 d) after a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol (FTAI) upon some variables involved in the embryonic implantation rate in goats during the natural deep anestrous season (April, 25 degrees north). The experimental units considered crossbred, multiparous, anovulatory goats (n = 69, Alpine, Saanen, Nubian x Criollo), with average body weight (43.6 +/- 5.7 kg) and body condition score (1.86 +/- 0.28 units) located in northern-semiarid Mexico (25 degrees N, 103 degrees W). Once the goat's anestrus status was confirmed, goats were subjected to an estrus induction protocol. Upon estrus induction confirmation, goats (n = 61) were subjected to a FTAI procedure. Immediately after the FTAI, the goats were randomly distributed to five experimental groups: (1). G100-7 (n = 13) 100 IU, hCG 7 d post-FTAI, (2). G100-14 (n = 12) 100 IU hCG, 14 d post-FTAI, (3). G300-7 (n = 12) 300 IU, hCG, 7 d post-FTAI, (4). G300-14 (n = 12) 300 IU hCG 14 d post-FTAI, and (5). Control group, CONT (n = 12) 0.5 mL saline, 7 and 14 d post-FTAI. The response variables conception rate (39.36 +/- 0.23), fertility rate (27.96%), prolificacy rate (1.1 +/- 0.29 kids), ovulation rate (0.74 +/- 0.20 corpus luteum) corpus luteum diameter (10.15 +/- 0.59 mm), embryo number (1.58 +/- 0.20), and embryo implantation rate (48.96%), did not differ between treatments. However, while the variables fecundity rate (67%), embryo efficiency index-1 (33.99 +/- 0.20%), and embryo efficiency index-2 (27.94 +/- 0.30%) were favored by the G300-14 treatment, the corpus luteum area was favored (p < 0.05) by both G300-7 (113.30 +/- 0.19 mm(2)) and G300-14 (103.04 +/- 0.17 mm(2)). Such reproductive strategy emerges as an interesting approach, not only to enhance the out-of-season reproductive outcomes, but also to boost one of the main rulers defining the global reproductive efficiency of a heard, namely, the embryo implantation efficiency.

AB  - Covering: up to 2025Microbial interactions involve complex processes shaped by their ecological contexts. Herbivore animal dung denotes an interesting ecological niche for the study of interorganism communication and competition mediated by small molecules. Coprophilous organisms, which inhabit or are associated with animal dung, have developed resourceful defense mechanisms to survive in this competitive environment. Fungi, in particular, are renowned for their ability to produce biologically active secondary metabolites, a chemical arsenal that fosters successful colonization of the dung substrate. With recent advancements in OMICs technologies and our extensive knowledge of coprophilous fungi diversity, we can now delve into the biosynthetic machinery of these organisms and explore the opportunities they offer for discovering new antimicrobials and other beneficial natural products. This review explores the potential of coprophilous fungi in the context of the intricate microbial dynamics of this substrate, particularly the biosynthetic and chemical diversity that make this environment especially promising for natural product discovery. Notably, taxa spanning multiple families within the Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes have been reported to thrive in dung, highlighting their potential as a reservoir of unique metabolic capabilities. Indeed, 198 secondary metabolites, derived from polyketide, amino acid derived, terpene, and hybrid pathways, have been reported from these fungi, underscoring the remarkable scope of their biosynthetic potential.

AB  - Agricultural insecticide usage presents a complex challenge, particularly when addressing hidden targets such as concealed pest species. Typically, insecticide spraying targets either the host plant or the soil substrate, reaching the target when the pests move or feed, yet their vulnerability when concealed remains low. This study delves into the often-obscure effects of insecticides on hidden herbivore species, focusing specifically on the diamide insecticide chlorantraniliprole and its impact on the concealed insect herbivore, the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella (Gu & eacute;rin-M & egrave;neville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetidae). We document the progressive effects of chlorantraniliprole from egg-laying through the insect's development and reproductive output. By examining egg-laying preferences, development, survival, respiration rate, leaf consumption, and polysaccharide and protein accumulation, alongside fecundity, in two field-collected leaf miner populations, we elucidate chlorantraniliprole's broader effects. While the insecticide did not alter the leaf miner's egg-laying preferences, one population exhibited higher larval survival, indicating chlorantraniliprole resistance. This chlorantraniliprole-resistant population displayed a lower respiration rate-indicative of reduced stress-and higher leaf consumption, accompanied by increased sugar and protein accumulation. Although this population showed lower adult longevity, it exhibited higher fecundity. These findings highlight the multifaceted impacts of insecticides, extending beyond survival to affect development, fecundity, and potential fitness. Variations in response among insect populations suggest that resistant insects may outperform susceptible ones even under sublethal exposure, with significant implications for management strategies and future outbreaks.

AB  - Simple Summary Tree of heaven is a tree native from Asia, considered a serious weed where ever it occurs outside of its native range. Among the herbivores which attack it is a tiny mite, Aculus mosoniensis, which causes serious malformations of the growing tips. In order to determine whether this species is safe to use as a biological control agent in Europe, where the mite has already been recorded, and elsewhere within the invasive range of tree of heaven, host range testing is required. After testing several tree species related to tree of heaven, it was found that this mite was unable to reproduce on any other species except tree of heaven, and importantly there was no damage or sign of feeding on any of the test species. Thus we conclude that this is a safe biological control agent and will help to control this highly invasive tree. Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China, considered a serious invasive species worldwide, with several socio-economic and ecological impacts attributed to it. Chemical and mechanical methods have limited efficacy in its management, and biological controls may offer a suitable and sustainable option. Aculus mosoniensis (Ripka) is an eriophyid mite that has been recorded to attack tree of heaven in 13 European countries. This study aims to explore the host range of this mite by exposing 13 plant species, selected either for their phylogenetic and ecological similarity to the target weed or their economic importance. Shortly after inoculation with the mite, we recorded a quick decrease in mite number on all nontarget species and no sign of mite reproduction. Whereas, after just one month, the population of mites on tree of heaven numbered in the thousands, irrespective of the starting population, and included both adults and juveniles. Significantly, we observed evidence of damage due to the mite only on target plants. Due to the specificity, strong impact on the target, and the ability to increase its population to high levels in a relatively short amount of time, we find A. mosoniensis to be a very promising candidate for the biological control of tree of heaven.

AB  - This study describes antioxidative activity of green tea (GT) extract on standard post-thawed quality indicators of frozen buffalo bull's spermatozoa. Semen samples were obtained from the bulls for three weeks through artificial vagina. Egg yolk was used as an extender, in which different concentrations of GT extract (0.0%, 0.50%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 2.5%) were added. Semen quality indicators studied were the percentage of motility, survivability, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity of frozen buffalo bull sperms. The antioxidative effect of GT was observed at the comparatively lower concentration (0.1-1.5%) on the post-thawed quality indicators. On the other hand, the hight GT concentration (1.5%) significantly decreased the quality indicators of spermatozoa. Green tea extract enhanced the spermatozoa survivability, integrity of acrosome and plasma membrane of spermatozoa following freezing and thawing. It is suggested that the addition of 1.5% green tea extract (4 g in 200 ml methanol) can be safely used for enhanced effectiveness of fertility after thawing.

AB  - Introduction: Mitochondrial studies are crucial for assessing livestock health and performance. While extensive research has been done on cattle and pigs, the influence of mitochondria in Indian buffalo remains unexplored. Therefore, in order to understand functions of mitochondria, their energy-related processes, or any additional mitochondrial traits in buffaloes, it is imperative to isolate high-yield mitochondria with purity and functionality. Mitochondria are extracted by few conventional buffers. These buffers were previously characterized for their effectiveness in isolating mitochondria from rodent and human tissues. Therefore, the present study is to assess the performance of mitochondria isolation buffers specifically in buffalo tissues. Methods: The study involved isolation of mitochondria from four different tissues, i.e., liver, brain, heart and muscles of slaughtered buffalo (n=3),using:(i) Tris-Mannitol buffer (ii) Tris-Sucrose buffer, and (iii) MOPS-Sucrose buffer. Buffer efficiency in preserving high fidelity during mitochondria isolation was assessed by comparison with Cayman's MitoCheck (R) Mitochondrial Isolation Kit (control). Further mitochondrial purity and functionality was assessed through comparative estimation of protein concentration and marker enzyme assays, respectively. Results: Our results revealed insights into the suitability of specific buffer for functional mitochondria isolation from specific type of buffalo tissue. Notably for obtaining high quality functional mitochondria from buffalo, MOPS-Sucrose buffer appeared optimal for soft tissues (liver and brain), while Tris-Mannitol buffer was efficient for hard tissues (muscles and heart).Conclusions: Thus, our research highlights the influence of buffer composition and tissue-specific variations in buffer effectiveness on mitochondrial activity in different tissues, leading to improved mitochondrial isolation in buffalo.(c) 2024 S.

AB  - The gray brocket deer, Mazama gouazoubira, occurs in South America and presents an extensive degree of morphological and genetic variability. Previous phylogenetic research showed that the genus Mazama is polyphyletic and imposed the designation of a different genus-group name for M. gouazoubira. We aimed to review and clarify the taxonomy of M. gouazoubira through the proposal of updating the nomenclature for this taxon and by the characterization of specimens collected close to the original type locality (topotypes). The topotypes were characterized by morphological (general characterization and morphometry), cytogenetic (conventional staining, Ag-NOR, G- and C-banding, and fluorescence in situ hybridization), and phylogenetic (mitogenomes) approaches. We revealed chromosome homologies between cattle and M. gouazoubira using an entire set of cattle whole chromosome painting probes and propose an updated G-band idiogram for the species. The morphometric analysis did not discriminate the individuals of M. gouazoubira, including the topotypes, from other small brocket deer species. However, the phylogenetic analysis, based on a Bayesian inference tree of the mitogenomes, confirmed the polyphyly of the genus Mazama and supported the need to change the gray brocket deer genus-group name. Based on our revision, we validated the genus Subulo, and fixed a type species for the genus. In the absence of the holotype, we denominated a neotype described by the collection of a male topotype in Paraguay. The nomenclature rearrangement presented here is a starting point that will assist in the taxonomic resolution of Neotropical deer.

AB  - Processed milk and milk products produced from bovine milk, commonly contain beta-casein A1 (beta CA1) and beta-casein A2 (beta CA2). Since the presence of beta CA1 is linked to milk intolerance and digestion problems, A2A2 milk, which only contains beta CA2, is proposed as a healthier alternative. To support this health claim, the purity of A2A2-milk has to be guaranteed. In the presented study, a multiplex immunoassay, able to distinguish between beta CA2 and beta CA1, was developed and real-life applicability was shown on raw milk samples from genotyped A1A1, A1A2 and A2A2 cows. Because of its ability to discriminate between beta CA2 and beta CA1, this newly developed method was able to detect the addition of common bovine A1A2 milk to A2A2 milk, as low as 1%. Besides the detection of A2A2 milk purity, the developed assay can also be implemented as a rapid phenotyping method at dairy farms to replace the more invasive DNA-based screening. Additionally, the developed method was capable of detecting the addition of common bovine milk up to 1% in sheep, goat, buffalo, horse and donkey milk, which conforms to EU recommendations. In conclusion, a newly developed multiplex method capable of reliably detecting the dilution of A2A2 milk of multiple species, with common bovine milk up to 1%, is presented.

AB  - Goat milk is rich in various nutrients that are beneficial for human health. However, the genomic evolution and genetic basis underlying the nutritional value and unique flavor formation in dairy goats remain poorly understood. In the present study, we generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for dairy goats comprising 2.63 Gb with a contig N50 of 43 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 101 Mb. Genome quality comparisons revealed that the dairy goat genome has higher integrity and continuity than the published goat and sheep genomes. The identification of genes under positive selection in dairy goats highlights potential candidates to explain their high milk production. Comparative genomic analysis elucidates the adaptive evolutionary mechanisms of dairy goats such as strong disease resistance, broad adaptability, and unique milk flavor. Moreover, we demonstrate the conservation of the lactation gene network and identify new potential regulators associated with lipid metabolism. Additionally, we establish the regulatory landscape of lactation for the first time in dairy goats, revealing its unique gene regulatory characteristics. Hence, our study not only provides the first chromosome-level reference genome for dairy goat, but also offers potential research directions for dairy production and genetic improvement.

KW  - IDENTIFICATION
AB  - Simple Summary Identifying individual sheep accurately is crucial for establishing precise animal husbandry. In the process of identifying sheep by their faces, changes in sheep face poses and different camera angles can affect the identification accuracy. In this study, we construct a new sheep face recognition model. Sheep face data with different poses and angles are used as input in a bilinear feature extraction network, which extracts the important features of sheep faces separately. Then, a feature fusion method is used to fuse the features extracted by the bilinear network for sheep face recognition. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the algorithm is 99.43%, achieving the individual recognition of sheep in complex environments while reducing the influence of pose and angle on recognition. A key prerequisite for the establishment of digitalized sheep farms and precision animal husbandry is the accurate identification of each sheep's identity. Due to the uncertainty in recognizing sheep faces, the differences in sheep posture and shooting angle in the recognition process have an impact on the recognition accuracy. In this study, we propose a deep learning model based on the RepVGG algorithm and bilinear feature extraction and fusion for the recognition of sheep faces. The model training and testing datasets consist of photos of sheep faces at different distances and angles. We first design a feature extraction channel with an attention mechanism and RepVGG blocks. The RepVGG block reparameterization mechanism is used to achieve lossless compression of the model, thus improving its recognition efficiency. Second, two feature extraction channels are used to form a bilinear feature extraction network, which extracts important features for different poses and angles of the sheep face. Finally, features at the same scale from different images are fused to enhance the feature information, improving the recognition ability and robustness of the network. The test results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively reduce the effect of sheep face pose on the recognition accuracy, with recognition rates reaching 95.95%, 97.64%, and 99.43% for the sheep side-, front-, and full-face datasets, respectively, outperforming several state-of-the-art sheep face recognition models.

AB  - Heat waves, brief periods of unusually high temperatures, are damaging to agroecosystems and are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Despite growing appreciation for the threat that heat waves pose to agricultural sustainability, we have a poor understanding of what determines their impact on agroecological interactions in the field. Here, we report the results of a field experiment that examined how heat waves and their timing interact with crop pest resistance to influence the interactions between potato (Solanum tuberosum) and its most damaging pest, the Colorado potato beetle (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata). We used open-top chambers and ceramic heaters to generate heat wave conditions in field plots with pest-resistant and pest-susceptible potato varieties at four CPB developmental stages. We then assessed CPB performance, leaf herbivory, and tuber yield. The neonate-stage heat wave reduced larval survival by 10%, but the surviving larvae were 18% larger and developed 15% faster. However, these effects occurred only on the susceptible variety; both larval survival and growth were unaffected by the heat wave in the pest-resistant variety. Moreover, the neonate-stage heat wave reduced adult survival by 15%, suggesting negative carry-over effects of early-life heat exposure. Heat wave events after the neonate stage had no effects on CPB performance, crop damage, or tuber yield. Our results indicate that timing and pest resistance in crops are essential for understanding the impacts of extreme heat events on crop-pest dynamics. Agroecological pest management in an increasingly variable and extreme climate will likely benefit from the development of strategies that account for the seasonal timing of potential heat events and from the continued use of crop varieties bred for pest resistance, which our results suggest may dampen the impacts of extreme temperatures on crop-pest interactions.

AB  - From the world's highlight on dangers of tuberculosis as a zoonotic and debilitating disease threatening animal and human health beside economy, this research aimed to determine the prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis from buffaloes' mastitic milk by isolation on Lowenstein-Jensen medium (LJ medium), Ziehl-Neelsen staining; identification by different biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 500bp diagnostic for M. bovis, as well as (2) to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the various antimicrobials (9 types) on the isolated M. bovis by using different antimicrobial sensitivity plate method. A total number of 100 samples of mastitic milk from native lactating buffaloes' breed were collected aseptically from 4 private farms in Cairo-Alexandria desert road in the north part of the Egypt and subjected to bacteriological and molecular examination for M. bovis followed by their antibiogram profile. Seven (7%) isolates were identified as M. bovis from totally examined 100 milk samples and isolated M. bovis showed resistance to ciprofloxacin; gentamycin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim while were intermediate sensitive to both of erythromycin and norfloxacin but on the contrary were sensitive to amikacin; cefotaxime; clindamycin and streptomycin. It can be concluded that M. bovis can be the causative agent of mastitis in Egyptian Buffaloes and could be a potential risk for zoonotic transmission to man as well as economic losses. So, strict hygienic regulations and novel diagnostic tools should be used for prevention and detection of tuberculous mastitis in buffaloes' farms. The general public health should also be intensely warned from consuming raw or unpasteurized milk. All these prophylactic measures will eventually lead to a positive impact on public health.

AB  - The literature shows that vector-transmitted plant viruses mediate host volatile biosynthesis to attract vectors and repel non-vectors, benefiting plant-infecting viruses and enhancing their spread. In this study, pepper veinal yellows virus (PeVYV) and its encoded movement protein P4 were shown to mediate host volatile biosynthesis to co-attract its exclusive vector aphids and non-vector Q-whiteflies; both have been proven to have existing food competition. The P4 protein enhances the biosynthesis of three volatiles and reduces the biosynthesis of one volatile involved in co-attracting and co-repelling aphids and Q-whiteflies. Viral replication is enhanced significantly in plants co-fed on by aphids and Q-whiteflies compared with plants fed on individual insects. Viral replication is enhanced significantly in the early stage for plants fed on by Q-whiteflies while in the late stage for plants fed on by aphids. Trans-zeatin (tZ) biosynthesis was increased in plants fed on by aphids and Q-whiteflies, and tZ enhanced viral replication in these plants. These data suggest that the PeVYV P4 protein mediates host volatile biosynthesis to co-attract vectors and non-vectors, benefiting viral infection probably by enhancing tZ biosynthesis. Data in this study have broad implications regarding the ecological significance of whiteflies in various agricultural ecosystems where aphids are the key viral transmitters.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal myiasis in European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is a pathological condition caused by the larval stages of Cephenemyia stimulator, a fly from the Oestridae family. These larvae reside in the host's upper respiratory tract for months, inducing significant tissue damage and clinical symptoms. The lifecycle of Cephenemyia stimulator is complex, involving three larval stages before maturation into adult flies, with each stage contributing to the progressive pathology observed in the host. Despite their prevalence, the histopathological effects of these larvae in the nasal and nasopharyngeal cavities have been understudied. Our study fills this knowledge gap by providing a detailed histopathological analysis of the affected tissues, using various staining techniques to reveal the extent and nature of the damage caused by these parasitic larvae. This histopathological examination reveals significant alterations within the nasopharyngeal mucosa and nasal cavity, including erythematous changes, mucosal metaplasia, fibrosis, and tissue necrosis. Parasitic cysts and eosinophilic infiltration further characterize the impact of the infestation, compromising not only the mucosal integrity but also potentially the olfactory function of the affected animals. This research is crucial for understanding the impact of myiasis on both the health and olfactory capabilities of roe deer populations and could have significant implications for wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary Highly digestible and high-quality proteins are especially needed in weaned pigs to alleviate weaning stress in piglets. Fishmeal (FM) and soybean protein (SPC) are two commonly used protein supplements in the diets of weaned pigs, but the high prices of those two kinds of ingredients have prompted a search for an alternative cost-effective protein source. After the removal of anti-nutritional factors, degossypolized cottonseed protein (DCP) shows potential as an alternative to FM and SPC. In this study, the effects on weaned piglets of replacing FM and SPC with DCP in diets were evaluated. The results showed that replacing FM with DCP weakens the small intestinal morphology and decreases nutrient digestibility, but improves the community structures of cecum microbiota that relieve these negative effects without impairing the growth performance of weaned piglets. The inclusion of high-quality proteins is commonly used in swine production, especially in weaned pigs. Our research investigated the effects of replacing fishmeal (FM) and soybean protein concentrate (SPC) with degossypolized cottonseed protein (DCP) on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, intestinal morphology, cecum microbiota and fermentation in weaned pigs. A total of 90 pigs were used in a 4-week trial. Pigs were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments (initial BW 8.06 +/- 0.26 kg; six pigs per pen; five pens per treatment), including a basal diet group (CON) with a 6% SPC and 6% FM; two experimental diets group (SPCr and FMr) were formulated by replacing SPC or FM with 6% DCP, respectively. There were no differences in growth performance and diarrhea rate among three treatments except for the ADFI during day 14 to day 28. Using the DCP to replace FM would weaken the jejunum morphology and decrease the nutrient digestibility of pigs during day 0 to day 14. However, replacing FM with DCP can improve the community structure of cecum microbiota, and may relieve these negative effects. In conclusion, DCP can be used as a cost-effective alternative protein supplement.

AB  - Human behavior shapes both our impact on nature and the success of solutions to safeguard it. We used crime opportunity and deterrence theory, together with methods from epidemiology, to link space-time patterns in 560 rhino poaching incidents (2011-2021) to poacher and ranger behavior in a South African rhino stronghold. Poaching activity was significantly associated with proximity to ranger camps. Together with supplementary evidence we present from internal investigations, this suggests that criminal syndicates collude with some rangers to facilitate poaching. Poachers repeatedly targeted specific regions of the reserve for set periods before shifting, mirroring the "near-repeat" behavior observed for other crimes. Poachers also avoided tourist activity and minimized time on the reserve. Results suggest poachers strategically leverage space-time variation in opportunity and risk. Solutions based on these behavioral insights include early response to space-time clusters of poaching, spatially targeted implementation of rhino dehorning, and bolstering ranger resilience to the corrupting influence of criminal syndicates.

AB  - Pollution of ecosystems by heavy metals such as mercury is currently a great concern. Mercury (Hg) can be released into the environment anthropogenically, but it is also naturally present in small quantities in all environmental compartments. Many different factors contribute to different rates of Hg deposition in animal bodies. The aim of this work is to describe how Hg concentrations in the bodies of small rodents change throughout the season at a site where massive anthropogenic pollution is not expected. Mice of the genus Apodemus were sampled during the whole year. Samples of blood, hair, liver, kidney, and brain were analyzed. Total Hg concentrations were measured by DMA-80. The mean Hg concentrations in examined organs were in the order hairs > kidney > liver > blood > brain, and their values decreased from 0.0500 to 0.0046 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Males and females did not differ in contamination levels, but age-dependent differences in Hg concentrations were found. It was also identified how Hg concentrations in different organs correlate with each other. Different levels of seasonal variability were detected in Hg concentrations in blood, hair, and kidney.

AB  - The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in plants can be influenced by abiotic factors such as light, temperature and moisture, as well as biotic factors like herbivory, oviposition, and pathogen damage. The influence of symbiotic microorganisms on VOC emission is less explored. Although it is widely known that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can significantly affect host plant metabolism, their role in VOC emission in trees remains under-investigated. Here, we examine the impact of AM fungi on VOC production in the South American willow tree, Salix humboldtiana. We assessed the effects of inoculation with AM fungi on plant growth and larval feeding by the willow sawfly Nematus oligospilus, as well as its impact on the plant's VOC emission profile. Willow plants inoculated with AM fungi exhibited increased leaf biomass and reduced damage incidence from willow sawfly larvae, supporting the role of mycorrhiza as a protective symbiosis. Notably, AM fungi-inoculated plants emitted 40% less total VOC compared to non-inoculated plants. Both groups emitted similar levels of monoterpenes; however, inoculated plants produced 30% fewer sesquiterpenes. Herbivory did not alter total VOC emission, but non-inoculated plants showed a reduction in (E)-beta-ocimene, which was not observed in inoculated plants. The significant decline in sesquiterpene emission of inoculated willow saplings points out the importance of considering the symbiotic microorganisms in the study of plant defenses and insect-plant interactions.

AB  - This paper offers the first cladistic analysis of the poorly known millipede genus Poecilocricus Schubart, 1962, from Brazil. The data set was composed of 18 taxa and 40 morphological characters. We performed a parsimony analysis by exhaustive search (ie; implicit enumeration) under equal weights (EW) in TNT 1.5. One most parsimonious tree with 78 steps (CI = 0.57; RI = 0.79) recovered the monophyly of the genus. Poecilocricus was supported by the following synapomorphies: median portion of mentum of the gnathochilarium with a large and rounded protuberance; second body ring excavated in ventral view; seventh body ring with internal extension on sternite; coxae of leg pairs 5, 6, and 7 expanded into a long process; apex of coxae of leg pair 3 with short thin setae on apex; medial portion of coxite of anterior gonopod with similar round bulge at both sides in anterior view; telopodite of posterior gonopod with external branch bifurcated in two short branches; and solenomere short and lanceolated. In addition, we conducted a taxonomic revision of the genus providing redescription of the type species Poecilocricus singularis Schubart, 1962, and the description of the four new species: P. mataracasp. nov., P. vazantesp. nov., P. itacarambiensissp. nov. and P. linasp. nov. Furthermore, we include an identification key to the males and a distribution map for all species of the genus.

AB  - The development of tensile stress can cause desiccation cracks, further increasing infiltration and inducing instability in green infrastructure (slopes and landfill liners). Recent research has promoted the use of biochar (i.e., stable carbon with a life period of more than 500 years) as an eco-friendly material that can provide simultaneous benefits in reducing tensile stresses and crack development, aiming to enhance landfill cover longevity. However, there is a lack of guidelines and criteria for selecting biochar (feedstock type and particle size) as landfill cover material. This study aims to investigate the effects of biochar particle size and feedstock type on cracking of soil. Two contrasting feedstock types (i.e., pig manure-based and wood-based) have been selected for amendment on lean clay soil. Laboratory experiments were conducted to monitor the cracks. The results show that wood biochar (WB) is more efficient in crack reduction than pig manure biochar (PMB). Moreover, it has been observed that fine-grained biochar is more suspectable to cracks formation regardless of biochar type. The cohesion and internal friction angle of biochar are dependent on the surface morphology of biochar. WB has more angularity and sharp edges, which can increase interlocking in soil, thereby enhancing shear resistance and, hence, soil stability. The comprehensive study can help narrow down the selectivity of biochar and its specifications to mitigate cracks and enhance the strength of landfill cover.

AB  - BackgroundCamellia oleifera Abel. is one of the four major woody oil species whose seeds produce high-grade edible oil. In recent years, the planting area of Camellia oleifera is increasing in China. However, in the process of cultivation, due to the high fruit load, the Camellia oleifera tree has small fruit and poor quality. In previous studies, we explored the optimal leaf-fruit ratio. In this study, the changes of molecular regulation mechanism of Camellia oleifera under different leaf-fruit ratios were revealed by combining physiological indexes with transcriptome data.ResultThe physiological results showed that the content of MDA and starch in leaves increased significantly with the decrease in the leaf-to-fruit ratio. The results of transcriptome showed that there was a close relationship between leaf-fruit ratio and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. With the decrease of leaf-fruit ratio, the expression of genes related to lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis increased significantly, which promoted the synthesis of lignin and flavonoid.ConclusionsCombining physiological indicators and transcriptomics, we demonstrated that leaf-fruit ratio can significantly affect the normal growth of plants. When the fruit load is too high, the fruit as a 'sink' will consume a large amount of nutrients in the plant body and promote the biosynthesis of lignin and flavonoids in the body. The results provide a more reliable scientific basis for the study of cultivation and management of Camellia oleifera.

AB  - Cyperus esculentus is an invasive sedge causing high losses in many crops. Prevention is key in minimizing further spread and damage. Propagules (tubers or seeds) may spread via cattle manure. This study examined the effect of ensiling, digestion, and storage in manure on the viability of C. esculentus propagules. Propagules were subjected to five durations (0-16 weeks) in silage maize, seven durations (0-48 h) of ruminal digestion, and five durations of storage (0-16 weeks) in manure (slurry or farmyard), or combinations of previous processes. Afterwards, the viabilities were determined by a germination and tetrazolium test. After 6 weeks in a maize silo, the viability of the propagules was reduced by at least 96%. Incubation for 36 h in the rumen, followed by post-ruminal digestion in vitro, reduced seed viability by 30%. However, for the tubers, no effect was observed. The viability of seeds and tubers was reduced by 90% after 11.5 and 13.7 weeks of incubation in slurry, respectively. Compared with seeds, tubers were less tolerant to 12-24 h of animal digestion, followed by 8 weeks of storage in slurry. Keeping a maize silo closed for at least 6 weeks and maintaining slurry storage for at least 16 weeks are excellent measures to eliminate C. esculentus. For farmers, these preventive measures are relatively easy and cheap to implement compared to the requirements of curative control methods.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in the environment. However, it is unclear whether MPs are present in mammalian lungs through inhalation, and if so, could be possibly found in fetal tissues. In this study, we aim to determine the presence and characteristics of particles in domestic and fetal pig lung tissue in the natural environment. Specimens from the lungs of domestic pigs (n = 10) and fetal pigs that already died in matrix during vaginal birth from the non-contaminated area (n = 10) were obtained from farmers' nearby sludge treatment plant. These specimens were compressed between two glass microscope slides, which were examined under polarized light microscopy. In addition, Agilent 8700 LDIR Chemical imaging system (LDIR) was used to determine the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of MPs. According to the polarized light microscope survey of domestic pig lungs, we observed an average of 12 particles/g, which was more than the 6 particles/g observed in fetal pig lungs, which ranged in size from 115.14 mu m to 1370.43 mu m. All the observed MP particles were fiber in shape. LDIR indicated an average of 180 particles/g of domestic pig lungs, ranging in size from 20.34 mu m to 916.36 mu m, which was twice as many MPs observed in fetal pig lungs. Furthermore, the compo-sitions of MPs were different between them. LDIR indicated that polyamide (PA) was the most common polymer identified in domestic pig lungs (46.11%), while polycarbonate (PC) was the most common polymer in fetal pig lungs (32.99%). These findings confirmed the presence of MPs in the lung tissue of both domestic and fetal pigs in the natural environment, but the main characteristics differed. This fact indicated the increasing risk of MPs to human respiratory tract is increasing. Further research should be conducted to entirely estimate the specific exposure level on humans and offspring.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, man has imposed his activities above the natural processes of ecosystems. Rivers have undergone major changes associated with urban centers, so monitoring them is important to determine their status and suitability to provide environmental services. Studies applying the community ecology approach, such as energy flow in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, may be appropriate to determine their status and functioning. This study characterized an Andean river that runs across the city of Ayacucho (Peru). Water physicochemical parameters and biotic quality indices were used and compared with the abundance of trophic guild components and functional feeding groups to demonstrate that the latter are at least equally suitable to estimate water quality. The river section studied ranged from 2640 to 2900 m a.s.l. and was monitored in the wet and dry seasons. Six monitoring stations were established according to the extent of the influence of the urban center. Water physicochemical variables and macroinvertebrate abundances were determined. A Surber net was used for multihabitat sampling; macroinvertebrates were identified to genus level (in most cases) and counted to estimate relative abundances. Trophic guilds (detritivore, predator, herbivore) were formed using the genus data from identification according to the information available in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru. Functional feeding groups were set based on the classification of families. The sensitivity of trophic metrics was assessed by relating them to environmental variables and the Andean Biotic Index (ABI), the Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted for Colombia (BMWP/Col.), and the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) indices. Environmental variables and biotic indices increased significantly in the most impacted stations, where the abundance of most taxa decreased. The components of trophic guilds and functional groups varied, and those feeding on fine particles increased in sites with a higher urban impact. The metrics based on trophic characteristics were highly correlated with the BMWP/Col and ABI indices. Therefore, these indices can be used to estimate river water quality and provide information on its functioning.

AB  - Wildlife vertebrate hosts are integral to enzootic cycles of tick-borne pathogens, and in some cases have played key roles in the recent rise of ticks and tick-borne diseases in North America. In this forum article, we highlight roles that wildlife hosts play in the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic, companion animal, livestock, and wildlife tick-borne pathogens. We begin by illustrating how wildlife contribute directly and indirectly to the increase and geographic expansion of ticks and their associated pathogens. Wildlife provide blood meals for tick growth and reproduction; serve as pathogen reservoirs; and can disperse ticks and pathogens-either through natural movement (e.g., avian migration) or through human-facilitated movement (e.g., wildlife translocations and trade). We then discuss opportunities to manage tick-borne disease through actions directed at wildlife hosts. To conclude, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of the ecology of tick-host interactions, emphasizing that wildlife host communities are themselves a very dynamic component of tick-pathogen-host systems and therefore complicate management of tick-borne diseases, and should be taken into account when considering host-targeted approaches. Effective management of wildlife to reduce tick-borne disease risk further requires consideration of the 'human dimensions' of wildlife management. This includes understanding the public's diverse views and values about wildlife and wildlife impacts-including the perceived role of wildlife in fostering tick-borne diseases. Public health agencies should capitalize on the expertise of wildlife agencies when developing strategies to reduce tick-borne disease risks.

AB  - Phosphor-in-glass (PiG) composed of glass matrix and the embedded phosphor particles has been intensively developed to meet the requirement of high-power LED lighting sources. P2O5-based glass matrices are the promising candidates to fabricate high luminescence PiG in view of their low-melting temperature to avoid the erosion of phosphor by glass melting, however, their poor chemical durability limited the practical application. In this work, the water durability of PiG basing on SnCl2-P2O5-ZnO glass matrix embedded with YAG:Ce3+ phosphor is demonstrated. With the addition of ZnO, the water durability of SnCl2-P2O5-based PiG is enhanced significantly without obvious loss of light output. The influence of ZnO addition with variable contents on the microstructure, photoluminescent properties and the water durability of the obtained PiG is investigated through a series of characterizations. The obvious improvement of the water erosion resistance induced by adding ZnO provides an optional route to develop higher stability, lead-free, cost-effective low-melting point P2O5-based glass matrix for fabrication of high performance PiG materials.

AB  - The forest musk deer (FMD) (Moschus berezovskii) represents an endemic and endangered species in East Asia, valued for biodiversity conservation and musk economy. In recent decades, various research has investigated the ecology and biology of FMD. However, a bibliometric analysis is currently missing. This work, for the first time, elucidates the current research trends and hotspots of FMD by analyzing annual publication volume, citations, samples, and keywords from FMD-related publications in two prominent databases: the Web of Science (WoS), and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The results reveal that (1) both WoS and CNKI publications exhibit fluctuating growth patterns, with CNKI initiating earlier (in 1958) than WoS (1990), however, WoS publications have recently surpassed CNKI. (2) Highly cited WoS articles primarily concentrate on the micro-ecology of captive FMD, whereas highly cited CNKI literature highlights the macro-ecology of wild FMD. (3) CNKI research encompasses a broader array of samples compared to WoS studies. (4) The Citespace keyword timeline maps indicated that WoS research centered on subjects such as "microsatellite loci" and "gut microbiota," while CNKI studies prioritized themes like "camera trap" and "musk," alongside a global emphasis on the "musk gland." Research on FMD reveals significant developmental potential, yet numerous areas remain underexplored. The current FMD study mostly focuses on disease mechanisms and musk secretion in captive populations. However, research on ecology and the conservation of wild populations is seriously lacking. Future studies should focus on key research areas such as FMD rewilding and reintroduction programs, non-invasive sampling techniques, synthetic musk, and gut probiotics. Pertinent research will inform conservation and sustainable utilization practices for FMD.

AB  - A case study in Indonesia of circular bioeconomy implementation was investigated by managing livestock wastes, especially goat manure (GM), which an excess of its availability may be adverse to the environment. The efficacy of this scenario to control pollution or to increase productivity still needs to be proven. Hence, this research aimed to study the possibility of circular bioeconomy implementation using biotic and abiotic resources in Indonesia under excessive nutrients (GM and mycorrhizal) on P. angulata production. Outdoor factorial container experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design in Central Java, Indonesia. Treatments included four levels of GM (0, 10, 20, 30 g plant(-1)) and four levels of mycorrhizal (0, 10, 20, 30 g plant(-1)) applied in the soil with six replications. This case study revealed that the use of mycorrhizal inoculant and GM indicated no significant difference to most of P. angulata's growth and yield parameters. The implementation of circular bioeconomy through integrated farming of P. angulata was not an instant solution for economic and environmental optimization, but can be considered as a way to tackle environmental problem due to the excessive livestock wastes. The environmental sustainability can be achieved step by step, without hindering farmers' income.

AB  - Hunter harvest data are important components of game species management and conservation, and natural resource agencies often use self-reporting mechanisms to collect harvest data. Despite the advantages of self-reporting systems, hunter noncompliance with mandatory reporting remains a challenge for managers. Our objective was to utilize the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and concepts of organizational trust to understand factors influencing hunter compliance and satisfaction with mandatory harvest reporting. We distributed questionnaires through email channels and postcards mailed to resident deer hunters in Georgia, USA. Structural equation model results from the 1712 survey responses suggest that TPB constructs (attitudes, perceived behavioral control, social norms), organizational trust, and satisfaction with hunting experience positively influenced satisfaction with mandatory reporting. In contrast, the number of years an individual has been hunting negatively influenced satisfaction. Further, we tested a binary logistic regression model to predict potential drivers of compliant behavior with harvest reporting requirements. Our model found that attitudes, social norms, and satisfaction with reporting positively impacted reporting compliance. However, results also indicate that older, more experienced hunters were less likely to report harvests. Our findings suggest that targeting efforts towards increasing trust, positive attitudes, and satisfaction with regulations and regulatory systems among older, more experienced hunters may positively influence compliant behavior. Our study emphasizes the importance of engaging hunters in regulatory decision-making processes and improving agency-hunter relationships to achieve greater regulatory compliance and satisfaction.

AB  - Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs commonly given to patients with estrogen receptor (ER)dependent breast cancers to reduce estrogenic stimulation. However, AIs like Letrozole are associated with negative side effects such as cognitive deficits, sleep disturbances and hot flashes. We have previously shown that these negative effects can be recapitulated in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) treated with Letrozole (20 mu g daily) for 4 weeks and that marmosets treated with Letrozole show increased levels of estradiol in the hippocampus (Gervais et al., 2019). In order to better understand the mechanisms through which AIs affect cognitive function and increase steroid levels in the hippocampus, we used bulk, paired-end RNA-sequencing to examine differentially expressed genes among Letrozole-treated (LET; n = 8) and vehicle-treated (VEH; n = 8) male and female animals. Gene ontology results show significant reduction across hundreds of categories, some of the most significant being inflammatory response, stress response, MHC Class II protein complex binding, Tcell activation, carbohydrate binding and signaling receptor binding in LET animals. GSEA results indicate that LET females, but not LET males, show enrichment for hormonal gene sets. Based on the transcriptional changes observed, we conclude that AIs may differentially affect the sexes in part due to processes mediated by the CYP450 superfamily. Ongoing studies will further investigate the longitudinal effects of AIs on behavior and whether AIs increase the risk of stress-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Objectives Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease whose causes are not fully understood, but a longstanding hypothesis is that OA stems primarily from the cumulative effects of joint mechanical loading throughout life. Based on this wear and tear hypothesis, anthropologists have assumed that the presence of OA in archeological human skeletons can be interpreted as evidence of a highly physically active lifestyle. Here, we use guinea pigs to experimentally test the hypothesis that higher levels of routine physical activity result in greater OA degeneration. Materials and methods Guinea pigs are a useful model for OA research because they spontaneously develop the disease in a manner similar to humans. One group of growing animals was housed for 22 weeks in a large room that promoted voluntary physical activity (4.8 km of movement per day, on average), while animals in another group were housed in small cages that restricted their mobility (n = 15/group). After the experiment, histological and microcomputed tomographic analyses were conducted focusing on the knees. Results Rather than causing greater OA degeneration, elevated levels of routine physical activity resulted in significantly less knee cartilage deterioration, less synovial inflammation, smaller osteophytes, and maintenance of greater epiphyseal trabecular bone quantity. Discussion These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that high levels of routine physical activity drive the pathogenesis of OA and call into question typical interpretations of OA in studies of archeological human skeletons.

AB  - More than half of all insect species utilize various natural liquids as primary diet. The concentrated liquids with energy-dense nutrition can provide highly favorable rewards, however, their high-viscosity poses challenges to the insect for ingesting. Here we show that rhinoceros beetles, Trypoxylus dichotomus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), are capable of ingesting sugar solutions with viscosities spanning four orders of magnitude, exhibiting extraordinary adaptability to diverse natural liquid sources. We discovered a previously unidentified maxillaesweeping motion that beetles preferentially adopt to consume highly viscous liquids, achieving a higher feeding rate than the more common direct sucking. By utilizing morphological characterizations, flow visualization, and fluid-structure coupling simulation, we revealed the underlying mechanisms of how this maxillary movement facilitates the transportation of viscous liquid. Our findings not only shed light on the multifunctionality of beetle mouthparts but also provide insights into the adaptability of generalized mouthparts to a broad range of fluid sources.

AB  - Due to lifespan extension and changes in global climate, the increase in mycoses caused by primary and opportunistic fungal pathogens is now a global concern. Despite increasing attention, limited options are available for the treatment of systematic and invasive mycoses, owing to the evolutionary similarity between humans and fungi. Although plants produce a diversity of chemicals to protect themselves from pathogens, the molecular targets and modes of action of these plant-derived chemicals have not been well characterized. Using a reverse genetics approach, the present study revealed that thymol, a monoterpene alcohol from Thymus vulgaris L., (Lamiaceae), exhibits antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans by regulating multiple signaling pathways including calcineurin, unfolded protein response, and HOG (high-osmolarity glycerol) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways. Thymol treatment reduced the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ by controlling the expression levels of calcium transporter genes in a calcineurin-dependent manner. We demonstrated that thymol decreased N-glycosylation by regulating the expression levels of genes involved in glycan-mediated post-translational modifications. Furthermore, thymol treatment reduced endogenous ergosterol content by decreasing the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes in a HOG MAPK pathway-dependent manner. Collectively, this study sheds light on the antifungal mechanisms of thymol against C. neoformans.

AB  - The identification of kinematic subpopulations is of paramount importance to understanding the biological nature of the sperm heterogeneity. Nowadays, the data of motility parameters obtained by a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system has been used as input to distinct algorithms to identify kinematic subpopulations. In contrast, the images of the trajectories were depicted only as examples of the patterns of motility in each subpopulation. Here, python code was written to reconstruct the images of trajectories, from their coordinates, then the images of trajectories were used as input to a machine learning clustering algorithm of classification, and the subpopulations were described statistically by the motility parameters. Finally, the images of trajectories in each subpopulation were displayed in a way we called Pollock plots. Semen samples of boar sperm were treated with distinct concentrations of ketanserin (an antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptor of serotonin) and untreated samples were used as a control. The motility of sperm in each sample was analyzed at 0 and 30 min of incubation. Six subpopulations were found. The subpopulation 2 presented the highest values of velocities at 0 or 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, the ketanserin increased the values of the curvilinear velocity at high concentrations, whereas the linearity and the straight velocity decreased. Our computational model permits better identification of the kinematic subpopulations than the traditional approach and provides insights onto the heterogeneity of the response to ketanserin; thus, it could significantly impact the research on the relationship between sperm heterogeneity-fertility.

AB  - Behavioural complexity is likely to reflect how animals cope with their environment. A large behavioural repertoire and the ability to flexibly apply these behaviours provide an individual with a greater likelihood of adapting to its (captive) environment. Here, we developed a procedure to aggregate different behavioural measures into a condensed measure of behavioural complexity based on 14 features, which were previously proposed (e.g. number of behaviours, Shannon diversity index) as well as some new features of behavioural complexity (e.g. variances of within and between transition durations). To test the measure, artificial behavioural sequences with potentially varying complexity were created using an individual-based modelling approach. With a Principal Component Analysis, the features extracted from these sequences could be reduced to two components ('general complexity' and ' state variability') explaining 59.64 and 27.68% of the total variance, respectively. The effect of the aspects of the artificial behavioural sequences on ' general complexity' and ' transitions variability' were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. The number of behavioural categories and the proportion of short behavioural states had the largest effect on the components. Both components were increasing with a greater number of behavioural categories, whereas the proportion of short behavioural states the opposite effect on the components. We also tested the approach on real data-sets. The principle components were not identical to the ones from the simulation. Yet, we found consistencies and similarities in the loadings. The approach for an aggregated measure of behavioural complexity developed here could form the basis of an individual-based animal welfare indicator for intensively kept animals.

AB  - The emission of ammonia (NH3) is predominantly caused by agriculture, especially by livestock keeping. The health effects of NH3 and the related formation of particulate matter are the reasons for solid efforts to reduce their ambient concentrations. In addition, the impact of global warming on livestock is increasing due to heat stress, likely also increasing NH3 emissions. Therefore, adaptation measures are under discussion to reduce the heat stress of animals inside livestock units. Because of the relationship between temperature increase and NH3 release, the impact of the adaptation measures to cool the indoor air of livestock units (three different energy-saving air preparation systems, an inversion of the feeding and resting times by half a day, a reduction of the stocking density and doubling the maximum volume flow rate) was investigated. The NH3 release was calculated by the following predictors: indoor air temperature; ventilation rate describing the turbulence inside the livestock building; and the diurnal variation caused by the animal activity. These parameters were calculated by a simulation model for the indoor climate of livestock buildings. The monthly mean of the NH3 emission for several adaptation measures, which were applied to reduce heat stress, were compared with the emission of a reference building for 1800 fattening pigs, divided into nine sections with 200 animals each for an all-in-all-out production cycle to calculate the mitigation potential. The higher the cooling power of such adaptation measures, the higher the mitigation potential for NH3. In particular, those adaptation measures which cool the inlet air (e.g., cooling pads reduce the emission by -2%, earth-air heat exchangers by -3.1%) show the best performance to mitigate the NH3 emission of livestock buildings.

AB  - Scrapie is a notifiable transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in sheep that relies on clinical examinations for reporting suspects. A short examination protocol was used in 1002 sheep to define clinical markers suggestive of scrapie. Sheep were naturally or experimentally exposed to a classical, atypical scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent; 312 were positive for a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) by brain examination and included non-exposed controls. Assessed signs were posture, behaviour, menace, scratch and blindfolding response, wool loss and skin changes, body condition, incoordination and tremor. First, the combined occurrence of two or more clinical signs was compared between TSE-positive and negative sheep. Second, the importance of clinical markers was determined in a general classification and regression tree model. The main clinical markers to predict TSEs according to the tree model were incoordination and a positive scratch test. Test sensitivities and specificities were 70.8-81.5% and 96.1-93.0%, respectively, and predictive values above 87%. The results suggest that the short clinical protocol, which assesses the presence of certain clinical signs associated with a TSE in sheep and is quick to perform, may be useful to reach a suspect diagnosis in both naturally and experimentally generated TSEs.

AB  - The INTENSE project, supported by the EU Era-Net Facce Surplus, aimed at increasing crop production on marginal land, including those with contaminated soils. A field trial was set up at a former wood preservation site to phytomanage a Cu/PAH-contaminated sandy soil. The novelty was to assess the influence of five organic amendments differing in their composition and production process, i.e. solid fractions before and after biodigestion of pig manure, compost and compost pellets (produced from spent mushroom substrate, biogas digestate and straw), and greenwaste compost, on Cu availability, soil properties, nutrient supply, and plant growth. Organic amendments were incorporated into the soil at 2.3% and 5% soil w/w. Total soil Cu varied from 179 to 1520 mg kg(-1), and 1 M NH4NO3-extractable soil Cu ranged from 4.7 to 104 mg kg(-1) across the 25 plots. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Ella) was cultivated in plots. Changes in physico-chemical soil properties, shoot DW yield, shoot ionome, and shoot Cu uptake depending on extractable soil Cu and the soil treatments are reported. Shoot Cu concentration varied from 45 +/- 24 to 140 +/- 193 mg kg DW-1 and generally increased with extractable soil Cu. Shoot DW yield, shoot Cu concentration, and shoot Cu uptake of barley plants did not significantly differ across the soil treatments in year 1. Based on soil and plant parameters, the effects of the compost and pig manure treatments were globally discriminated from those of the untreated, greenwaste compost and digested pig manure treatments. Compost and its pellets at the 5% addition rate promoted soil functions related to primary production, water purification, and soil fertility, and the soil quality index.

AB  - With the rapid development of the pig farming industry in China, a large amount of pig manure is inevitably generated. The management and utilization of pig manure in a sustainable approach require a systematic analysis of the environmental impacts generated from the existing pig manure treatment and disposal routes. In this study, three typical pig manure treatment and disposal routes: pig manure solid-liquid separation, i) wastewater biological treatment, direct land application of manure/sludge; ii) black-film anaerobic digestion of wastewater, mono-composting of manure/sludge and land use; iii) wastewater biological treatment, co-composting of manure/sludge and land use, were comparatively assessed in terms of their environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment. The results show that the added chemicals in wastewater treatment and the consumed electricity in composting the manure/sludge are the two main contributors to all environmental impacts. Thus, using green chemicals, controlling the dosage of added chemicals accurately, and selecting composting types with low energy consumption will significantly reduce the environmental burden of pig manure treatment and disposal routes. For the global warming potential of the evaluated three pig manure treatment and disposal routes, direct emissions of greenhouse gases during the composting process contribute the most, accounting for 77 %, 95 %, and 79 %, respectively. Furthermore, the struvite recovery with anaerobic digestion from pig manure will bring excellent environmental benefits, which will markedly offset the toxicity impacts and carbon emissions derived from pig manure treatment and disposal process. Overall, this work quantitatively evaluates the potential environmental impacts of the existing pig manure treatment and disposal routes, providing insights on optimization for future technical improvement and development.

AB  - New Zealand (NZ) is an important global exporter of various livestock products, however its potential for production is being constrained by environmental restrictions. The aim of this study was to explore future pathways for NZ livestock (dairy, beef, and sheep) production from grazed pastures, which includes changes in land use, GHG mitigations, increased dairy-beef and net carbon neutrality. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to determine national level environmental impacts of livestock production in NZ. Carbon, reactive nitrogen (Nr) and Eutrophication Potential (EP) footprints on a total production basis at national level from livestock systems could be decreased by 39%, 36% and 30%, respectively. Achieving net carbon neutrality of all livestock production with a multiple mitigation scenario gave corresponding emission reductions of 41% for Nr and 36% for EP, requiring afforestation of 0.9 Mha of sheep and beef land. However, transitioning to carbon neutrality for all production reduced total livestock protein production by 7% for current systems and by 21% for the mitigation scenario compared to no carbon neutrality changes. In contrast, increased integration of dairy-derived beef increased national livestock protein production by 3%. Optimized livestock production through greater dairy beef integration and use of multiple mitigations offers the most promising pathway for low environmentalimpact livestock production in NZ. However, this should aim at minimizing effects on livestock production due to the large impact on global food exports, while higher value or premiums for low environmental-impact products will be important to encourage changes to meet the environmental constraints.

AB  - Cattle-yak, the interspecific hybrid between yak and taurine cattle, exhibits male-specific sterility. Massive loss of spermatogenic cells, especially spermatocytes, results in azoospermia in these animals. Currently, the mechanisms underlying meiosis block and defects in spermatocyte development remain elusive. The present study was designed to investigate the differences in the protein composition of spermatocytes isolated from 12-month-old yak and cattle-yak testes. Histological analysis confirmed that spermatocytes were the most advanced germ cells in the testes of yak and cattle-yak at this developmental stage. Comparative proteomic analysis identified a total of 452 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) isolated spermatocytes from cattle-yak and yak. A total of 291 proteins were only present in yak spermatocytes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the downregulated DAPs were mostly enriched in the cellular response to DNA damage stimulus and double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair via break-induced replication, while the proteins specific for yak were related to cell division and cycle, spermatogenesis, and negative regulation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Ultimately, these DAPs were related to the critical process for spermatocyte meiotic events, including DSBs, homologous recombination, synapsis, crossover formation, and germ cell apoptosis. The database composed of proteins associated with spermatogenesis, including KPNA2, HTATSF1, TRIP12, STIP1, LZTFL1, LARP7, MTCH2, STK31, ROMO1, CDK5AP2, DNMT1, RBM44, and CHRAC1, is the focus of further research on male hybrid sterility. In total, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying failed meiotic processes and male infertility in cattle-yak.

AB  - Giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera forms extensive forests on temperate reefs, providing habitat and food for a diversity of marine life. Kelp biomass varies in response to changing ocean temperatures, but physiological responses as reflected in the nutritional quality of kelp tissue are poorly understood. Over a 19-year period in southern California, we found that nutritional quality of giant kelp tissue declined; nitrogen content of giant kelp tissue declined by 18%, while carbon content proportionally increased. This decline in nutritional quality was associated with increasing seawater temperatures and with regional and local scale processes including upwelling as indicated by the biologically effective upwelling transport index, the El Nino-Southern oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre oscillation. Changes in kelp stoichiometry with seawater temperature have important implications for nutrition and behavior of key consumers, such as sea urchins. Our results suggest that the consequences of projected declines in kelp abundance due to climate change may be compounded by reductions in its nutritional quality.

AB  - The European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus is an exotic herbivorous mammal undergoing an active phase of geographical expansion in the arid ecosystems of Argentina. The Adaptive Flexibility Hypothesis states that populations at the range edge (new populations) will exhibit greater flexibility in the use of resources compared with populations located in the range core (older populations). The objective of this work was to compare the rabbit's use of spatial and trophic resources in relation to the establishment time of their populations. The sampling was carried out for 2 years (2017 and 2018) in sites with different establishment times for rabbit populations. Random sampling stratified by type of habitat was applied using 115 fixed strip transects of 1,000 m(2) laid out across the study areas. Fresh rabbit signs were recorded in each transect, and environmental and anthropic variables were measured. Our results show that the individuals from the range edge are more selective in the use of habitat than those from the range core. At the microhabitat level, we observed a pattern in the particular components of habitat use by rabbits mainly linked to food availability and proximity to water. From a trophic perspective, rabbits could show flexible adjustment to novel conditions and environments in the range edge. The variability in resource use by the European rabbit confirms its ecological flexibility, pivotal for their advance toward new environments in Argentina.

AB  - Under the current meat sheep breeding system, newborn lambs usually live with their mothers until weaning, and in daily management, they often need to be separated from their ewes for a short period due to dehorning, disease treatment, etc. Such short-term separation was considered to be a high-intensity stress for the lambs. This study aimed to explore the effects of 1 h sensory separations on behaviors and the concentration of stress-related indicators of small-tailed Han lambs. Lambs were assigned to four groups: auditory, visual, and tactile separation (AVT) group; visual and tactile separation (VT) group; tactile separation (T) group; and control (C) group. Then they were separated from their mothers for one hour on postnatal days 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Results showed the separated lambs (AVT, VT, and T groups) spent less time lying down relaxing and more time looking around, exploring, vocalizing, and attempting to escape (P < 0.05). Lambs separated by lack of tactile contact only exhibited the most escaping and moving behavior. Twin-born lambs showed less moving, escaping, and vocalizing than single-born lambs (P < 0.05). The separation also led to a rise in serum globulin levels and a decrease in tetraiodothyronine. In conclusion, this study showed that temporary 1 h ewe-lamb separations could affect behaviors and the serum levels of stress indicators of lambs. The behavioral responses were more obvious when lambs were separated by lack of tactile contact only, and in single-born lambs. It can conclude that indicated that when lambs need to be temporarily separated from ewes in daily management production, it would be better to let them stay together with their littermates, and make them avoid hearing or seeing the ewes, such management may partially reduce the separation stress, thereby improving the welfare and breeding efficiency of sheep.

AB  - Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the bottom of the scrotum. This common congenital malformation in humans and domestic animals is the best characterized risk factor for abnormal sperm functions and infertility. However, current treatment approaches for cryptorchidism do not ensure paternity in all cases. Some lineages of mammals (such as elephants and cetaceans) have natural ascrotal testes (i.e., undescended or incompletely descended testes) and normal sperm motility and fertility, providing an opportunity to understand the genetic basis of cryptorchidism. In this study, we showed that genes associated with sperm motility and competition/fertility in ascrotal mammals experienced frequent, strong selective pressure. The fixation of specific amino acids and positive selection in ascrotal mammals could affect the physicochemical properties and functions of fertilization-related proteins. In a comparison between mammals with undescended testes and incompletely descended testes, discrepancies in genes showing evidence for adaptive evolution and in functional enrichment suggested that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of fertility in the challenging testicular environment. Our findings revealed substantial heterogeneity in the divergence of fertilization-related genes between natural scrotal and ascrotal mammals and provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying normal sperm motility and competition in natural ascrotal mammals. We provide a detailed theoretical basis for understanding the pathology of cryptorchidism from a molecular evolutionary perspective. This study may contribute to the establishment of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for sperm motility and fertility disorders due to congenital cryptorchidism in humans and domestic animals.

AB  - Starch, the primary determinant of wheat grain yield, contributes 65-75% grain dry weight and 80% of the endosperm dry weight. The starch biosynthetic pathway is regulated by several enzymes, of which the soluble starch synthase (SS) is the most crucial enzyme and is sensitive to environmental change. In the present study, we targeted identifying the unique haplotypes of SSI gene in 17 different wild and cultivated genotypes of wheat, selected for abiotic stress tolerance. Four unique SNPs corresponding to non-synonymous substitution were identified from wild progenitor species, Aegilops tauschii (accessions pau14102 and pau3747), Ae. speltoides (pau15081) and T. dicoccoides (pau7107), each present in exon-1. However, two unique SNPs corresponding to non-synonymous substitution were identified from cultivated wheats, Impala and C591, present in exon-2 and exon-4, respectively. These SNPs correspond to the N-terminal half of the GT5 domain in exon 1-6 and are expected as novel haplotypes contributing to better grain filling and starch deposition under changing environmental conditions. The positive effects of these haplotypes need further validation through molecular and phenotypic evaluation.

AB  - In recent years, overuse of chemical fertilization has led to soil acidification and decreased rice yield productivity in southern China. Biochar and manure co-application remediation may have positive effects on rice yield and improve acid paddy soil fertility. This study was conducted to understand the effects of co-application of wood biochar and pig manure on rice yield and acid paddy soil quality (0-40 cm soil layers) in a 5-year field experiment. The experiment consisted of six treatments: no biochar and no fertilizer (CK); biochar only (BC); mineral fertilizer (N); mineral fertilizer combined with biochar (N + BC); manure (25% manure N replacing fertilizer N) combined with mineral fertilizer (MN); and manure combined with mineral fertilizer and biochar (MN + BC). Total nitrogen application for each treatment was the same at 270 kg nitrogen ha(-1)y(-1), and 30 t ha(-1) biochar was added to the soil only in the first year. After five years, compared with N treatments, N + BC, MN, and MN + BC treatments increased the rice yield rate to 2.8%, 4.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, by improving soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and available phosphate under a 0-40 cm soil layer. MN + BC had the strongest resistance to soil acidification among all the treatments. The interaction between fertilizers and biochar application was significant (p < 0.05) in rice yield, soil electrical conductivity (10-20 cm), and soil available phosphate (20-40 cm). Principal component analysis indicated that the effect of manure on soil property was stronger than that of biochar in the 0-40 cm soil layer. The overall rice yield and soil fertility decreased in the order of biochar + mineral fertilizer + manure > mineral fertilizer + manure > biochar + mineral fertilizer > mineral fertilizer > biochar > control. These results suggest that biochar and manure co-application is a long-term viable strategy for improving acid soil productivity due to its improvements in soil pH, organic carbon, nutrient retention, and availability.

AB  - To determine the optimal co-digestion conditions for four mixed vegetable crop residues (including cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and pepper, mixed in equal parts by mass) with pig manure, we conducted a study using response surface methodology (RSM). The interaction effects of parameters, such as manure-to-mixed vegetable residue ratios (M/S), initial pH, and organic load (OL) with respect to cumulative methane yield, were investigated. The results showed that the influence of each factor on the CMY is in the following order: initial pH > M/S > OL. The highest cumulative methane yield was calculated to be 380.50 mL/g VS at an initial pH of 7.3, OL of 18.8 g VS/L, and M/S of 3.9:1. Comparison and verification experiments showed that under optimized conditions, the co-digestion process showed increased methane yield and had practical application value. The microbial analysis showed that the relative abundances of bacterial taxa, such as Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Fastidiosipila, and Terrisporobacter, were all highest in the co-digestion samples under optimized process conditions (PV). Different types of methanogenic archaea taxa in PV samples were richer than in other samples, which showed higher relative abundances of Methanogenium, Methanobrevibacter, Methanoplanus, Methanospirillum, and Methanobrevibacter. Thus, the co-digestion system of a mixture of vegetable residues and pig manure can enrich different types of methanogenic archaea taxa, which leads to increased digestion performance and may strengthen process stability. Importantly, pig manure and mixed vegetable residues can be included in anaerobic digestion applications through co-digestion, thus enabling the valorization of these substantial residues and engineering for applications.

AB  - This study identified helminthic species among wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Primorsky Krai, Russia. In total, 66 fecal samples were taken from wild boars and examined using the floatation-sedimentation method to identify helminths eggs and protozoan cysts. Age and sex were estimated for each host animal investigated. The helminthic fauna of the wild boars examined involved six parasite genera, but 4 are helminths and 2 are protozoans: the nematodes Metastrongylus spp., Trichuris suis, Capillaria sp. and Ascaris suum; and the protozoan parasites Eimeria sp. and Cystoisospora suis. The most prevalent parasite was Metastrongylus spp. (13.6 %) followed by Trichuris suis (7.6 %). The other parasites found were Eimeria sp. (3 %), Ascaris suum (3 %), Capillaria sp. (1.5 %) and Cystoisospora suis (1.5 %). Not found positive correlation between the host's age and sex and the parasite prevalence. This was the first detailed study on helminths infections among wild boars in Primorsky Krai.

AB  - Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin found in foods, has a deleterious effect on female reproduction owing to its endocrine-disrupting activity mediated through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the mechanisms of OTA-induced ER stress in pig embryos during in vitro culture (IVC) are not yet fully understood. In the present study, porcine embryos were cultured for two days in an IVC medium supplemented with 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mu M OTA, which led to an OTA-induced reduction in the developmental rate of blastocysts. The mRNA-seq transcriptome analysis revealed that the reduced blastocyst development ability of OTA-exposed porcine embryos was caused by ER stress, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of ROS and the occurrence of apoptosis. The expression levels of some UPR/PERK signaling-related genes (DDIT3, EIF2AK3, EIF2S1, NFE2L2, ATF4, EIF2A , and KEAP1) were found to differ in OTA-exposed pig embryos. OTA induces DNA damage by triggering an increase in RAD51/gamma-H2AX levels and suppressing p-NRF2 activity. This effect is mediated through intracellular ROS and superoxide accumulation in the nuclei of porcine embryos. The cytotoxicity of OTA increased the activation of the PERK signal pathways (p-PERK, PERK, p-eIF2 alpha, eIF2 alpha, ATF4, and CHOP) in porcine embryos, with abnormal distribution of the ER observed around the nucleus. Collectively, our findings indicate that ER stress is a major cause of decline in the development of porcine embryos exposed to OTA. Therefore, OTA exposure induces ER stress and DNA damage via oxidative stress by disrupting PERK/NRF2 signaling activity in the developmental competence of porcine embryos during IVC.

AB  - This research assesses the environmental uses of Haleakala Crater, and adjoining east Maui areas, by native Hawaiians during recent centuries, and evaluates the modern utilization of this volcanic depression. The study methods examine, and focus on, numerous historical and modern accounts and reports. Three historical periods were identified as follows: (1). A phase, from the similar to 1400s until contact with foreigners in 1778, characterized by the development of settlements, population expansion, the intensification of traditional agriculture, and the political consolidation of Maui. The construction of the Kiha-a-Pi'i-lani trail across the crater enhanced travel between distant island areas. (2). Following the collapse of Maui's human populations during the late 1700s, and until the 20th century, came a period distinguished by scientific exploration of the crater, and intentional or accidental introductions of animals, including goats, horses, cattle, and wild dogs. (3). After Haleakala became a National Park in 1916, efforts to eradicate introduced animals and to encourage the reproduction of silverswords and other plants were initiated. Unfortunately, in retrospect, construction of a modern paved road, improvement of hiking trails, and building of facilities allowed swift access to the Park and substantially increased tourist numbers, up to similar to 2 million yearly visitors. Faced with such crowds, the long-term planning of Park resources appears to be a formidable task.

AB  - Context. Good body condition in juvenile marine mammals is crucial for survival and, therefore, population demography. Australian fur seals, endemic to Australia, recently established a breeding colony at the southern edge of their range, at The Needles, a small group of islands in south -west Tasmania (43.6614 degrees S) and a significant distance from their core breeding range in Bass Strait. Aims. We aimed to compare pup body condition at two breeding colonies, distinct in time since establishment and latitude. Specific aims were to: (1) establish the timing of peak pupping, to compare condition of known-age pups, and determine a baseline at The Needles; (2) investigate pup body condition over time at an established colony; and (3) gain insight into the effects of environmental conditions on pup body condition. Methods. We conducted a colony comparison of pup body condition using condition indices at The Needles and an established breeding colony in Bass Strait, Tenth Island, for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 breeding seasons. Pup body condition was quantified at Tenth Island over 18 years (2003-2020) using a long-term morphometric dataset. To establish breeding phenology at these two colonies, we determined peak pupping date for the 2019/20 breeding season using daily pup counts. We assessed the effect of environmental parameters on body condition for the long-term dataset. Key results. Pups from The Needles displayed significantly higher body condition than those from Tenth Island, despite similar peak pupping date. Breeding phenology was consistent with published timing for Australian fur seals. Pup body condition at Tenth Island over the 2-year colony comparison was comparable to the historical average. Environmental drivers that affect maternal foraging efficiency are linked to pup body condition. Conclusions. Higher pup body condition at The Needles is likely underpinned by better foraging conditions resulting in increased pup provisioning levels. Our results indicate that south-west Tasmania is a region of foraging and emerging breeding importance for Australian fur seals. Implications. Future research to monitor pup body condition, maternal foraging behaviour and ecosystem productivity at The Needles will help to provide greater understanding of likely population trajectories at this southernmost breeding site for Australian fur seals.

AB  - Two species of palm tree pests, Oryctes elegans and Oryctes agamemnon (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), cause significant damage to date palm trees (Phoenix dactylifera) in many countries in the Middle East. Despite several decades of research and the implementation of numerous control strategies, including mechanical, chemical, regulatory, and biosecurity measures, managing these pests remains challenging. Control of O. rhinoceros in the Pacific using an entomopathogenic virus is a landmark of classical biological control. In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach to examine the virome of populations of two Oryctes species across various regions in southern Iran, with the hope of discovering natural viral pathogens as potential biocontrol agents. Total RNA was extracted from a pool of larval gut samples and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. After analysing the RNA-Seq data, 28 novel virus sequences, including a diverse range of RNA and DNA viruses, were identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these newly discovered viruses are evolutionarily linked with other closely related members in several families, including Partitiviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Totiviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tombusviridae, Nodaviridae, Potyviridae, Endornaviridae, Circoviridae and some unassigned viruses such as Negevirus and Jivivirus. Given the similarity of some of these viruses to plant viruses, and viruses reported from fungi and protists and their unclear host association, we have tentatively named them "Oryctes-associated viruses." This study uncovers the great diversity of viruses in Oryctes species; however, further studies are necessary to determine their natural incidence, geographical distribution, impact on their hosts, and their potential as biological control agents for these significant date palm pests.

AB  - Herbivorous insects assess and choose their potential host plants based on traits that may correlate with host suitability or quality. These traits may operate as cues for better resources, noxious chemicals, or fewer competitors and enemies. Interactions between insects and their host plants may also be modulated by the nutritional value of the plant, by plant chemical stimuli, or by physical traits such as trichomes. Differences in chemical or physical cues among plants may convey information about diet suitability. Several studies have addressed the topic of differences in plant traits between host and non-host plants; fewer have addressed these differences among potential host plants. We have studied the effect of chemical and physical plant traits on the feeding and oviposition preferences of the oligophagous herbivore Epilachna paenulata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and two of its host plants, Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita moschata (Cucurbitaceae). We first typified the volatile and non-volatile chemical profiles and the trichome distribution of the plants. Then, using behavioral assays, we evaluated feeding and oviposition preferences of E. paenulata. Further, to assess a correlation between oviposition preferences and offspring survival, we measured larval performance as indicated by survival, mass, and time to complete each instar. Female longevity in both Cucurbita host plants was also evaluated. Our results show that the congeneric plants bear differences in their chemical profiles, including volatile organic compounds, leaf waxes, and leaf parenchyma metabolites. Trichome abundance was also different, with C. maxima presenting fewer hairs. Epilachna paenulata females laid significantly more eggs in C. maxima, regardless of the plant they were raised as larvae. Female longevity on C. maxima was higher, but larval performance showed no difference between both plants. The proximate causes mediating female oviposition preferences may then involve trichome abundance, oviposition deterrents, toxic substances, or a combination of these factors.

AB  - The Eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), is a significant pest, causing extensive damage to structures that amount to substantial economic losses. Boric acid is widely used for wood preservation due to its stability and broad-spectrum insecticidal properties, yet its impact on termite gut microbiomes and the implications of such effects remain understudied. Our study evaluates the dose-dependent mortality of R. flavipes upon being provided boric acid treated filter papers and investigates the resulting dysbiosis within the termite gut microbiome. Consistent with reports from other insects, mortality increased in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest boric acid concentration (203.7 mu g/cm(2) of filter paper) significantly reducing termite survival. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the gut bacterial microbiome revealed notable shifts in composition, indicating boric acid-induced dysbiosis. Aside from an overall decrease in bacterial diversity, the relative abundance of some symbionts essential for termite nutrition decreased in response to higher boric acid concentrations, while several opportunistic pathogens increased. Our findings extend the understanding of boric acid's mode of action in termites, emphasizing its ability to significantly modulate the bacterial symbiont community, which can have dire effects on termite biology. Considering its ability to protect wood from further termite consumption, our study supports the continued use of boric acid and related compounds for termite-resistant treatments for wood.

AB  - Simple Summary
   A few highly selected commercial pig breeds have been developed and many different local breeds have been replaced by these modern breeds. With the aim to preserve rare local breeds, the necessity has arisen to find and create the conditions under which local breeds could be more widely used. Therefore, the performance and production qualities of local breeds should be evaluated and highlighted. As the quality of pig production is associated with breeds and effects of other different conditions, the objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of breed, gender, and feeding level in the finishing phase on the carcass and meat quality of Lithuanian White and Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs reared indoors. Feed restriction during the finishing phase and gender both affected the growth and fatness of pigs. The breed and gender appeared to have an effect on the parameters of meat quality including fatty acid composition. The breed and gender effects on fatty acid composition showed more favorable lipid indices in relation to healthy nutrition in the ham muscles of Lithuanian White pigs compared with Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs and also in the ham muscle and backfat of females compared with castrated males.
   The diversity of breeds is an important factor influencing carcass and meat quality traits that are also associated with other different effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of breed, gender, and feeding level in the finishing phase on the carcass and meat quality of Lithuanian White and Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs reared indoors. After 60 kg weight, half of the animals from both breeds were fed a restricted diet of approximately 82% of average ad libitum feeding intake, and the other half of pigs were further fed ad libitum to the end of the experiment. Feed restriction during the finishing phase decreased daily gain and weight of pigs at slaughter, and backfat thickness at the tenth rib (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). Lithuanian White pigs demonstrated higher (p < 0.001) growth rate, live body weight at slaughter and carcass weight, and had a higher (p < 0.01) length of carcass and loin area and lower (p < 0.05) backfat thickness at the last rib and at two points at the lumbar area compared with Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs. The semimembranosus muscle of Lithuanian White pigs had relatively (8.1%) lower (p < 0.001) proportions of saturated and 41.2% higher (p < 0.001) proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with the pigs of the Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle breed, whereas in the longissimus muscle and subcutaneous tissue, the breed only affected the n-6/n-3 ratio (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Gender showed an effect on saturated fatty acids in all the studied tissues, however, the effects on polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in the semimembranosus muscle and subcutaneous tissue (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001) and the effects on monounsaturated fatty acids was found only in the semimembranosus muscle (p < 0.01). These differences in the fatty acid composition of the semimembranosus muscle and subcutaneous tissue of females exhibited more favorable lipid quality indices compared with castrated males (p < 0.001). The semimembranosus muscle of Lithuanian White pigs also showed more favorable lipid quality indices in relation to healthy nutrition compared with Lithuanian Indigenous Wattle pigs (p < 0.001).
   This study is one of the steps toward the development and utilization of endangered breeds. The obtained information can be used to increase choice in pork production and consumption, and provides new insights for research into the conservation of local breeds.

AB  - Simple Summary The water deer Hydropotes inermis, one of the most primitive members of Cervidae, is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List in their native range, having declined drastically in recent years. In this study, we illustrated a northern extension of water deer using the current evidence, and assessed the status, phylogeny, and genetic ancestry of the newly recorded population. Our results showed that water deer had expanded to the Northeast China and the Russian Far East, where there had previously been no record of this species; thus, this could be a genuine range expansion rather than simply an expansion of the known range. A genetic investigation indicated that the expanding population had a close phylogenetic affinity with Korean water deer. The likely migration route and causes of the species' distribution range expansion are discussed. Given current anthropogenic pressures and climate change, wildlife range expansion offers a second chance for species conservation. The water deer Hydropotes inermis is a native to China and the Korean peninsula, but populations in North Korea and mainland China have declined drastically in recent years. However, the range of this species appears to be rapidly expanding northward. In this study, we employed camera traps and molecular technology to assess the status, phylogeny, and genetic ancestry of the newly recorded population. Our results showed an ongoing northward expansion of water deer, reaching at least 500 km from their historical distribution limit. We provided updated information on this species' geographical distribution in Northeast China and the Russian Far East. Based on historical survey data before the 1990s, there had previously been no record of this species in these two regions; thus, this could be a genuine range expansion rather than simply an expansion of the known range. A genetic investigation based on mitochondrial DNA indicated that the expanding population had a close phylogenetic affinity with Korean water deer. The likely migration route and causes of the species' distribution range expansion are discussed. We recommend revising the range of water deer in the IUCN Red List to facilitate the effective conservation and management of this threatened species, especially in new locations.

AB  - Sb and As are chemically similar, but the sequences and structures of Sb(III) and As(III) oxidase are totally distinct. It is thus interesting to explore whether Sb(III) oxidase oxidizes As(III), and if so, how microbial oxidations of Sb(III) and As(III) influence one another. Previous investigations have yielded ambiguous or even erroneous conclusions. This study aimed to clarify this issue. Firstly, we prepared a consortium of Sb(III)oxidizing prokaryotes (SOPs) by enrichment cultivation. Metagenomic analysis reveals that SOPs with the Sb (III) oxidase gene, but lacking the As(III) oxidase gene are predominant in the SOP community. Despite this, SOPs exhibit comparable Sb(III) and As(III)-oxidizing activities in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, indicating that at the microbial community level, Sb(III) oxidase can oxidize As(III). Secondly, we isolated a representative cultivable SOP, Ralstonia sp. SbOX with Sb(III) oxidase gene but without As(III) oxidase gene. Genomic analysis of SbOX reveals that this SOP strain has a complete Sb(III) oxidase (AnoA) gene, but lacks As(III) oxidase (AioAB or ArxAB) gene. It is interesting to discover that, besides its Sb(III) oxidation activities, SbOX also exhibits significant capabilities in oxidizing As(III) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Moreover, under aerobic conditions and in the presence of both Sb(III) and As(III), SbOX exhibited a preference for oxidizing Sb(III). Only after the near complete oxidation of Sb(III) did SbOX initiate rapid oxidation of As(III). In contrast, under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of both Sb(III) and As(III), Sb(III) oxidation notably inhibited the As(III) oxidation pathway in SbOX, while As(III) exhibited minimal effects on the Sb(III) oxidation. These findings suggest that SOPs can oxidize As(III) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, exhibiting a strong preference for Sb(III) over As(III) oxidation in the presence of both. This study unveils a novel mechanism of interaction within the Sb and As biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - The obligate root parasite Cistanche armena is a recently rediscovered, extremely rare endangered species endemic to Armenia, specifically parasitizing camelthorn (Alhagi maurorum, Fabaceae) and saltwort (Salsola dendroides, Chenopodiaceae). Its populations are reputedly declining due to habitat destruction and biotic impacts. Since the only known means of its reproduction is via the seeds, understanding the mechanisms of breaking C. armena seed dormancy and germination along with the related aspects of the species' biology is highly important both from fundamental (functional ecology and evolution) and applied (conservation and management) perspectives. Here, we present the first in vitro seed germination protocol for C. armena involving fluridone, a systemic herbicide targeting the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. In addition, the seed micromorphology of C. armena is described using both light microscopy and lignin autofluorescence visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The actin cytoskeleton in radicle cells of germinated C. armena seedlings is described for the first time, being the proof of seed viability. Further elaboration and application of the proposed germination protocol with the cultivation of C. armena on susceptible hosts are altogether seen as a valuable tool for the conservation of this species.

AB  - Boar spermatozoa are highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, which are prone to disruption by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS can induce lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation and impaired enzyme activity, ultimately reducing sperm quality and reproductive performance. Wine grape pomace (WGP), a by-product of the winemaking process, is rich in polyphenols, including flavonoids (anthocyanins and quercetin), stilbenes (resveratrol) and tannins, which possess strong antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with 4% WGP on boar ejaculate output and sperm quality during storage. Twenty boars were divided into two groups: a control group fed a standard diet and a WGP group supplemented with 4% WGP for 4 months. Semen samples were collected and analysed for ejaculate number of sperm per ml, total antioxidant capacity (in seminal plasma) and quality parameters (motility, kinematic parameters, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, viability) after 1, 3 and 5 days of refrigerated storage. Results showed that WGP supplementation increased the number of sperm per ml compared to the control group (p < 0.05), resulting in approximately two additional seminal doses per ejaculate, without negatively affecting other seminal parameters (p > 0.05) and refrigeration storage (p > 0.05). This improvement in sperm concentration could enhance the profitability of swine semen production by increasing the number of doses produced per boar annually. Given the low cost of WGP (10.03 <euro>/boar/year), this strategy could offer a cost-effective approach to improving reproductive performance in boars. These findings support further research into optimising WGP inclusion levels and exploring its broader impacts on boar fertility and reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Bounding box and point annotations are widely used in deep learning-based animal detection from remote sensing imagery, yet their impact on model performance and training efficiency remains insufficiently explored. This study systematically evaluates the influence of these two annotation methods using aerial survey datasets of African elephants and antelopes across three commonly employed deep learning networks: YOLO, CenterNet, and U-Net. In addition, we assess the effect of image spatial resolution and the training efficiency associated with each annotation method. Our findings indicate that when using YOLO, there is no statistically significant difference in model accuracy between bounding box and point annotations. However, for CenterNet and U-Net, bounding box annotations consistently yield significantly higher accuracy compared to point-based annotations, with these trends remaining consistent across different spatial resolution ranges. Furthermore, training efficiency varies depending on the network and annotation method. While YOLO exhibits similar convergence speeds for both annotation types, U-Net models trained with bounding box annotations converge significantly faster, followed by CenterNet, where bounding box-based models also show improved convergence. These findings demonstrate that the choice of annotation method should be guided by the specific deep learning architecture employed. While point-based annotations are more cost-effective, their lower training efficiency in U-Net and CenterNet suggests that bounding box annotations are preferable when maximizing both accuracy and computational efficiency. Therefore, when selecting annotation strategies for animal detection in remote sensing applications, researchers should carefully balance detection accuracy, annotation cost, and training efficiency to optimize performance for specific task requirements.

AB  - Organic carbon is transformed into CO2 by various interventions applied to the soil and diffuse to the atmosphere. The manures which used unconscious under available soil moisture and temperature condition makes the soil microorganism activity increased. This causes CO2 emission increase as well by oxidation of organic matter. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate different amounts of sheep (20, 40 and 60 t ha(-1)) and poultry (15, 30 and 45 t ha(-1)) manure under different wetting-drying cycles (irrigation intervals of 3, 6 and 9-days) in terms of CO2 emission and to understand the relationship of soil temperature and soil moisture with CO2 emission. The study was conducted according to arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replications as a pot study in greenhouse conditions. The frequent irrigation and using high amount of manure increased CO2 emissions. Although the same amount of organic matter was provided to the soil in different amounts of sheep and poultry manures, CO2 emission was higher in sheep manure. Soil temperature increased by irrigation at infrequent intervals and high amount of manure. Moisture retention in the soil increased by using high amount of manure. The linear relationship of soil temperature (R-2=0.922) and soil moisture (R-2=0.895) with CO2 emission was found to be quite significant (P<0.01). As a result of the study, using low amount of poultry manure (15 or 30 t ha(-1)) instead of sheep manure and irrigation at infrequent intervals (9-days) can be suggested as precautions to decrease CO2 emissions.

AB  - Cultivation of perennials such as Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deuter (Mis) combines the provision of ecosystem services and the generation of additional carbon sources for farming. The potential of Mis based fertilisers, regarding immobilisation of inorganic nitrogen (N) and build-up of soil organic matter (SOM), was tested in a field trial. Therefore, a crop rotation of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), mustard (Sinapis alba L.) as catch crop, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was set up. The tested treatments were a mixture of Cattle Slurry (CS) and Mis, a mixture of CS and Wheat Straw (CS-WS), Cattle Manure (CM) from Mis shredded bedding, CM from WS shredded bedding, a pure CS, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) and a treatment without any N applied (NoN). When the carbon-rich fertilisers (both mixtures and manures) were applied to cereals, they led to a slight N immobilisation compared to pure CS, whereas differences were mostly not significant. Furthermore, Mis fertilisers were at least as efficient as WS-based organic fertilisers in inducing a contribution of SOM build-up and in reducing inorganic N before winter and thus preventing N losses, whereas differences were mostly not significant.

AB  - Selective harvest, such as poaching, impacts group-living animals directly through mortality of individuals with desirable traits, and indirectly by altering the structure of their social networks. Understanding the relationship between disturbance-induced, structural network changes and group performance in wild animals remains an outstanding problem. To address this problem, we evaluated the immediate effect of disturbance on group sociality in African savanna elephants-an example, group-living species threatened by poaching. Drawing on static association data from ten free-ranging groups, we constructed one empirically based, population-wide network and 100 virtual networks; performed a series of experiments 'poaching' the oldest, socially central or random individuals; and quantified the immediate change in the theoretical indices of network connectivity and efficiency of social diffusion. Although the social networks never broke down, targeted elimination of the socially central conspecifics, regardless of age, decreased network connectivity and efficiency. These findings hint at the need to further study resilience by modeling network reorganization and interaction-mediated socioecological learning, empirical data permitting. The main contribution of our work is in quantifying connectivity together with global efficiency in multiple social networks that feature the sociodemographic diversity likely found in wild elephant populations. The basic design of our simulation makes it adaptable for hypothesis testing about the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance or lethal management on social interactions in a variety of group-living species with limited, real-world data.

AB  - Ecologists commonly assess ecological patterns at the population level, focusing on the average response of all individuals within a population, but to predict how populations will respond to land-use change we must understand how changes to habitat differentially affect individuals within a population. For example, forest management is a widespread type of land-use that impacts wildlife through the loss of key habitat features, but individuals within a population may vary in their responses to this loss due to differences in habitat selection among individuals. Specifically, intraspecific variation in habitat selection has been linked to animal personalities (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among conspecifics), but previous research has not examined whether the relationship between personality and habitat selection is influenced by land-use change. To address this knowledge gap, we tested the hypothesis that land-use change alters the association between personality and microhabitat selection in small mammals. Specifically, we investigated two main questions: (1) To what extent are personality type and microhabitat selection correlated among conspecifics? (2) Does land-use change alter individual patterns of microhabitat selection? To answer these questions, we conducted a large-scale field experiment over 4 years, contrasting unmanaged forest (control) with managed forest (two silvicultural treatments) in Maine, USA. We examined the relationships between habitat selection and personality traits in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We found that personality traits were correlated with microhabitat selection at multiple spatial scales. Furthermore, land-use change altered these patterns of selection; resulting in either the loss of personality-associated selection or in novel patterns of selection in managed forests. These findings suggest that promoting structural complexity at multiple spatial scales, such as by interspersing stands of mature forest with managed stands, may maintain a variety of intraspecific habitat selection patterns and the associated ecological outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Conservation practices in the nature of some animal species are very difficult when they are in conflict with anthropogenic activities. In order to make possible the coexistence of a predator such as the wolf with animal breeding activities in the wild, the EU has produced solid and structured legislation through the Natura 2000 network. The application of the Habitats Directive allows the various member countries to choose biodiversity management actions as long as they maintain their resilience. Our work compares two different management methods developed in Spain and Italy with the aim of evaluating a possible difference in the conservation of wolf packs present in their respective territories. The results obtained show that both in Spain and Italy, the presence of the wolf causes damage to livestock. The economic damage is quite substantial and affects, in different ways, sheep, goat, bovine, and equine breeding. Nevertheless, wolf populations are stable in Spain, where hunting is allowed, and slightly increasing in Italy, where the species is particularly protected.
   Our work shows that, despite the persistence of persecutory actions, conservation activity has proved successful for the return of numerous wild mammals to different habitats, including the wolf. The human-wolf conflict is still described in all countries where the wolf is present. This is evidenced by the high number of damages on livestock, and the corpses of wolves found both in protected areas and in those where hunting is permitted. The diagnosis of road accidents, together with poisoning and poaching, are major causes of mortality. Although hunting records the highest percentage of kills in Spain, the demographic stability reported by the censuses suggests that this activity does not have a consistent influence on the Iberian wolf population's survival. In Italy, where wolf hunting is prohibited, wolf populations are to be increasing. In some Italian situations, wolf attacks on horses seem to cause unwanted damage to foals, but they represent a very precious source of information about the habits of carnivores. A simple management plan would be sufficient to help the coexistence between the productive parts and the ecosystem services ensured by the presence of the wolf. The presence of hybrids is a negative factor.

AB  - The decomposition of cadavers and large vertebrate carcasses is the result of complex processes primarily influenced by ambient temperatures. Thus, low temperatures can alter decomposition by curtailing tissue autolysis and bacterial decomposition, and by limiting insect activity contributing to necromass removal. In this study, we tested whether carcass decomposition rate is modulated not only directly by temperature and insect occurrence, but also indirectly by the mediation of interactions among insects by ambient temperature. To test this, a comparative analysis of the decomposition of domestic pig carcasses in summer and fall was conducted in Atlantic Canada. The results indicated that carcass decomposition standardized to account for seasonal differences was significantly decelerated in the fall as opposed to the summer during the later decomposition stages and was sometimes incomplete. Moreover, the arrival, presence, and departure of insects from carcasses during ecological succession differed between summer and fall. Necrodes surinamensis (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Silphidae) and Creophilus maxillosus (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) maintained higher abundances late during succession in the fall than in the summer and their abundance was related to a decline in decomposition rates, probably because these species feed on dipteran larvae promoting necromass removal. These results demonstrate the variability in response to environmental parameters of insects of forensic importance and support the idea that slowed decomposition in the fall may be exacerbated by changes in interspecific interactions among insects. Furthermore, these results suggest that successional studies of insects carried out in the summer have little forensic utility for cadavers found in cold weather conditions.

AB  - Photoperiod is the main cue that controls seasonal reproduction in deer from temperate regions, like secretion of testosterone by the testis, neck enlargement, and testis development. However, little is known about its effect on the reproduction of tropical deer species. This research aimed to assess the potential seasonality of the brown brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) by melatonin treatment. Repro-ductive parameters such as testicular volume, neck circumference, and semen quality were evaluated from day 0 to 90, and fecal androgen metabolites (FAM) from day-28 to 91. Melatonin treatment was administered from day 0 to 60. In total, seven individuals were used in the study. Four animals were allocated to the treated group (TG) and three to the control group (CG). The neck circumference and some seminal parameters did not show a significant difference between CG and TG and along the experimental period. High FAM levels were observed for the TG on days 7, 14, 21, 35, 84, and 91 (p < 0.05). The mean testicular volume was reduced from day 0 to 30 (p < 0.05) and from day 0 to 90 (p < 0.05), with no increase in the mean testicular volume from day 30 to 60 (p > 0.05). Sperm motility was the highest on day 60 compared with day 0 (p < 0.05). Although not statistically different, membrane integrity and major defects tended to be higher and lower, respectively, in the TG compared with the CG. For these parameters, the incremental change (%) per individual showed that males from the TG tended to have a higher percentage during the melatonin treatment, hence melatonin might affect these seminal char-acteristics. These findings suggest that exogenous melatonin might enhance FAM levels and sperm motility.

AB  - Numerous efforts have been made to enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) for accelerating renewable energy generation, however, it remains unclear whether the intensified measures could enhance the proliferation and transmissions of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the system. This study assessed the impact of an innovative pig manure AD process, which includes hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) and a twostage configuration with separated acidogenic and methanogenic phases, on biomethane (CH4) production and ARGs dynamics. Results showed that HTP significantly increase CH4 production from 0.65 to 0.75 L/L/d in conventional single-stage AD to 0.82 and 0.91 L/L/d in two-stage AD. This improvement correlated with a rise in the relative abundance of Methanosarcina, a key methanogenesis microorganism. In the two-stage AD, the methanogenic stage offered an ideal environment for methanogens growth, resulting in substantially faster and higher CH4 production by about 10% compared to single-stage AD. Overall, the combined use of HTP and the two-stage AD configuration enhanced CH4 production by 40% compared to traditional single-stage AD. The abundance and diversity of ARGs were significantly reduced in the acidogenic reactors after HTP. However, the ARGs levels increased by about two times in the following methanogenesis stage and reached similar or higher levels than in single stage AD. The erm(F), erm(G), ant(6)-Ia, tet(W), mef(A) and erm(B) were the six main ARGs with significant differences in relative abundances in various treatments. The two-stage AD mode could better remove sul2, but it also had a rebound which elevated the risk of ARGs to the environment and human health. Network analysis identified pH and TVFAs as critical factors driving microbial communities and ARG proliferation in the new AD process. With the results, this study offers valuable insights into the trade-offs between AD performance enhancement and ARG-related risks, pinpointing essential areas for future research and practical improvements.

AB  - Based on data from a field survey of 85 Norwegian farms, we aimed to investigate associations of group size, floor space per pig and type of feed with selected welfare-and performance indicators in finishing pigs. On each farm, we registered the number of pigs per pen, floor space per pig (m2), and the type of feed used (dry feed: n = 42 farms; liquid feed: n = 43 farms), once for every farm between 10:00-12:00 h within the last three weeks before slaughter. Ten pigs per pen from eight pens per farm were randomly chosen for sampling of welfare indicators (bite marks on ears, body and tail, hernia, and movement disorders, and a human approach test). A subsample of 44 farms recorded their production data in the Norwegian Ingris database. These farm level data included daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and mean weight of the slaughtered pigs. The pen-level data were analysed using a using a mixed model, with group size and floor space per pig (m2) as fixed effects, type of feed (liquid vs. dry feed) as a categorical variable, and individual "farm" as a random effect. The farm-level data were analysed using a generalized model with Poisson distribution and the same fixed factors. The proportions of pigs with bite marks on ears (P < 0.001) and body (P < 0.001) and daily weight gain (P < 0.001) decreased with increasing group size whereas avoidance of a novel human increased (P < 0.001). The proportion of pigs with bite marks on the body (P = 0.019) decreased with increasing floor space per pig. Providing dry feed ad libitum in vertical feeders resulted in a greater proportion of pigs with bite marks on the ears (P = 0.010) and the body (P = 0.029) than providing liquid feed intermittently in long troughs, but daily weight gain was higher with dry feeding (P < 0.001). Overall, low proportions of pigs had hernias (1.1 & PLUSMN; 0.001%) and movement disorders (1.7 & PLUSMN; 0.2%). In conclusion, our findings indicate that except for an increased avoidance of a novel human in larger groups, the pigs had better welfare in larger groups in terms of lower proportion of bite marks. Finally, more floor space per pig and liquid feed in feed troughs were also associated with a lower proportion of bite marks. As our data were skewed towards smaller group sizes and densities were skewed towards the legislated minimum space allowance per pig, the implications are limited to the range of conditions presented in the study.

AB  - Main conclusionLeaf vein network cost (total vein surface area per leaf volume) for major veins and vascular bundles did not differ between monocot and dicot species in 21 species from the eastern Colorado steppe. Dicots possessed significantly larger minor vein networks than monocots.AbstractAcross the tree of life, there is evidence that dendritic vascular transport networks are optimized, balancing maximum speed and integrity of resource delivery with minimal resource investment in transport and infrastructure. Monocot venation, however, is not dendritic, and remains parallel down to the smallest vein orders with no space-filling capillary networks. Given this departure from the "optimized" dendritic network, one would assume that monocots are operating at a significant energetic disadvantage. In this study, we investigate whether monocot venation networks bear significantly greater carbon/construction costs per leaf volume than co-occurring dicots in the same ecosystem, and if so, what physiological or ecological advantage the monocot life form possesses to compensate for this deficit. Given that venation networks could also be optimized for leaf mechanical support or provide herbivory defense, we measured the vascular system of both monocot and dicots at three scales to distinguish between leaf investment in mechanical support (macroscopic vein), total transport and capacitance (vascular bundle), or exclusively water transport (xylem) for both parallel and dendritic venation networks. We observed that vein network cost (total vein surface area per leaf volume) for major veins and vascular bundles was not significantly different between monocot species and dicot species. Dicots, however, possess significantly larger minor vein networks than monocots. The 19 species subjected to gas-exchange measurement in the field displayed a broad range of Amax and but demonstrated no significant relationships with any metric of vascular network size in major or minor vein classes. Given that monocots do not seem to display any leaf hydraulic disadvantage relative to dicots, it remains an important research question why parallel venation (truly parallel, down to the smallest vessels) has not arisen more than once in the history of plant evolution.

AB  - Conservation of wildlife populations necessitates identifying patterns in space use because fitness requirements influence resource selection; however, details on how phenology affects space use are often only cursorily addressed during development of space- and resource-use estimates. Moreover, space-use assessments often aggregate distinct, phenology-specific behaviors into generalized realizations of biological processes, such as reproduction. Therefore, to improve the relevance and accuracy of biological inferences for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) space use at the population level, we defined 12 distinct phenology-specific periods to compare and contrast variations in space-use estimates. We calculated 1,568 individual space-use estimates using dynamic Brownian Bridge movement models for Rio Grande wild turkeys (M. g. intermedia; n = 255 females) across Texas, USA, during 2012-2018. Females in each pre-laying state used larger areas than during all other phenological states, suggestive of exploratory movements related to reproductive activities and resource acquisition. Incubation core areas were consistently <1.5 ha and incubation range sizes ranged from 10 ha to 48 ha. Core area and range sizes during the brooding period doubled from 15 days after hatch (3.1 ha and 42 ha) to 30 days after hatch (6.5 ha and 89 ha). Post-breeding and wintering period ranges were >30% smaller than reproductive period ranges. Mean daily distance traveled was similar across phenological states except during incubation and brooding periods. Our results indicate that examining wild turkey space use at identifiable, phenology-specific temporal scales will help mitigate against biases in estimates of resource selection based on arbitrary phenology definitions that aggregate data across multiple, distinct, phenological states.

AB  - In brief Seminal nerve growth factor induces ovulation in camelids by influencing the secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the portal vessels of the pituitary gland. We show that the nerve growth factor-induced release of GnRH is not mediated directly through interaction with hypothalamic neurons.
   Abstract Ovulation in camelids is triggered by seminal nerve growth factor (NGF). The mechanism of action of NGF appears to occur via the central nervous system. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NGF acts in the hypothalamus to induce GnRH release. To determine if NGF-induced ovulation is associated with a rise in NGF concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), llamas were i) mated with an urethrostomized male, ii) mated with intact male, or given intrauterine iii) seminal plasma or i.v.) saline (Experiment 1). To characterize the luteinizing hormone (LH) response after central vs peripheral administration, llamas were treated with saline (negative control) or NGF either by i.v. or intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration (Experiment 2). To determine the role of kisspeptin, the effect of ICV infusion of a kisspeptin receptor antagonist on NGF-induced LH secretion and ovulation was tested in llamas (Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, a surge in circulating concentrations of LH was detected only in llamas mated with an intact male and those given intrauterine seminal plasma, but no changes in CSF concentrations of NGF were detected. In Experiment 2, peripheral administration (i.v.) of NGF induced an LH surge and ovulation, whereas no response was detected after central (ICV) administration. In Experiment 3, the kisspeptin receptor antagonist had no effect on the LH response to NGF. In conclusion, results did not support the hypothesis that NGF-induced ovulation is mediated via a trans-synaptic pathway within the hypothalamus, but rather through a releasing effect on tanycytes at the median eminence.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the occurrence of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, which may thereby impact the outcome of plant-herbivore interactions. While elevated temperature is known to directly affect herbivore growth, it remains largely unclear if it indirectly influences herbivore performance by affecting the host plant they feed on. In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level. To this end, we studied the interaction between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants and the larvae of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) under different temperature regimes. We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack. Thus, our study provides evidences on how temperature reprograms plant-induced defense to herbivores.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) are a cash crop that thrive under warm and moist conditions. However, tea plants are becoming increasingly vulnerable to heat damage (HD) during summer growing seasons due to global climate warming. Because China ranks first in the world in both harvested tea area and total tea production, monitoring and tracking HD to tea plants in a timely manner has become a significant and urgent task for scientists and tea producers in China. In this study, the spatiotemporal characteristics of HD evolution were analyzed, and a tracking method using HD LST-weighted geographical centroids was constructed based on HD pixels identified by the critical LST threshold and daytime MYD11A1 products over the major tea planting regions of mainland China from two typical HD years (2013 and 2022). Results showed that the average number of HD days in 2022 was five more than in 2013. Daily HD extent increased at a rate of 0.66% per day in 2022, which was faster than that in 2013 with a rate of 0.21% per day. In two typical HD years, the tea regions with the greatest HD extent were concentrated south of the Yangtze River (SYR), with average HD pixel ratios of greater than 50%, then north of the Yangtze River (NYR) and southwest China (SWC), with average HD pixel ratios of around 40%. The regions with the least HD extent were in South China (SC), where the HD ratios were less than 40%. The HD LST-weighted geographical centroid trajectories showed that HD to tea plants in 2013 initially moved from southwest to northeast, and then moved west. In 2022, HD moved from northeast to west and south. Daily HD centroids were mainly concentrated at the conjunction of SYR, SWC, and SC in 2013, and in northern SWC in 2022, where they were near to the centroid of the tea planting gardens. The findings in this study confirmed that monitoring HD evolution of tea plants over a large spatial extent based on reconstructed remotely sensed LST values and critical threshold was an effective method benefiting from available MODIS LST products. Moreover, this method can identify and track the spatial distribution characteristics of HD to tea plants in a timely manner, and it will therefore be helpful for taking effective preventative measures to mitigate economic losses resulting from HD.

AB  - In 2017, clinical disease and mortality in cattle associated with Theileria orientalis Ikeda was reported in Virginia, U.S. The exotic tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, is a competent vector for this species. White-tailed deer (Odo-coileus virginianus) are commonly infested with H. longicornis in the eastern U.S. and are also infected with several genotypes of piroplasms such as a Theileria sp. (often called Theileria cervi-like), Babesia odocoilei, and Babesia sp. H10. However, it is currently unknown if deer are susceptible to T. orientalis and can act as potential hosts. In this study, we tested 552 white-tailed deer samples from the southeastern U.S. to determine the presence of T. orientalis. We used a PCR-RFLP to test 293 (53%) of these samples to distinguish between piroplasm genera. A total of 189 white-tailed deer were positive with Theileria, 47 were positive with Babesia, and 57 did not amplify. Because this assay does not determine species, we sequenced 30 random samples targeting a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene. Although a high diversity of Theileria and Babesia spp. were detected, none were T. orientalis. All 552 samples were then screened with a T. orientalis specific real-time PCR protocol, but none were positive for T. orientalis. Our data suggests that white-tailed deer are commonly infected with piroplasm species but not T. orientalis.

AB  - The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), is an invasive, polyphagous herbivore native to China which was first detected in Pennsylvania, USA, in 2014. As of spring 2022, L. delicatula has spread to 14 states in its introduced range in the eastern US, prompting quarantines, increased surveillance, and new research. Despite known preferences for tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (Simaroubaceae), L. delicatula has been reported from over 100 plants for feeding and oviposition. As L. delicatula continues to spread, individuals have the potential to encounter new host plants for feeding and new substrates for oviposition. In this study, we investigated oviposition and host plant use by nymphs among common trees, shrubs, and vines at 3 field sites in eastern Pennsylvania to determine whether use of plants differs among plant species and with plant size. We then used our field data and information from the literature to assess the risks to 2 nearby, uninvaded habitats in central Maryland. In repeated visual surveys in Pennsylvania, we found L. delicatula egg masses on 10 of 15 plant species, including new observations on Cercis canadensis L. (Fabaceae), Crataegus viridis L. (Rosaceae), and Liquidambar styraciflua L. (Altingiaceae). Egg mass abundance increased strongly with tree size. We found nymphs on 12 plant species, including new observations on C. viridis, and nymphal abundance differed significantly among plant species. Applying results from our field surveys and from the literature to currently uninvaded sites, we found high levels of risk for trees in managed and semi-natural settings; the great majority of trees in these inventories are at risk for use by L. delicatula, though several plant species have yet to be evaluated for risk. Our work highlights the need for continued research into oviposition and feeding choices as well as the urgency for monitoring and preemptive management at sites near known L. delicatula infestations.

AB  - The intricate relationship between trophic levels in marine ecosystems remains largely unexplored, particularly in the Southern Ocean. To investigate the complex composition of water constituents, notably the phytoplankton community, we used machine learning techniques to classify six bio-optical classes from a comprehensive ocean-color data time-series. In situ data from the Southern Ocean further characterized these classes by predominant phytoplankton types. Bio-logging data from southern elephant seals revealed that 60% of prey-catch attempts were concentrated within the diatom-dominated class, despite its lower regional frequency. Seals exhibited enhanced foraging activity and prolonged residency periods, up to 42 consecutive days, in diatom-rich waters compared to 5-10 days in other classes. These findings suggest a preference among southern elephant seals for diatom-rich waters, indicating a selective foraging activity influenced by the phytoplankton community's structural composition rather than total biomass alone. This preference underscores the intricate interplay between marine top predators and ecosystem dynamics, hinting at mechanisms through which phytoplankton structure shapes seal activity.

AB  - Deer mice (genus Peromyscus) are among the commonest small mammals in the Nearctic zoogeographic region. Nevertheless, systematic relationships are only partially settled and numerous taxonomic questions await resolution. For instance, researchers have found that some members of the Peromyscus truei species group contain high levels of genetic divergence that could indicate the presence of cryptic species. We analyzed the systematics and phylogenetic relationships of the P. truei group using new and previously published mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Our analyses verify several earlier conclusions, but we also detected new clades that deserve recognition. Considering their mitochondrial distinctiveness, allopatric ranges, and previously reported molecular, biochemical, chromosomal, morphological, and ecological differences, we elevate three previously described taxa to species. We support the recognition of two subgroupings. The first comprises P. gratus, P. truei, and possibly P. cf. martirensis and P. cf. zapotecae. The second contains to P. amplus, P. attwateri, P. collinus, P. difficilis, P. felipensis, P. laceianus, P. nasutus, P. ochraventer, and P. pectoralis. Placement of P. bullatus will likely remain unknown until genetic data are available. Further research could improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of Peromyscus, but in some cases taxonomic issues must be resolved first.

AB  - Cryptostroma corticale is the causal agent of sooty bark disease, which was first described in the middle of the last century and has developed in recent years to a relevant threat for Acer spp. trees in Central Europe. Triggered by extreme heat and drought, this tree disease is becoming more and more important in the course of climate change. Acer pseudoplatanus is a particularly affected tree species, but the disease has also been observed on other Acer spp., and there is some indication that there are suitable hosts outside the Acer genus. In literature, Aesculus hippocastanum was mentioned twice to be a host, however, without any proof or details. With this study, we verify the assumption that A. hippocastanum is a host of C. corticale by morphological and phylogenetic analyses based on a case in Germany. Furthermore, we provide microscope pictures of microtome sections of the specimens, showing the spore production of C. corticale on A. hippocastanum.

AB  - Fermented liquid pig manure (LPM) can be used as a nutrient source to replace synthetic fertilizers (SF). However, concerns remain regarding nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses from rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddies fertilized with LPM. Fly ash (FA) has a high calcium content (Ca) and zeolite (Z) has a high negative-charge; thus, they can immobilize P and N through the fixation of P with Ca and NH4+ onto negatively charged sites, respectively. This study investigated the effects of the co-application of FA and Z (FAZ) on the nutrient availability and growth of rice fertilized with LPM. Four treatments were evaluated: no input (control), synthetic fertilizer (SF), and LPM at two levels, with or without FAZ application, for 104 days. The pH (pH(water)), electrical conductivity (ECwater), N (N-water), and P (P-water) concentrations in the ponding water of rice fields were analyzed 18 times during rice growth. The rice biomass and uptake of N and P were measured, and the concentrations of mineral N and available P in soil were determined after harvest. LPM application increased (p < 0.001) N and P availability in the absence of FAZ, leading to rice biomass comparable to that of SF. However, FAZ diminished the fertilization effects of LPM on rice growth. The N-water decreased by 50% and the rice uptake of N increased by 6% after FAZ application, probably because of the retention of N by Z and its subsequent release. By contrast, FAZ increased (p < 0.001) soluble P-water (85% for LPMS) and decreased (p = 0.004) P uptake (8%-40%), reducing the rice biomass by 20%-25%. The decreased P uptake is probably due to the strong immobilization of P by FA. Therefore, it is cautioned that P-limitation through immobilization of P by FA under alkaline conditions may hinder rice growth in FAZ-amended paddy fertilized with LPM. An appropriate application rate of FA for improved P nutrition needs to be explored.

AB  - The tea plant is an economically important crop in China, but long-term monoculture and substantial chemical nitrogen fertilizer input cause soil acidification, which in turn affects the nutrient supply and tea quality. Intercropping has drawn more attention in tea gardens because this pattern is expected to improve soil fertility and tea quality and change the soil microbial community composition. However, the roles of some key microorganisms in rhizosphere soils have not been well characterized. Here, a "soybean in summer and smooth vetch in winter" strategy was used in a tea garden to investigate the effects of intercropped legumes on soil fertility, tea quality, and potential changes in beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus. Our data showed that when soybeans were turned into the soil, the intercropping system exhibited higher soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), tea quality indices, and expression of the Camellia sinensis glutamine synthetase gene (CsGS). Notably, intercropping significantly affected the bacterial communities, decreasing the relative abundance of Bacillus but increasing its absolute abundance. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BM1 was isolated from intercropped soil and showed outstanding plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties when co-inoculated with rhizobia. In winter, intercropping with smooth vetch had a beneficial effect on soil properties and tea quality. Co-inoculation with strain BM1 and Rhizobium leguminosarum Vic5 on smooth vetch (Vicia villosa) produced huge improvements in SOM, TN, and tea leaf quality, which were accompanied by the highest level of amino acids and the lowest levels of polyphenols and caffeine (p < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that intercropping with some legumes in the tea garden is a strategy that increases SOM, TN, and tea quality, and the optional use of some PGP Bacillus species produces an amplification effect.

AB  - Simple Summary The hypothesis of this experiment proposes that it could be possible to identify pregnant goats through maximum progesterone milk levels at any time in the pregnancy, and that there is an optimal moment to apply a lactation inhibitor to dry off lactating goats. The maximum progesterone concentration in milk varied depending on the season of the year, and those concentrations were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant goats, but significantly higher in the case of gestating goats with four foetuses, for which it would be possible to distinguish the pregnancy. The milk yield of goats at mating does not affect fertility until a value of at least 3250 mL/day. If using lactation inhibitors, their application up to the 10th week post-mating would be optimal for drying off lactating goats. Two of the most important problems in high-yielding dairy goat farms are early and accurate pregnancy diagnosis and the appropriate dry off of lactating does before the next kidding. The hypothesis posits that it could be possible to identify pregnant does through maximum progesterone milk levels at any time during the pregnancy, and that there is an optimal time to apply a lactation inhibitor to help dry off lactating does. Therefore, 114 Murciano-Granadina breed goats were used, from which 74 goats were inseminated at week 20 of lactation and samples of milk from pregnant and non-pregnant goats were taken at two-week intervals. The average maximum progesterone milk levels were higher outside the natural breeding season (40 degrees latitude) than in the breeding season (11.6 +/- 1.13 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.02 ng/mL), although the levels from pregnant and non-pregnant goats were similar (10.85 +/- 1.3 vs. 9.74 +/- 1.6 ng/mL), except in the case of pregnancy with four foetuses (12.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL). Milk yield at mating does not affect fertility until a value of at least 3250 mL/day. Pregnancy started to affect milk yield up to the +7th week and was 59.9% lower in the +10th week after mating, so the use of lactation inhibitors could be more effective from this latter week. In conclusion, the results show that it is not possible to detect gestation in goats reliably through the maximum concentration of progesterone in milk at any time during lactation, except in the case of goats gestating four foetuses, that the milk yield of goats at mating does not affect fertility until a value of at least 3250 mL/day, and that from the 10th week post-mating, the application of lactation inhibitors would be optimal.

AB  - Herbivory traces found on Salvinia graui Herbst and Anz & oacute;tegui, 1987 and Salvinia cf. minima Baker, 1886 were analysed herein. These ichnofossils were collected from Quebrada de Alfredo outcrop in sediments corresponding to the Palo Pintado Formation (Late Miocene, at the Northwest of Argentina). Among the traces identified, one of them became interesting: a new type of leaf-mining that never have been recorded in these fossil plants. The leaf-mining are linear and branched like fingers, pointing to a particular behaviour from the insect producer. Likewise, other damage types corresponding to marginal, non-marginal and window excisions and one gall were found. The fossil traces were assigned to five ichnospecies, of which three are novelties. Moreover, these damages were compared with modern specimens collected at the Northeast of Argentina and possible producers were inferred. This study demonstrates that interactions between Salvinia and their associated insects were already established 8 Ma ago, without suffering significant changes. Our results also constitute the second evidence of plant-insect interactions of aquatic ferns during the Neogene in both South America and worldwide as well as enrich the understanding of the ecological dynamics and diversity of insect feeding strategies in aquatic environments at different times in the past.

AB  - The increased consumption of animal products has led to a proliferation of animal husbandry operations, particularly in agricultural countries. Animal husbandry facilities or livestock farming directly impact the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the environment, giving rise to various issues such as odors, contamination of water and air sources with pathogens, and potential contamination of meat products originating from these facilities. This research aims to assess the impacts on the physical (temperature, relative humidity and air velocity), chemical (carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds and particulate matter), and biological air quality assessment (amount and type of bioaerosols) aspects resulting from pig and poultry farming. The findings will serve as valuable data for managing and addressing these aforementioned issues. It was found that both in poultry and swine houses generated total suspended particles (TSP) and PM10 (Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 mu m or less). Analysis of poultry house exhaust revealed elevated concentrations of TSP and PM10 exceeding established health benchmarks. Chickens tend to produce a higher concentration of VOCs (2.07 +/- 0.57 ppm) compared to swine (0.82 +/- 0.53 ppm). Staphylococcus epidermidis was predominant bacteria in both swine and poultry houses while Cladosporium sp was the most prevalent fungi in poultry houses. These results in this study are very useful for developing targeted mitigation strategies, products, devices to address specific pollutants produced by each type of livestock, reducing overall environmental impact and improving air quality within and around animal husbandry facilities.Implications: This research highlights how the growing demand for meat is affecting the environment, especially in farming areas. By studying the effects of pig and poultry farming on things like air and water quality, the study shows the challenges these farms pose, like bad smells and pollution. They found that both types of farms release a lot of tiny particles and smelly chemicals into the air, but there are differences between them. Understanding these findings can help us develop ways to reduce the pollution from these farms and make the air cleaner for everyone.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus is a worldwide emerging foodborne pathogen; raw or undercooked meats and liver pork products can cause infection through the orofecal route. In Central-Southern Italy, small traditional farming method, associated with the possibility of environmental sharing with wild species, can facilitate HEV diffusion and persistence. The aim of this study was to determine HEV genotype and subtype in Marche region from home slaughtered domestic pigs involved in small and traditional food chains. A total of 236 liver and muscle tissues and 6 pooled salami samples were screened. Laboratory workflow started with homogenization, followed by RNA extraction. Nested reverse transcription PCR and qRT-PCR were used to amplify specific parts of overlapping open reading frames belonging to the HEV genome. A total of 42/236 (17.79%) liver and 8/236 (3.39%) diaphragm specimens were positive; none of the pooled salami specimens showed positive HEV signal. The discovered HEV3c presented high nucleotide similarities with ones amplified from wild boar populations hunted in the same province. Extensive farming methods and environmental sharing with wild animal species support cross-infection infections, as observed in the present study. Although salami resulted negative for HEV RNA detection, the effects of food technologies on viral loads remain unclear. Therefore, further scientific investigations coupled with efficacious standardized laboratory procedures will be the next challenge.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive database of sulfur isotope values from Greece, including samples of C3 and C4 plants and terrestrial and aquatic animal bones. This comprehensive analytical approach examines sulfur isotopes-along with carbon and nitrogen-in modern plants, terrestrial mammals, and fish bones (fresh and marine reservoirs) from Greece. The results show a clear offset in delta S-34 values between terrestrial and aquatic animals, influenced by their dietary sources from marine or freshwater environments. This delta S-34 offset and the clear difference between S-C-N isotopes permits the reconstruction of the dietary habits of domesticated herbivores and demonstrates differences in husbandry practices and animal movements. Additionally, the combination of sulfur and nitrogen values allows the reconstruction of the diet of omnivores, revealing the type of protein consumed. Finally, this isotopic dataset will provide an essential backbone for future archaeological, ecological, and forensic studies.

AB  - Cultural diffusion is one of the core issues among researchers in the field of cultural geography. This study aimed to examine the spatial diffusion patterns of the Qijia culture (QJC) to clarify the origin and formation process of Chinese field model-based cultural diffusion patterns (FM-CDP) and geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis methods. It used the point data of Qijia cultural sites without time information and combined them with the relevant records of Qijia cultural and historical documents, as well as archaeological excavation materials. Starting with the spatial location information of cultural distribution, it comprehensively analysed the cultural hearth, regions, diffusion patterns, and diffusion paths. The results indicated the following. (1) The QJC's heart is in the southeast of Gansu Province, where the Shizhaocun and Xishanping sites are distributed. (2) Five different levels of cultural regions were formed, which demonstrated different diffusion patterns at different regional scales. On a large regional scale, many cultural regions belong to relocation diffusion patterns. Meanwhile, at the small regional scale (in the Gansu-Qinghai region), there are two patterns of diffusion: expansion diffusion and relocation diffusion; however, the expansion diffusion pattern is the main one. (3) Based on the relationship between the QJC, altitude, and the water system, the culture also has the characteristics of diffusion to low altitude areas and a pattern of diffusion along water systems. (4) There is a circular structure of the core, periphery, and fringe regions of the QJC. Finally, (5) the dry and cold climate around 4000a B.P., the cultural exchange between Europe and the Asian continent (the introduction of barley, wheat, livestock and sheep, and copper smelting technology), and the war in the late Neolithic period were important factors affecting the diffusion of the QJC.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) leads to a highly contagious, lethal and economically devastating disease among pigs. Since no effective treatment for the disease, it is crucial to investigate its transmission mechanism and control strategies in large-scale pig farms. We first established a toy model to explore ASFV spread in one pig unit. Then a switching patch model was developed to capture its spread from one initial epidemic pig house consecutively to others, even the whole farm. Assessing innocent culling rates of three large-scale epidemic pig farms in Jiangsu Province showed that it is unnecessary to slaughter all pigs in the farms compulsively. Then we explored how the disinfection and fixation of employees impact ASFV spread in the farms. To control ASFV, we can block or slow down its spreading by improving the efficiency of disinfection and decreasing employee population to some extend. We can also shrink potential areas to be infected by properly improving the matching refinement degree among employees and houses. Some essential requirements for large-scale pig farms are presented to reduce their ASFV spreading risk, which can be helpful for animal health authorities in establishing regulation to standardize large-scale pig farms.

AB  - Simple Summary Game meat has a good nutritional profile; wild boar, in particular, has lower fat, high protein, and higher iron content than meat from other domesticated animals. The present study aimed to assess the carcass characteristics and chemical composition and also to investigate the effect of gender and age on the intramuscular fatty acid profile of wild boar meat harvested during the 2010-2017 winter hunting seasons in the Frasin District hunting area (Romania). The age-class factor influenced the carcass traits (p <= 0.05), but not the yield, although overall, adults were heavier and had a better yield compared to the younger specimens (77.36 vs. 74.79 kg). The differences induced by gender for carcass traits and dressing yield were present but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). For the chemical composition of wild boar meat, the percentages of protein, fat, ash, and water did not present significant differences (p > 0.05) within the factors applied (gender, age-class). Regarding the studied effects, results showed that the wild boars' age-class significantly influenced (p <= 0.001) the amount of meat total fat, with the adults having the highest fat content than subadults (7.60% vs. 4.52%). As for the fatty acid profile, a high ratio of PUFA/SFA (P/S: polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids) and n-6/n-3 PUFA was present in the meat, showing good functional properties for human health. The present study evaluates the influence of gender and age-class on the carcass traits, meat chemical composition, and fatty acid profiles of randomly hunt-harvested wild boars from Romania's Frasin District hunting area, which is an important part of the stock density management strategy. Only 76 wild boars were chosen to participate in the experimental design from a total of 94 wild boars hunted over seven winter seasons, based on two main criteria: right carcass part intact and animal health status (suitable for human consumption) as determined by the veterinary health notice issued by the Food Safety Authority, with all wild boars being evaluated before slaughtering. After sanitary inspection and within the first 24 h postmortem, meat samples were taken in duplicate from the right side of wild boar carcasses (m. Biceps femoris). The aim of this study was to compare the carcass characteristics, chemical composition, and fatty acid profile of wild boar Biceps femoris muscle obtained from the right side of carcasses, as well as the effects of gender, age-class, and their interaction on these traits, in a context where venison is frequently regarded as organic food by consumers due to the natural habitat in which wild animals live. The age of the animals had an effect on the postmortem undressed warm and cold carcass weights (p <= 0.05). Considering the proximal chemical composition, only the intramuscular fat (IMF) content was higher in adult meat samples compared to young animals. C18:1 n-9 was the most abundant fatty acid in wild boar meat, followed by C16:0, C18:2 n-6, and C18:0. For IMF content, gender, age class, and their interaction influenced mainly MUFA fatty acids, in particular C16:1 n-9, C20:1 n-9 and C22:1 n-9, and also PUFA fatty acids C18:3 n-6, C20:3 n-3, C20:4 n-6, C20:5 n-3, C22:4 n-6, and C22:5 n-6. The appropriate amounts of individual fatty acids in the muscles of the wild boars translate into a ratio of P/S acids that promotes health as a bio-alternative resource of meat.

AB  - Plants, insects, and their ecological interactions have been key components of global terrestrial ecosystems throughout geologic time. The arms race between latex-producing plants and latex-sabotaging insect herbivores-resulting in increasingly deadly latex in plants and progressively complex sabotaging behaviors in insects-is one such ecological interaction that is important in modern ecosystems. However, while latex has been identified in the fossil record, ancient latex-sabotaging behavior has not previously been described. Here we report on the discovery of four fossil leaves from the Eocene Geiseltal brown coals in Germany preserved with branched laticifer systems and damage indicative of latex-sabotaging insect behavior. Two types of damage are evident on the compressions of dicot leaves assigned to the morphotype Apocynophyllum neriifolium Heer emend. Kunzmann et Heer. One fossil leaf shows repeated, regularly spaced vein cuts along the midrib, while three other leaves show continuous trenching across the leaf lamina. These damage patterns are recognized as pertaining to previously described Damage Types for repeated hole feeding on the leaf midrib and for the narrow, trenched feeding of the leaf lamina, although they had not been associated with latex-bearing structures in previous work. It is specifically the co-occurrence of these damage types and the branched laticiferous system in the Geiseltal leaves described here that point to latex-sabotaging insect behavior. The Eocene age of the Geiseltal leaves with these types of insect damage is likely close to the time in which laticifers became widespread among flowering plants, suggesting a rapid evolutionary response by insect herbivores.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNN) have become a central method in ecology. To build and train DNNs in deep learning (DL) applications, most users rely on one of the major deep learning frameworks, in particular PyTorch or TensorFlow. Using these frameworks, however, requires substantial experience and time. Here, we present 'cito', a user-friendly R package for DL that allows specifying DNNs in the familiar formula syntax used by many R packages. To fit the models, 'cito' takes advantage of the numerically optimized 'torch' library, including the ability to switch between training models on the CPU or the graphics processing unit (GPU) which allows the efficient training of large DNNs. Moreover, 'cito' includes many user-friendly functions for model plotting and analysis, including explainable AI (xAI) metrics for effect sizes and variable importance. All xAI metrics as well as predictions can optionally be bootstrapped to generate confidence intervals, including p-values. To showcase a typical analysis pipeline using 'cito', with its built-in xAI features, we built a species distribution model of the African elephant. We hope that by providing a user-friendly R framework to specify, deploy and interpret DNNs, 'cito' will make this interesting class of models more accessible to ecological data analysis. A stable version of 'cito' can be installed from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN).

AB  - Anthracnose of Camellia plants is caused by the Colletotrichum species. The fungal pathogens mainly infect the leaves of plants and lead to serious economic losses. However, knowledge of Camellia phyllosphere microbial community after Colletotrichum infection has not been explored which limited our understanding of the relationship between the Camellia anthracnose outbreak and interacting microorganisms. In this study, three economically and ecologically important Camellia species with anthracnose symptoms were collected and subjected to bacterial and fungal composition analysis, diversity, co-occurrence characteristics, isolation of key strains, and tie-back pathogenicity test. The results indicated that Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium were the dominant bacterial genera over the three Camellia species and Pallidocercospora, Colletotrichum, and Pichia were the dominant fungal genera. The co-occurrence analysis showed that Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Massilia, and Allorhizobium were the key bacterial taxa and Colletotrichum, Pallidocercospora, Pichia, Septophoma, and Septoria were the key fungal taxa over the three infected plants. The hub taxa, including the species significantly associated with the Colletotrichum abundance, were mostly beneficial bacteria over the three Camellia species. Further co-culture and tie-back pathogenicity tests verified that the hub taxa associated with pathogenic Colletotrichum in the microbial networks may play promoting/inhibiting roles on Colletotrichum infection. The results highlight the importance of phytopathological conditions for the interactions between microbial members of foliar fungal and bacterial communities.

AB  - This report documents the first identification of Diplodia species on atypical tree hosts, isolated from stem cankers. Diplodia is part of the Botryosphaeriaceae family, which includes plant pathogens that predominantly infect conifer species. However, Diplodia species are expanding their host range and geographic distribution worldwide. Typically associated with tip blight, the fungi described in this study were isolated from stem necroses in urban trees across various German cities, representing distinct geographical regions. Diplodia mutila was identified for the first time on Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Crataegus persimilis, and Platanus x hispanica. Additionally, Diplodia juglandis was isolated from Aesculus hippocastanum and Platanus x hispanica, marking a first record for these hosts. Diplodia seriata was detected as a first finding on Aesculus hippocastanum, Crataegus persimilis, Platanus x hispanica, and Ulmus species, while Diplodia malorum was isolated for the first time from Sorbus domestica, and Diplodia sapinea on Ulmus species. The taxonomy of these fungi was verified through sequencing with multiple primers, including ITSu1/4, LSU/LR6, EF1a 526/1567R, Beta-tubulin T1/T22, and species-specific Diplodia primers where applicable. The pathogenicity of these fungi was confirmed by fulfilling Koch's postulates. Stem infection trials were conducted on the corresponding tree hosts using the isolated fungi, and the resulting symptoms confirmed their pathogenic role. The growing incidence of Diplodia species on non-coniferous hosts in urban environments raises significant concerns not only for forestry but also for urban management. This underscores the need for further research and heightened awareness of these pathogens.

AB  - Goats are primarily raised in marginal, arid, and semi-arid production systems and exhibit a seasonal reproductive pattern. Extending their reproductive season would enhance food security and improve the economic viability of goat production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of SeVE supplementation during the anestrus season on ovarian activity in anestrous goats subjected to an estrus synchronization protocol. The response variables included estrus induction (EI), ovulatory rate (OR), corpus luteum diameter (CLD), left and right ovary diameters (LOD and ROD), embryo implantation (EMBRYO), and pregnancy rates (PREG). Adult, anestrous, crossbred dairy goats (n = 32) from northern semi-arid Mexico (i.e., Comarca Lagunera, 26 degrees N) were randomly assigned to two homogeneous groups based on age, live weight (LW), and body condition score (BCS): (1) the supplemented group (SeVE; n = 16), received 5 mg selenium plus 350 IU vitamin E, and (2) the control group (CONT; n = 16), received physiological saline. Estrus was induced using a combination of progesterone (P4, 20 mg), equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 400 IU), and exposure to the male effect. While no differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the groups for LW and BCS, the variables EI, OR, EMBRYO, and PREG rates were higher (p < 0.05) in the SeVE group than the CONT group. No differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the groups for CLD, LOD, or ROD. Thus, SeVE-targeted supplementation improved reproductive outcomes without affecting ovarian structure size (i.e., a non-dimensional ovarian SeVE action), suggesting that this precision supplementation strategy certainly enhances reproductive efficiency. This was possibly related to selenium-induced increases in P4 synthesis, and the antioxidant effects on follicular development correlate with improved endometrial development, conceptus survival, embryo growth, and pregnancy maintenance. Such improvements could contribute to the sustainability of marginal production systems in the semi-arid regions of northern Mexico, supporting food security and increasing economic returns for goat producers and their families.

AB  - The focus of breeding animals such as goats has been to increase productivity and other benefits from domestic animals. A breeding programme for producing blended goats is ongoing in Mpwapwa, Dodoma, Tanzania. However, few studies have been conducted to understand the performance of the produced breed (blended goat) in comparison with local indigenous goats. This study assessed the performance of blended and local indigenous goats in terms of milk and meat productivity while taking into consideration birth type, mortality rate, diseases causing mortality, and management system used. Primary and secondary data collection methods were used in this study. The weight, length, and girth of 2-year-old kids were measured in the morning and evening, and milk production in a lactating doe was recorded. Secondary data on the weight, length, and girth of inborn between 2010 and 2020. The results showed significantly higher productivity for blended goats than for indigenous goats in terms of meat and milk production (P < 0.005). The mortality rate of indigenous goats was not significantly higher than that of blended goats (P > 0.05). Diseases significantly influence goat mortality. Breed, management system, and milking time had a significant impact on goat productivity. For instance, morning milking produced significantly more milk than evening milking (P < 0.05). It is conclusive that the blended goat performs better than the indigenous goats in terms of milk and meat productivity. We recommend and encourage the adoption of blended goats by farmers who want to maximize goat production while considering other factors such as milking time, disease intervention, and management system used.

AB  - Benzophenone-3 (BP-3), commonly used as a UV filter in personal care products and as a stabilizer, is an alleged endocrine disruptor with potential neurodevelopmental impacts. Despite its abundance in the environment, the studies on its effect on brain development are scarce, especially in terms of multigenerational impact. In this work, for the first time, we examined neurotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of BP-3 on mouse brain regions (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) in both the first (F1) and second (F2) generations after maternal exposure to environmentally relevant BP-3 levels. We found disregulated markers of cell damage (LDH, H2O2, caspase-3 and -8) and observed increased expression of pro-apoptotic Fas/FAS or Fasl/FASL. BP-3 exposure disrupted the BAX/BCL2 pathway, showing stronger effects in the F1 than in the F2 generation, with a dominance of extrinsic pathway (FAS, FASL, caspase-8) over intrinsic one (BAX, BCL2), suggesting that BP-3-induced apoptosis primarily operates via the extrinsic pathway and could impair brain homeostasis across generations. This study underscores the potential of BP-3 to increase multigenerational risks associated with disrupted neurodevelopment and highlights the importance of understanding its long-term neurotoxic effects.

AB  - Alpine grasslands are distributed widely on high-elevated ranges and plateaus from the wet tropics to polar regions, accounting for approximately 3% of the world's land area. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is the highest and largest plateau in the world, and approximately 60% of the plateau consists of alpine grassland, which is used mainly for grazing animals. Livestock structure was determined in Guinan (GN), Yushu (YS) and Maqu counties (MQ) on the QTP by interviewing 235 local pastoralists. Based on data collected from GN, the livestock carrying capacity was calculated using herbage dry matter biomass intake (LCCm) by the livestock, and the metabolizable energy yield (LCCe) and digestible crude protein (LCCp) available in pasture. The pasture area per household differed among the regions of the QTP, which was the main reason for the difference in livestock stocking rate. The householders raised the appropriate proportion of breeding females and young yaks and sheep in GN and MQ, but not in YS, to maintain a constant turnover. Most pasture in YS was used at the community level, especially in summer. The calculated carrying capacities based on metabolizable energy yield (LCCe) of the pasture and dry matter biomass (LCCm) were similar in most months except for August, when the value of LCCe was higher than LCCm. Based on the digestible protein of the pasture, the calculated livestock carrying capacity overestimated the actual carrying capacity during the herbage growing season from May to September. Appropriate practices should be taken in different regions of QTP, such as providing supplementary feed, especially protein, during the forage non-growing season. Livestock carrying capacity should be adjusted dynamically, and calculated by a number of parameters. The stocking rate should be controlled to optimize livestock production and curb or minimize grassland degradation to generate a sustainable system. This study examined the grasslands and LCC on the QTP, but the results could be applied to grasslands worldwide.

AB  - Negative interactions between humans and wildlife (i.e. those presenting risks to human security or private property) can trigger retaliation and potential human-wildlife conflict (HWC). The nature and strength of these human responses may depend on previous interactions with wildlife and can be shaped by landscape conditions. However, the ways in which previous experiences and landscape conditions interact to shape peoples' attitudes towards wildlife are not well-understood. We conducted our study in Tsavo Conservation Area, Kenya, which experiences some of the highest rates of HWC documented in East Africa. We explored how previous experiences with wildlife and landscape conditions interact to inform the attitudes of people towards wildlife. We conducted semi-structured surveys among 331 households and fit an ordinal mixed-effects regression model to predict human attitudes to wildlife as a function of landscape conditions and previous interactions. Respondents indicated that baboons, elephants, and lions posed the greatest risks to human security and private property. Households experiencing risks from wildlife wanted wildlife populations to decrease, whereas households depending on grazing lands outside the study area wished to see wildlife increase. Our study demonstrates that human-wildlife interactions have important social and spatial contexts, and are not uniform across households in the same area owing to location of private property. Correspondingly, for interventions to be effective, we recommend considerations of local contexts and landscape conditions of communities.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflict is frequently defined as a clash that is the result of interaction among community and wildlife or events by humans or wildlife that has an unpleasant outcome on both. Intimidation caused by carnivore towards injuries to individual, financial defense, damages to crops is increasing or the opinion that wildlife causes threats to human safety, health, food, and property. The current study was For this purpose, 22 villages were selected in and around the park where the population of the wildlife was high. For the study purpose, questionnaire based survey and interview were conducted. In the study area, 300 questionaire were distributed through which the opinion of the respondent was taken by asking 13 different questions like crop damage, livestock depredation, season and months of damage, and people attributes towards the wildlife, etc. The domestic animals killed by the wildlife in the study area were the goats and sheep, (38.98%). The rate of depredation of livestock has been recorded to increase in the early summer season (60%), spring (15%), followed by winter (12%), and autumn is less (13%). Wildlife damage maize crop and majorly attack on the area of crops which are close to the forest in summer.

AB  - Sheep (Ovis aries) are stoic, prey animals that have evolved to mask signs of pain and vulnerability, making behavioural indicators of poor welfare difficult to detect. Body condition scoring (BCS) remains one of the most practical, animal-based indicators of chronic undernutrition and compromised welfare in grazing ruminants. Disruption of the incisor apparatus due to dental disorders or tooth loss can impair grazing efficiency, resulting in reduced nutritional intake and contributing to poor body condition. Despite this, there has been little research into the prevalence or welfare impact of dental disorders in sheep. This preliminary study aimed to assess the prevalence of incisor wear in extensively grazed Dohne Merino ewes, examine its distribution across age groups, and evaluate associations with bodyweight and BCS. A total of 818 ewes aged 2 to 10 years were evaluated during routine husbandry. Incisor wear was scored based on dentine exposure using a 0-3 ordinal scale. BCS was determined through hands-on palpation, and liveweight was recorded. Wear affecting more than one-third of tooth enamel was present in at least one incisor in 99% of ewes over five years of age. Greater incisor wear was significantly associated with lower bodyweight and BCS in ewes over two years, irrespective of age. These findings underscore the potential role of incisor wear as a contributing factor to nutritional compromise and welfare risk in older sheep. Monitoring incisor health may facilitate more accurate welfare assessments and enhance management strategies in extensive systems.

AB  - The neonatal MK-801 model of schizophrenia has been developed based on the neurodevelopmental and NMDA receptor hypofunction hypotheses of schizophrenia. This animal model is generated with the use of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, during different temporal windows of postnatal life of rodents leading to behavioral defects in adulthood. However, no studies have examined the role of specific postnatal time periods in the neonatal MK-801 (nMK-801) rodent model and the resulting behavioral and neurobiological effects. Thus, the goal of this study is to systematically investigate the role of NMDA hypofunction, during specific temporal windows in postnatal life on different cognitive and social behavioral paradigms, as well as various neurobiological effects during adulthood. Both female and male mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MK-801 during postnatal days 7-14 (p7-14) or 11-15 (p11-15). Control mice were injected with saline during the respective time period. In adulthood, mice were tested in various cognitive and social behavioral tasks. Mice nMK-801-treated on p7-14 show impaired performance in the novel object, object-to-place, and temporal order object recognition (TOR) tasks, the sociability test, and contextual fear extinction. Mice nMK-801-treated on p11-15 only affects performance in the TOR task, the social memory test, and contextual fear extinction. No differences were identified in the expression of NMDA receptor subunits, the synapsin or PSD-95 proteins, either in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or the hippocampus (HPC), brain regions significantly affected in schizophrenia. The number of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells is significantly reduced in the PFC, but not in the HPC, of nMK-801-treated mice on p7-14 compared to their controls. No differences in PV-expressing cells (PFC or HPC) were identified in nMK-801-treated mice on p11-15. We further examined PFC function by recording spontaneous activity in a solution that allows up state generation. We find that the frequency of up states is significantly reduced in both nMK-801-treated mice on p7-14 and p11-15 compared to saline-treated mice. Furthermore, we find adaptations in the gamma and high gamma activity in nMK-801-treated mice. In conclusion, our results show that MK-801 treatment during specific postnatal temporal windows has differential effects on cognitive and social behaviors, as well as on underlying neurobiological substrates.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities, mainly in the form of local fuel exhausts and inputs from the coastline, heavily affect ecosystems at the interface between terrestrial and marine realms, impairing their functionality and the services they provide. Due to the central role of primary producers in trophic webs, their sessile nature and ethical concerns implied in experiments on animals, pollutant analyses in both sediments and macrophytes assume special relevance in assessing pollutant transfers from the abiotic to biotic compartments and their possible transfer through trophic webs. With a view to clarify the accumulation of inorganic and organic pollutants deriving from fuel exhausts on primary producers, the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Zn, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene were determined in sediments and macrophytes collected from sites along the Cilento coast, in western Mediterranean Sea, characterized by different levels of anthropogenic pressures. The 18 species analysed, belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, Heterokontophyta and Embryophyta, exhibited different accumulation capabilities toward pollutants, with average concentrations of Cu, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene in all the divisions (17.6 +/- 2.3 mu g g-1 d.w., 34.3 +/- 2.1 ng g-1 d.w., 61.5 +/- 9.4 ng g-1 d.w., respectively) higher than those measured in sediments (4.0 +/- 0.7 mu g g-1 d.w., 11.6 +/- 0.9 ng g-1 d.w., 14.8 +/- 1.0 ng g-1 d.w., respectively) and more than one order of magnitude higher in Embryophyta for Cu (62.9 +/- 7.1 mu g g-1 d.w.) and in Cyanobacteria for benzo[a]pyrene (181 +/- 2 ng g-1 d.w.). The obtained findings constitute a reference for the accumulation capabilities of different taxa and for the behaviour of different fuel exhaust pollutants in marine coastal environments, with implication for their transfer across trophic webs.

AB  - The evaluation of early reproduction traits in Beetal goat was performed for possible effects of genetic and non-genetic factors on litter size at birth (LSB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at birth (LWB), litter weight at weaning (LWW) and age at first kidding (AFK). The data records consisted of information of pedigree and targeted traits pertained to 223 does born to 25 sires and 122 dams between the years 2004 to 2019. A general linear model was used for assessment of non-genetic factors such as period of birth, type of birth and dam's weight at kidding on studied traits. Genetic evaluation of targeted traits was done to estimate variance components and genetic parameters under dyadic mixed modelling. The estimates of least-square means for LSB, LSW, LWB, LWW and AFK were observed as 1.27 +/- 0.03, 1.25 +/- 0.03, 3.24 +/- 0.07 kg, 13.08 +/- 0.30 kg and 27.56 +/- 0.58 months, respectively. Only the period of birth showed significant (P < 0.05) effects for targeted traits in this study. The estimates of direct heritability for LSB, LSW, LWB, LWW and AFK were low in magnitude as 0.08, 0.03, 0.10, 0.03 and 0.06, respectively. The moderate to high genetic and phenotypic correlations among litter traits indicate simultaneous improvement for these traits. It was concluded that low ranged direct heritability estimates for targeted traits indicated modest scope for genetic improvement of reproductive efficiency in Beetal goat through selection and, therefore, adoption of improved managerial practices is necessary to improve reproductive efficiency of Beetal goat.

AB  - The construction of a network capturing the topological structure linked to the interactions among species and the analysis of its properties constitutes a clarifying way to understand the functioning of an ecosystem at different scales of analysis. Here, we present a novel systematic procedure to profit from the enhanced information derived from considering its multiple levels and apply it to analyse the presence of keystone species. The proposed method presents a way to unveil the information stored in a network by comparing it to some randomised modification of itself. The randomising of the original network is done by swapping a controlled number of links while preserving the degree of the nodes. Then, we compare the modularity value of the original network with the randomised counterparts, which gives us a measure of the amount of relevant information stored in the first one. Once we have verified that the modularity value is meaningful, we use it to perform a community analysis and a characterisation of other topological properties in order to identify keystone species. We applied this method to a pollinator-plant-herbivore trophic network as a case study and we found that (a) the comparison between the modularity of the original and the randomised networks is a suitable tool to detect relevant information; and (b) identifying keystone species yields different results in bipartite networks from the ones obtained in networks of more than two trophic levels. We also analysed the effect of eliminating selected species from the system on the cohesion of the network. The selection of these species was made according to the centralities values, such as degree and betweenness, of the corresponding nodes. Our findings show that our analysis, mainly based on the measure of modularity is a reliable tool to characterise ecological networks. Additionally, we argue that since degree and betweenness are not always correlated, it is more reliable to measure both in an attempt to detect keystone species. The methodology proposed here to identify keystone species can be applied to other ecological networks currently available in the literature.

AB  - The introduction of novel plant species to new habitats may have consequences for native herbivores. We examined the impact of Alliaria petiolata, a Eurasian invader of forest understories and edges in North America, on adult oviposition behavior and on larval preference and the performance of Anthocharis midea, a univoltine butterfly that specializes on plants in the Brassicaceae. We compared the usage of A. petiolata by this butterfly to that of one of its common native hosts, Cardamine concatenata, and additionally explored the impact of drought and larval age on the larval success of these hosts. In the field, adults oviposited on the native host preferentially earlier in the season, but they strongly preferred A. petiolata later in the season and laid more eggs overall and in multiples more often on this plant. Larvae strongly preferred to feed on leaves of C. concatenata over A. petiolata in the laboratory and survived to pupation at a high rate on it. Conversely, larvae fed little and died when offered A. petiolata. Larvae preferentially chose tissues of droughted C. concatenata over well-watered plants, but drought stress had no impact on larval mass and survival to pupation. Larvae showed no preference for droughted or non-droughted A. petiolata and while drought stress tended to extend survival on this plant, all larvae still died on it. Older larvae were no better at feeding and surviving on A. petiolata than young larvae. Our results indicate that A. petiolata currently serves as an ecological trap for A. midea, being both highly attractive to ovipositing adults yet lethal to larvae. This effect could cause both local declines in the abundance of this butterfly and drive selection for the altered behavior of adults and larvae to either avoid or better tolerate this plant.

AB  - A total of 150 ejaculates, 10 from each of 15 swamp buffalo bulls comprising each group 5 animals were used in the study to observe the seasonal effect in sperm biochemical and semen quality. Methods: Clinical and andrological examinations, and monitoring of semen production and quality were carried out on fifteen mature, healthy swamp buffalo bulls in North East India. Seminal characteristics were compared between three seasons of the year (Summer, March-June; Monsoon, i.e. July-September; Autumn, i.e. October-November and winter, i.e. November-February) with distinct ambient temperature and humidity. Results: All bulls were diagnosed as clinically healthy and with good libido throughout the period of study. Ejaculate volume, mass activity, HOST and acrosomal integrity differ significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) between all seasons, whereas initial sperm motility, sperm concentration and abnormalities did not differ significantly. The total protein, total cholesterol and total lipid of seminal plasma of swamp buffalo semen differ significantly between all the seasons. In conclusion, climatic changes did not seem to largely affect semen sperm output or viability, although the proportions of some semen characteristics and biochemical constituents altered season wise. Conclusion: Seasonal changes moderately appear to cause deleterious changes in sperm quality in swamp buffalo.

This has been observed in agroecological regions where heat stress did not exist and, in regions where temperatures and relative humidity were high, it is intensifying. Hair sheep show resistance to heat stress (HS) in different warm latitudes; however, lactating ewes, due to metabolic work, produce a greater amount of heat and have more problems dissipating heat than those ewes that do not lactate. To counteract the effects caused by HS, ewes adjust their physiological parameters to avoid productive and reproductive problems that affect their production and well-being. Two groups of ewes (10 lactating and 10 non-lactating) were used to evaluate the effect of heat stress during summer under tropical conditions. In this study, a temperature and humidity index (THI) was found that ranged between 65 and 79 (morning and afternoon). Likewise, a heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) of 6 units was observed. The highest breathing frequency (BF; 115.46 +/- 35.25 breaths per minute (bpm)) and rectal temperature (RT; 38.95 +/- 0.51 degrees C) were found during the afternoon in the group of lactating ewes. The means were compared by group, time of the day, and interaction, and only significant differences were found between groups for RT and udder temperature (p < 0.001). In the case of time of day, all parameters were higher during the afternoon, regardless of the group of ewes (p < 0.001). Likewise, an interaction was found in the parameters RT, right paralumbar fossa (RPF), rump, leg, and udder (p < 0.001). In conclusion, Blackbelly ewes lactating during the summer in the tropics have higher skin temperatures, and also raise BF and RT to tolerate HS in tropical climates.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to study the influence of RNA editing sites on lactation and mammary gland development process in yaks, we comprehensively characterized the RNA editome of the yak mammary gland during the lactation period and dry period by using the transcriptome and genome sequencing data. The results revealed 82,872 nonredundant RNA editing sites, 14,159 of which were differentially edited between the lactation period and dry period. Enrichment analysis showed that the genes harboring differential editing sites were mainly associated with mammary gland development-related pathways, such as MAPK pathway, PI3K-Akt pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway, and focal adhesion pathway. Our findings offer some novel insights into the RNA editing function in the mammary gland of yaks. The mammary gland is a complicated organ comprising several types of cells, and it undergoes extensive morphogenetic and metabolic changes during the female reproductive cycle. RNA editing is a posttranscriptional modification event occurring at the RNA nucleotide level, and it drives transcriptomic and proteomic diversities, with potential functional consequences. RNA editing in the mammary gland of yaks, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we used REDItools to identify RNA editing sites in mammary gland tissues in yaks during the lactation period (LP, n = 2) and dry period (DP, n = 3). Totally, 82,872 unique RNA editing sites were identified, most of which were detected in the noncoding regions with a low editing degree. In the coding regions (CDS), we detected 5235 editing sites, among which 1884 caused nonsynonymous amino acid changes. Of these RNA editing sites, 486 were found to generate novel possible miRNA target sites or interfere with the initial miRNA binding sites, indicating that RNA editing was related to gene regulation mediated by miRNA. A total of 14,159 RNA editing sites (involving 3238 common genes) showed a significant differential editing level in the LP when compared with that in the DP through Tukey's Honest Significant Difference method (p < 0.05). According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, genes that showed different RNA editing levels mainly participated in pathways highly related to mammary gland development, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, FoxO, and GnRH signaling pathways. Collectively, this work demonstrated for the first time the dynamic RNA editome profiles in the mammary gland of yaks and shed more light on the mechanism that regulates lactation together with mammary gland development.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of apatinib (APT) mesylate on the growth, migration ability, and underlying mechanisms in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines Kyse30 and Kyse150. Additionally, the anti-metastatic effects of APT mesylate were further validated in a nude mouse xenograft metastasis model. In vitro, APT mesylate treatment significantly reduced cell viability and migration ability in both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that APT mesylate inhibited the expression of proteins involved in the ERK/ELK-1/Snail signaling pathway, including ERK1/2, Snail, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, while upregulating E-cadherin expression. In vivo, APT mesylate administration notably decreased the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules in nude mice, with higher doses showing more pronounced effects. The 200 mg/kg high-dose group exhibited a significantly lower number of metastatic nodules compared to the cisplatin (CIS) group. The results suggest that APT mesylate inhibits ESCC cell proliferation and migration primarily by suppressing the ERK/ELK-1/Snail signaling pathway, which mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduces metastasis and invasiveness. This study provides experimental evidence for the potential clinical application of APT mesylate in targeted therapy for ESCC, indicating its promising clinical value.

AB  - The impacts of manure dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the adsorption and desorption of veterinary antibiotics in soils have not been fully explored. In this study, the effects of pig manure (PM) DOM and its hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions on antibiotic adsorption and subsequent desorption in three topsoils of bamboo stands under different fertilization conditions (control, with heavy manure application, and with heavy manure application suspended) were examined by batch experiments, with the aid of excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The addition of 100 mg-C L- 1 PM DOM was found to increase the adsorption (in terms of the Freundlich affinity coefficient (Kf)) of florfenicol by 71.27%-132.23% but decrease the adsorption of doxycycline, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethazine by 41.67%-94.78%, 98.09%-99.99%, and 22.93%-67.20%, respectively. These effects resulted mainly from the increases in solution pH by PM DOM addition and preferential adsorption of PM DOM's proteinlike fraction to the soils. Effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of PM DOM were antibiotic and soil specific, except the increases in adsorption Kf of florfenicol in all tested soils. Among the four antibiotics, sulfamethazine exhibited the lowest Kf values in the soils with PM DOM addition during both the adsorption and desorption processes, implying that sulfamethazine may be the most leachable antibiotic in the field. The results of this study indicate that it is essential to consider the varying effects of the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of manure DOM in assessing the leaching risk of veterinary antibiotics in manured soils.

AB  - Polyglyphanodontians were a dominant terrestrial lizard group during the Cretaceous. They were mainly distributed across Laurasia but show their greatest diversity in the Upper Cretaceous deposits of China and Mongolia. Several of the Asian taxa were comparatively large, with robust skulls and a dentition specialized for herbivory. Two polyglyphanodontian genera, Tianyusaurus from China and Polyglyphanodon from North America, are unusual in having developed a complete, or near complete, lower temporal bar. Here we describe a third polyglyphanodontian with a complete lower temporal bar, Yechilacerta yingliangia gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Cretaceous of Jiangxi Province, southern China. These deposits have also yielded specimens of Tianyusaurus, but the new genus differs from Tianyusaurus in several key aspects of skull and dental morphology, including the presence of coarse pustulate cranial sculpture, and the absence of maxillary caniniform teeth. Phylogenetic analysis places the new genus and species as the sister taxon to Tianyusaurus, with both taxa nested among East Asian gilmoreteiids. Previous phylogenetic analyses using morphological characters have mostly placed polyglyphanodontians close to extant teiioid lizards, but our analyses, using a constraint tree for squamates based on published molecular phylogenies, placed Polyglyphanodontia closer to Iguania. However, a more comprehensive review is needed to resolve their relationships.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:53B9CE04-E600-48AE-AC98-7476A949BCBD

AB  - The knowledge of the bat fauna from Minas Gerais, the largest state in southeastern Brazil, has greatly changed in recent years due to increased sampling and taxonomic revisions with reports of range extension and/or new species descriptions. The first annotated list of bats for the state dates to over 10 years ago. Our study aimed to update it by incorporating new localities sampled since then and by adding new species records to the list. We also conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and museum databases and analyzed 691 specimens collected in the state from all mesoregions and ecosystems deposited in collections. We documented the occurrence of 99 bat species from nine families, distributed in 181 municipalities, covering all mesoregions and biomes of the state. This is an increment of 30% in bat richness and of 241% in locality sites with bat records in Minas Gerais, when compared with the previous compilation. We report two previously unrecorded species for the state, the phylostomids Rhinophylla pumilio Peters, 1865 and Trinycteris nicefori (Sanborn, 1949). The mesoregions with the largest number of bat collection localities were "Metropolitana" (46), "Zona da Mata" (26), and "Norte de Minas" (21). The Atlantic Forest had the largest number of collection sites compared to the other biomes present in the state (102). There are a lot of sampling gaps in the state, and most of the conservation areas have not yet been sampled for bats. In face of that and based on the recent findings of several new species and records as a result of sampling and revisionary efforts, we suggest the implementation of rapid survey programs accompanied by taxonomic studies within the conservation units of Minas Gerais. Long-term monitoring programs, including bats, are also completely missing in the state.

AB  - Many wooden architectural heritage buildings exist in Korea, and the authenticity and structural stability of these cultural assets are being affected by termites. This study aimed to identify the degree of termite damage and related factors in these buildings. The degree of termite damage to 182 nationally designated wooden architectural heritage buildings (national treasures and treasures) in Korea was quantified, and data were collected for 11 factors affecting termite damage, such as the surrounding environment and architectural features. Based on the results of a general linear model analysis, the following three factors were identified to have a significant effect on termite damage: the type of contact between the ground and wooden structural items, the number of days of termite activity, and the proportion of forests in the land surrounding the property. This study is the first attempt to statistically analyze factors affecting termite damage to wooden heritage buildings, and our results provide initial data for the preservation and management of these properties.

AB  - Understanding the processes that determine how animals allocate time to space is a major challenge, although it is acknowledged that summed animal movement pathways over time must define space-time use. The critical question is then, what processes structure these pathways? Following the idea that turns within pathways might be based on environmentally determined decisions, we equipped Arabian oryx with head- and body-mounted tags to determine how they orientated their heads - which we posit is indicative of them assessing the environment - in relation to their movement paths, to investigate the role of environment scanning in path tortuosity. After simulating predators to verify that oryx look directly at objects of interest, we recorded that, during routine movement, > 60% of all turns in the animals' paths, before being executed, were preceded by a change in head heading that was not immediately mirrored by the body heading: The path turn angle (as indicated by the body heading) correlated with a prior change in head heading (with head heading being mirrored by subsequent turns in the path) twenty-one times more than when path turns occurred due to the animals adopting a body heading that went in the opposite direction to the change in head heading. Although we could not determine what the objects of interest were, and therefore the proposed reasons for turning, we suggest that this reflects the use of cephalic senses to detect advantageous environmental features (e.g. food) or to detect detrimental features (e.g. predators). The results of our pilot study suggest how turns might emerge in animal pathways and we propose that examination of points of inflection in highly resolved animal paths could represent decisions in landscapes and their examination could enhance our understanding of how animal pathways are structured.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Fungi treatment is well established as a promising approach to upgrade the nutritional value of lignocellulosic biomass. This potency of fungi treatment is, however, primarily based on in vitro experiments, and extrapolation to practice is currently hindered, owing to a dearth of studies addressing the practical relevance of fungal treatment of high-fiber feed, such as rice straw and rice stubble. These potential biomasses are rife in Southeast Asian countries, coinciding with increasing rice production; however, it remains a big challenge to utilize rice stubble as a potential feed for ruminants. Similar to rice straw, rice stubble is traditionally eliminated through controlled burning, which is harmful to the environment. The aim of this study was to convert rice stubble into a new animal feed capable of increasing environmental friendliness. Using urea, it is well known to modify the lignification or silicification of lignocellulosic biomass. However, it remains scanty in combination with fungi treatment. Therefore, we treated rice stubble with either urea or oyster fungus (Pleurotus ostreatus) or a combination of these two treatments and offered these treated rice stubbles to slow-growing goats with the objective to study their effect on feed intake, digestibility, and fermentation end-products.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the fungal treatment (Pleurotus ostreatus) of urea-treated rice stubble on growth performance in slow-growing goats. Eighteen crossbred Thai-native x Anglo-Nubian male goats (average body weight: 20.4 +/- 2.0 kg) were randomly assigned to three experimental total mixed rations containing 35% rice stubble (RS) that were either untreated (URS), urea treated (UTRS), or treated with urea and fungi (UFTRS). URS and UTRS were cultivated and harvested from an aseptically fungal spawn, incubated at 25-30 degrees C for 25 days. Indicators of growth performance were monitored, and feces were collected quantitatively to assess nutrient digestibility, during a 12-week feeding trial. All goats remained healthy throughout the experiment. The goats fed UFTRS had a lower feed conversion ratio (kg feed/kg growth) compared to goats fed URS or UTRS. Compared to URS, dietary UFTRS increased the nutrient digestibility of slow-growing goats, such as organic matter (OM) (+8.5%), crude protein (CP) (+5.5%), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (+39.2%), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (+27.4%). Likewise, dietary UFTRS tended to increase rumen ammonia concentrations, but rumen pH and volatile fatty acids were not affected by UFTRS. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the fungal treatment of RS is an effective tool to improve the growth performance of slow-growing goats.

AB  - By allowing for the creation of embryo banks, reproductive biotechnologies play an essential role in the preservation of endangered goat breeds' genetic diversity. This study focused on comparing both available embryo collection methods [laparotomy (LAP) vs. nonsurgical embryo recovery (NSER)] in Caninde goats to create an embryo bank for later use in a breed conservation program. Twelve females were superovulated and subjected to either the LAP or NSER technique for embryo recovery. The recovery rate was similar (p > 0.05) between NSER (86.8% +/- 5.6%) and LAP (92.8% +/- 4.0%). Moreover, there were no differences (p > 0.05) in the number of structures recovered, the viable embryos, and the freezable embryos per goat, respectively, for NSER (11.7 +/- 1.3, 11.2 +/- 1.5, and 10.2 +/- 1.1) and LAP (10.3 +/- 1.0, 8.7 +/- 0.7, and 8.0 +/- 0.8). Overall, 132 structures were collected out of 151 ovulations (similar to 12.6 +/- 1.2 corpora lutea per goat). Finally, the procedure duration time was also similar (p > 0.05) for NSER versus LAP, respectively: 32.3 +/- 3.3 versus 30.8 +/- 3.9 minutes. In conclusion, the NSER method results proved to be similar to the LAP technique in small-sized Caninde goats. It was noticeable, however, that the NSER technique is simpler and provides the possibility for successive procedures with few health risks and sequels for females. This study may hopefully boost in vivo embryo production programs in the Caninde breed, facilitating the formation of embryo banks and so assuring the availability of genetic diversity before any decline becomes irreversible.

AB  - Kalanchoe daigremontiana, a medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds, has the potential to serve as a feed supplement, reducing reliance on conventional livestock medications while potentially enhancing productivity. This study evaluated the effects of K. daigremontiana supplementation over 52 days on kidney and liver function, metabolism, weight changes, and reproductive efficiency in multiparous Alpine goats during the breeding season. Fifty-five goats were assigned to either a control (CTL, n = 27; 47.6 +/- 1.1 kg) or a K. daigremontiana-supplemented (KAL, n = 28; 47.6 +/- 1.3 kg) diet. The KAL group received K. daigremontiana at a dry matter-based inclusion rate of 2 kg t(-1) of feed, while the CTL group received no supplementation. Blood samples were collected at four time points to assess the biochemical markers of kidney and liver function. Pregnancy was achieved through natural mating, and reproductive efficiency was evaluated. Overall, liver and kidney function did not differ significantly between treatments (p > 0.05). However, KAL supplementation was associated with increased creatinine (p < 0.05), ALP (p < 0.001), and bilirubin (p < 0.05) at specific time points, whereas CTL goats exhibited higher BUN (p < 0.001), AST (p < 0.05), albumin (p < 0.001), total protein (p <= 0.05), and phosphorus (p < 0.01) on specific dates. Other metabolic markers, weight gain, and reproductive efficiency did not differ between treatments (p > 0.05). Overall, Kalanchoe daigremontiana supplementation had mild, transient effects on goat health without significantly impacting productivity. Further research is needed to explore its long-term effects and optimal dosage for livestock nutrition.

AB  - Symbiotic organisms may contribute to a host plant's success or failure to grow, its ability to maintain viable populations, and potentially, its probability of establishment and spread outside its native range. Intercellular and intracellular microbial symbionts that are asymptomatic in their plant host during some or all of their life cycle - endophytes - can form mutualistic, commensal, or pathogenic relationships, and sometimes novel associations with alien plants. Fungal endophytes are likely the most common endosymbiont infecting plants, with life-history, morphological, physiological, and plant-symbiotic traits that are distinct from other endophytic guilds. Here, we review the community dynamics of fungal endophytes during the process of plant invasion, and how their functional role may shift during the different stages of invasion: transport, introduction (colonisation), establishment, and spread. Each invasion stage presents distinct ecological filters that an alien plant must overcome to advance to the subsequent stage of invasion. Endophytes can alternately aid the host in overcoming stage-specific filters, or contribute to the barriers imposed by filters (e.g. biotic resistance), thereby affecting invasion pathways. A few fungi can be transported as seed endophytes from their native range and be vertically transmitted to future generations in the non-native range, especially in graminoids. In other plant groups, alien plants mostly acquire endophytes via horizontal transmission from the invaded plant community, and the host endophyte community is shaped by host filtering and biogeographic factors (e.g. dispersal limitation, environmental filtering). Endophytes infecting alien plants (both those transported with their host and those accumulated in the non-native range) may influence invasion success by affecting plant growth, reproduction, environmental tolerance, and pathogen and herbivory defences; however, the direction and magnitude of these effects can be contingent upon the host identity, life stage, ecological conditions, and invasion stage. This context dependence may cause endophytic fungi to shift to a non-endophytic (e.g. pathogenic) functional life stage in the same or different hosts, which can modify alien-native plant community dynamics. We conclude by identifying paths in which alien hosts can exploit the context dependency of endophyte function in novel abiotic and biotic conditions and at the different stages of invasion.

AB  - Introduction The stoichiometric characteristics of leaves can indicate the nutrient limitations and ecological strategies of closely related plants. Sea-buckthorn is a unique species in China with economic and ecological value, yet nutrient limitations and environmental adaptation strategies in its main distribution areas remain unclear.Methods Here, This study aims to explore the adaptive mechanism in different geographical environments and its impact on species substitution distribution patterns by analyzing the leaf stoichiometric characteristics of three species of sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides, Hippophae tibetana and Hippophae neurocarpa).Results Our results reveal that the overall nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of Sea-buckthorn leaves of are respectively 32.19 +/- 4.96mg<middle dot>g-1, and 2.03 +/- mg<middle dot>g-1 with an N/P ratio of 16.68 +/- 4.01. Leaf N concentration significantly increased, with increasing longitude, and latitude. Leaf P concentration significantly increased, with the change of longitude. Among the three sea-buckthorn species, the N concentration of Chinese sea-buckthorn and Coastal sea-buckthorn exhibited increase significantly with latitude, whereas the N concentration of Tibetan sea-buckthorn showed significant variation with longitude. Through standardised major axis (SMA) regression, an allometric relationship was observed between the N and P concentrations across sea-buckthorn species. Notably, the N and P concentrations of Tibetan sea-buckthorn exhibited significant allometric relationship. Potential evapotranspiration and altitude were identified as the primary factors influencing N concentration, while slope and humidity index were the main drivers affecting P concentration. Additionally, average annual radiation and precipitation were found to influence the N/P ratio. The leaf stoichiometry of sea-buckthorn species revealed distinct adaptation mechanisms to their respective habitats, leading to niche-driven species distribution patterns along environmental gradients. Tibetan sea-buckthorn served as a transitional zone between the other two species.Discussion Therefore, this study can provide basic data for the stoichiometric characteristics of sea-buckthorn leaves and the distribution pattern of species substitution, with provides a new ecological perspective on the relationship between species distribution and plant stoichiometric characteristics.

AB  - In pigs, the number of PMN in uterus lumen increases within few hours after natural or artificial AI resulting in early PMN-derived innate immune reactions. Sperm-NETs formation was recently reported to occur in various mammalian species. Aim of this study was to investigate direct interactions of boar spermatozoa with swine PMN, the release of sperm-mediated NETs, and to assess NET-derived effects on sperm functionality. Spermtriggered NETs were visualized by SEM- and immunofluorescence analyses. Sperm-mediated NETosis was confirmed by presence of extruded DNA with global histones and NE. Largest sizes of sperm-mediated aggNETs were detected after 5 h thereby resulting in effective massive sperm entrapment. The number of aggNETs increased from 3 h onwards. Kinetic studies of swine sperm-mediated NETosis showed to be a time-dependent cellular process. In addition, number of NETs-entrapped spermatozoa increased at 3 h of exposure whilst few free spermatozoa were detected after 3 h. Anchored NETs also increased from 3 h onwards. The cytotoxicity of NETs was confirmed by diminution of the total motility and the progressive motility. Spermatozoa membrane integrity and function loss exposed to NETs was confirmed from 3 h. Experiments revealed NETs-derived damaging effects on swine spermatozoa in membrane integrity, motility and functionality. We hypothesize that swine sperm-triggered aggNETs might play a critical role in reduced fertility potential in swine reproductive technique. Thus, aggNETs formation needs to be considered in future studies about uterine environment as well as advance of sperm in the porcine female reproductive tract.

AB  - Given the escalating production of livestock and poultry, coupled with the surging cost of soybean meal, the search for alternative raw materials that can replace soybean meal is becoming more important. Agricultural by-products like rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal present a promising plant-based protein alternative to soybean meal in pig production. This study revealed that corn-soybean-miscellaneous meals and corn-miscellaneous meals significantly enhanced the average daily growth of pigs weighing 25-50 kg compared to a corn-soybean meal diet. These findings suggest that miscellaneous meals can effectively serve as an alternative feed ingredient to soybean meal in pig diets. This research can be helpful to further develop miscellaneous meals (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower meal) as a functional alternative feed ingredient to soybean meal. The present study aims to determine the effect of miscellaneous meals (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower meal) replacing soybean meal in feed on growth performance, apparent digestibility of nutrients, serum biochemical parameters, serum free amino acid content, microbiota composition and SCFAs content in growing pigs (25-50 kg). A total of 72 (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) growing pigs with initial weights of 25.79 +/- 0.23 kg were randomly divided into three treatments. The pigs were fed corn-soybean meal (CON), corn-soybean-miscellaneous meals (CSM), and corn-miscellaneous meals (CMM). Each treatment included six replicates with four pigs per pen (n = 24, 12 barrows and 12 gilts). Soybean meal accounted for 22.10% of the basal diet in the CON group. In the CSM group, miscellaneous meals partially replaced soybean meal with a mixture of 4.50% rapeseed meal, 3.98% cottonseed meal, and 4.50% sunflower meal. In the CMM group, miscellaneous meals entirely replaced soybean meal with a mixture of 8.50% rapeseed meal, 8.62% cottonseed meal, and 8.5% sunflower. The results showed that compared with the CON, the CSM and CMM groups significantly improved the average daily gain (ADG) of growing pigs during the 25-50 kg stage (p < 0.05) but had no effects on average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily feed intake/average daily gain (F/G) (p > 0.05). Moreover, the CMM group significantly reduced nutrient apparent digestibility of gross energy compared with the CON group. The serum biochemical parameters results showed that the CSM group significantly improved the contents of total protein (TP) compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). The CMM group significantly improved the contents of total protein (TP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with the CON group in serum (p < 0.05). In comparison with the CON group, the CMM group also significantly improved lysine (Lys), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), phenylalanine (Phe), arginine (Arg), and citrulline (Cit) levels in serum (p < 0.05). However, the CMM group significantly decreased non-essential amino acid content glycine (Gly) in serum compared with CON (p < 0.05), while compared with the CON group, the CSM and CMM groups had no significant effects on the relative abundance, the alpha-diversity, or the beta-diversity of fecal microbiota. Moreover, compared with the CON group, the CSM group significantly increased butyric acid and valeric acid contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces (p < 0.05).
   In contrast to the CON group, the CMM group significantly reduced the contents of SCFAs in feces, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and isobutyric acid (p < 0.05). Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that miscellaneous meals (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower meal) can partially replace the soybean meal and significantly improve the growth performance of growing pigs during the 25-50 kg stage. Thus, miscellaneous meals are a suitable protein source as basal diets to replace soybean meals for 25-50 kg growing pigs. These results can be helpful to further develop miscellaneous meals as a functional alternative feed ingredient to soybean meal.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) is an evolving interventional procedure capable to reduce pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. We aimed to compare PA nerve distribution in different specimens and assess the feasibility of an ovine model for a denervation procedure and evaluate the acute changes induced by laser energy. Methods: The experiment was divided into two phases: (1) the analysis of PA nerve distribution in sheep, pigs, and humans using histological and immunochemical methods; (2) fiberoptic PADN in sheep and postmortem laser lesion characteristics. Results: PA nerve density and distribution in sheep differ from humans, although pigs and sheep share similar characteristics, nerve fibers are observed in the media layer, adventitia, and perivascular tissue in sheep. Necrosis of the intima and focal hemorrhages within the media, adventitia, and perivascular adipose tissue were evidenced post laser PADN. Among the identified lesions, 40% reached adventitia and could be classified as effective for PADN. The use of 20 W ablation energy was safer and 30 W-ablation led to collateral organ damage. Conclusions: An ovine model is suitable for PADN procedures; however, nerve distribution in the PA bifurcation and main branches differ from human PA innervation. Laser ablation can be safely used for PADN procedures.

AB  - Biochar is an effective additive for reducing ammonia emissions during composting due to its unique physicochemical properties. However, the properties of biochar vary according to production conditions such as the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. This heterogeneity may affect the ammonia mitigation performance of biochar during composting, but few studies have investigated the effect of biochar properties on ammonia emissions. Here, we prepared four types of biochar from two feedstocks (dairy manure and Japanese larch) at two pyrolysis temperatures (300 degrees C and 800 degrees C) and compared their impact on ammonia emissions during composting. The composting experiments were conducted on a laboratory scale by mixing each biochar (12 g) with dairy manure (300 g) for 19 days. The results showed that biochar addition (10.7-15.3% initial total nitrogen) significantly lowered ammonia emission rates compared to dairy manure alone (18.6% initial total nitrogen), and low-temperature biochars showed better performance than high-temperature biochars. We propose that ammonia emissions are reduced by biochar due to NH4+ adsorption and increased nitrification. Abundant surface oxygen-containing functional groups, high cation exchange capacity, high ash content, and low pH are likely the dominant factors reducing ammonia emissions, while high specific surface area is less influential.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation is one of the most effective methods for the conservation of germplasm re-sources and used of superior sires widely. However, the motility of yak (Bos grunniens) sperm was low after thawing and the proteomics changes in sperm cryopreservation remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the differences between fresh sperm and frozen sperm of yak through the proteomic analysis and thus improve the understanding of sperm cryodamage. The Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) technology was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) before and after freezing. Then, GO and KEGG analysis were conducted to analyze the DEPs enriched signaling pathways. Finally, the DEPs, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 (NDUFS8) were verified by the immunofluorescence technique. The results showed that there were 229 DEPs between fresh and frozen-thawed yak sperm. Compared with the fresh sperm, 120 proteins were up-regulated and 109 proteins were down-regulated in frozen-thawed sperm. The GO annotation showed that the up-regulated proteins enriched in metabolic and cytoskeleton-related processes, including lipoprotein metabolic process, lipid transport, extracellular region and intermedi-ate filament cytoskeleton organization. In contrast, the down-regulated proteins enriched in biological processes including single fertilization, sperm capacitation and response to unfolded protein. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that freezing and thawing affected the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway and the glycerolipid metabolic pathway of yak sperm. Immunofluorescence results showed that the protein expression level of SOD1 protein in the frozen group was significantly lower than that in the fresh group (P < 0.01), and the protein expression level of NDUFS8 protein was significantly higher in frozen group (P < 0.01). This study revealed the DEPs be-tween fresh and frozen-thawed sperm and provides a theoretical basis to further explore the exertion of normal biological functions of yak sperm after freezing and thawing.

AB  - Since a significant proportion of plant matter is consumed by herbivores, a necessary adaptation for many phyllosphere microbes could be to survive through the guts of herbivores. While many studies explore the gut microbiome of herbivores by surveying the microbiome in their frass, few studies compare the phyllosphere microbiome to the gut microbiome of herbivores. High-throughput metabarcode sequencing was used to track the fungal community from milkweed (Asclepias spp.) leaves to monarch caterpillar frass. The most commonly identified fungal taxa that dominated the caterpillar frass after the consumption of leaves were yeasts, mostly belonging to the Basidiomycota phylum. While most fungal communities underwent significant bottlenecks and some yeast taxa increased in relative abundance, a consistent directional change in community structure was not identified from leaf to caterpillar frass. These results suggest that some phyllosphere fungi, especially diverse yeasts, can survive herbivory, but whether herbivory is a key stage of their life cycle remains uncertain. For exploring phyllosphere fungi and the potential coprophilous lifestyles of endophytic and epiphytic fungi, methods that target yeast and Basidiomycota fungi are recommended.
   Fungal diversity was tracked from milkweed (Asclepias spp.) leaves to monarch caterpillar (Danaus plexippus) frass with metabarcoding to understand potential adaptations of phyllosphere fungi to folivory. The number of fungal species decreased from leaves to frass, with no consistent species increasing in relative abundance, implying a random bottleneck occurs in caterpillar guts. However, Basidiomycota yeasts were notably prevalent in caterpillar frass, suggesting that the yeast growth form could be conducive to surviving caterpillar folivory.. image

AB  - With the aim of identifying insects with potential value as indicator species in postmortem interval (PMI), the location or season of death of human or monogastric animals, two medium-sized large white pigs were used for the study during cold and warm seasons. Five stages of decomposition and their durations were observed and described in the pig carcasses during both seasons. Carcasses were first colonized by flies from seven taxa during fresh stage. Chrysomya marginalis (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Chrysomya albiceps, (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and Musca domestica (Walker) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were recorded as the overall dominant adult flies found on the carcasses in both seasons. Colonization by beetles began during the bloated stage in the warm season and active stage in the cold season. Dermestes maculatus (De Geer) (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) and Necrobia rufipes (De Geer) (Cleridae) were the most abundant beetles in both seasons. Flies and beetles were generally abundant during the warm seasons as compared to the cold season. However, the difference was only significant for beetles. The highest number of flies were recorded in the bloated stage for both seasons, however they were reduced in the active stage which coincided with the introduction of predatory beetles. The arrival time of the different arthropod species and their association with different stages of decomposition during both seasons pointed to their value in estimating the PMI in forensic investigations in the locality of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Consequently, they can potentially be useful in the estimation of PMI and other cases of criminal investigations.

AB  - The use of exogenous hormones has long been of interest for improving reproductive performance in swine production. Enhancing litter size directly impacts the economic efficiency of pig production. Various strategies, including nutritional, genetic, and hormonal approaches, have been explored with varying degrees of success. Administering a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, such as buserelin, at the onset of estrus can induce ovulation and reduce the variation in ovulation timing among sows. This study assessed the impact of GnRH agonist supplementation in boar semen doses on the litter size of inseminated gilts. The research was conducted on a commercial swine herd in northern Thailand. A total of 231 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred gilts, aged 224.5 +/- 16.2 days at the onset of estrus synchronization, participated in the experiment. The gilts' estrus was synchronized with oral altrenogest supplementation at a dosage of 20 mg/day for 18 days. After exhibiting standing estrus, the gilts were randomly divided into three groups. Control group: gilts were inseminated at 0 and 12 h post standing estrus onset with a conventional semen dose (n = 94). Treatment 1: similar to the control group, but with an added 5 mu g (1.25 mL) of buserelin acetate to the boar semen dose during the first insemination (n = 71). Treatment 2: similar to the control group, but with 10 mu g (2.5 mL) of buserelin acetate added to the boar semen dose during the first insemination (n = 66). All gilts were inseminated twice during their standing estrus using the intrauterine artificial insemination method. Each semen dose contained 3.0 x 109 motile sperm in 80 mL. The farrowing rate averaged 78.8% and did not significantly differ between the groups (p = 0.141). The total number of piglets born per litter in the treatment 2 group was greater than in the control group (14.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.2 +/- 0.3, respectively, p = 0.049), but was not significantly different from the treatment 1 group (13.3 +/- 0.3, p = 0.154). Similarly, the number of live-born piglets in the treatment 2 group was greater than in the control and treatment 1 groups (13.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.3 +/- 0.3 and 12.0 +/- 0.4, respectively, p < 0.05). Moreover, the live-born piglets' litter birth weight in the treatment 2 group was greater than in the control group (17.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 15.6 +/- 0.3 kg, respectively, p = 0.008) and the treatment 1 group (15.7 +/- 0.4 kg, p = 0.025). In conclusion, adding a GnRH agonist to boar semen appears to enhance the litter size of gilts. Further research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms and determining the optimal dose and timing for GnRH agonist supplementation.

AB  - A striking feature of plant ecology is the ability of plants to detect and respond to environmental cues such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) by priming or directly activating defenses against future herbivores. However, whether seeds also respond to compounds that are common constituents of HIPV blends and initiate future plant resistance is unknown. Considering that seeds depend on other environmental cues to determine basic survival traits such as germination timing, we predicted that seeds exposed to synthetic constituents of HIPV blends would generate well-defended plants. We investigated the effect of seed exposure to common volatiles on growth, reproduction, and resistance characteristics in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula using herbivores from two feeding guilds. After seed scarification and vernalization, we treated seeds with one of seven different plant-derived volatile compounds for 24 h. Seeds were then germinated and the resulting plants were assayed for growth, herbivore resistance, and expression of inducible defense genes. Of all the synthetic volatiles tested, indole specifically reduced both beet armyworm growth on A. thaliana and pea aphid fecundity on M. truncatula. The induction of defense genes was not affected by seed exposure to indole in either plant species, indicating that activation of direct resistance rather than inducible resistance is the mechanism by which seed priming operates. Moreover, neither plant species showed any negative effect of seed exposure to any synthetic volatile on vegetative and reproductive growth. Rather, M. truncatula plants derived from seeds exposed to (Z)-3-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate grew larger compared to controls. Our results indicate that seeds are sensitive to specific volatiles in ways that enhance resistance profiles with no apparent costs in terms of growth. Seed priming by HIPVs may represent a novel ecological mechanism of plant-to-plant interactions, with broad potential applications in agriculture and seed conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary The consumption of fermented milk products can have health benefits, particularly for those that suffer from lactose intolerance. Condition that is usually caused by insufficient production in the intestinal epithelium of lactase, the enzyme that facilitates the digestion of milk sugar (lactose). The lactose originally present in fermented beverages undergoes fermentation to lactic acid, so its concentration is lower than in processed milk. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the storage time of fermented beverages made from sheep's milk on the lactose content of kefir and yogurts inoculated with various starter cultures. The drinks were made from sheep's milk with natural fat content. A sensory evaluation of the products was carried out to determine the most favorable date of consumption in terms of lactose concentration and organoleptic values. Effects of both inoculation type and beverage storage time were shown for all the parameters. Analysis showed that the optimal storage time for natural yogurt was 21 days. If kefir is to have its optimal taste, storage for more than fourteen days is not advised. The aim of the research was to evaluate lactose content and rheological, physical, chemical, and organoleptic parameters during the storage of fermented beverages made from sheep's milk. The research was carried out on natural, probiotic, and Greek-type yogurts, as well as kefir. The products were made using the thermostat method from the milk of 42 East Frisian sheep in the middle lactation period, in duplicate. Lactose contents, active and titratable acidity, color by the L*a*b*C*h* system, and rheological parameters (hardness, consistency, consistency, and viscosity) were tested, and organoleptic assessments were carried out on the first, seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first days of storing the drinks at 4 degrees C. Of all drinks, the highest reduction in lactose after 21 days of storage was found to occur in kefir (52% reduction) and, among the yogurts, in the Greek yogurt (41% reduction). The product with the lowest lactose content, regardless of the storage period, was kefir. This indicates that kefir is more suitable than yogurt for people with partial lactose intolerance. Effects of both inoculation type and beverage storage time were shown to exist for all parameters. It was also found that kefirs suffered deterioration in most rheological parameters and, in general organoleptic evaluation in the final period of storage. Based on our analysis, the optimal storage time for natural yogurts and sheep's milk kefirs at 4 degrees C was 21 and 14 days, respectively.

AB  - Silent Information Regulator 5 (SIRT5) has been established as a crucial regulator of cellular alanylation modification. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT5 plays a significant regulatory role in key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and fatty acid oxidation, all of which are closely associated with cellular lipid metabolism. Despite these advancements, the specific role of SIRT5 in regulating intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in goats, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we cloned the complete coding sequence of the goat SIRT5 gene and, through amino acid sequence alignment, demonstrated its closest phylogenetic relationship with sheep. Additionally, we characterized the higher expression of SIRT5 during the differentiation of goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. The silencing of SIRT5 by siRNA-mediated knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes and enhanced lipid deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Concurrently, SIRT5 deficiency led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and a marked reduction in apoptosis. Interestingly, although overexpression of SIRT5 promoted cell proliferation, it did not significantly alter lipid deposition in goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified a total of 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following SIRT5 silencing in goat preadipocytes, predominantly involved in the Focal adhesion, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Notably, we successfully reversed the phenotypic effects observed in SIRT5 knockdown goat precursor adipocytes by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways using the AKT inhibitor LY294002 and the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor PD169316, respectively. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that SIRT5 may modulate intramuscular fat deposition in goats through PI3k-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. These results expand the gene regulatory network associated with IMF formation and provide a theoretical foundation for improving meat quality by targeting IMF deposition.

AB  - Simple Summary The work concerns upon the supplementation of linseed oil ethyl esters to boars in order to improve semen parameters. The study included two groups of animals each with n = 6 animals. The application of linseed oil ethyl esters at 3% to the complete feed mixture in the experimental group improved semen parameters. It significantly increased semen parameters in particular sperm viability (p < 0.001), higher semen volume (310 mL versus 216 mL, p < 0.001) and sperm concentration (331 versus 216 million per mL, p < 0.001). Higher semen quality parameters of normospermic boars may have a direct translation into prolonged use of animals, which will significantly reduce pig production costs. Numerous studies have shown that improvements in the sperm and semen quality of males of many species can be achieved with appropriate dietary supplements added to feed or fodder. Particularly promising seems to be the inclusion of omega polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diets of males. Among other things, it has been shown that linseed oil ethyl esters (EELO can be an excellent source of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal diets. These compounds are more durable and resistant to oxidation, epoxidation and resinification processes, and do not exhibit toxic properties in living organisms. At present, there is a lack of data in the literature on the enrichment of boar diets with EELO. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of the addition of EELO to boar diets on the properties of sperm in fresh semen. The study was conducted during the summer on semen collected from 12 boars of the line 990. Linseed oil ethyl esters were administered in each feeding at a rate of 3.0% (45 mL each) in basal diets for each boar on a daily basis for 16 weeks. Ejaculates were collected manually by the gloved-hand technique, at one-week intervals for eight-week periods, from the eighth week onwards after the start of feeding. Eight ejaculates were collected from each boar, totaling 96 samples. The addition of EELO to the diets of boars caused an increase in sperm viability (p < 0.001), semen volume (310 mL versus 216 mL, p < 0.001) and sperm concentration (331 versus 216 million per mL, p < 0.001). Furthermore, in the experimental animals, there was a decrease in the percentage of spermatozoa exhibiting DNA fragmentation. The experimental boars also showed an increase in the percentage of gametes without apoptosis and capacitation and an increase in the percentage of viable spermatozoa not showing lipid peroxidation membranes. Consequently, EELO nutritional supplementation resulted in the improved quality of the fresh semen of boars.

AB  - Veterinary anthelmintics excreted from treated animals pass to soil, subsequently to plants and then to their con -sumers. This circulation might have various consequences, including drug-resistance promotion in helminths. The present study was designed to follow the effect of the environmental circulation of the common anthelmintic drug albendazole (ABZ) in real farm conditions on the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus in vivo. Two fields with fod-der plants (clover and alfalfa) were fertilized, the first with dung from ABZ-treated sheep (at the recommended dos-age), the second with dung from non-treated sheep (controls). After a 10-week growth period, the fresh fodder from both fields was used to feed two groups of sheep, which were infected with H. contortus. Eggs and adult nematodes from the animals of both groups were isolated, and various parameters were compared. No significant changes in the eggs' sensitivity to ABZ and thiabendazole were observed. However, significantly increased expression of several cytochromes P450 and UDP-glycosyl transferases as well as increased oxidation and glycosylation of ABZ and ABZ-sulfoxide (ABZ-SO) was found in the exposed nematodes. These results show that ABZ environmental circulation im-proves the ability of the helminths to deactivate ABZ.

AB  - Mutations in the disrupted in schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene are associated with an increased risk of developing psychological disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Assessing the impact of knocking out genes, like DISC1, in animal models provides valuable insights into the relationship between the gene and behavioral outcomes. Previous research has relied on mouse models to assess these impacts, however these may not yield as reliable or rich a behavioral analysis as can be obtained using rats. Thus, the goal of the present study was to characterize the behavioral effects of a biallelic functional deletion of the DISC1 gene in the Sprague Dawley rat. Female and male wild type and DISC1 knockout rats were assessed beginning just prior to weaning and during the post-weaning periadolescent period. The primary outcomes evaluated were activity, anxiety, responses to novel objects and conspecifics, and prepulse inhibition. These behaviors were selected as analogous indices of psychological dysfunction in humans. The DISC1 knockout had significant effects on behavior, although the kind and magnitude of deficits was different for females and males: in females, effects included hyperactivity, aversion to novelty, and a modest prepulse inhibition deficit; in males, effects in anxiety and neophobia were mild but their prepulse inhibition deficit was large. These data confirm that the DISC1 knockout rat model is an excellent way to reproduce and study symptoms of psychological disorders and provides compelling evidence for differential consequences of its dysfunction for females and males in the progression and emergence of specific behavioral deficits.

AB  - Simple Summary With the development of goat industry, the improvement of goat production performance has become the primary task of goat industry. Studies have shown that SNX29, known for binding to microtubule motor protein activity and phosphatidylinositol, could be a candidate gene for carcass and dorsal fat traits. Many studies have been provided that CNV and indel can affect their phenotypic traits in livestock. However, there are no reports on investigating SNX29 genetic variation in Hunan local goats. In this study, two indels (17 bp-indel and 21 bp-indel) and CNV of SNX29 were identified in 516 individual Xiangdong black goats (a representative Chinese native goat breed in Hunan), while SNX29 CNV was significantly associated with chest circumference and abdominal circumference (p < 0.01). These findings suggested that the SNX29 gene could be used for marker-assisted selection in meat goats. For the first time, this report reveals a novel application prospect for the SNX29 CNV to improve the Chinese local goats. Previous studies have found that the copy number variation (CNV) and insertion/deletion (indels) located in the sorting nexin 29 (SNX29) gene, which is an important candidate gene related to meat production and quality, are associated with growth traits of African goats and Shaanbei white cashmere goats. However, the genetic effects of SNX29 genetic variation on growth traits of Xiangdong black (XDB) goat (a representative meat goat breed in China) are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to detect the mRNA expression level of SNX29 and to explore the genetic effects of CNV and indel within SNX29 on growth traits and gene expression in XDB goat. The SNX29 mRNA expression profile showed that the SNX29 was highly expressed in adipose tissues, indicating that the SNX29 gene could play a key role in subcutaneous adipose deposition of XDB goat. 17 bp indel (g.10559298-10559314), 21 bp indel (g.10918982-10919002) and CNV were detected in 516 individuals of XDB goat by PCR or qPCR. The association analysis of SNX29 CNV with growth traits in XDB goats showed that SNX29 CNV was significantly correlated with chest circumference and abdominal circumference (p < 0.01), and the normal type of SNX29 CNV goat individuals were more advantageous. For the mRNA expression of SNX29 gene, individuals with SNX29 copy number normal type had a higher trend than that of SNX29 gene with copy number gain type in longissimus dorsi muscle (p = 0.07), whereas individuals with SNX29 copy number gain type had a higher trend in abdominal adipose (p = 0.09). Overall, these results suggested that the SNX29 gene could play an important role in growth and development of XDB goats and could be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in XDB goats.

AB  - Context Epiphytic tank bromeliads are a key functional group in Neotropical forests. Yet, they remain under-utilised in environmental restoration efforts. Limited knowledge suggests herbivores are not highly lethal, although they do impact plant establishment of translocated populations. Aims To assess survival and development of micropropagated Vriesea incurvata (Bromeliaceae) translocated to two micro-environments: (1) gallery forest (GF); and (2) forest interior (FI) under the influence of herbivory in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Methods Plants were translocated to phorophytes (3.5-4.0 m) in the GF environment and in the FI environment (76 plants per microhabitat) and monitored for 2 years. Herbivory on leaves, survival and morphometric traits were compared between herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants in the GF and FI environments. Abiotic variables were measured in each microhabitat. Key results Herbivory reduced plant survival in the FI environment (P = 0.039) and, together with low luminosity, was negatively associated with leaf number (LN, P < 0.001). All plants survived in the GF environment. In this microhabitat, herbivory was negatively associated with the length of the longest leaf and foliar rosette diameter (LLL/FRD, P < 0.001), while luminosity was positively related with FRD (P = 0.009) and number of leaves (LN) (P = 0.026). We reported for the first time Calodesma collaris larvae feeding on V. incurvata. Conclusions V. incurvata grows preferentially in the GF environment and serves as food for animals such as moths. Implications Herbivore pressure constitutes a key biotic factor affecting the translocated V. incurvata plants. Together with luminosity, herbivory plays a major role in explaining the observed survival and development patterns.

AB  - Probiotics are suggested to improve pig health, nutrient utilisation, performance, and they may reduce nitrogen (N) pollution. However, the effectivity of a single strain might be different from that of a multi-strain. The study was conducted to investigate the effect of a novel Bacillus multi-strain on nutrient digestibility, energy utilisation, and N retention in weaned piglets using an European diet. The experiment consisted of a control diet (CD) and a supplemented diet (SD). The probiotic used for SD consisted of B. amyloliquefaciens-516 and B. subtilis-541. A total of eight boars/treatment were weaned (day 0; 8.5 kg body weight). Only boars were used to ease the collection of urine. Until day 10, piglets were fed ad libitum and were housed in pairs; from day 11, piglets were fed semi ad libitum (feeding level 3.2x metabolic body weight) and were housed individually. From day 14, faecal and urine were collected twice daily. Piglets were humanely euthanised at day 19 (15.0 kg bodyweight) after which the jejunum, ileum, and colon content were collected. In faeces, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of, amongst others, DM, organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), and subsequently net energy (NE) were calculated using titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker. In the jejunum and ileum, the apparent digestibility of CP was estimated, and in the ileum, the apparent AA digestibility was measured. In urine, the N content was measured to determine N retention. The volatile fatty acid (VFA), branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA), and lactic acid content were analysed in the colon and faeces. The apparent CP digestibility in the jejunum and ileum was not affected by treatment (p > 0.05), and no effect was observed on the apparent ileal digestibility of AA (p > 0.05). Supplementation with the multi-strain probiotic improved the ATTD of DM (p = 0.01; +1.3%) and OM (p = 0.02; +1.2%) and tended to improve the ATTD of CP (p = 0.10; +2.2%) and NSP (p = 0.07; +1.9%). The multi-strain probiotic also improved the NE value (p = 0.02; +0.2 MJ/kg DM) and improved N retention (p = 0.05; +1.6%). Supplementation did not influence the VFA, BCFA, and lactic acid content in the faeces (p > 0.05). However, in the colon, supplementation did influence the lactic acid content (lower; p = 0.01) and tended to influence the valeric acid content (higher; p = 0.09). In conclusion, results from the current study suggest that the multi-strain probiotic has the potential to contribute to improve nutrient efficiency in weaned piglets. More research needs to be conducted to identify the impact of the improved nutrient utilisation on gut health in post-weaned pigs as well as environmental pollution.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenols, can alter neurodevelopmental trajectories and have a lasting neurobehavioral impact through epigenetic pathways. However, outcomes associated with prenatal bisphenol exposure may also be shaped by the postnatal environment and collectively these environmental effects may be sex-specific. Thus, an integrative research design that includes multiple early life exposures and considers sex differences may be essential for predicting outcomes. In the current study, we use a multivariate approach to examine the contributions of prenatal bisphenol exposure, postnatal maternal care, and offspring sex to variation in DNA methylation of well-studied candidate genes (NR3C1, BDNF, OXTR) in the ventral hippocampus and amygdala of adult Long-Evans rats. Main effects of postnatal maternal care and interactions with prenatal bisphenol exposure were consistently found for DNA methylation within the NR3C1 gene (ventral hippocampus) and within the BDNF and OXTR genes (amygdala). Sex-specific effects were also found across all analyses. Overall, our findings suggest that both early-life factors (prenatal and postnatal) and offspring sex contribute to variation in DNA methylation in genes and brain regions relevant for the expression of anxiety-like behavior. These results highlight the need to consider the brain region-specific effects of multiple exposures in males and females to understand the lasting effects of early environments.

AB  - BackgroundInfertility is a growing global health concern affecting millions of couples worldwide. Among several factors, an extreme body weight adversely affects reproductive functions. Leptin is a well-known adipokine that serves as an endocrine signal between adiposity and fertility. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the effects of high leptin level on female reproduction remain unclear.MethodsTransgenic pigs overexpressing leptin (female) were produced by backcrossing and screened for leptin overexpression. The growth curve, fat deposition, reproductive performance, apoptosis, serum hormones and cholesterol production, RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the leptin-overexpressing pigs and wild-type group were evaluated.ResultsTransgenic pigs overexpressing leptin (female) were obtained, which exhibited significantly reduced body weight, body size, and back fat thickness. These pigs manifested a late onset of puberty (330 +/- 54.3 vs. 155 +/- 14.7 days), irregular estrous behavior characterized by increased inter-estrous interval (29.2 +/- 0 vs. 21.3 +/- 0.7 days), and more number of matings until pregnancy (at least 3 times). This reproductive impairment in leptin pigs was related to hormonal imbalances characterized by increased levels of FSH, LH, prolactin, E2, P4, and TSH, altered steroidogenesis such as increased levels of serum cholesterol esters along with steroidogenic markers (StAR, CYP19A), and ovarian dysfunctions manifested by neutrophilic infiltration and low expression of caspase-3 positive cells in the ovaries. Moreover, bulk RNA sequencing of the ovaries also revealed neutrophilic infiltration followed by upregulation of inflammation-related genes. Furthermore, snRNA-seq reflected that leptin overexpression triggered immune response, suppressed follicle development and luteinization, resulting in metabolic dysfunction and hormone imbalance in the ovary.ConclusionsLow body weight in leptin overexpressing pigs adversely affects the reproductive performance, causing delayed puberty, irregular estrous cycles, and reduced breeding efficiency. This is linked to metabolic imbalances, an increased immune response, and altered ovarian functions. This study provides a theoretical basis for the complex mechanisms underlying leptin, and infertility by employing leptin-overexpressing female pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Parity and season are two prominent variants which influence buffalo reproductive performance and synchronization outcome. The present study compared modified new Ovsynch synchronization (GPGMH) protocol with conventional Ovsynch (OVS) in reproductive parameters of buffaloes with different parity (nulliparous and multiparous) in different seasons (peak and low breeding seasons). Compared to the conventional Ovsynch, the modified GPGMH protocol was more effective to enhance the estrus rate, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in multiparous crossbred buffaloes. In addition, the application of GPGMH protocol improve the reproductive performance during the peak breeding season than low breeding season. The present study was conducted to examine the effect of conventional the Ovsynch protocol (OVS) and a modified Ovsynch synchronization (GPGMH) protocol on the follicular dynamics, estrus, ovulation, and pregnancy in nulliparous and multiparous crossbred (swamp x riverine) buffaloes during different seasons. GPGMH or OVS protocols were used to synchronize nulliparous (n = 128; GPGMH = 94, OVS = 34) and multiparous (n = 154; GPGMH = 122, OVS = 32) buffaloes during the peak (n = 186; GPGMH = 143, OVS = 43) and low breeding (n = 96; GPGMH = 73, OVS = 23) seasons. Buffaloes were monitored for follicular dynamics, estrus response, ovulation, and pregnancy rates. The results showed that protocol, parity, and season had significant effects on estrus, ovulation, and pregnancy variables, and interactions among parity and protocol, season and protocol, and season and parity were observed for few of reproductive indices in the crossbred buffaloes. There were no significant (p > 0.05) interaction for protocol, parity and season. In multiparous buffaloes, the application of the GPGMH protocol significantly (p < 0.05) increased the interaction to the interval to estrus onset after the second GnRH, estrus response, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate, and lowered (p < 0.05) the silent estrus when compared with the conventional OVS protocol. During the peak breeding season, the application of the GPGMH protocol significantly (p < 0.05) improved the interaction to the estrus response, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate, while it lowered (p < 0.05) the silent estrus incidence when compared to the conventional OVS protocol. In conclusion, the GPGMH protocol, in comparison to the OVS protocol, improves the follicular dynamics, estrus response, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in crossbred multiparous buffaloes during the peak breeding seasons.

AB  - Freshwater resources available for agricultural production are in decline due to global change. Bottom-up forces due to abiotic stress such as water limitation may modulate parasitoid host range by modifying both adult preference and offspring performance defining parasitoid efficiency and safety in biocontrol programmes. In such context, we evaluated the impact of water limitation on 7 plant traits, 3 aphid performance traits, and parasitoid preference and performance of Aphidius ervi when encountering 6 plant-aphid complexes. The majority of the plants tested were smaller, had reduced stomatal conductance, and reduced leaf transpiration and photosynthesis rates under water limitation. The generalist aphids Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Myzus persicae, and Sitobion avenae were negatively affected by water limitation and showed increased generation time and reduced growth rate. By contrast, the specialist aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum, Aphis nerii, and Rhopalosiphum padi were not, or only slightly, impacted by bottom-up effects. Parasitoid choosiness was not drastically affected by bottom-up effects while aphid host suitability for parasitoid offspring development was decreased in the three generalist aphid species tested but not in the specialist ones. Aphid specificity (generalist vs. specialist) was a key factor explaining the bottom-up effect of water limitation on aphid performance and parasitoid efficacy as a biological control agent. Prediction of the impact of global change on the effectiveness of parasitoids could be useful to select the organisms best adapted to environmental conditions.

AB  - White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and Central American tapir (Tapirus bairdii) are two endangered ungulates that inhabit the Maya Forest in Southern Mexico. These species need water sources almost every day to fill their ecological and physiological needs. How have they survived in a landscape like the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve where the water is very scarce and temporal? We analyzed 10 years of data for both species, collected through the intensive use of camera traps located in 18 ephemeral ponds of the Mexican side of the Maya Forest. These data in combination with occasional data on individual movements of both species collected with radiotelemetry allowed us to describe changes in occupancy, abundance, and movements that show the different strategies these species must cope with during dry periods. The white-lipped peccary population passed through cycles and disappeared from periods of water scarcity, and later, they appeared and stayed close to a few sources of water while the tapir population remained constant and occupied almost all sources of water throughout the years. This contribution increases the ecological knowledge and survival strategies of two endangered tropical ungulates of Mesoamerican Forests that have been disappearing at alarming rates in other forests of the region.

Predators and prey may alter their movement in relation to predator hunting modes, yet few studies have evaluated how these strategies influence movement behaviors of free-ranging animals in a multiple-predator, multiple-prey system. We fit hidden Markov models (HMM) with movement data derived from >400 GPS-collared ungulates and large predators in eastern Washington, USA. We used these models to test our hypotheses that stalking (cougars [Puma concolor]) and coursing (gray wolves [Canis lupus]) predators would exhibit different broad-scale movement behaviors consistent with their respective hunting strategies in areas that increased the likelihood of encountering or capturing ungulate prey (e.g., habitats selected by deer [Odocoileus spp.]). Similarly, we expected that broadscale movement behaviors of prey would change in response to background levels of predation risk associated with each predator's hunting strategy. We found that predators and ungulate prey adjusted their broadscale movements in response to one another's long-term patterns of habitat selection but not based on differences in predator-hunting strategies. Predators changed their movement behaviors based on the type of prey, whereas ungulates generally reduced movement in areas associated with large predators, regardless of the predator's hunting strategy. Both predator and prey movements varied in response to landscape features but not necessarily based on habitat that would facilitate specific hunting behaviors. Our results suggest that predators and prey adjust their movements at broad temporal scales in relation to long-term patterns of risk and resource distributions, potentially influencing their encounter rates with one another at finer spatiotemporal scales. Habitat features further influenced changes in movement, resulting in a complex combination of movement behaviors in multiple-predator, multiple-prey systems.

AB  - Seahorses represent the only known group of animals with male pregnancy. Seahorses have small testis that produce a limited quantity of sperm. To date, the response of this immune-privileged organ to pathogenic infections has not been reported. (3-defensin (BD) is an important innate immune defence factor against pathogens in vertebrate testis. To elucidate its immunoprotection in seahorse testis, we identified the Hippocampus erectus (3-defensin (HeBD) sequence in its genome via phylogenetic tree and protein-sequence structure analysis. Geneexpression analysis showed that HeBD was highly expressed in the seahorse testis and was significantly upregulated after bacterial infection, indicating that HeBD expression was related to testicular immune responses. Furthermore, antibacterial activity testing demonstrated that the mature HeBD peptide exhibited broad-spectrum aggregation activity but only moderate antibacterial activity. We found that the mature HeBD mature significantly neutralised bacterial endotoxin activity. In conclusion, our results imply that HeBD serves an immunoprotective role in seahorse testis.

AB  - Aegilops longissima and Ae. sharonensis, being classified into the Sitopsis section of genus Aegilops, are distinct species both taxonomically and ecologically. Nevertheless, earlier observations indicate that the two species are not reproductively isolated to full extent and can inter-bred upon secondary contact. However, the genomic underpinnings of the morpho-ecological differentiation between the two foci species remained unexplored. Here, we resequenced 31 representative accessions of the two species and conducted in-depth comparative genomic analyses. We demonstrate recurrent and ongoing natural hybridizations between Ae. longissima and Ae. sharonensis, and depict features of genome composition of the resultant hybrids at both individual and population levels. We also delineate genomic regions and candidate genes potentially underpinning the differential morphological and edaphic adaptations of the two species. Intriguingly, a binary morphology was observed in the hybrids, suggesting existence of highly diverged genomic regions that remain uneroded by the admixtures. Together, our results provide new insights into the molding effects of interspecific hybridization on genome composition and mechanisms preventing merge of the two species.

AB  - Peromyscus sonoriensis is a widespread species ranging from southern Texas to the Yukon, from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Because of this extensive range, there are substantial differences in morphology due to variation in temperature, precipitation, and habitat. We used 2 data sets (n = 4,840 and n = 20,175) to study morphological differences of their crania and appendages. Consistent with Allen's rule (shorter appendages with colder temperature), both data sets show a strong, positive, correlation between tail length and the average January temperature. However, there was an equally strong, but negative, correlation between tail length and average July temperature. We observed similar results for feet and crania. Ear length had a significant negative correlation with July average temperature but no correlation with January average temperature. When we controlled for temperature, cranial and appendage length increased with latitude, which was opposite of what we expected. Furthermore, longitude had a strong impact as mice trapped further west had longer appendages. When divided into habitats, forest deer mice are more likely than prairie or desert deer mice to demonstrate morphological responses to differences in climate, location, and year trapped. Our results show that P. sonoriensis exhibit notable morphological variation linked to location, habitat, and climate.
   Peromyscus morphology is influenced by location, habitat, and climate. Depending upon habitat, colder January temperatures are associated with shorter crania and most appendages; likewise, warmer July temperatures are also often associated with shorter crania and appendages, suggesting that both extremes can limit cranial and appendage length. Furthermore, longitude, surprisingly, can also play a further role in morphology.
   Peromyscus sonoriensis es un clado presente desde el sur de Texas hasta el Yuk & oacute;n, desde el Mississippi hasta el Pac & iacute;fico. Debido a esta amplia distribuci & oacute;n geogr & aacute;fica, se pueden observar diferencias sustanciales en su morfolog & iacute;a relacionadas a variaciones de temperatura, precipitaci & oacute;n y h & aacute;bitat. En este estudio se utilizaron dos conjuntos de datos para estudiar las diferencias morfol & oacute;gicas en el cr & aacute;neo y los ap & eacute;ndices. Ambos conjuntos de datos mostraron una fuerte correlaci & oacute;n positiva entre la longitud de la cola y la temperatura promedio en enero, de acuerdo con la regla de Allen (ap & eacute;ndice m & aacute;s corto en temperaturas m & aacute;s bajas). Sin embargo, se encontr & oacute; correlaci & oacute;n igualmente fuerte, pero negativa, entre la longitud de la cola y la temperatura promedio en julio. Se observaron resultados similares en las patas y cr & aacute;neo. La longitud de las orejas tuvo una correlaci & oacute;n negativa significativa con la temperatura promedio en julio, pero no con la temperatura promedio en enero. Al contrario de lo esperado, cuando se control & oacute; el efecto de la temperatura, el largo de los ap & eacute;ndices aument & oacute; con la latitud. Sorprendentemente, la longitud tuvo un fuerte impacto, de manera que los roedores capturados m & aacute;s hacia el oeste ten & iacute;an ap & eacute;ndices m & aacute;s largos. Cuando el & aacute;rea se dividi & oacute; por ecorregiones, los ratones ciervos de bosque mostraro respuestas morfol & oacute;gicas a las diferencias en clima, ubicaci & oacute;n y a & ntilde;o de captura que los de pradera y desirto. Los resultados muestran que P. sonoriensis muestra notable variaci & oacute;n en cr & aacute;neo y ap & eacute;ndices asociada al clima y a la geograf & iacute;a.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the degradation characteristics of oat grass in the rumen of Mindong goats and changes in microbial community attached to the grass surface. Four healthy male goats, aged 14 months, with permanent rumen fistula, in eastern Fujian, were selected as experimental animals. The rumen degradation rate of oat grass was measured at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h using the nylon bag method. Surface physical structure changes in oat grass were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cellulase activity was measured, and bacterial composition was analyzed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The findings of this study indicate that oat grass had effective degradation rates (ED) of 47.94%, 48.69%, 38.41%, and 30.24% for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acidic detergent fiber (ADF), respectively. The SEM was used to investigate the degradation process of oat grass in the rumen. After 24 h, extensive degradation of non-lignified tissue was observed, resulting in the formation of cavities. At 36 h, significant shedding was observed, and by 72 h, only the epidermis and thick-walled tissue, which exhibited resistance to degradation, remained intact. Surface-attached microorganisms produced beta-GC, EG, CBH, and NEX enzymes. The activity of these enzymes exhibited a significant increase between 4 and 12 h and showed a positive correlation with the degradation rate of nutrients. However, the extent of correlation varied. Prevotella and Treponema were identified as key genera involved in the degradation of roughage, with their abundance decreasing over time. Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCOA) revealed no significant differences in the rumen microbial structure across different time points. However, Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) indicated a discernible diversity order among the samples. According to the Spearman correlation coefficient test, Ruminococcus, Fibrobacter, and Saccharoferments exhibited the closest relationship with nutrient degradation rate and surface enzyme activity, displaying a significant positive correlation. In summary, this study delineates a time-resolved correlative framework linking microbial succession to structural and enzymatic dynamics during oat grass degradation.

AB  - Lignite-converted bioorganic fertilizer substantially improves soil physiochemical properties, but little is known about how lignite bioorganic fertilizer (LBF) affects soil microbial communities and how the changed microbial communities impact their stability, functions, and crop growth in saline-sodic soil. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was con-ducted in saline-sodic soil in the upper Yellow River basin, Northwest China. Three treatments, i.e., the control treat-ment without organic fertilizer (CK), the farmyard manure treatment (FYM) amended with 21 t ha-1 (same as local farmers) sheep manure, and the LBF treatment amended with the optimal rate of LBF (3.0 and 4.5 t ha-1), were de-signed in this study. The results showed that after two years of application of LBF and FYM, the percentage of aggregate destruction (PAD) was significantly reduced by 14.4 % and 9.4 %, respectively, while the saturated hydraulic conduc-tivity (Ks) was obviously increased by 114.4 % and 99.7 %, respectively. The LBF treatment significantly increased the contributions of nestedness to total dissimilarity by 101.4 % and 156.2 % in bacterial and fungal communities, respec-tively. LBF contributed to the shift from stochasticity to variable selection in the assembly of the fungal community. The LBF treatment enriched the bacterial classes of Gammaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Methylomirabilia and fungal classes of Glomeromycetes and GS13, which were mainly driven by PAD and Ks. Additionally, the LBF treat-ment significantly increased the robustness and positive cohesions and decreased the vulnerability of the bacterial co -occurrence networks in both 2019 and 2020 in comparison with the CK treatment, indicating that the LBF treatment increased stability of bacterial community. The relative abundance of chemoheterotrophy and arbuscular mycorrhizae in the LBF treatment were 89.6 % and 854.4 % higher than those in the CK treatment, respectively, showing that the LBF enhanced sunflower-microbe interactions. The FYM treatment improved the functions mainly regarding sulfur respiration and hydrocarbon degradation by 309.7 % and 212.8 % in comparison with the CK treatment, respectively. The core rhizomicrobiomes in the LBF treatment showed strong positive connections with the stabilities of both bacterial and fungal co-occurrence networks, as well as the relative abundance and potential functions of chemoheterotrophy and arbuscular mycorrhizae. These factors were also linked to the growth of sunflowers. This study reveals that the LBF improved sunflower growth due to enhance microbial community stability and sunflower-microbe interactions through altering core rhizomicrobiomes in saline-sodic farmland.

AB  - Plastic contamination is widely recognized as a major environmental concern due to the entry of small plastic particles into the food chain, thereby posing potential hazards to human health. However, the current understanding of microplastic (MP; < 5 mm) particles in livestock, which serve as an important food source, is limited. This study aims to investigate the concentration and characteristics of MPs in edible tissues of cow and sheep, namely liver, meat, and tripe, obtained from butcher shops in five areas of Bushehr port, Iran. The mean concentration of MPs in different tissues of cow and sheep were 0.14 and 0.13 items/g, respectively. Among the examined tissues, cow meat exhibited the highest concentration of MPs, with a concentration of 0.19 items/g. Nylon and fiber were identified as the predominant polymer types and shapes of MPs found in cow and sheep tissues, respectively. Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was observed in MP concentration across different tissues of cow and sheep. Significantly, this study highlights the elevated hazards associated with exposure to MPs through the consumption of edible cow and sheep tissues, particularly for children who consume meat. The results underscore the potential transfer of MPs from the environment to livestock bodies through their food, contamination during meat processing, and subsequent health hazards for consumers.

AB  - The dynamics of consumers can be affected by both nutrient-deficient food (low phosphorus (P) to carbon (C) ratio) and nutrient-excessive (high P:C) food, which is known as the stoichiometric knife-edge phenomenon. In this study, aiming to illustrate the responses of herbivores and omnivores to food with excessive P content, we present and analyze a tri-trophic level stoichiometric knife-edge model incorporating the intraguild predation structure. The model dynamics are theoretically examined, including the boundedness and positivity of solutions, the existence and stability of boundary equilibria, and the existence of positive equilibria. Numerical simulations show that the model has complex dynamics, encompassing chaotic-like oscillations, multiple types of bifurcations, long transients, and regime shifts. Moderate P levels facilitate the coexistence of the three species, whereas both lower and higher P levels result in the extinction of herbivores and omnivores. Specifically, the energy enrichment paradox occurs at low P levels. In contrast, the nutrient enrichment paradox occurs at high P levels, both of which are detrimental to the survival of herbivores and omnivores. Furthermore, the high-intensity predation of producers by omnivores helps to restrain the occurrence of chaotic dynamics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of multi-species coexistence.

AB  - Animal personality may influence the foraging behaviour of animals. The state-behaviour feedback hypothesis suggests that variations in personality that drive foraging strategies may be influenced by their physiological states. Appetite hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, play a crucial role in regulating the host's foraging behaviour. In addition, the digestive tract is essential for the digestion and absorption of nutrients, which is related to feed efficiency and the host's foraging behaviour. However, the potential role of appetite hormones and digestive tract morphology as the basis for personality-driven foraging behaviour remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we used the Chinese three-keeled pond turtle to investigate how the boldness-exploration personality syndrome affects food intake and its association with morphological traits, hormones and digestive tract morphology between different personality types. We found a positive link between boldness-exploration personality and physiological state; bolder and more explorative turtles had higher food intake, lower stomach and intestine mass along with shorter stomach and intestine. However, no differences in morphology and serum leptin and ghrelin concentrations were found between these two personality types. Our results indicate that personality could affect foraging behaviour probably because of its association with digestive tract morphology. These results provide new evidence of behavioural-physiological adaptation mechanisms in animal personality, suggesting that personality-related foraging behaviour may covary with the physiological state. Individuals with different personalities may adaptively adjust their foraging behaviour based on their digestive tract morphology. These associations may lead to individual dietary specialization and contribute to achieving a potentially similar fitness expectation of different personalities in nature.

AB  - Endometrial fibrosis in sheep reduces reproductive performance with elusive therapeutic targets. The fibrotic endometrium is a complex ecosystem with heterogeneous cells and their interactions. The molecular characterization of key cells and the mechanisms of these interactions are unclear. To uncover the key molecular features of sheep endometrial fibrosis tissue, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptional characterization of sheep endometrial cells from both normal and fibrotic tissues, aiming to clarify the mechanisms of fibrosis development. Histomorphological analysis revealed significant collagen deposition in fibrotic endometrial tissue. The transcription atlas of sheep endometrial cells was created, identifying eight main endometrial cell types. Key findings include the abnormal expression of collagen-related genes in fibrotic cells and the identification of endothelial cells and fibroblasts as major contributors to fibrogenesis with aberrant receptor-ligand interactions involving collagen-related genes. Fibroblasts had a tendency to differentiate into myofibroblasts in fibroblast-mediated fibrosis progression. In vitro experiments demonstrated the role of fibroblasts in fibroblast activation through the PERK/eIF2 alpha/CHOP stress pathway. Additionally, fibrosis disturbs the immune microenvironment. This study highlights that high collagen gene expression in injured endometrial cells leads to abnormal tissue repair and fibrosis, offering valuable insights for understanding endometrial fibrosis at the single-cell level.

AB  - Simple Summary China is the world's largest pork producer and consumer, and pork is among the most important foods for people. Therefore, pig supply has a bearing on residents' quality of life and the security of the pig industry. However, swine epidemics such as African swine fever have led to drastic changes in pig supply. This study analyzed the mechanism of the effect of swine epidemics on nonlinear shocks to pig supply, and monthly data on pig supply from January 2012 to June 2020 were applied to study the threshold effect of swine epidemics on pig stock and slaughter in China empirically. Our results contribute to devising relevant measures for the prevention and control of swine epidemics. The pig industry is the pillar industry of animal husbandry in China, and epidemics can lead to drastic changes in pig supply, affecting the healthy development of the pig industry and residents' quality of life. This study analyzed the mechanism of the effect of swine epidemics on nonlinear shocks to pig supply, and monthly data on pig supply from January 2012 to June 2020 were applied to study the threshold effect of swine epidemics on pig stock and slaughter in China empirically, using the index of swine epidemics' width (ISEW) as the threshold variable. The results of this study were as follows: (1) The influence of the ISEW over 7 months on pig stock in China was divided into two ranges, and the pig stock did not change significantly when the ISEW was less than 0.25. Swine epidemics had a significantly negative impact on the pig stock when the ISEW was larger than 0.25. (2) The influence of the ISEW over 8 months on pig slaughter was also divided into two ranges. When the ISEW was less than 0.33, epidemics had a positive and significant effect on pig slaughter, while epidemics had a marked negative impact on pig slaughter when the ISEW was greater than 0.33. Based on these conclusions, this study proposed relevant measures for the prevention and control of swine epidemics.

AB  - The heavy metal zinc (Zn) is known to be transmitted in the food chain; however, the effect of Zn stress on beans and herbivorous insects is largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the resistance of broad bean plants to Zn stress and the consequent changes in their physiological and biochemical metabolism by simulating heavy metal pollution in soil. Simultaneously, the effects of aphid progeny treated with different Zn concentrations on the expression of carbohydrate and related genes were analyzed. The results showed that Zn had no effect on the germination rate of broad beans, but other effects mainly manifested as follows. (1) Chlorophyll content decreased. (2) The total soluble sugar and Zn content in stems and leaves increased with increasing Zn content. (3) The proline content first increased and then decreased with increasing Zn content. (4) The height of the seedlings indicates that low concentrations promote growth and high concentrations inhibit growth. In addition, only the first-generation fecundity decreased significantly when aphids fed on heavy metal broad beans. Continuous high Zn levels increase the trehalose content of aphid F1 and F2, while F3 decreases. These results can not only provide a theoretical basis for exploring the impact of soil heavy metal pollution on ecosystems but also preliminarily evaluate the possibility of broad beans as a means of pollution remediation.

TI  - An Integrated Strategy for the Detection, Dereplication, and Identification of DNA-Binding Biomolecules from Complex Natural Product Mixtures
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS
LA  - English
AB  - A fundamental factor in natural product drug discovery programs is the necessity to identify the active component(s) from complex chemical mixtures. Whereas this has traditionally been accomplished using bioassay-guided fractionation, we questioned whether alternative techniques could supplement and, in some cases, even supplant this approach. We speculated that a combination of ligand-fishing methods and modern analytical tools (e.g., LC-MS and online natural product databases) offered a route to enhance natural product drug discovery. Herein, a candidate solution referred to as the lickety-split ligand-affinity-based molecular angling system (LLAMAS) is described. This approach utilizes an ultrafiltration-based LC-PDA-MS/MS-guided DNA-binding assay in combination with the (i) Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking, (ii) Dictionary of Natural Products, and (iii) SciFinder platforms to identify DNA binders in complex chemical mixtures. LLAMAS was initially vetted in tests using known small-molecule DNA binders and then optimized to a 96-well plate-based format. A set of 332 plant samples used in traditional Chinese medicine was screened for DNA-binding activity with LLAMAS, resulting in the identification of seven DNA-binding molecules, including berberine (12), palmatine (13), coptisine (14), fangchinoline (15), tetrandrine (16), daurisoline (17), and dauricine (18). These results demonstrate that LLAMAS is an effective natural product discovery platform for the efficient identification and dereplication of DNA-binding molecules from complex mixtures.

AB  - A novel study was conducted to elucidate heat-stress responses on a number of hair- and skin-based traits in two indigenous goat breeds using a holistic approach that considered a number of phenotypic and genomic variables. The two goat breeds, Kanni Aadu and Kodi Aadu, were subjected to a simulated heat-stress study using the climate chambers. Four groups consisting of six goats each (KAC, Kaani Aadu control; KAH, Kanni Aadu heat stress; KOC, Kodi Aadu control; and KOH, Kodi Aadu heat stress) were considered for the study. The impact of heat stress on caprine skin tissue along with a comparative assessment of the thermal resilience of the two goat breeds was assessed. The variables considered were hair characteristics, hair cortisol, hair follicle quantitative PCR (qPCR), sweating (sweating rate and active sweat gland measurement), skin histometry, skin-surface infrared thermography (IRT), skin 16S rRNA V3-V4 metagenomics, skin transcriptomics, and skin bisulfite sequencing. Heat stress significantly influenced the hair fiber characteristics (fiber length) and hair follicle qPCR profile (Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), HSP90, and HSP110). Significantly higher sweating rate, activated sweat gland number, skin epithelium, and sweat gland number (histometry) were observed in heat stressed goats. The skin microbiota was also observed to be significantly altered due to heat stress, with a relatively higher alteration being noticed in Kanni Aadu goats than in Kodi Aadi goats. Furthermore, the transcriptomics and epigenetics analysis also pointed towards the significant impact of heat stress at the cellular and molecular levels in caprine skin tissue. The higher proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) along with higher differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in Kanni Aadu goats due to heat stress when compared to Kodi Aadu goats pointed towards the better resilience of the latter breed. A number of established skin, adaptation, and immune-response genes were also observed to be significantly expressed/methylated. Additionally, the influence of heat stress at the genomic level was also predicted to result in significant functional alterations. This novel study thereby highlights the impact of heat stress on the caprine skin tissue and also the difference in thermal resilience exhibited by the two indigenous goat breeds, with Kodi Aadu goats being more resilient.

AB  - The volatile fraction of the leaves of Betula glandulosa Michx. has been investigated for its secondary metabolite composition by GC/MS and GC/FID. The rapid expansion of this shrub species in subarctic landscapes, like the ones found in Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada), highly impacts ecosystem dynamics. Yet, despite its abundance, few phytochemical investigations have yet been conducted on this species. In this study, we present the first phytochemical investigation of the volatile metabolites of B. glandulosa leaves. Although no essential oil was isolated, volatile compounds were extracted from the hydrosol by steam distillation. The main metabolites observed were linalool (14.6-19.0 %), C-6 oxylipins (known as green leaf volatiles, GLV; total of 18.2-40.2 %), eugenol (1.6-8.6 %) and alpha-terpineol (3.3-4.8 %). Dwarf birch is an important food source for insects and herbivores, so knowledge of its metabolite composition could help understand parts of its functional role in subarctic ecosystems. The composition of the volatile fraction could serve as marker for differentiating B. glandulosa from other dwarf birch species like Betula nana L.

AB  - The flagship species concept is based on the perceived "charisma" of species. While certain attributes have been proposed to predict charisma, support for conservation of flagship species is often driven by local and context-specific factors. The largest hypersaline lagoon in South America has been considered for restoration programs after suffering from decades of urban development and pollution. Recently, the seahorse Hippocampus reidi was reported in the lagoon, generating significant public attention. Inspired by marketing theory, we conducted a study to evaluate people's preferences for various species inhabiting the lagoon. In a choice experiment, participants were shown high-resolution photographs of ten species, including the seahorse, and asked to rank their top three preferred species (most preferred = 3, second most preferred = 2, and third most preferred = 1), as well as their three least preferred species (least preferred = -3, second least preferred = -2, and third least preferred = -1). We calculated a flagship score for each species based on these rankings and compared them using ANOVA. The seahorse had a significantly higher flagship score than all other species, with its intrinsic aesthetic beauty being the main reason for its preference according to participants. This interest in seahorses presents a unique opportunity to apply the flagship species concept as a conservation fundraising strategy, promoting a biocentric perspective on the largest hypersaline lagoon in South America.

AB  - Eutrophication transforms clear water into turbid water in shallow lakes. Current restoration techniques focus on re-establishing the clear-water state rather than on its maintenance. We investigated the response of submerged macrophytes to temporary grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and scraping snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) in-troductions. We also explored the impacts of herbivores on underwater light conditions to identify their long-and short-term potential to halt regime shift from clear to turbid after clear-water state reestablishment. Herbivores reduced both the biomass of submerged macrophytes and accumulated nutrients in the tissue of submerged macrophytes. This potentially avoided the pulse of endogenous nutrient release which would have exceeded the threshold required for the regime shift from clear to turbid. However, herbivores had a non-significant impact on submerged macrophyte-reduced light attenuation coefficient, which has a positive linear relationship with water chlorophyll a. Further, grass carp and snails enhanced the inhibition ratio of submerged macrophytes to phytoplankton by 3.96 and 2.13 times, respectively. Our study provides novel findings on the potential of herbivore introduction as an indirect biomanipulation tool for halting the regime shift of shallow lakes from clear to turbid after the restoration of submerged macrophytes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the exogenous gut microbiome at early life stages on the development of mice skeletal muscle in adulthood. First, the characteristics of skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota composition of the gut microbiota donors-Erhualian (EH) pigs (a native Chinese breed)-were studied. EH pigs had significantly higher fiber densities and thinner fiber diameters than Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire crossed (DLY) pigs (p < 0.05). The expression levels of genes related to oxidized muscle fibers, mitochondrial function, and glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle of EH pigs were significantly higher than those in DLY pigs (p < 0.05). Moreover, the abundances of 8 gut microbial phyla and 35 genera correlated with the skeletal muscle fiber diameters and densities exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05) between EH and DLY pigs. Subsequently, newborn mice were treated with saline (CG) and fecal microbiota suspensions collected from EH pigs (AG), respectively, for 15 days, starting from the day of birth. In adulthood (60 days), the relative abundances of Parabacteroides, Sutterella, and Dehalobacterium were significantly higher in the feces of the AG mice than those of the CG mice. The microbes contribute to improved functions related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The weight, density, and gene expression related to the oxidized muscle fibers, mitochondrial function, and glucose metabolism of the AG group were significantly higher than those of the CG group (p < 0.05), whereas the fiber diameters in the skeletal muscle of the AG mice were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the CG mice. These results suggested that intervention with exogenous microbiota at early stages of life can affect the fiber size and energy metabolism of their skeletal muscle.

AB  - Skin is the largest mammalian organ and the first defensive barrier against the external environment. The skin and fur of mammals can host a wide variety of ectoparasites, many of which are phylogenetically diverse, specialized, and specifically adapted to their hosts. Among hematophagous dipteran parasites, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to serve as important attractants, leading parasites to compatible sources of blood meals. VOCs have been hypothesized to be mediated by host-associated bacteria, which may thereby indirectly influence parasitism. Host-associated bacteria may also influence parasitism directly, as has been observed in interactions between animal gut microbiota and malarial parasites. Hypotheses relating bacterial symbionts and eukaryotic parasitism have rarely been tested among humans and domestic animals, and to our knowledge have not been tested in wild vertebrates. In this study, we used Afrotropical bats, hematophagous ectoparasitic bat flies, and haemosporidian (malarial) parasites vectored by bat flies as a model to test the hypothesis that the vertebrate host microbiome is linked to parasitism in a wild system. We identified significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as striking differences in skin microbial network characteristics between ectoparasitized and nonectoparasitized bats. We also identified links between the oral microbiome and presence of malarial parasites among miniopterid bats. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial symbionts may serve as indirect mediators of parasitism among eukaryotic hosts and parasites.

AB  - Coniferous trees produce secondary or defense chemicals, such as terpenes, against pest insects. Terpenes could serve as constitutive or induced defensive mechanisms, defending the tree from invasive herbivores. The Mediterranean pine shoot beetle Tomicus destruens colonizes stems and branches of Pinus brutia trees and even can kill mature trees during periodic outbreaks. We investigated whether terpene profiles of needle and stem of P. brutia trees differ between health and those infested by T. destruens. We selected 20 healthy and T. destruens-infested trees and analyzed the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes of their needles and phloem. We found higher concentrations of tricyclene, camphene and p-cymene in the phloem of infested trees. Similarly, the needles of infested trees had higher concentrations of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, limonene, trans-beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene than healthy trees. These results show that the monoterpene and sesquiterpene profiles of P. brutia trees differed between healthy and infested trees, suggesting that volatile terpenes may be an important part of plant-induced responses against T. destruens.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the reproductive performance of sows submitted to single fixed-time insemination (SFTAI) using boars according to capacity for liquid in vitro semen preservation, type of extender, and storage time. Boars (n = 12) were classified into two groups based on progressive motility (PM) at 120 h of semen storage: low (PM - 64.5%) - and high-preservation (PM - 83.9%) capacity for semen storage. Weaned sows (n = 397, parity - 1 to 7) were inseminated (1.5x109 sperm cells) in a factorial design: two classes of boars (low- or high-preservation), two types of extenders (short- or long-term), and two semen storage times at insemination (24 or 72 h). An adapted triptorelin acetate protocol was used for SFTAI. Total sperm motility (TM) and PM at insemination were greater in high-preservation boars at 72 h compared with low-preservation boars at 24 or 72 h (P < 0.01). Short- or long-term extender did not affect (P >= 0.68) TM and PM in high-preservation boars; however, long-term extender improved these parameters in low-preservation boars (P < 0.01). Pregnancy and farrowing rates were not affected by groups (P > 0.05). Total piglets born (TPB) was reduced (P = 0.05) in low-preservation boars with 72 h of storage (13.6 +/- 0.5) compared to high-preservation boars with semen stored for 24 or 72 h (15.2 +/- 0.5 and 15.5 +/- 0.5, respectively). The low-preservation boars reduced the TPB in sows submitted to SFTAI, and this reduction was greater using semen stored for 72 h.

AB  - Precise assessment of bark stripping damage is of high economic importance, since bark stripping makes wood unusable for saw timber and it is important for compensation payments for game damage. Bark stripping is clustered and decreases with increasing tree diameter, so that common forest inventories, optimized for assessing timber production variables such as standing timber volume, do not provide adequately precise estimates of bark stripping damage. In this study we analysed different sampling designs (random sampling, systematic sampling), tree selection methods (fixed radius plot, angle count sampling) and number of plots and plot sizes (plot radius: 2-20 m; basal area factor: 1-6m(2)/ha) for bark stripping assessment. The analysis is based on simulation studies in 9 fully censused stands (9026 trees). Simulations were done for actually assessed damage and randomly distributed damage and each scenario was repeated 100 times with different random points or different random grid locations. Systematic sampling was considerably more precise than random sampling in both scenarios. Sampling intensities to attain a standard error of 10% ranged between 12 and 18% dependent on the plot size. For a given sampling intensity, precision increased with decreasing plot size or increasing basal area factor. This implies, however, a large number of plots to be measured, which is expensive, when travel costs are high. Differences between tree selection by fixed radius plots or angle count sampling were minor. For bark stripping damage, we recommend sampling with fixed radius plots with a radius of 4-6 m and the measurement of approximately 230 or 150 plots, respectively.

AB  - The infection dynamics of Coxiella (C.) burnetii were investigated in three dairy goat herds (A, B, and C) 2 years after the first pathogen detection. A total of 28 and 29 goats from herds A and B, and 35 goats from herd C, were examined. Sera were analyzed on three sampling dates using phase-specific serology. Pathogen shedding was assessed using post-partum vaginal swabs and monthly bulk tank milk (BTM) samples. Dust samples from a barn and milking parlor were also collected monthly. These samples were analyzed with PCR (target IS1111). In herd A, individual animals tested seropositive, while vaginal swabs, BTM, and most dust samples tested negative. Herds B and C exhibited high IgG phase I activity, indicating a past infection. In herd B, approximately two-thirds of the goats shed C. burnetii with vaginal mucus, and irregular positive results were obtained from BTM. Herd C had two positive goats based on vaginal swabs, and BTM tested positive once. Dust samples from herds B and C contained C. burnetii DNA, with higher quantities typically found in samples from the milking parlor. This study highlights the different infection dynamics in three unvaccinated dairy goat herds and the potential use of dust samples as a supportive tool to detect C. burnetii at the herd level.

AB  - Biologically available nitrogen from human activities have altered nutrient dynamics across landscapes and aquatic ecosystems. Small spatial changes in land use and river management, may contribute to altered nutrient dynamics and influence denitrification and assimilatory uptake in river systems. Human actions can influence the stoichiometry of rivers. Construction of Libby Dam and the creation of the transboundary Koocanusa Reservoir has resulted in sequestration of approximately 60%-80% of the phosphorus entering the reservoir. Recent and ongoing expansion of surficial mining operations in one tributary upstream of Koocanusa Reservoir, the Elk River, has increased nitrate loading tenfold or more to Koocanusa Reservoir and to the Kootenai River. The combination of excessive nitrate loading and decreased phosphorus availability has skewed the N:P ratio to greater than 200:1 in both the river and reservoir. To address how this altered stoichiometry influences nitrogen spiraling in a large river, we estimated nitrate uptake over 16 years in five reaches of the Kootenai River. Reaches spanned 224 river km and types were based on natural and anthropogenically-influenced geomorphology. Although we documented a decline in nitrate moving longitudinally downstream indicating that nitrate is being used by the biota, the magnitude and timing of areal nitrate uptake varies among the reaches. Areal nitrate uptake did not differ between the early years with lower nitrate concentrations and the later years with higher nitrate concentrations suggesting that the Kootenai River is nitrogen saturated. Phosphorus addition, used as a management tool to offset P sequestration in the reservoir, increased areal nitrate uptake and extended the period of higher areal nitrate uptake. Without increases to the ecosystem functions of nitrogen transformation and removal, the ecosystem becomes saturated and the entire load is being transported downstream.

AB  - In the present study, we analysed fertility and longevity traits of 22 sheep breeds from Germany with a suitable quantity of data in the national database OviCap. The data comprised merino, meat, country and milk sheep breeds with 62,198 ewes and about 173,000 lambing records, until the fifth lambing. Across-breed means of heritabilities reached estimates of 0.13, 0.17 and 0.18 for number of lambings, average number of lambs born per lambing and number of lambs per lifetime, respectively. For age at first lambing, length of lifetime and productive life, mean heritabilities over breeds were 0.34, 0.17 and 0.32, respectively. The across-breed means of the individual rate of inbreeding were significantly negative for the average number of lambs born per lambing and number of lambs born per lifetime, and for number of lambings it was close to the significance threshold. We found declining slopes for inbreeding depression for the average number of lambs born per lambing and number of lambs born per lifetime in 16 breeds, and significantly negative slopes in five and seven breeds. For lifetime and productive life, 9/22 and 8/22 breeds showed significant inbreeding depression, while for age at first lambing, only 1/22 breeds showed significant inbreeding depression. A significant reduction in inbreeding depression due to purging effects was found for eight breeds. Fitness traits may be subject to forced directional selection. Therefore, sheep breeding programmes should give special consideration to fertility and longevity traits. Fitness related traits seem to be essential in conservation of genetic diversity within sheep breeds.

AB  - Consumers expect ruminants to graze outdoors and flocks to be of a reasonable size. Dairy goats can be kept outdoors (natural) or indoors. There are few pasture-grazed-system goat farms. The farms we studied in the centre-west of France were either organic or conventional, and all used pastures and tended to meet consumer demand for naturalness. We obtained information through semi-directed interviews. Dairy goats are susceptible to gastrointestinal infections when using pastures and this was one of the main health problems mentioned by organic farmers. There are a very limited number of medicines available for lactating dairy goats and farmers can use complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM), where they are completely autonomous in their choice. The use of CAVM has also been driven by organic labels and protected designation of origin (PDO) regulations for goat cheese. Homeopathy, phytotherapy, and aromatherapy were used for various health problems on almost all the farms surveyed. Herd size and farm area were negatively associated with the complex use of CAVM, possibly due to the workload on larger farms. Some CAVMs were used more in relation to the management of farms: aromatherapy in organic farms and homeopathy in cheese-making farms. The farmers with higher levels of education were more likely to employ phytotherapy. The farmers were autonomous in the choice of CAVM and did not rely on the advice of veterinarians.

AB  - The epidermis plays an indispensable barrier function in animals. Some species have evolved unique epidermal structures to adapt to different environments. Aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals (cetaceans, manatees, and hippopotamus) are good models to study the evolution of epidermal structures because of their exceptionally thickened stratum spinosum, the lack of stratum granulosum, and the parakeratotic stratum corneum. This study aimed to analyze an upstream regulatory gene transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 3 (TRPV3) of epidermal differentiation so as to explore the association between TRPV3 evolution and epidermal changes in mammals. Inactivating mutations were detected in almost all the aquatic cetaceans and several terrestrial mammals. Relaxed selective pressure was examined in the cetacean lineages with inactivated TRPV3, which might contribute to its exceptionally thickened stratum spinosum as the significant thickening of stratum spinosum in TRPV3 knock-out mouse. However, functional TRPV3 may exist in several terrestrial mammals due to their strong purifying selection, although they have "inactivating mutations." Further, for intact sequences, relaxed selective constraints on the TRPV3 gene were also detected in aquatic cetaceans, manatees, and semi-aquatic hippopotamus. However, they had intact TRPV3, suggesting that the accumulation of inactivating mutations might have lagged behind the relaxed selective pressure. The results of this study revealed the decay of TRPV3 being the genomic trace of epidermal development in aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals. They provided insights into convergently evolutionary changes of epidermal structures during the transition from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment.

AB  - The operation of the Three Gorges Dam has altered the hydrological regime of Dongting Lake, leading to earlier water level recession and premature lake bed exposure. The hydrological shift has accelerated the early development of Carex spp.-dominated meadows, resulting in phenological mismatches between Carex brevicuspis (the primary food source for herbivorous geese) and the arrival of herbivorous geese. This mismatch has reduced suitable food resources for these geese during their wintering period. This study aimed to assess how mowing treatments mitigate this mismatch by improving the quality of C. brevicuspis. During the 2023/2024 wintering season, we studied the effects of mowing treatments on C. brevicuspis and the underlying mechanisms. Three treatments were applied: complete mowing (CM; stubble height < 0.3 cm), stubble mowing (SM; stubble height 15 cm), and no mowing (CK). The results showed that mowing treatments significantly increased leaf moisture and nitrogen content, reduced crude fiber content, and thereby increased the quality and food utilization rates by herbivorous geese. Additionally, mowing increased the quality of C. brevicuspis by stimulating compensatory growth responses, which relies on the resources of the belowground bud banks mechanisms. However, mowing treatments also significantly decreased plant height, density, aboveground biomass, and the biomass of belowground bud banks, which potentially impairs the long-term recovery and sustainability of plant. Therefore, while targeted mowing can effectively improve the food quality for herbivorous geese during wintering, careful consideration of the management of mowing frequency and intensity are essential to maintain balance between the wetland vegetation recovery and the sustainable food supply for herbivorous geese.

AB  - Kelp habitats are threatened across the globe, and because of their ecological importance, active conservation and restoration solutions are needed. The use of man-made structures as artificial reefs is one way to enhance kelp habitat by providing suitable substrata, but in the past the ecology of artificial structures has been investigated mainly in contrast to natural coastal habitats, not as elements integrated into the seascape. Indeed, it is now emerging that structuring processes, including ecological interactions (e.g., herbivory), can depend on properties of the surrounding seascape. In Eastern Canada, grazing by the green sea urchin can jeopardize the success of artificial reefs for kelp enhancement. Urchin activity is, however, likely to be influenced by the bottom composition, and thus a seascape approach is needed to integrate urchin behavior and habitat heterogeneity. Adopting a spatially explicit framework, we investigated whether the seascape creates areas of differential grazing risk for kelp by affecting urchin habitat use. Specifically, we transplanted kelp onto modules of artificial substrata distributed on a heterogeneous area that we mapped for bottom type and algal cover. After following kelp survival and urchin distribution over time, we modeled kelp survival as function of urchin metrics and coupled it to urchin use of the habitat models to map grazing risk in the area. Kelp survival was a function of the frequency of the urchins presence. Urchins avoided sandy patches, while bottom composition and algal cover modulated the within-patch urchin use of the habitat, creating heterogeneity in grazing risk. Discrete seascape features (boulders) also increased the grazing risk locally. The heterogeneity of coastal seafloor can thus play a major role in determining the ecological outcomes on artificial structures. Incorporating this information when planning artificial reefs could minimize the detrimental grazing risk, thereby increasing the success of artificial reefs for kelp habitat enhancement.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to assess the effects of a geothermal plus sunlight-based incubator on the growth performance, electricity uses and housing environment of piglets. A total of 20 piglets, average 7.7 +/- 0.015 kg (mean +/- std.) initial body weight, were randomly divided into two separated incubators: control (conventional incubator) and the geothermal plus sunlight-based heat pump (GS) incubator with 10 replicated piglets. The experimental duration was 8 weeks. Average daily weight gain, feed intake, electricity consumption, and house temperature, humidity, ammonia, and carbon dioxide concentration were measured on a weekly basis. There were no significant differences in the final body weight, average daily body weight gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between the incubators. The electricity consumption of the GS incubator was reduced by 120.95 kWh/head and the saving efficacy was about 64.76% that of the conventional incubator. The electricity cost was reduced by 3.26 USD and the ratio of feed cost to weigh gain was lower in the GS-based incubator. No significant differences were noted for the internal temperature and humidity between the incubators. The ammonia concentration and carbon dioxide concentration were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the GS-based incubator than the control incubator. The geothermal plus sunlight-based incubator might be healthy and economic for the sustainable pig production.

AB  - In vitro maturation (IVM) and cryopreservation of goat oocytes are important for establishing a valuable genetic bank for domesticated female animals and improving livestock reproductive efficiency. C-Phycocyanin (PC) is a Spirulina extract with antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and radical scavenging properties. However, whether PC has positive effect on goat oocytes IVM or developmental competence after vitrification is still unknown. In this study, we found that first polar body extrusion (n = 293), cumulus expansion index (n = 269), and parthenogenetic blastocyst formation (n = 281) were facilitated by adding 30 mu g/mL PC to the oocyte maturation medium when compared with the control groups and that supplemented with 3, 10, 100 or 300 mu g/mL PC (P < 0.05). Although PC supplementation did not affect spindle formation or chromosome alignment (n = 115), it facilitated or improved cortical granules migration (n = 46, P < 0.05), mitochondria distribution (n = 39, P < 0.05), and mitochondrial membrane potential (n = 46, P < 10(-4)). Meanwhile, supplementation with 30 mu g/mL PC in the maturation medium could significantly inhibit the reactive oxygen species accumulation (n = 65, P < 10(-4)), and cell apoptosis (n = 42, P < 0.05). In addition, PC increased the oocyte mRNA levels of GPX4 (P < 0.01), and decreased the mRNA and protein levels of BAX (P < 0.01). Next, we investigated the effect of PC supplementation in the vitrification solution on oocyte cryopreservation. When compared with the those equilibrate in the vitrification solution without PC, recovered oocytes in the 30 mu g/mL PC group showed higher ratios of normal morphology (n = 85, P < 0.05), survival (n = 85, P < 0.05), first polar body extrusion (n = 62, P < 0.05), and parthenogenetic blastocyst formation (n = 107, P < 0.05). Meanwhile, PC supplementation of the vitrification solution increased oocyte mitochondrial membrane potential (n = 53, P < 0.05), decreased the reactive oxygen species accumulation (n = 73, P < 0.05), promoted mitochondria distribution (n = 58, P < 0.05), and inhibited apoptosis (n = 46, P < 10(-3)). Collectively, our findings suggest that PC improves goat oocyte IVM and vitrification by reducing oxidative stress and early apoptosis, which providing a novel strategy for livestock gamete preservation and utilization.

KW  - PROFILE
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as a central toxic factor of gram-negative bacteria, can induce oxidative stress and cellular inflammation to result in the impairment of female fertility in different organisms. Particularly, it has harmful effects on the oocyte quality and subsequent embryonic development. However, the approach concerning how to prevent oocytes from LPS-induced deterioration still remains largely unexplored. We assessed the effective influences of velvet antler water extract (VAWE) by immunostaining and fluorescence intensity quantification on the meiotic maturation, mitochondrial function and sperm binding ability of oocytes under oxidative stress. Here, we report that VAWE treatment restores the quality of porcine oocytes exposed to LPS. Specifically, LPS exposure contributed to the failed oocyte maturation, reduced sperm binding ability and fertilization capability by disturbing the dynamics and arrangement of meiotic apparatuses and organelles, including spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, actin polymerization, mitochondrial dynamics and cortical granule distribution, the indicators of oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Notably, VAWE treatment recovered these meiotic defects by removing the LPS-induced excessive ROS and thus inhibiting the apoptosis. Collectively, our study illustrates that VAWE treatment is a feasible strategy to improve the oocyte quality deteriorated by the LPS-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - Plants synthesise a vast array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serve as chemical defence and communication agents in their interactions with insect herbivores. Although nitrogen (N) is a critical resource in the production of plant metabolites, its regulatory effects on defensive VOCs remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of N content in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) on the tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura), a notorious agricultural pest, using biochemical and molecular experiments in combination with insect behavioural and performance analyses. We observed that on tomato leaves with different N contents, S. litura showed distinct feeding preference and growth and developmental performance. Particularly, metabolomics profiling revealed that limited N availability conferred resistance upon tomato plants to S. litura is likely associated with the biosynthesis and emission of the volatile metabolite alpha-humulene as a repellent. Moreover, exogenous application of alpha-humulene on tomato leaves elicited a significant repellent response against herbivores. Thus, our findings unravel the key factors involved in N-mediated plant defence against insect herbivores and pave the way for innovation of N management to improve the plant defence responses to facilitate pest control strategies within agroecosystems.

AB  - Sheep are a vital species in the global agricultural economy, providing essential resources such as meat, milk, and wool. Merino sheep (Junken type) are a key breed of fine wool sheep in China. However, research on fine wool traits has largely overlooked the role of SNPs and their association with phenotypes. Copy number variations (CNVs) have emerged as one of the most important sources of genetic variation, influencing phenotypic traits by altering gene expression and dosage. To generate a comprehensive CNVR map of the ovine genome, we conducted genome-wide CNV detection using genotyping data from 285 fine wool sheep. This analysis revealed 656 CNVRs, including 628 on autosomes and 28 on the X chromosome, covering a total of 43.9 Mbs of the sheep genome. The proportion of CNVRs varied across chromosomes, from 0.45% on chromosome 26 to 3.72% on chromosome 10. Functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses highlighted significantly enriched GO terms, including odorant binding, ATP binding, and sulfuric ester hydrolase activity. The KEGG analysis identified involvement in pathways such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance, ECM-receptor interaction, the one-carbon pool by folate, and focal adhesion (p < 0.05). To validate these CNVRs, we performed quantitative real-time PCR experiments to verify copy number predictions made by PennCNV software (v1.0.5). Out of 11 selected CNVRs with predicted gain, loss, or gain-loss statuses, 8 (IDs 68, 156, 201, 284, 307, 352, 411, 601) were successfully confirmed. This study marks a significant step forward in mapping CNVs in the ovine genome and offers a valuable resource for future research on genetic variation in sheep.

AB  - Seasonal drought has hindered the sustainable growth of the Camellia oil tree industry. While brassinolide (BL) can mitigate drought stress in plants to some extent, the regulatory mechanisms underlying BL's effects in Camellia oil tree remain unclear. To investigate the mechanisms by which BL alleviates drought stress in Camellia oil tree, three-year-old 'Huashuo' cutting seedling was exposed to three experimental treatments: CK (normal watering), UW (no watering), and BL (no watering, sprayed with 1 mg center dot L- 1 BL). Leaf anatomical observation, hormone quantification, and transcriptomic profiling were performed on leaf samples collected at days 2, 4, and 6 following treatments. The results demonstrated that (i) BL treatment significantly increased leaf and spongy tissue thickness; (ii) BL reduced ABA and IAA levels in leaves under drought stress; (iii) WGCNA identified three modules linked to ABA, IAA, and their corresponding hormone levels, with subsequent analysis infer NAC transcription factors (TFs) as the primary regulators in these modules. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of BL in alleviating drought stress in tree crop and provides a fundamental reference for molecular breeding and genetic improvement of Camellia oil tree.

AB  - Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) live in large colonies with one breeding female (queen), one to three breeding males (BMs) and the remainder are non-reproductive subordinates. The animals have a linear dominance rank with the breeders at the top of the hierarchy. We investigated how dominance rank in naked mole-rats differs with exploration (the propensity to explore a novel environment) and related endocrine markers. Exploration behaviour, faecal progestagen metabolite (fPM), faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM), faecal androgen metabolite (fAM) and plasma prolactin concentrations were quantified in breeding, high-, middle- and low-ranked females and males from five naked mole-rat colonies. There were no significant differences between the dominance rank and exploration behaviour. Interestingly, the queens and high-ranking females had higher fGCM and fAM concentrations compared with middle- and low-ranked females. The queens had significantly higher fPM concentrations than all other ranked females, since they are responsible for procreation. In the males, the BMs had higher fGCM concentrations compared with high- and low-ranked males. In addition, BMs and middle-ranking males had overall higher prolactin levels than all other ranked males, which could be linked to cooperative care. Overall, the results suggest that physiological reproductive suppression is linked to high dominance rank.

AB  - With the booming development of biogas industry to treat organic waste in China, the by-product of biogas slurry was accompanied with a huge amount. Static storage process of biogas slurry was normally operated under different seasons before application to land which would cause nutrition decomposition and greenhouse gas emission. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the nutrition decomposition, greenhouse gas emission (CH4 and N2O), and phytotoxicity of biogas slurry under different static temperatures, furthermore to illuminate the network among them and functional microorganism. According to the results, higher temperature at 30 degrees C contributed to fast and complete degradation of COD. In addition, more quantity of NH4+ conversion and NO3- formation appeared at 30 degrees C. These factors resulted in relatively less crop toxicity together. CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas emission than N2O and was highest in 30 degrees C treatment with total emission of 273.7 L/(m(3)center dot d) and greenhouse gas emission of 20.01 kg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent). Lower temperature was conductive to N reservation and reduction of greenhouse gas emission, but making against with stabilization of organic matter and crop safety. At the same dilution times (<= 3) of biogas slurry with deionized water, higher temperature at 30 degrees C could reduce 30 days of storage time, but 10 degrees C was still unsafe for crop. Structural equation model was further illustrated the positive effect of temperature on NO3-, CH4, GI, and N2O and negative on COD and NH4+. These results could help to monitor the environmental risk, evaluate the maturity, guide the irrigation scheme, and regulate the static storage condition of biogas slurry under different seasons.

AB  - Incorporating non-crop habitats around cropping fields is often promoted to enhance biodiversity and deter crop pests. However, few studies have investigated how these habitats influence the overwintering success of pest populations. In this study, we investigate how a specialist insect pest, the asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), uses local and landscape resources for overwintering. We surveyed beetles in 2019-2020 at 11 asparagus farms in Michigan, USA, and conducted experiments to compare overwintering survival of adult beetles in five substrates commonly found in asparagus agroecosystems. We compared the overwintering number of beetles across three habitat types: asparagus field, weedy margin, and woodlot. Overwintering asparagus beetle abundance was highest within sites with deciduous leaves and decomposing asparagus stalks. We found a negative relationship between the abundance of dead trees in adjacent woodlots and adult beetle abundance. We then expanded beyond the woodlots with a landscape analysis conducted at multiple spatial scales. Landscape analysis indicated that deciduous forest within 1250 m of sites increased beetle abundance in focal asparagus fields, while asparagus production at spatial scales greater than 1500 m suppressed their populations. Our findings indicate that certain specialist pests, like asparagus beetles, depend on host resources for overwintering, but non-host habitat from the surrounding landscape is also important to their success. Practically, removal of host and non-host debris (leaf litter) from asparagus fields may lead to decreased survival and lower pest pressures. In addition, crop-dominated landscapes may not require in-field habitat management of overwintering substrates to the same extent as more diverse landscapes with higher proportions of non-host habitat (deciduous forest). Ultimately, we argue that the net positive and negative impact of increasing nonhost habitat at the landscape level should be considered when developing integrated pest management strategies for specialists at the local scale.

AB  - Asthma has been extensively studied in humans and animals, but the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma in Meishan pigs, a breed with distinct genetic and physiological characteristics, remain elusive. Understanding these mechanisms could provide insights into veterinary medicine and human asthma research. We investigated asthma pathogenesis in Meishan pigs through transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of blood samples taken during autumn and winter. Asthma in Meishan pigs is related to inflammation, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle disorders. Related genes include CXCL10, CCL8, CCL22, CCL21, OLR1, and ACKR1, while metabolites include succinic acid, riboflavin-5-phosphate, and fumaric acid. Transcriptomic sequencing was performed on panting and normal Meishan pigs, and differentially expressed genes underwent functional enrichment screening. Metabolomic analysis revealed differential metabolites and pathways between groups. Combined analyses indicated that lung inflammation is influenced by genetic, allergenic, and environmental factors disrupting oxidative phosphorylation in lung mitochondria, affecting the TCA cycle. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, glutathione S-transferases, arginase 1 and RORC in immune regulation, the Notch pathway, YPEL4 in cell proliferation, and MARCKS in airway mucus secretion play roles in asthma pathogenesis. This study highlights that many cytokines and signaling pathways contribute to asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate their complex interactions.

AB  - Purpose The stomachs and spiral valves of sharks and rays were examined for their trypanorhynch (Cestoda) parasite fauna and dietary items to infer feeding ecology. In Indonesia, sharks and rays have been experiencing increasing awareness and conservation in the recent years due to high fisheries activities and to avoid future species extinction. Methods The samples were collected in 2009 from two different sampling sites at the southern coasts of Java and Bali in Indonesia. The parasite fauna was studied for 41 elasmobranch fishes. Amongst these, three shark species, Carcharhinus sorrah, Carcharhinus sp. I and Squalus megalops and seven ray species, Brevitrygon heterura, B. cf. heterura, Gymnura zonura, Maculabatis gerrardi, Mobula kuhlii, Neotrygon cauruleopuncatata and Rhinobatos penggali were studied. Four additional specimens, belonging to the shark species Carcharhinus sp. II and Mustelus cf. manazo and the ray species Maculabatis gerrardi were studied from the waters of South Bali. Results Analyses of the feeding ecology of the ray M. gerrardi revealed distinct differences between both sampling sites, indicating the presence of ecological differences between the geographically independent regions. A total of 11 different trypanorhynch species/taxa belonging to the five families Eutetrarhynchidae (5), Gilquiniidae (1), Lacistorhynchidae (1), Pterobothriidae (1) and Tentaculariidae (3) were found. Ten trypanorhynch species from Penyu Bay and four species from South Bali could be identified. Two taxa that might represent new species were collected: Dollfusiella sp. from Brevitrygon heterura and Prochristianella sp. from Maculabatis gerrardi. Conclusions The present paper gives insights in using the trypanorhynch cestode community in combination with feeding ecology analyses to support conservation of elasmobranchs in Indonesian waters.

AB  - Substituting mineral fertilizer with organic fertilizer and plant growth-promoting microbes (PGPM) inoculation have been well documented as two possible mitigation options for soil nitrogen (N)-oxide (N2O and NO) emissions in cropland. However, whether the combined application of the two measures can have an additive, antagonistic or no effect in reducing N-oxide emissions is unknown, especially in tropical-intensive vegetable fields. Utilizing a field experiment in typical tropical continuous and rotational vegetable cultivation systems, we examined how organic fertilizer substitution for mineral fertilizer accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation influenced N-oxide emissions, vegetable yields, and successive cropping obstacles. Partial substitution with organic fertilizer accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation increased vegetable yields based on alleviating the incidence of plant wilt and decreased N-oxide emissions by 11 % compared to the partial substitution and by 35 % compared to conventional mineral fertilizer. These inhibitory effects on soil N-oxide emissions may be mainly attributed to the increased abundance of nosZ genes and the key species enrichment in the bacterial co-occurrence networks related to N2O reduction (Desulfobacteroata and Verrucomicrobiota), and decreased in nirS genes. The stimulation of vegetable yield and the incidence of plant wilt suppression following organic substitution accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation was probably due to the promoted efficiency of N uptake and utilization by vegetables. Although the increased amount of organic fertilizer application was another strategy for stimulating vegetable yields and reducing the incidence of plant wilt, it also obviously stimulated soil N-oxide emissions. Rotational cropping improved vegetable yields while decreasing soil N-oxide emissions by 10 % when compared to the continuous cropping system. Overall, the work suggested that the combined application of organic fertilizers and PGPM may be an environment-friendly strategy for ensuring food security while mitigating N-oxide emissions in tropical-intensive vegetable fields.

AB  - Form-based design codes have emerged as a planning tool aimed at shaping the physical form of neighborhoods to reinforce local character and enhance sense of place (SoP). However, their effectiveness in delivering these outcomes remains underexplored. This study investigates the extent to which Buffalo's Green Code-a form-based zoning ordinance-enhances SoP in residential environments, using Elmwood Village as a case study. A multi-scalar analytical framework assesses SoP at the building, street, and neighborhood levels. Empirical data were gathered through an online survey, while the neighborhood was systematically mapped into street segment blocks categorized by Green Code zoning. The study consolidates six Green Code classifications into three overarching categories: mixed-use, residential, and single-family. SoP satisfaction is analyzed through a two-step process: first, comparative assessments are conducted across the three zoning groups; second, k-means clustering is applied to spatially map satisfaction levels and evaluate SoP at different scales. Findings indicate that mixed-use areas are most closely associated with place identity, while residential and single-family zones (as defined by the Buffalo Green Code) yield higher satisfaction overall-though satisfaction varies significantly across spatial scales. These results suggest that while form-based codes can strengthen SoP, their impact is uneven, and more scale-sensitive zoning strategies may be needed to optimize their effectiveness in diverse urban contexts. This research overall offers an empirically grounded, multi-scalar assessment of zoning impacts on lived experience-addressing a notable gap in the planning literature regarding how form-based codes perform in established, rather than newly developed, neighborhoods.

AB  - Background Theileriosis is a tick-borne disease caused by protozoon species in the Theileria genus of the Theileriidae family. The biochemical changes induced by infection are considered to be an important understanding of the pathophysiology of caprine theileriosis. In this study, it was aimed to determine oxidative stress, thyroid hormones, trace elements, and biochemical parameters in theileriosis infection. Materials and Methods A sample of 14 goat was used for this purpose, of which 7 were healthy and 7 were infected with Theileria ovis. Theileria infection was diagnosed from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera from blood samples was tested for total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), oxidative stress index (OSI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), urea, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe). Result TOC, OSI, AST, ALT and GGT values were higher in the patient group than in the healthy group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, there were decreases in TAC, T3, T4, total protein, albumin, creatinine, Cu, Zn, Se, and Co values (P < 0.05). However, there was not found to be a statistical difference between the healthy and patient groups in terms of triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, urea, BUN, Mn, and Fe values (P > 0.05). Conclusions It can be stated that oxidative stress is a complication of caprine theileriosis and it may be accompanied with hypothyroidism and deficits in trace minerals.

AB  - How animals respond to seasonal resource availability has profound implications for their dietary flexibility and realized ecological niches. We sought to understand seasonal dietary niche partitioning in extant African suids using intra-tooth stable isotope analysis of enamel. We collected enamel samples from canines of red river hogs/bushpigs (Potamochoerus spp.) and third molars of warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.) in 3 different regions of central and eastern Africa. We analyzed multiple samples from each tooth and used variations in stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (delta 13C and delta 18O) and covariances between them to infer seasonal dietary changes. We found that most Phacochoerus display C4-dominated diets, while most Potamochoerus display C3-dominated diets. Phacochoerus and Potamochoerus that co-occur in the same region display no overlap in intra-tooth delta 13C, which suggests dietary niche partitioning. They also show diverging delta 13C values as the dry seasons progress and converging delta 13C values during the peak of the rainy seasons, which suggests a greater dietary niche separation during the dry seasons when resources are scarce than during the rainy season. We found statistically significant cross-correlations between intra-tooth delta 13C and delta 18O in most specimens. We also observed a temporal lag between delta 13C and delta 18O in some specimens. This study demonstrates that intra-tooth stable isotope analysis is a promising approach to investigate seasonal dietary niche variation. However, large inter-individual variations in delta 18O at certain localities can be challenging to interpret. Future studies that expand the intra-tooth stable isotope surveys or include controlled feeding experiments will improve its application in ecological studies.

AB  - Goat raising has increased in Lao People's Democratic Republic due to meat demand from Vietnam. Goat production is low input using free grazing and minimal husbandry. Technical constraints are well known but socio-cultural contexts are poorly understood. This paper describes qualitative research on farmer's motivations, experiences and learning pathways, to improve goat husbandry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 smallholder goat farmers in Lao's South-Central province of Savannakhet. The interviews revealed that farmers relied on their experiences and observations of goat raising in their communities to make their management decisions. Trial and error was a valued learning strategy. Farmers took guidance from the exchange of goat raising experiences with other goat farmers and preferred participatory learning that fostered discussion in familiar village settings. Lao smallholder goat farming systems are a product of compromise across a number of resources. Project interventions that required low investments of labour, land or capital were most readily implemented and adapted by farmers. This study questions the assumption that project interventions are inherently optimal and beneficial for smallholder farming systems. Recommendations propose how farmer's experiences, constraints and preferences can be incorporated into development approaches to ensure management system changes reflect the desires of smallholder farmers.

AB  - Characterizing spatial and temporal variability of food web dynamics is necessary to predict how wetter and more nutrient-rich conditions expected with climate change will influence the fate of organic matter within northern peatlands. The goals of this study were to (1) document spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of periphyton to peatland food webs using isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15), and (2) quantify the influence of increased nutrient availability on primary and secondary production across a gradient of rich, moderate, and poor fen peatlands common to the northern boreal biome. We established replicate m(2) plots within each fen located in interior Alaska to quantify periphyton (algae and bacteria) and macroinvertebrate biomass with and without nutrient addition throughout a growing season (May-August). Stable isotope analysis showed that periphyton contributed x = 65% of organic matter to the food web over time and across fens compared to x = 7% from plants or detritus. The transfer of basal resources was reflected in an increase in herbivore biomass as algal biomass increased over time in all fens, followed by an increase in predatory macroinvertebrates during the latter part of the growing season. Furthermore, all measures of periphyton and macroinvertebrate biomass were enhanced by nutrient addition. These data provide insight into patterns of natural variation within the aquatic food web of boreal peatlands and show that basal resources within this ecosystem, which are generally considered to be "detritus-based," are actually driven by periphyton with minimal input from plant detrital pathways.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is an unavoidable environmental pollutant commonly found in feed and foodstuffs. It is the most toxic one of all the aflatoxins, which can cause severe impairment to testicular development and function. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of reproductive toxicity in rams sheep remain inconclusive. The study was designed to explore the effects of AFB1 on sheep testes through rumen-microbiota, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Six-month-old male Dorper rams (n = 6) were orally administrated with 1.0 mg/kg AFB1 (dissolved in 20 mL 4% ethanol) 24 h before the experiment. At the same time, rams in the control group (n = 6) were intragastrically administrated with 20 mL 4% ethanol. It was observed that acute AFB1 poisoning had significant (p < 0.05) toxin residue in the testis and could cause testicular histopathological damage. AFB1 stimulated the secretion of plasma testosterone level through regulating testosterone synthesis-related genes (StAR, 3 beta-HSD, CYP11A1, and CYP11A1), which are accompanied by the increase of oxidative stress and testicular apoptosis that had a close relationship with the regulation of testosterone secretion. Interestingly, we observed rumen dysbacteriosis and decreased the abundances of Prevotella, Succiniclasticum, CF231, Ruminococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio in AFB1-exposed sheep, which were negatively correlated to the testosterone synthesis-related gene levels. Taken together, our findings indicated that AFB1 induced testicular damage and testicular dysfunction, which is related to testicular oxidative stress and apoptosis involved in rumen dysbacteriosis in sheep.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism in immune responses is an essential factor in environmental adaptation. However, the mechanisms involved remain obscure owing to the scarcity of data from sex-role-reversed species in stressed conditions. Benzo[ a ]pyrene (BaP) is one of the most pervasive and carcinogenic organic pollutants in coastal environments. In this study, we evaluated the potential effects on renal immunotoxicity of the sex -role -reversed lined seahorse ( Hippocampus erectus ) toward environmental concentrations BaP exposure. Our results discovered the presence of different energy -immunity trade-off strategies adopted by female and male seahorses during BaP exposure. BaP induced more severe renal damage in female seahorses in a concentration -dependent manner. BaP biotransformation and detoxification in seahorses resemble those in mammals. Benzo[ a ]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol- 9,10-oxide (BPDE) and 9-hydroxybenzo[ a ]pyrene (9-OH-BaP) formed DNA adducts and disrupted Ca 2+ homeostasis may together attribute the renal immunotoxicity. Sexual dimorphisms in detoxification of both BPDE and 9-OH-BaP, and in regulation of Ca 2+ , autophagy and inflammation, mainly determined the extent of renal damage. Moreover, the mechanism of sex hormones regulated sexual dimorphism in immune responses needs to be further elucidated. Collectively, these findings contribute to the understanding of sexual dimorphism in the immunotoxicity induced by BaP exposure in seahorses, which may attribute to the dramatic decline in the biodiversity of the genus.

AB  - Planting service crops (SCs) with late summer manure applications has been promoted as an agronomic practice to capture manure nitrogen (N) and release it to the following season's cash crop, thereby reducing fertilizer N requirements. The present study explored this hypothesis using a cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) monoculture SC, along with two polyculture SCs (4 species and 12 species) both containing rye, planted after winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest, in systems with and without liquid hog manure. The following spring, SC regrowth was chemically terminated 1 week prior to corn (Zea mays L.) planting, and a sidedress N application was made at the 6-8 leaf stage to half of the plots. Corn N accumulation and final grain yield were reduced up to 20% following the rye monoculture in both years, even though SCs did not reduce soil mineral N nor partial plant-available N over the corn-growing season. Additionally, the sidedress N application could not overcome the yield loss associated with rye. Thus, this study did not observe N release by SCs to the following cash crop and demonstrates that yield loss can occur when corn follows rye SCs irrespective of changes in plant available N. This research reinforces the importance of selecting appropriate species and their proportions in polycultures, to mitigate negative impacts of SCs, especially those of rye on corn.

AB  - Ancient DNA (aDNA) is increasingly being used to investigate questions such as the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of extant and extinct species. If aDNA samples are sufficiently old, expected branch lengths (in units of nucleotide substitutions) are reduced relative to contemporary samples. This can be accounted for by incorporating sample ages into phylogenetic analyses. Existing methods that use tip (sample) dates infer gene trees rather than species trees, which can lead to incorrect or biased inferences of the species tree. Methods using a multispecies coalescent (MSC) model overcome these issues. We developed an MSC model with tip dates and implemented it in the program BPP. The method performed well for a range of biologically realistic scenarios, estimating calibrated divergence times and mutation rates precisely. Simulations suggest that estimation precision can be best improved by prioritizing sampling of many loci and more ancient samples. Incorrectly treating ancient samples as contemporary in analyzing simulated data, mimicking a common practice of empirical analyses, led to large systematic biases in model parameters, including divergence times. Two genomic datasets of mammoths and elephants were analyzed, demonstrating the method's empirical utility.

AB  - As the use of coastal and offshore environments expands, there is a need to better understand the exposure of marine megafauna to anthropogenic activities that potentially threaten their populations. Individual satellite telemetry studies are often hampered by small sample sizes, providing limited information on spatiotemporal distributions of migratory animals and their relationships to anthropogenic threats. We addressed this issue by synthesising satellite tracking data from 484 individuals of three taxonomic groups and six species; three marine turtle, two whale and one shark. The spatial overlap between taxa distributions and multiple anthropogenic activities was assessed as a proxy for the cumulative exposure of these taxa to anthropogenic threats (coastal modification, vessel strike, underwater noise, oil spill, bycatch, entanglement, and artificial light) across an area totalling 2,205,740 km(2) off north-western Australia. Core exposure areas (top 50% of the distribution) encompassed ecologically important sites for all taxa, such as the Ningaloo and Pilbara regions, migratory routes for whales and sharks in offshore waters beyond Ningaloo Reef, and marine turtle nesting beaches at Barrow Island and Cape Lambert. Although areas of high exposure represented <14% of taxa distributions, we showed that no taxa occurred in the absence of threats and that even areas with existing spatial protections are experiencing high levels of exposure. Importantly, we developed a robust approach for documenting the potential exposure of marine species to a range of human activities at appropriate spatial scales to inform conservation management.

AB  - Exploration of genetic diversity in wild relative is ideal strategy for improving wheat cultivars to drought stress conditions in breeding program. Aegilops tauschii (goat grass) is a diploid (2n = 2x = 14, DD) wild species, thought as the D genome contributor to bread wheat. In this study the genetic diversity of 32 Ae. tauschii accessions collected from different provinces of Pakistan were assessed using 28 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In addition to genetic analysis, we also investigated their antioxidants enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, SOD; Peroxidase, POD) responses for osmotic stress tolerance, induced by polyethylene glycol in completely randomized design (CRD). The variations in antioxidant enzymes activities among accessions ranged in between 4.97 (POD) and 112.02% (SOD), under osmotic stress conditions. High variability and positive correlations of SOD and POD with osmotic stress tolerance, indicated diversity among Ae. tauschii accessions and could be used as selection criteria. Additionally, molecular characterization through SSR markers revealed high genetic variation among accessions and supported the SOD and POD based diversity. A total of 137 alleles were observed with the mean values of 4.89 alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.21 (Barc142) to 0.85 (Barc124) with an average value of 0.59. The genetic distance coefficient range was between 0.25 and 0.93. All accession were clustered by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean UPGMA. The accessions did not align with their geographical regions, thereby suggesting that there is not any relationship between molecular diversity and eco-geographic diversity.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar semen of high quality is a key factor that influences the outcome of artificial insemination. Furthermore, semen delivery practices could exert a negative effect on boar sperm quality and functionality. Nonetheless, the specific effect of temperature changes during semen delivery and molecular responses of sperm to temperature variations have not been fully understood. In this context, the present study aimed to investigate how temperature changes during semen transport influence boar sperm quality and functionality. Our results showed that the temperature of boar semen increased from the initial 17 degrees C to the ambient temperature of 37 degrees C after 24 h of delivery using a well-sealed Styrofoam. Sperm quality and functionality were greatly damaged, which could not be recovered when the semen temperature went back to 17 degrees C. Beyond this fact, boar sperm experienced a significant conversion of early apoptosis to late apoptosis caused by an elevated temperature. During this process, boar sperm adjusted themselves to survive by up-regulating the levels of heat shock proteins and activating the key energy regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase. The findings help to understand how temperature variations influence boar sperm quality and functionality and how the sperm struggles to survive, providing theoretical and technical information to improve the delivery practice of boar semen.Abstract Semen delivery practice is crucial to the efficiency of artificial insemination using high-quality boar sperm. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a common semen delivery method, a Styrofoam box, under elevated temperatures on boar sperm quality and functionality and to investigate the underlying molecular responses of sperm to the temperature rise. Three pooled semen samples from 10 Duroc boars (3 ejaculates per boar) were used in this study. Each pooled semen sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was stored at a constant 17 degrees C as the control group. Another one was packaged in a well-sealed Styrofoam box and placed in an incubator at 37 degrees C for 24 h to simulate semen delivery on hot summer days and subsequently transferred to a refrigerator at 17 degrees C for 3 days. The semen temperature was continuously monitored. The semen temperature was 17 degrees C at 0 h of storage and reached 20 degrees C at 5 h, 30 degrees C at 14 h, and 37 degrees C at 24 h. For each time point, sperm quality and functionality, apoptotic changes, expression levels of phosphorylated AMPK, and heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90 were determined by CASA, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. The results showed that elevated temperature during delivery significantly deteriorated boar sperm quality and functionality after 14 h of delivery. Storage back to 17 degrees C did not recover sperm motility. An increased temperature during delivery apparently promoted the conversion of sperm early apoptosis to late apoptosis, showing a significant increase in the expression levels of Bax and Caspase 3. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK were greatly induced by the temperature rise to 20 degrees C during delivery but reduced thereafter. With the temperature elevation, expression levels of HSP70 and HSP90 were notably increased. Our results indicate that a temperature increase during semen delivery greatly damages sperm quality and functionality by promoting sperm apoptosis. HSP70 and HSP90 could participate in boar sperm resistance to temperature changes by being associated with AMPK activation and anti-apoptotic processes.

AB  - Herbivore populations are regulated by a combination of plant defences and natural enemies. While plant defence can suppress herbivore populations, these defences can also adversely affect natural enemies, thereby releasing herbivores from top-down control.
   Over their life spans, herbivores and their natural enemies may experience substantial variation in plant defence. Recent studies have demonstrated that individual herbivores feeding on diets containing variable concentrations of plant toxins suffer substantially reduced fitness compared to herbivores feeding on a constant toxin concentration, even when both groups of herbivores experience equivalent means. However, the impacts of defence variability on natural enemies and top-down control of herbivores are unknown.
   Using artificial diets, we independently manipulated the mean concentration and variation of a plant toxin experienced by individual Trichoplusia ni caterpillars and its parasitoid Copidosoma floridanum. Additionally, by combining the performance of individual caterpillars on different constant diet concentrations of toxin, we were able to estimate the effect of toxin variability between herbivores using nonlinear averaging.
   Increases in the mean toxin concentration in the diet of parasitized T. ni hosts decreased the fitness of C. floridanum, while variance in individual diets did not impact parasitoid fitness, even though both mean and variance decreased the fitness of T. ni caterpillars. Increased variability in encountered plant defences suppressed individual herbivore fitness with no perceptible cost to top-down control. At the population level, however, increased variability between individual herbivore diets decreased the success of parasitoids relative to herbivores, thus reducing the strength of top-down control.
   Our study highlights the importance of defence variability at different scales in regulating herbivore performance. Variability in plant defence has the potential to reduce herbivore populations through a combination of bottom-up and top-down effects, but only at small spatial scales experienced by individual herbivores.

AB  - Selenium is one of the most commonly supplemented microelements in ruminants because deficiency of this trace element is a global problem that can lead to several diseases, especially in young animals during the neonatal period. The aim of this study was to assess the activity of the hematopoietic process based on cytological evaluation of caprine bone marrow smears in goats supplemented with selenium and vitamin E during the neonatal period. Twelve clini- cally healthy goats at the age of 2 days participated in the study. They were divided into two equal groups (n=6). The goats from the experimental group received a single dose of Se and vitamin E on the second day of life. Bone marrow was collected 2 times, stained with the MGG method, and subjected to cytological evaluation. Peripheral blood was sampled 3 times and peripheral blood smears were analyzed. The bone marrow cells in the group receiving the sup- plement absorbed dyes faster and more intensively than the same cells in the control animals. The number of erythroblasts was higher in goats from the experimental group than in the con- trol group, which indicated the intensification of erythropoiesis in animals supplemented with selenium and vitamin E. The results of morphological tests clearly indicated an increase in the number of erythrocytes and a higher hemoglobin concentration in the group receiving selenium and vitamin E. Selenium and vitamin E supplementation has a positive impact on the erythro- poiesis in bone marrow and can prevent neonatal anemia in goats.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a commonly used management tool to safeguard marine life from anthropogenic impacts, yet their efficacy often remains untested. Evaluating how highly dynamic marine species use static MPAs is challenging but becoming more feasible with the advancement of telemetry data. Here, we focus on southern right whales ( Eubalaena australis, , SRWs) in the waters off Aotearoa/New Zealand, which declined from 30,000 whales to fewer than 40 mature females due to whaling. Now numbering in the low thousands, the key socializing and nursery areas for this population in the remote subantarctic islands are under the protection of different types of MPAs. However, the effectiveness of these MPAs in encompassing important whale habitat and protecting the whales from vessel traffic has not been investigated. To address this, we analyzed telemetry data from 29 SRWs tagged at the Auckland Islands between 2009 and 2022. We identified two previously unknown and currently unprotected areas that were used by the whales for important behaviors such as foraging, socializing, or resting. Additionally, by combining whale locations and vessel tracking data (2020-2022) during peak breeding period (June to October), we found high spatiotemporal overlap between whales and vessels within several MPAs, suggesting the whales could still be vulnerable to multiple anthropogenic stressors even when within areas designated for protection. Our results identify areas to be prioritized for future monitoring and investigation to support the ongoing recovery of this SRW population, as well as highlight the overarching importance of assessing MPA effectiveness post-implementation, especially in a changing climate.

AB  - Globally rising livestock populations and declining wildlife numbers are likely to dramatically change disease risk for wildlife and livestock, especially at resources where they congregate. However, limited understanding of interspecific transmission dynamics at these hotspots hinders disease prediction or mitigation. In this study, we combined gastrointestinal nematode density and host foraging activity measurements from our prior work in an East African tropical savannah system with three estimates of parasite sharing capacity to investigate how interspecific exposures alter the relative riskiness of an important resource - water - among cattle and five dominant herbivore species. We found that due to their high parasite output, water dependence and parasite sharing capacity, cattle greatly increased potential parasite exposures at water sources for wild ruminants. When untreated for parasites, cattle accounted for over two-thirds of total potential exposures around water for wild ruminants, driving 2-23-fold increases in relative exposure levels at water sources. Simulated changes in wildlife and cattle ratios showed that water sources become increasingly important hotspots of interspecific transmission for wild ruminants when relative abundance of cattle parasites increases. These results emphasize that livestock have significant potential to alter the level and distribution of parasite exposures across the landscape for wild ruminants.

AB  - Introduction: Stereotypical expression in laboratory-housed rodents can be explained by different motivational, coping, and motor dysfunction theories. Here, we aimed to explore the neurocognitive underpinnings of high stereotypical (HS) expression in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii), previously proposed as a model system of compulsive-like behavioral persistence. Specifically, we aimed to establish whether HS behavior is related to an underlying escape-related trigger.Methods: One-hundred and sixteen deer mice were classified as either non-stereotypical (NS) or HS. Mice of each cohort were further subdivided and exposed to either sub-acute (3-day) or chronic (25-day) behavioral restriction (R), and high-dose escitalopram (ESC), lorazepam (LOR), alone and in combination with R (ESC+R and LOR+R, respectively). Mice were reassessed for stereotypical behavior at both time points.Results: Our results indicate that HS behavior is likely not temporally and functionally related to an anxiogenic trigger, i.e., R, but rather that HS is associated with parallel changes in anxiogenic feedback processing. We also show that chronic R alone significantly decreased the time spent in expressing HS behavior in animals of the HS, but not NS phenotype.Discussion: This points to the possibility that HS-expressing mice represent a subgroup of P. maniculatus bairdii in which unique interactions between neurobiology and processes of gradual behavioral organization, may contribute to the expression of the typical behaviors observed in this cohort. Collectively, our findings highlight the value of the deer mouse model system to investigate the potential neurocognitive mechanisms that may underlie the development of persistent phenotypes that can likely not be explained entirely by current theories.

AB  - Forest fragments in the Cerrado are areas of prominent biological importance due to their great species richness and biodiversity. These areas host endemic species of Celastraceae, the knowledge of which contributes to the preservation of this biome. This study aims to characterize the pollen morphology of 10 native species of Celastraceae found in forest fragments in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, contributing to the knowledge of the taxa for future taxonomic studies, and providing data for the conservation of the species in the forest areas. The pollen grains were acetolyzed, measured, described qualitatively and illustrated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The pollen characters referring to the pollen unit, polarity, type and number of apertures are similar in all the species studied. The shape, amb and exine ornamentation of pollen grains are the diagnostic qualitative morphological data for Celastraceae in this study. Microreticulate pollen grains were observed in Celastrus, Hippocratea and Pristimera; reticulate pollen grains with a very thick exine characterize the analyzed species of Plenckia; and reticulate and microreticulate ornamentation was observed among the species of Monteverdia. The results obtained here allow us to distinguish species of the analyzed genera and confirm the pollen diversity previously reported for Celastraceae.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in the development of oocytes and ovarian follicles. We have previously shown differential expression of miR-342-3p during yak oocyte maturation. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-342-3p in meiotic maturation of yak oocytes and the underlying mechanism. The profile of ovarian DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression was investigated in yak by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The pattern of Dnmt1 expression in various meiotic stages (GV stage, MI stage and MII stage) of yak oocyte maturation was then measured by immunofluorescence staining. The interaction between Dnmt1 and miR-342-3p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, miR-342-3p inhibitors were microinjected into yak cumulus-oocyte complex to evaluate the effects on oocyte maturation. MiR-342-3p expression was upregulated in oocytes during meiotic maturation, with significantly higher levels in the MII stage compared with the GV- and MI stages (p < .05), whereas the opposite pattern of Dnmt1 expression was detected. In the period to sexual maturity (3-year-old), DNMT1 showed an age-related pattern of ovarian expression at both the gene and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry analysis also indicated maturation-stage-related differences in DNMT1 expression in the ovarian follicles and corpus luteum, with expression predominantly detected in cumulus cells and oocytes. MiR-342-3p inhibitors effectively upregulated Dnmt1 expression and significantly inhibited oocyte meiotic maturation. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-342-3p plays a vital role in the meiotic maturation of yak oocytes by targeting the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of Dnmt1 and provide a new perspective on the mechanism of this process.

AB  - Throughout their lifetimes, individuals of most species engage in multiple mutualistic interactions simultaneously. These mutualisms can interfere with each other, leading to ecological costs that can influence the outcome of these interactions. Identifying factors that modulate these costs is pivotal to reaching a deeper understanding of the dynamics of mutualistic interactions. We investigated the ecological costs of protective ants on the pollination of plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and how plant traits and the type of pollinator can modulate them. We hypothesized that (1) ants negatively affect the patterns of flower visitation and plant reproductive performance and that (2) this effect is relatively higher for plants bearing EFNs close to inflorescences compared to those bearing EFNs only on vegetative tissues. Additionally, we hypothesized that (3) the effect of ants on flower visitation is contingent upon the type of flower visitor. To evaluate these hypotheses, we used a meta-analytical approach based on 27 studies that assessed the effects of ants on patterns of floral visitation and plant reproductive performance. We found that ants impose a low, yet highly variable, cost to pollination. Specifically, ants have a strong negative effect on patterns of flower visitation, especially when the visitors are bees, but this does not translate into reduced plant reproductive performance. In fact, the reproductive success of plants with EFNs close to vegetative tissue is enhanced by ant presence. Finally, the negative effect of ants on flower visitors is stronger when EFNs are closer to inflorescences. Synthesis: Our results indicate that, in general, ants have a low impact on the pollination of EFN-bearing plants. This pattern supports theoretical predictions that natural selection acts to lower the costs of protection mutualisms. Our macroscale evaluation further shows that plant traits such as EFN location, as well as the type of flower visitors, modulate this cost. The outcome of ant-pollinator interactions may affect the evolutionary trajectory of traits mediating defence and pollination in EFN-bearing plants.
   A lo largo de la vida, individuos de la mayor & iacute;a de las especies se involucran en m & uacute;ltiples interacciones mutualistas simult & aacute;neamente. Estos mutualismos pueden interferir entre s & iacute;, llevando a costes ecol & oacute;gicos que afectan al resultado de estas interacciones. Identificar factores que modulan estos costes es esencial para profundizar nuestro conocimiento sobre la din & aacute;mica de las interacciones mutualistas. Investigamos los cestos ecol & oacute;gicos de las hormigas protectoras en la polinizaci & oacute;n de plantas con nectarios extra florales (NEFs) y c & oacute;mo los atributos de las plantas y el tipo de visitante floral pueden modular esos costes. Nuestras hip & oacute;tesis son (1) las hormigas afectan negativamente los patrones de visita floral y el & eacute;xito reproductivo de las plantas y (2) este efecto es relativamente mayor para plantas con NEFs cerca de las inflorescencias que plantas con NEFs cerca de tejidos vegetativos & uacute;nicamente. Tambi & eacute;n investigamos la hip & oacute;tesis de que (3) los efectos de las hormigas en la visita floral dependen del tipo de visitante floral. Para evaluar nuestras hip & oacute;tesis, usamos un enfoque meta-anal & iacute;tico basado en 27 estudios que eval & uacute;an los efectos de las hormigas en los patrones de visita floral y & eacute;xito reproductivo de las plantas. Encontramos que hormigas imponen un coste bajo pero variable a la polinizaci & oacute;n. Espec & iacute;ficamente, las hormigas tienen un efecto negativo fuerte en los patrones de visita floral, especialmente cuando los visitantes son abejas, pero esto no se traduce en una reducci & oacute;n del desempe & ntilde;o reproductivo de las plantas. De hecho, el & eacute;xito reproductivo de las plantas con NEFs cerca del tejido vegetativo es mayor en presencia de hormigas. Finalmente, el efecto negativo de las hormigas en los visitantes florales es m & aacute;s fuerte cuando los NEFs est & aacute;n cerca de las inflorescencias. S & iacute;ntesis: nuestros resultados indican que, en general, hormigas tienen un bajo impacto en la polinizaci & oacute;n de plantas con NEFs. Este patr & oacute;n apoya predicciones te & oacute;ricas de que la selecci & oacute;n natural act & uacute;a reduciendo los costes de los mutualismos protectores. Nuestra evaluaci & oacute;n macroecol & oacute;gica tambi & eacute;n muestra que algunos atributos de las plantas como la localizaci & oacute;n de los NEFs, as & iacute; como el tipo de visitante floral, modulan este coste. El resultado de las interacciones puede afectar la trayectoria evolutiva de los atributos que median la defensa y la polinizaci & oacute;n en plantas con NEFs.

Nossas hip & oacute;teses s & atilde;o de que (1) as formigas afetam negativamente os padr & otilde;es de visita & ccedil;& atilde;o floral e desempenho reprodutivo das plantas e que (2) esse efeito & eacute; relativamente maior para plantas com NEFs mais pr & oacute;ximos das infloresc & ecirc;ncias quando comparados com esp & eacute;cies que possuem NEFs apenas nas estruturas vegetativas. Adicionalmente, n & oacute;s tamb & eacute;m formulamos a hip & oacute;tese de que (3) os efeitos das formigas na visita & ccedil;& atilde;o floral dependem do tipo de visitante floral. Para avaliar nossas hip & oacute;teses, n & oacute;s usamos uma abordagem meta-anal & iacute;tica baseada em 27 estudos que avaliaram o efeito das formigas nos padr & otilde;es de visita & ccedil;& atilde;o floral e desempenho reprodutivo das plantas.

AB  - Nematodes represent >3/5 of the abundance of the world's metazoans and usually account for nearly 90% of the total benthic fauna, playing a key ecological role in the benthic ecosystem functioning on a global scale. These small metazoans include a relevant number of microscopic predators and, in turn, are the most abundant preys of macro-megafauna and fish juveniles thus playing a key role in marine food webs. Here, using two independent approaches, we test the bioaccumulation in marine nematodes of several heavy metals present in contaminated sediments. We report here that nematodes, despite their short life cycle and small size, bioaccumulate significantly heavy metals. Bioaccumulation increases from deposit feeders and microalgal grazers to predators of microbes and other tiny metazoans. These results suggest that nematodes also contribute to their biomagnification along the food webs and can contribute to increase the transfer of contaminants from the sediments to larger organisms.

AB  - Numerous case studies indicate that the successful invasion of alien species involve multiple mechanisms. Spartina alterniflora (Poaceae) has rapidly and extensively encroached on China's coastline over the past decades, however, limited studies have explored multiple invasion mechanisms. Using a combination of greenhouse experiments, field survey, and literature investigations, a cross-scale study of S. alterniflora in Eastern China was conducted to link the multiple invasion mechanisms against the dominant native species, Phragmites australis (Poaceae) and Scirpus mariqueter (Cyperaceae) at high and low coastal habitats, respectively. The results revealed that S. alterniflora was competitive superior to native species at the seed/seedling scale, with a higher seed yield and germination rate, and low risk of seed hunting by crabs. At the individual scale, S. alterniflora showed a stronger tolerance to changing environmental factors impacting photosynthesis, growth parameters, and root architecture, compared with the native P. australis. S. alterniflora were also resilient to insect pests. At the community scale, S. alterniflora showed shading effects on the native S. mariqueter. The multiple competitive advantage led to the successful invasion of S. alterniflora in Eastern China, broadening our understanding of why the exotic species can achieve dominance in whole China's coast. We suggest that the multiple competitive superiority of S. alterniflora can be integrated from the perspectives of the organizational level of life systems to efficaciously forecast invasion trajectories and design control strategies.

AB  - Coprolites are one of the sources of evidence most commonly used in paleoparasitological studies. However, the zoological origin identification is not always possible. Parasites of the genus Eimeria (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) are obligate protozoan which have evolved to exhibit a great diversity of host range, and present strict host specificity. Usually, the identification of Eimeria spp. can be done by morphological characteristics such as size and shape of the oocysts. Moreover, molecular diagnostic methods such as PCR have proven to be very useful methodologies for an accurate taxonomic identification. In recent years, molecular techniques have started to be applied in paleoparasitological studies. Here, we provide the first integrative approach that combine light microscopic studies and ancient DNA (aDNA) in order to detect and identify Eimeria spp. on artiodactyl coprolites recovered from an archeological context from northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. The main objective is to discuss the advantages of complementing these two approaches as a promising tool to identify the zoological origin of coprolites. Furthermore, we provide paleoparasitological data about the presence of Eimeria spp. in coprolites of South American ungulates. Light microscopic studies allowed the identification of oocysts attributed to Eimeria spp. in 13 of the 40 coprolites. Amplification and sequencing of the aDNA ITS1 detected the presence of Eimeria spp. in 5 of the 10 samples, and allowed the taxonomic identification of these sequences as belonging to Eimeria arloingi. Furthermore, the results obtained from cytochrome b gene (Cytb) analysis confirmed the identity of the host as Capra hircus. Results displayed the presence of coccidiosis in goats from historical times. This study highlights that both techniques are complementary and promotes the use of the identification of Eimeria spp. in ancient samples in order to identify the zoological origin.

AB  - Introduction Cystic echinococcosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease of great medical and veterinary importance, which is caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. In Ukraine, two areas of the prominent circulation of the parasite are established, the southern steppe zone with sheep as the main transmitter, and the northern forest-steppe zone and Polissia, where pigs are mainly responsible for maintaining the E. granulosus transmission. Methods Given that only a few studies have so far addressed the genetic diversity of the parasite in Ukraine, we have sequenced partial mitochondrial genes of cytochrome c oxidase 1 (789 bp), NADH dehydrogenase 1 (602 bp) and 12S rRNA (333-334 bp) in pig metacestodes from the Sumy region (farms close to Sumy, northeastern Ukraine) and the Kyiv region (a farm in Bila Tserkva, central Ukraine). Results Four isolates from four pigs in the Sumy region were identified as E. canadensis (G7 genotype), the major E. granulosus s.l. species circulating in Eastern Europe, including the three microvariants (G7A, G7B, G7C). Three isolates from the two pigs in the Kyiv region were classified as E. granulosus s.s. (G1 genotype), including one microvariant (G1A). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first genetic record of E. granulosus s.s. with the presumed highest infectivity and virulence among the E. granulosus s.l. species in Ukraine. The finding has implications for public health as local control programmes should take into consideration different development rate of this parasite in dogs and the greater risk of the species for human infection.
