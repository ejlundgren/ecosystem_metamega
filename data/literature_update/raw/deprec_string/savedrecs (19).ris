AB  - Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are herbivorous insects which deprive plants of nutrients by feeding on the phloem sap and transmission of plant viruses. In the present study, the susceptibility of selected white-berried grapevine (Vitis spp.) cultivars "Aurora", "Bianca", "Muskat Letni" and "Solaris" to the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) and the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae (Sulz.) was evaluated using the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique. The content of major flavonoids and stilbenoids in grapevine leaves and leaf anatomy parameters that might have affected aphid probing were also analyzed. Based on the success rate in reaching the phloem vessels and feeding on phloem sap, the studied grapevine cultivars can be assigned to various groups of susceptibility. Cultivars "Bianca" and "Muskalt Letni" are susceptible to A. fabae and M. persicae, respectively (aphids reach phloem phase and show short bouts of sap ingestion); "Muskat Letni" shows low susceptibility to A. fabae, while "Aurora" and "Bianca" to M. persicae (only 50% aphids reach phloem phase and no sap ingestion occurs); "Solaris" is resistant to A. fabae and M. persicae (no phloem phase present). Anatomical structure of leaves was similar in all cultivars and no mechanical barriers for aphid probing were observed. However, the content of individual flavonoids and silbenoids differed among cultivars. We hypothesize that the high content of piceid in the leaves of "Solaris" may be responsible for the rejection of this cultivar by both aphid species. The study demonstrated that the risk of the direct damage due to A. fabae and M. persicae feeding on grapevines is low. However, considering the intense aphid probing activity within leaf epidermis and mesophyll, A. fabae and M. persicae may pose a serious threat as vectors of non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses to white-berried grapevines.

AB  - The current work assessed the inclusion impacts of oilseed camelina meal (CM) as a protein source in red sea bream (Pagrus major) diets. A 45 day assessment period with 180 juveniles (6.47 +/- 0.17 g) were allocated in triplicates to 4 experimental groups and fed formulated diets in which fish meal (FM) was subrogated at graded series of 0% (T1), 20.5% soybean meal (T2), 20.5% camelina meal (T3), and 33% camelina meal (T4). No noticeable alterations were observed in specific growth rate, feed intake, survival rate, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor among the experimental groups. Fish fed the T4 diet showed considerably reduced (P < 0.05) final weight and body protein content when compared to those fed T2, T3, and basal diets. Plasma biochemical parameters show no differences (P > 0.05) in glucose, total bilirubin, total protein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase, and glutamic pyruvate transaminase. Hematocrit levels decreased noticeably (P < 0.05) in fish groups fed camelina meal in comparison to the control group. Liver and intestinal histology showed a healthy status and an increase in villus length and goblet cell number in camelina groups. Fish fed the T4 diet displayed higher expression levels (P < 0.05) of relative mRNA interleukin 1 beta (IL1b) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in comparison to other groups. The inclusion of camelina meal (up to 20%) in red sea bream diets produced similar outcomes to specimens fed fish meal and soybean meal.

AB  - With the improvement of the conversion efficiency of LED chip and fluorescent material and the increasing demand for high-brightness light sources, LED technology has begun to move toward the direction of high-power. However, there is a huge problem that high-power LED must face with a large amount of heat generated by high power causing a high temperature thermal decay or even thermal quenching of the fluorescent material in the device, resulting in a reduction of the luminous efficiency, color coordinates, color rendering index, light uniformity, and service life of LED. In order to solve this problem, fluorescent materials with high thermal stability and better heat dissipation were prepared to enhance their performance in high-power LED environments. A variety of boron nitride nanomaterials were prepared by the solid phase-gas phase method. By adjusting the ratio of boric acid to urea in the raw material, different BN nanoparticles and nanosheets were obtained. Moreover, the control of catalyst amount and synthesis temperature can be used to synthesize boron nitride nanotubes with various morphologies. By adding different morphologies and quantities of BN material in PiG (phosphor in glass), the mechanical strength, heat dissipation, and luminescent properties of the sheet can be effectively controlled. PiG prepared by adding the right number of nanotubes and nanosheets has higher quantum efficiency and better heat dissipation after being excited by high power LED.

AB  - Plants have long been thought to be less dependent on pollinators for seed production at higher elevations due to adverse pollination environments. However, recent research has yet to consistently support the generality of this expectation. In this study, we asked whether pollinator dependence decreases along an elevational gradient and how it varies with various reproductive traits. To answer these questions, we quantified pollinator-plant associations and various reproductive traits for 112 flowering plants spanning a large elevational gradient (990-4260 m a.s.l.) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We found that flowering plants in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region are highly dependent on pollinators for seed production (76.2% of seed production was contributed by animal pollinators and 44.6% of plants would produce no seed without pollinator visitation). Contrary to our expectation, there was no significant elevational gradient in pollinator dependence index. Although the pollinator dependence index was not significantly correlated with pollen limitation, flower size, floral longevity, or reward type, it was correlated with compatibility status and flowering time. These findings indicate that pollinator dependence does not decrease along an elevational gradient in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our study also highlights the severe vulnerability of flowering plant seed production to pollinator declines under global change in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, particularly for early-flowering or self-incompatible plants growing at higher elevations (e.g., subnival belt).

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of providing an unlimited source of cells from all three germ layers and germ cells. The derivation and usage of iPSCs from various animal models may facilitate stem cell-based therapy, gene-modified animal production, and evolutionary studies assessing interspecies differences. However, there is a lack of species-wide methods for deriving iPSCs, in particular by means of non-viral and non-transgene-integrating (NTI) approaches. Here, we demonstrate the iPSC derivation from somatic fibro-blasts of multiple mammalian species from three different taxonomic orders, including the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in Primates, the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) in Carnivora, and the pig (Sus scrofa) in Cetartiodactyla, by combinatorial usage of chemical com-pounds and NTI episomal vectors. Interestingly, the fibroblasts temporarily acquired a neural stem cell-like state during the reprogram-ming. Collectively, our method, robustly applicable to various species, holds a great potential for facilitating stem cell-based research using various animals in Mammalia.

AB  - Background: Current antidepressant therapy remains unsatisfactory due to its delayed clinical onset of action and the heterogeneity of depression. Targeting disturbed neurometabolic pathways could provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression. Albiflorin is a phytomedicine isolated from the root of Peony (Paeonia albiflora Pall) with excellent clinical tolerance. Until now, the antidepressant-like activities of albiflorin in different subtypes of depression and its effects on neurometabolism are unknown.
   Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the rapid antidepressant-like effects of albiflorin in three common animal models of depression and elucidate the pharmaco-metabolic mechanisms of its action using a multi-omics approach.
   Results: We found that albiflorin produces rapid antidepressant-like effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine models of depression. Using a system-wide approach combining metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, we showed that the therapeutic effects of albiflorin are highly associated with the rapid restoration of a set of common metabolic abnormities in the hippocampus across all three depression models, including phospholipid and tryptophan metabolism. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that albiflorin normalized the metabolic dysregulation in phospholipid metabolism by suppressing hippocampal cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2). Additionally, inhibition of cPLA2 overexpression by albiflorin corrects abnormal kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism via the cPLA2-protein kinase B (Akt1)-indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO1) regulatory loop and directs tryptophan catabolism towards more hippocampal serotonin biosynthesis.
   Conclusion: Our study contributed to a better understanding of the homogeneity in the metabolic mechanisms of depression and established a proof-of-concept for rapid treatment of depression through targeting dysregulated neurometabolic pathways.

AB  - This study presents the first successful generation and comprehensive characterization of trophoblastic organoids (TOs) and the derivation of three-dimensional cavity- or sac-like structures-termed lacunoids/cystoids-from sheep intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) embryos. TOs were generated from sheep ICSI embryos for the first time and were shown to express trophoblastic markers at levels comparable to those in embryonic tissue. Detailed morphological characterization was conducted for both the TOs and the derived lacunoids/cystoids. Additionally, the TOs' interactions with endometrial organoids (EOs), as well as those with preimplantation embryos, were investigated through co-culture experiments. The TOs expressed key trophoblastic markers, including CDX2, GATA3, syncytin-1, KRT18, KRT7, and Sox2, confirming their validity as a model for studying sheep trophoblast biology. The generation of lacunoids/cystoids from the TOs further revealed their structural and developmental characteristics, contributing valuable insights into early placental development and trophoblast-related pathologies. The TOs also supported extended embryonic development, and their co-culture with EOs induced dynamic changes in gene expression, particularly in angiogenesis-related genes, in both organoid types. This novel and reproducible in vitro model offers a reliable platform to study early placental development, effectively recapitulating the biological crosstalk between the trophectoderm and endometrium. The in-depth characterization of TOs and lacunoids/cystoids highlights their potential to advance our understanding of trophoblast differentiation and related developmental disorders.

AB  - Closely related species within termite genera often show extremely similar morphology, where morphological characteristics of soldiers alone or imagos (including alates and primary reproductives) alone are sometimes insufficient to establish new species. However, many original descriptions of termite species are based on soldier characteristics alone, because of the seasonal occurrence of alates and the difficulty in collecting primary reproductives. Importantly, primary reproductives of the family Kalotermitidae (so-called drywood termites) are relatively easy to collect from field colonies compared with those of the other termite families. Here, we describe a new kalotermitid species, Glyptotermes matsuurai sp. nov., from Australia by effective use of morphological characteristics of primary reproductives. Glyptotermes matsuurai is distinguished from the Australian species G. iridipennis Froggatt, 1896 by the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene; however, it is not distinguishable from G. iridipennis based on the external morphology of soldiers. It therefore forms a species complex with G. iridipennis. Although we could collect alates of G. matsuurai from only one of the field-collected colonies kept in the laboratory, we conducted morphological analyses of imagos from multiple colonies by using primary reproductives collected from field colonies. As a result of our morphological analyses of imagos, we found that G. matsuurai is morphologically distinguishable from all other species of Australian Glyptotermes. Thus, when enough alates are unavailable, morphological characteristics of primary reproductives can be used to facilitate the discovery of undescribed cryptic species at least in the genus Glyptotermes and possibly in other genera within the family Kalotermitidae.

AB  - Creative problem solving and memory are inherently intertwined: memory accesses existing knowledge while creativity enhances it. Recent studies show that insights often accompanying creative solutions enhance long-term memory. This insight memory advantage (IMA) is explained by the 'insight as prediction error (PE)' hypothesis which states that insights arise from PEs updating predictive solution models and thereby enhancing memory. Neurally, the hippocampus initially detects PEs and then, together with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), integrates and updates these expectations facilitating efficient memory encoding and retrieval. Dopamine (DA) mediates reward PEs and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, while noradrenaline (NE) enhances arousal and attention impacting the amygdala, the salience network, and hippocampal plasticity. These neurobiological mechanisms likely underpin IMA and have significant implications for educational practices and problem-solving strategies.

AB  - In this paper, we investigated the effects of neonatal exposure to methoxychlor (MXC), a synthetic organochlorine used as an insecticide with estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activities on ovarian follicles of adult pigs. Piglets were injected with MXC (20 mu g/kg body weight) or corn oil (controls) from postnatal Day 1 to Day 10 (n = 5 per group). Then, mRNA expression, protein abundance and immunolocalization of growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and cognate receptors (ACVR1, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, TGFBR1, BMPR2, and AMHR2), as well as FSH receptor (FSHR) were examined in preantral and small antral ovarian follicles of sexually mature gilts. The plasma AMH and FSH levels were also assessed. In preantral follicles, neonatal exposure to MXC increased GDF9, BMPR1B, TGFBR1, and BMPR2 mRNAs, while the levels of AMH and BMP15 mRNAs decreased. In addition, MXC also decreased BMP15 and BMPR1B protein abundance. Regarding small antral follicles, neonatal exposure to MXC upregulated mRNAs for BMPR1B, BMPR2, and AMHR2 and downregulated mRNAs for AMH, BMPR1A, and FSHR. MXC decreased the protein abundance of AMH, and all examined receptors in small antral follicles. GDF9 and BMP15 were immunolocalized in oocytes and granulosa cells of preantral follicles of control and treated ovaries. All analyzed receptors were detected in the oocytes and granulosa cells of preantral follicles, and in the granulosa and theca cells of small antral follicles. The exception, however, was FSHR, which was detected only in the granulosa cells of small antral follicles. In addition, MXC decreased the plasma AMH and FSH concentrations. In conclusion, the present study may indicate long-term effects of neonatal MXC exposure on GDF9, BMP15, AMH, and FSH signaling in ovaries of adult pigs. However, the MXC effects varied at different stages of follicular development. It seems that neonatal MXC exposure may result in accelerated initial recruitment of ovarian follicles and impaired cyclic recruitment of antral follicles.

AB  - Autonomous circadian clocks exist in nearly every mammalian cell type. These cellular clocks are subjected to a multilayered regulation sensitive to the mechanochemical cell microenvironment. Whereas the biochemical signaling that controls the cellular circadian clock is increasingly well understood, mechanisms underlying regulation by mechanical cues are largely unknown. Here we show that the fibroblast circadian clock is mechanically regulated through YAP/TAZ nuclear levels. We use high-throughput analysis of single-cell circadian rhythms and apply controlled mechanical, biochemical, and genetic perturbations to study the expression of the clock gene Rev-erb & alpha;. We observe that Rev-erb & alpha; circadian oscillations are disrupted with YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. By targeted mutations and overexpression of YAP/TAZ, we show that this mechanobiological regulation, which also impacts core components of the clock such as Bmal1 and Cry1, depends on the binding of YAP/TAZ to the transcriptional effector TEAD. This mechanism could explain the impairment of circadian rhythms observed when YAP/TAZ activity is upregulated, as in cancer and aging.
   Organisms are adapted to daily cyclic environmental changes thanks to the circadian clocks located in all their cells and tissues. This study shows that mechanosensing severely affects circadian rhythms at the single-cell level through alterations in the expression and intracellular localization of transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ.

AB  - The benefits of current treatments for depression are limited by low response rates, delayed therapeutic effects, and multiple side effects. Antidepressants affect a variety of neurotransmitter systems in different areas of the brain, and the mechanisms underlying their convergent effects on behavior have been unclear. Here we identify hippocampal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling as a common downstream pathway that mediates the behavioral effects of five different antidepressant classes (fluoxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, vilazodone, trazodone) and of electroconvulsive therapy. All of these therapies decrease BMP signaling and enhance neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Preventing the decrease in BMP signaling blocks the effect of antidepressant treatment on behavioral phenotypes. Further, inhibition of BMP signaling in hippocampal newborn neurons is sufficient to produce an antidepressant effect, while chemogenetic silencing of newborn neurons prevents the antidepressant effect. Thus, inhibition of hippocampal BMP signaling is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the effects of multiple classes of antidepressants.

AB  - Proline rich-39 (PR-39) is a natural antimicrobial protein with good antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The miniature Wuzhishan pig (WZSP) has important similarities to humans in anatomical structure, physiological characteristics, and nutrient metabolism that make it an important model animal for biomedical research. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and therapeutic mechanism of PR-39 on intestinal barrier function using the LPS-induced enteritis model in WZSPs. We found that PR-39 treatment reversed the decrease in growth performance and peripheral organ damage, regulated serum indices (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL10, TGF-beta, IgA, IgG, DAO, D-LA) and enhanced the antioxidant capacity (MDA, CAT, GSH-Px, T-AOC) of piglets. PR-39 protected the integrity of the jejunal barrier by upregulating the density of goblet cells and the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin. Additionally, PR-39 increased the abundance of jejunal probiotics (e.g., Lactococcus), and increased the cecal abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii, then promoted the production of 7-keto deoxycholic acid to activate the bile acid receptor TGR5, which in turn inhibited the NF-kappa BMLCK-MLC signaling pathway and the secretion of proinflammatory factors by macrophages. In summary, these findings suggest that PR-39 supplementation may be an effective strategy to improve the intestinal damage and dysfunction.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms used by phytophagous insects to survive and feed on new hosts is key to explaining their mechanisms of range expansion and diversification. However, only a few Neotropical biological models have been used to understand these mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the differences in gene expression of the Neotropical phytophagous insect Anastrepha obliqua Macquart (Diptera: Tephritidae), the West Indian Fruit Fly, when feeding on three different host plant species under sympatric and synchronous conditions. Third-instar larvae of A. obliqua infesting red mombin (Spondias purpurea L.), mango (Mangifera indica L.), and carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) were collected in two localities in southwestern Colombia. After assembling a de novo transcriptome, differences in gene expression between larvae infesting the three host species were established using a batch effect design, controlling the variability introduced by location. Sixty-four differentially expressed unigenes were identified among flies infesting the different hosts, with the greatest number of genes differentially expressed between red mombin and carambola. Digestive genes, such as alpha-amylases and serine proteases, were upregulated in larvae from red mombin compared with mango (six genes) and carambola (four genes), suggesting the response of A. obliqua to the nutritional composition in red mombin. Also, two genes related to immune system responses, glutactin and acidic phospholipase A2, were upregulated in mango compared to carambola. Notably, genes annotated as transposable elements (TEs) were consistently upregulated in larvae infesting carambola and mango compared to larvae infesting red mombin. This may suggest the activation of these TEs in acclimation or adaptation to new hosts. Based on our results, the main categories of differentially expressed genes in A. obliqua were serine proteases, detoxification proteins, and proteins associated with the regulation of gene expression. These results support the potential of A. obliqua to adapt to host plants and its qualification as a generalist species.

AB  - Used cooking oil (UCO) is a valuable resource that can be utilized in different ways. Appropriate management of UCO waste can provide environmental and economic benefits, compared to improper disposal practices. This study assessed the environmental impacts of potential UCO valorization options in Thailand. Altogether, 14 scenarios, including 10 for alternative energy recovering processes (S1-10) and other options such as soap production (S11), use in dry pig feed (DPF) production (S12), synthesis of plastics (S13) and polyol (S14), were considered. The defined system boundaries for each scenario include pretreatment, material and energy consumption, and waste treatment stages for the treatment of 1000 kg UCO. Environmental impacts in terms of global warming potential (GWP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), fossil resource scarcity (FRS), and freshwater, terrestrial, and marine eco-toxicity (FE, TE, and ME, respectively) were analyzed using the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method. The results revealed that all the current waste valorization options create an environmental burden and contribute towards GWP. Scenarios 7 and 10 showed environmental credits for FEP, FE, and ME indicators while scenario 9 did so for FRS. The processes direct energy consumption resulted in the highest contribution to GWP in Scenarios 1, 5-8, 10, 12, and 13. Environmental effects of material consumption and waste treatments were found to be the highest in bio-oil and DPF production, respectively. However, co-products produced could not offset the burden created by energy and material consumption. Overall, the results showed better environmental performance from energy recovery-based UCO management options compared to alternative processes.

AB  - As the global demand for seafood surges, the expanding aquaculture industry faces a pressing need for viable aquafeed ingredients. The raw material for fish oil is limited and expensive due to unpredictable fishery resources in the fishing zones and the overexploitation of wild fisheries, underscoring the urgency of finding alternatives. This review explores diverse plant oil sources, including soybean, rapeseed, linseed, and algal oils, emphasizing their crucial role in nutritionally balanced aquafeeds. These oils support aquatic animals' growth, health, and development, influencing membrane structure, energy storage, and hormone production. Genetically modified oilseeds (GM), such as camelina and canola, offer a controlled nutrient content, enabling customized nutrient profiles. This comprehensive review provides an overview of different plant oil sources, elucidates their nutrient profiles, and assesses their potential applications in aquaculture. The discussion encompasses their impact on growth, feed efficiency, lipid profile, health, immunological status, disease resistance, and overall performance of both freshwater and marine fish. Furthermore, the review compiles relevant data on the current status of genetically modified plant oils and explores their potential integration into aquaculture practices. In summary, substituting plant oils for fish oil in aquafeed presents a promising solution to aquaculture industry challenges to meet nutritional requirements for fish.

AB  - During embryonic heart development, the progenitor cells in the epicardium would migrate and differentiate into noncardiomyocytes in myocardium and affect the integrity of ventricular wall, but the underlying mechanism has not been well studied. We have found that myocardium geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Ggpps), a metabolic enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, is critical for cardiac cytoarchitecture remodelling during heart development. Here, we further reveal that epicardial Ggpps could also regulate ventricular wall architecture integrity. Epicardium-specific deletion of Ggpps before embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) is embryonic lethal, whereas after E13.5 is survival but with defects in the epicardium and ventricular wall structure. Ggpps deficiency in the epicardium enhances the proliferation of epicardial cells and disrupts cellcell contact, which makes epicardial cells easier to invade into ventricular wall. Thus, the fibroblast proliferation and coronary formation in myocardium were found enhanced that might disturb the coronary vasculature remodelling and ventricular wall integrity. These processes might be associated with the activation of YAP signalling, whose nuclear distribution is blocked by Ggpps deletion. In conclusion, our findings reveal a potential link between the cholesterol metabolism and heart epicardium and myocardium development in mammals, which might provide a new view of the cause for congenital heart diseases and potential therapeutic target in pathological cardiac conditions.

AB  - Biochar as an environmentally friendly soil amendment, has attracted widespread attention and in combination with other amendments is considered to be more conducive to crop growth, soil fertility, and crop safety pro-duction. However, a comprehensive understanding of the differences among different biochars, biochar with inorganic amendment, and biochar with organic amendment with respect to soil health, plant growth, and Cd bioavailability or phytoavailability is necessary. Therefore, a sixty-day pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of five biochars derived from rice husk (RH), pig manure (PM), sewage sludge (SS), corn straw (CS), and wood chip (WC) and their respective combination with lime or compost on cadmium (Cd) immobilization and adsorption as well as physicochemical features and enzyme activities in contaminated soil. The results revealed that the sole application of PM, SS, and CS biochars had a positive impact on lettuce growth and photosynthetic pigments. In addition, mixing PM or SS biochar with compost further promoted lettuce growth due to higher soil fertility and enzyme activities. However, as compared to unamended soil, CS biochar-compost combination, RH, PM, SS, and CS biochar-lime combination highly reduced lettuce plant height and fresh weight. Furthermore, the application of amendments with biochar-lime mixtures greatly reduced Cd bioavailability. X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared spectra revealed that Cd immobiliza-tion mainly involved complexation and co-precipitation on mineral surfaces as well as hydroxyl or carboxyl functional groups in amendments. In comparison to a single application and biochar-lime combination, the biochar-compost combinations i.e RH, PM, SS, and WC were more effective in lowering Cd translocation and bioaccumulation in lettuce.

AB  - Cuticular wax and cutin are directly involved in the mechanisms by which plants acclimate to water-limited environments. However, how the two lipid forms balance their contributions to plant drought-tolerance is still not clear. The present study examined the responses of cutin monomers and cuticular waxes to drought stress in two sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) cultivars, drought-tolerant cv. Kangsi and drought-sensitive cv. Hongyingzi, by combining lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis. Drought increased total cutin contents by 41.3%, the contents of alkanoic acids by 72.6% and 2-hydroxyacids by 117.8% in Kangsi but unchanged those in Hongyingzi. The abundance of cutin monomers were relatively stable for cv Hongyingzi, excepting for a decrease of.-hydroxyacids from 35.0% to 27.4% in drought-stressed plants. However, for cv Kangsi, the abundance of.-hydroxyacids decreased from 36.8% to 21.0% and that of alkanoic acids increased from 30.5% to 37.1% in drought-stressed plants. Drought increased total wax coverage in Hongyingzi but reduced it in Kangsi. However, the abundance of aldehydes decreased from 51.2% to 39.3% in drought-stressed cv Kangsi, but increased from 25.2% to 36.1% in drought-stressed cv Hongyingzi. A decrease of sterols (by 76%) and an increase of primary alcohol (by 443%) was also observed in drought-stressed cv Hongyingzi. Transcriptome analysis also revealed that many genes implicated by homology in cutin monomer and cuticular wax biosynthesis also differed in their responses to drought stress between the two sorghum cultivars. Therefore, sorghum cultivars differed in their mechanisms in adjusting chemical profiles of both cutin and cuticular wax under water deficit condition.

AB  - Rhythmic light flicker alleviates cognitive impairments in various animal models of neurological diseases. However, its long-term effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a cohort of adult mice is subjected to long-term exposure to 40 Hz light flicker (1 hour daily for 30 days) and observed significant enhancements in hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning without any adverse behavioral effects. Specific ablation of hippocampal newborn neurons using DCXDTR mice abolished these effects. Furthermore, the inactivation or elimination of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneurons not only impaired 40 Hz light flicker entrainment but also reduce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Long-term flicker exposure increases excitatory input to DG PV interneurons, which enhances PV interneuron excitability, elevated GABA levels, and strengthened inhibitory transmission to newborn neurons, thereby promoting better integration of new neurons into the DG. Blocking GABAA receptors reverse the light flicker-induced increase in neurogenesis and spatial learning. Prolonged flicker exposure do not affect DG regional cerebral blood flow or the activity of excitatory cholinergic, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or cholecystokinin (CCK) interneurons. These findings suggest that long-term light flicker enhances spatial learning through PV-dependent neurogenesis, with elevated GABAergic activity supporting the development and integration of immature neurons in the adult DG.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disorder, causing pain and disability predominantly in the aging population but also affecting young individuals. Current treatments are limited to use of anti-inflammatory drugs to alleviate symptoms or degenerated joint replacement by a prosthetic implant at the end stage of the disease. We hypothesized that degenerative cartilage defects can be treated using nasal chondrocyte-based tissue-engineered cartilage (N-TEC). We demonstrate that N-TEC maintained cartilaginous properties when exposed in vitro to inflammatory stimuli found in osteoarthritic joints and favorably altered the inflammatory profile of cells from osteoarthritic joints. These effects were at least partially mediated by down-regulation of the WNT (wingless/integrated) signaling pathway through sFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein-1). We further report that N-TEC survive and engraft in vivo in ectopic mouse models reproducing a human osteochondral OA tissue environment, as well as in sheep articular cartilage defects that mimic degenerative settings. Last, we tested the safety of autologous N-TEC for the treatment of osteoarthritic cartilage defects in the knees of two patients with advanced OA (Kellgren and Lawrence grades 3 and 4) who were otherwise considered for unicondylar knee arthroplasty. No adverse reactions were recorded, and patients reported reduced pain as well as improved joint function and life quality 14 months after surgery. Together, our findings indicate that N-TEC can directly contribute to cartilage repair in osteoarthritic joints. A suitably powered clinical trial is now required to assess its efficacy in the treatment of patients with OA.

AB  - An analytical method of simultaneous detection of ten insecticide residues in honey and pollen was established. The samples were purified with QuEChERS approach using new adsorbents and analyzed with UPLC-MS/MS. The results showed that both of graphene and carbon nanotubes were highly efficient adsorbents for the dSPE clean up to eliminate coextractives in the samples, and graphene was superior to carbon nanotubes for the detection of pesticide residues in honey and pollen samples. The proposed method was used to detect pesticide residues in 25 honey samples and 30 pollen samples which were randomly collected from more than ten provinces in China. All honey samples contain 1-27 mu g/kg of chlorpyrifos residues. Only 4% of the honey samples were detected containing acetamiprid and imidacloprid, while the other seven pesticides were not detected. Chlorpyrifos residues were found in all pollen samples (5-66 mu g/kg), among which twenty percent exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs, 50 mu g/kg, European Commission Regulation). Most of the pollen samples containing pesticide concentrations higher than MRLs were collected from rape, followed by lotus, camellia, and rose. Besides, 36.7% and 33.3% of the pollen samples had imidacloprid and flupyradifurone higher than 5 mu g/kg. A total of 26.7% pollen samples were detected containing bifenthrin, while none of the other six pesticides were detected in pollen samples.

AB  - Mitochondria play an important role not only in producing energy for the cell but also for regulating mitochondrial and cell function depending on the cell's needs and environment. Uptake of cations, anions, and substrates requires a stable, polarized transmembrane charge potential (delta psi(m)). Chemiosmosis requires ion ex-changers to remove Na+, K+, Ca2+, PO43- , and other charged species that enter mitochondria. Knowledge of the kinetics of mitochondrial (m) cation channels and exchangers is important in understanding their roles in regulating mitochondrial chemiosmosis and bioenergetics. The influx/efflux of K+, the most abundant mitochondrial cation, alters mitochondrial volume and shape by bringing in anions and H2O by osmosis. The effects of K+ uptake through ligand-specific mK(+) channels stimulated/inhibited by agonists/antagonists on mitochondrial volume (swelling/contraction) are well known. However, a more important role for K+ influx is likely its effects on H+ cycling and bioenergetics facilitated by mitochondrial (m) K+/H+ exchange (mKHE), though the kinetics and consequences of K+ efflux by KHE are not well described. We hypothesized that a major role of K+ influx/efflux is stimulation of respiration via the influx of H+ by KHE. We proposed to modulate KHE activity by energizing guinea pig heart isolated mitochondria and by altering the mK(+) cycle to capture changes in mitochondrial volume, pH(m), delta psi(m), and respiration that would reflect a role for H+ influx via KHE to regulate bio-energetics. To test this, mitochondria were suspended in a 150 mM K+ buffer at pH 6.9, or in a 140 mM Cs+ buffer at pH 7.6 or 6.9 with added 10 mM K+, minimal Ca2+ and free of Na+. O-2 content was measured by a Clark electrode, and pH(m), delta psi(m), and volume, were measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry and light-scattering. Adding pyruvic acid (PA) alone caused increases in volume and respiration and a rapid decrease in the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH(m) = pH(in)-pH(ext)) at pH(ext )6.9 > > 7.6, so that delta psi(m) was charged and maintained. BKCa agonist NS1619 and antagonist paxilline modified these effects, and KHE inhibitor quinine and K+ iono-phore valinomycin depolarized delta psi(m). We postulate that K+ efflux-induced H+ influx via KHE causes an inward H+ leak that stimulates respiration, but at buffer pH 6.9 also utilizes the energy of delta pH(m), the smaller component of the overall proton motive force, delta mu H+. Thus delta pH(m) establishes and maintains the delta psi(m) required for utilization of substrates, entry of all cations, and for oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, K+ influx/efflux appears to play a pivotal role in regulating energetics while maintaining mitochondrial ionic balance and volume homeostasis.

AB  - Arthropods utilize olfactory function to detect informational substances within their natural habitats, thereby facilitating essential life activities such as foraging, mating, and oviposition. Niemann-Pick protein type C2 (NPC2), a putative odorant carrier, has not been fully described in the olfactory perception of predatory mites. In this study, we characterized in detail the olfactory perception functions of NbNPC2-2 and NbNPC2-3 in the important predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri. The results show that 2 NPC2 proteins, with 6 conserved cysteine sites, are significantly upregulated (by 2.93-fold for NbNPC2-2 and 1.66-fold for NbNPC2-3) with methyl salicylate (MeSA), an important herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV). Knocking down both NbNPC2-2 and NbNPC2-3 prevented N. barkeri from preferring pest-infested plants, and reduced their crawling speed to 2.92 and 3.12 mm/s under MeSA treatment. The affinity analysis revealed that NPC2-2 binds to HIPVs beta-ionone, MeSA, and ocimene (Ki = 28.55 +/- 2.12, 40.73 +/- 3.89, and 45.15 +/- 2.22, respectively), and NPC2-3 binds to 4-ethylbenzaldehyde (Ki = 51.67 +/- 0.23). Molecular docking further confirmed hydrogen bonding interactions between NPC2-2, NPC2-3, and these HIPVs. These results indicated that NPC2-2 and NPC2-3 act as odor carriers involved in the olfactory perception of mites toward HIPVs. This enhances understanding of the molecular mechanism of phytoseiid olfaction.

AB  - A variety of factors has been associated with healthy brain aging, and epidemiological studies suggest that physical activity and nutritional supplements such as caffeine may reduce the risk of developing dementia and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. Caffeine is known to act as a cognitive enhancer but has been also shown to positively affect exercise performance in endurance activities. We have previously observed that chronic oral caffeine supplementation and a treatment paradigm encompassing physical and cognitive stimulation by enriched environment (EE) housing can improve learning and memory performance and ameliorate hippocampal neuron loss in the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Here, we investigated whether these effects were synergistic. To that end, previous findings on individual treatments were complemented with unpublished, additional data and analyzed in depth by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post tests. We further evaluated whether plasma neurofilament light chain levels reflect neuropathological and behavioral changes observed in the experimental groups. While a treatment combining physical activity and caffeine supplementation significantly improved learning and memory function compared to standard-housed vehicle-treated Tg4-42 in tasks such as the Morris water maze, no major additive effect outperforming the effects of the single interventions was observed.

AB  - The investigation of fungal diversity in the rhizosphere of Camellia oleifera led to the isolation of two saprophytic fungal strains from the Xianyu Mountains, Anhui Province, China. Morphologically, these strains exhibited an irregular colony surface with divergent cracks, along with predominantly solitary slender phialides that produced narrow cylindrical conidia in chains. To further elucidate their taxonomic position, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using ITS and LSU rDNA region sequences, employing maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference. The results unequivocally supported that these isolated strains belong to the genus Leptobacillium and represent a previously undescribed species. Consequently, based on their discernible morphological and phylogenetic characteristics in comparison to other Leptobacillium species, we propose a new fungal taxon, L. xianyushanense sp. nov.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to lacking exploitation capability, traditional genetic algorithm cannot accurately identify the minimal best gene subset. Thus, the improved splicing method is introduced into a genetic algorithm to enhance exploitation capability for achieving balance between exploitation and exploration of GA. It can effectively identify true gene subsets with high probability. Furthermore, a dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep has been used to show that the proposed method can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including genetic algorithm and adaptive best-subset selection algorithm. Selecting the minimal best subset out of a huge number of factors for influencing the response is a fundamental and very challenging NP-hard problem because the presence of many redundant genes results in over-fitting easily while missing an important gene can more detrimental impact on predictions, and computation is prohibitive for exhaust search. We propose a modified memetic algorithm (MA) based on an improved splicing method to overcome the problems in the traditional genetic algorithm exploitation capability and dimension reduction in the predictor variables. The new algorithm accelerates the search in identifying the minimal best subset of genes by incorporating it into the new local search operator and hence improving the splicing method. The improvement is also due to another two novel aspects: (a) updating subsets of genes iteratively until the no more reduction in the loss function by splicing and increasing the probability of selecting the true subsets of genes; and (b) introducing add and del operators based on backward sacrifice into the splicing method to limit the size of gene subsets. Additionally, according to the experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms. Moreover, the mutation operator is replaced by it to enhance exploitation capability and initial individuals are improved by it to enhance efficiency of search. A dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep was used to evaluate the superiority of the modified MA against the genetic algorithm. According to our experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including the most advanced adaptive best-subset selection algorithm.

AB  - Gene-modified miniature pigs serve as alternative tissue and organ donors for xenotransplantation to alleviate the shortage of human allogenic organs. However, the high copy number of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) genomes integrates with the porcine genome, which has a potential risk of cross-species transmission and hinders the clinical practice of xenotransplantation. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to inactivate PERVs. However, Cas9 also triggers severe DNA damage at multiple integrated PERV sites in the porcine genome, which induces senescence and apoptosis of porcine cells. In this study, the cytosine base editor (CBE), an efficient and safe editor that does not cause DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), was used for PERV editing to reduce cytotoxic effects. Seven sgRNAs were set to target gag and pol loci of PERVs to induce premature stop codons. We found that approximately 10% of cell clones were completely inactivated for PERVs in pig ST cells, and the plasmid that was used for editing the PERVs did not integrate into host genome and influence the karyotype of the modified cells. Our studies offer a powerful and safe strategy for further generating PERV-knockout pigs using base editors.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Blast TBI (bTBI) found in Veterans presents with several complications, including cognitive and behavioral disturbances and PTE; however, the underlying mechanisms that drive the long-term sequelae are not well understood. Using an unbiased proteomics approach in a mouse model of repeated bTBI (rbTBI), this study addresses this gap in the knowledge. After rbTBI, mice were monitored using continuous, uninterrupted video-EEG for up to four months. Following this period, we collected cortex and hippocampus tissues from three groups of mice: those with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE+), those without epilepsy (PTE-), and the control group (sham). Hundreds of differentially expressed proteins were identified in the cortex and hippocampus of PTE+ and PTE- relative to sham. Focusing on protein pathways unique to PTE+, pathways related to mitochondrial function, post-translational modifications, and transport were disrupted. Computational metabolic modeling using dysregulated protein expression predicted mitochondrial proton pump dysregulation, suggesting electron transport chain dysregulation in the epileptic tissue relative to PTE-. Finally, data mining enabled the identification of several novel and previously validated TBI and epilepsy biomarkers in our data set, many of which were found to already be targeted by drugs in various phases of clinical testing. These findings highlight novel proteins and protein pathways that may drive the chronic PTE sequelae following rbTBI.

AB  - Twelve rams were used to confirm whether rams sexually activated in spring by light treatment increase social and sexual activities of non-treated rams in the presence of ewes. Males were divided into 2 groups: light-treated rams (group L, n = 6), which were exposed to artificial long days (16 h light) for 2 months (1 Nov-31 Dec), or non-exposed, control rams (group C, n = 6), exposed to the natural pho-toperiod. At the end of the long-day period, light-treated rams were returned to the natural photoperiod, groups isolated from each other. In mid-Feb, 3 rams from each group were put together such that 4 ex-perimental groups were created: the remaining light-treated rams (L, n = 3), the remaining control rams (C, n = 3), and the other treated (L-mixed n = 3) and non-treated (C-mixed, n = 3) rams, exposed to 30, 30, and 60 ewes, respectively, in 3 separate paddocks. To identify each ram, large (30-cm-high) numbers were painted on the sides and rump of the males with washable sheep spray paint. Behaviors were doc-umented by 4 video cameras using 6 30-minute segments from 1600 to 1800 h the following day (27 hours). C rams presented the lowest proportion of activities ( P < 0.01), and C-mixed rams exhibited pro-portions similar to L and L-mixed rams. C rams exhibited the fewest fight attempts ( P < 0.001), fighting ( P < 0.05), pushing ( P < 0.001), and sniffing another ram. The groups differed significantly ( P < 0.001) in pushing, pawing, flehmen, and attempt mounting, and C rams had the fewest interactions. In conclusion, rams exposed to 2 months of long days at late-autumn early-winter increased social and sexual activities of unexposed rams. These observations can be explained by a "ram-to-ram effect", which can enhance the endocrine activity of rams in sexual rest if they are joined with rams who have been made sexually active by a photoperiodic treatment. These findings suggest that socio-sexual interactions could be used to restrict out-of-season reproduction in this species.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - : Solid laser lighting with high photoelectric conversion efficiency and compact size has been increasingly vital in lighting applications. Extensive research has been conducted to obtain highquality color converters for application to high-power and highluminance laser lighting. Currently, Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor in glass (Ce:PiG) and Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor-in-glass film (Ce:PiF) possessing high efficiency, low cost, easy fabrication, and controllable chromaticity are becoming the most mainstream research directions. In this study, by modifying the glass particle size and sintering temperature, investigating the relevant host glass, and so forth, highperformance Ce:PiG was developed through a one-step co-sintering technology. It possesses a high internal quantum efficiency, approaching 100% of the original phosphors (92.5%). The luminous efficacy (LE) of the Ce:PiG was 240 lm/W at 2.18 W/mm2 under 450 nm blue laser diode (LD) excitation, which is the best result yet reported. Furthermore, to enhance the laser saturation threshold, the fabricated Ce:PiF relying on a sapphire substrate can withstand an 8 W/mm2 blue incident power density. The obtained sample can even reach an LE of 251.5 lm/W, which is an obvious improvement to Ce:PiG. In addition, the result, an LD module combined with the sample that meets the standard white light source, indicates that this work has good prospects for white laser lighting.

AB  - Despite their indisputable efficacy for pain management, opiate prescriptions remain highly controversial partially due to their elevated addictive potential. Relapse in drug use is one of the principal problems for addiction treatment, with drug-associated memories being among its main triggers. Consequently, the extinction of these memories has been proposed as a useful therapeutic tool. Hence, by using the conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm in rats, we investigated some of the molecular mechanisms that occurr during the retrieval and extinction of morphine withdrawal memories in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), which control emotional and episodic memories, respectively. The retrieval of aversive memories associated with the abstinence syndrome paralleled with decreased mTOR activity and increased Arc and GluN1 expressions in the DG. Additionally, Arc mRNA levels in this nucleus very strongly correlated with the CPA score exhibited by the opiate-treated rats. On the other hand, despite the unaltered mTOR phosphorylation, Arc levels augmented in the BLA. After the extinction test, Arc and GluN1 expressions were raised in both the DG and BLA of the control and morphine-treated animals. Remarkably, Homer1 expression in both areas correlated almost perfectly with the extinction showed by morphine-dependent animals. Moreover, Arc expression in the DG correlated strongly with the extinction of the CPA manifested by the group treated with the opiate. Finally, our results support the coordinated activity of some of these neuroplastic proteins for the extinction of morphine withdrawal memories in a regional-dependent manner. Present data provide evidence of differential expression and activity of synaptic molecules during the retrieval and extinction of aversive memories of opiate withdrawal in the amygdalar and hippocampal regions that will likely permit the development of therapeutic strategies able to minimize relapses induced by morphine withdrawal-associated aversive memories.

AB  - Tea leaf spot caused by Didymella segeticola is an important disease that threatens the healthy growth of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and results in reductions in the productivity and quality of tea leaves. Early diagnosis of the disease is particularly important for managing the infection. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is an efficient diagnostic technique with the advantages of simplicity, specificity, and sensitivity. In this study, we developed a rapid, visual, and high-sensitivity LAMP assay for D. segeticola detection based on sequence-characterized amplified regions. Two pairs of amplification primers (external primers F3 and B3 and internal primers FIP and BIP) were designed based on a specific sequence in D. segeticola (NCBI accession number: OR987684). Compared to common pathogens of other genera in tea plants and other species in the Didymella genus (Didymella coffeae-arabicae, Didymella pomorum, and Didymella sinensis), the LAMP method is specific for detecting the species D. segeticola. The assay was able to detect D. segeticola at a minimal concentration of 1 fg/mu L genomic DNA at an optimal reaction temperature of 65 degrees C for 60 min. When healthy leaves were inoculated with D. segeticola in the laboratory, the LAMP method successfully detected D. segeticola in diseased tea leaves at 72 h post inoculation. The LAMP assays were negative when the DNA samples were extracted from healthy leaves. Leaf tissues with necrotic lesions from 18 germplasms of tea plants tested positive for the pathogen by the LAMP assay. In summary, this study established a specific, sensitive, and simple LAMP method to detect D. segeticola, which provides reliable technical support for estimating disease prevalence and facilitates sustainable management of tea leaf spot.

AB  - Burn injuries are difficult to manage due to the defect of large skin tissues, leading to major disability or even death. Human fibroblast growth factor 2 (hFGF2) is known to promote burn wound healing. However, direct administration of hFGF2 to the wound area would affect the bioactivity. To provide a supportive environment for hFGF2 and control its release in a steady fashion, in this research, we developed novel thermosensitive poloxam hydrogels delivered with hFGF2-linked Camelina lipid droplets (CLD-hFGF2 hydrogels). Cryopreserved scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that the incorporation of CLD-hFGF2 does not significantly affect the inner structure of hydrogels. The rheological properties showed that CLD-hFGF2 hydrogels gelated in response to temperature, thus optimizing the delivery method. In vitro, CLD-hFGF2 could be released from hydrogels for 3 days after drug delivery (the release rate was 72%), and the release solution could still promote the proliferation and migration of NIH3T3 cells. In vivo, compared with hydrogels alone or with direct CLD-hFGF2 administration, CLD-hFGF2 hydrogels had the most obvious effect on deep second-degree burn wound healing. This work indicates that CLD-hFGF2 hydrogels have potential application value in burn wound healing.

AB  - Studies on olfactory training (OT) outcomes have mostly been limited to olfactory performance, while direct neural connections between olfactory system and amygdala-hippocampal complex allow expecting OT to have psychological effects. To address this hypothesis, we examined olfactory, cognitive and emotional effects of OT in the group of 68 subjects aged between 50 and 88 years (M (age) = 62.8 +/- 8.9 years; 28 males) who are likely to experience an age-related decline in olfactory and cognitive performance. We diversified stimuli used in the OT to verify whether odor mixtures result in more effective activation of olfactory receptor neurons than single molecule odors. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions: (a) simple OT utilizing single-molecule odors; (b) mixtures OT using odor mixtures; (c) control group without OT. Results indicate beneficent effects of the simple OT on cognitive assessment, cognitive decline symptoms, and olfactory sensitivity. OT can be adapted from otorhinolaryngological practice to successfully serve neurocognitive research and in supporting the cognitive-related aging process.

AB  - Parturition is a critical period for the ewe and lamb, and the incidence of dystocia has known impacts on lamb and ewe welfare and productivity. Current methods of dystocia monitoring are mostly conducted through visual observation. Novel approaches for monitoring have also been suggested, including the application of on-animal sensor technologies for remote surveillance of parturition success.This short communication explores how the use of sensor-based parturition detection models can be applied for detection of adverse and successful parturition events, respectively, in pasture-based sheep (Ovis aries). Specifically, the alert profile of a single ewe that experienced vaginal prolapse is reported and compared with the alert profiles of 13 ewes that experienced typical birth events. Although the ewe that experienced vaginal prolapse exhibited some common precursor alerts similar to ewes that progressed through a typical birth event, the overall alert profile was markedly different for the prolapsed animal, with an increased number of alerts occurring from five days prior to the prolapse event. As successful parturition has significant welfare and productivity outcomes, application and validation of these research findings in a commercial system could greatly improve current methods of welfare monitoring at lambing.

AB  - Clinical studies have demonstrated that allopregnanolone (3 alpha 5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone, ALLO) has antidepressant-like effects on patients with depression. Previous studies have shown alteration of the astroglial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) in depression, and ALLO is known to modulate glutamate release. The present study aimed to investigate whether astroglial GLT-1 and GS are indeed involved in the antidepressant-like effects of ALLO in learned helplessness (LH) rats, a validated animal model of depression. The results of this study showed that bilateral microinjection of ALLO into the lateral ventricles could normalize the levels of GLT-1 and GS in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and of GS in the hippocampal CA1 region of LH rats. These results suggest a certain connection between the antidepressant-like effects of ALLO and the astroglial GLT-1/GS system of the NAc in LH rats.

AB  - Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a widespread carcinogenic pollutant in the environment. Although previous studies have demonstrated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of B[a]P, the precise mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic effects induced by prenatal B[a]P exposure remain largely unknown. In the present study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg-bw of B[a]P for three consecu-tive days on embryonic days 17-19. The learning and memory abilities of offspring were determined by Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, while the number of dendritic branches and the density of dendritic spines in hippo-campal CA1 and DG regions were evaluated by Golgi-Cox staining at PND 45 and PND 75. The mRNA expression of BDNF, PSD-95, and SYP in offspring hippocampus were detected by qRT-PCR, and the protein expression of BDNF, PSD-95, SYP, HDAC2, acH3K9, and acH3K14 were measured by Western blotting or immunohisto-chemistry. CHIP-PCR was performed to further detect the levels of acH3K9 and acH3K14 in the promoter regions of BDNF and PSD-95 genes. Our results showed that rats prenatally exposed to B[a]P exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory abilities and the number of dendritic branches and the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 and DG regions were significantly reduced during adolescence and adulthood. The expression of HDAC2 protein was significantly upregulated, while acH3K9, acH3K14, BDNF, PSD-95, and SYP protein levels were significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of B[a]P-exposed rats. In addition, CHIP results showed that prenatal B[a]P exposure markedly decreased the level of acH3K9 and acH3K14 in the promoter region of BDNF and PSD-95 gene in the hippocampus of PND 45 and PND 75 offspring. All of the results suggest that prenatal B[a]P exposure impairs cognitive function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity of offspring in adoles-cence and adulthood, and HDAC2-mediated histone deacetylation plays a crucial role in these deficits.

AB  - Cold exposure exerts negative effects on hippocampal nerve development in adolescent mice, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Given that ubiquitination is essential for neurodevelopmental processes, we attempted to investigate the effects of cold exposure on the hippocampus from the perspective of ubiquitination. By conducting a ubiquitinome analysis, we found that cold exposure caused changes in the ubiquitination levels of a variety of synaptic-associated proteins. We validated changes in postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) ubiquitination levels by immunoprecipitation, revealing reductions in both the K48 and K63 polyubiquitination levels of PSD-95. Golgi staining further demonstrated that cold exposure decreased the dendritic-spine density in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis revealed that differentially ubiquitinated proteins were enriched in the glycolytic, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways. Protein expression analysis confirmed that cold exposure activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/HIF-1 alpha pathway. We also observed suppression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein levels and the pyruvate kinase (PK) activity induced by cold exposure. Regarding oxidative phosphorylation, a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial respiratory-complex I activity was observed, along with reduced gene expression of the key subunits NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 (Ndufv1) and Ndufv2. In summary, cold exposure negatively affects hippocampal neurodevelopment and causes abnormalities in energy homeostasis within the hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary The conception rate of sows is an important factor affecting the efficiency and income of pig farms. At present, the traditional estrus identification methods used in production, such as the external observation method and back pressure reaction method, have the disadvantages of being time-consuming and laborious, with low accuracy and high requirements for technicians. In addition, the abnormal estrus status of sows, such as continuous estrus and short estrus, will also lead to misjudgment during estrus inspection, which will affect the conception rate of sows and reduce production efficiency. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore a new method for estrus identification, to provide an important reference for accurate estrus identification of sows by screening salivary proteins related to estrus, and to provide a reference for the development of kits/strips for estrus identification of sows. The estrus cycle of multiparous Large White sows was divided into three stages to solve the problems of heavy workload and low accuracy of the traditional estrus identification method in pig production. Saliva protein was extracted from the oral saliva of multiparous sows. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to detect salivary proteome, and MaxQuant software was used for quality control. Results showed that 246 proteins were identified in the three stages, where 40 proteins were significantly different (p < 0.05). The total proteins identified were enriched by STEM software and the protein function was annotated by using the ClueGO plug-in in the Cytoscape software. The results were enriched to eight different trends. The annotated items were related to protein synthesis and processing and estrogen response. Gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of differential proteins involved in the pathways and entries included oocyte meiosis, response to estradiol, and oogenesis. Further interaction analysis showed that an interaction occurred between P00355, F1SHL9, P28491, F1SDR7, F2Z558, F1RYY6, and F2Z5G3 proteins. The findings served as a basis for revealing the changes in salivary protein content in the sow estrus cycle and provided a reference for the development of an estrus identification kit/test strip in the next step.

AB  - Cattle slurry storage is a major point source for methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) emissions globally. Efficacy of an oxygen-based amendment in reducing these emissions was investigated. Two 1.6 kg cattle slurry in-cubations, each lasting for 40-days, were carried out in a climate-controlled chamber with CH4 and NH3 emis-sions measured. Multiple peroxide sources acting as a source of oxygen were tested to examine how compatible they were for addition to cattle slurry. An amendment comprising of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and potassium iodide (KI) has been highlighted as method to reduce CH4 emissions from this source. While urea hydrogen peroxide and sodium percarbonate reduced CH4 emissions, they increased the slurry pH and subsequently NH3 emissions by 209 and 42%, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide did not infer any pH increase upon the slurry and therefore no increase in NH3 emissions was observed. Hydrogen peroxide and KI were able to reduce CH4 emissions by 63% during slurry storage. The use of this treatment on a larger scale system should be considered in the future considering the large reductions achieved.

AB  - Feeding on mixed, alternating, or changing diets often favor insect development. With the aim to optimize mass rearing and use for the biological control of insect pests, we investigated the effects of various combinations of high-quality (the green peach aphid Myzus persicae) and low-quality (eggs of the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella) foods on the larval development of a predatory ladybird Cheilomenes propinqua. In the first experiment, eggs and aphids were mixed in different proportions; in the second experiment, larvae switched from feeding on aphids to feeding on eggs. Although the beneficial additive effect of mixed foods was detected in some treatments with limited diets, feeding on various combinations of eggs with aphids never resulted in higher survival, faster development, or a larger size of emerging adults than those observed for feeding on unlimited amounts of aphids. For the practice of biological control, we conclude that, if necessary (for example, in the case of temporary shortage or a lack of aphids in mass rearing facilities or in the case of preventing release of C. propinqua adults in greenhouses), C. propinqua larvae can be fed with grain moth eggs by replacing, mixing, or alternating with aphids, although this will inevitably result in a proportional decrease in pre-adult survival, rate of development, weight, and size of the emerging adults. On the other hand, even a minimal addition of aphids can have a substantial positive effect on larvae fed with grain moth eggs.

AB  - Simple Summary Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are well known for their beneficial role in different body systems and their function in mammals. The use of PUFA-omega 3 as a feed additive has been investigated with the aim of improving the reproductive and productive performance of different livestock species, but their effects on dairy sheep are scarcely documented. The present study demonstrated that in milking ewes, dietary supplementation of bypass linseed oil (LO; rich in alpha-linolenic acid/ALA) modified the lipidic metabolic status, increased milk PUFA composition, and the size of luteal tissue at the onset of maternal recognition of pregnancy (on day 11 after insemination). The present study showed that the use of a bypass LO supplementation during the periconceptional period did not increase the reproductive indexes in ewes. Nevertheless, dietary bypass LO modified the circulating concentrations of lipid metabolites and the milk fatty acid profile, demonstrating its absorption and utilization by body tissues. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the strategic supplementation of bypass LO can enhance reproductive indexes-fertility, lambing rate, and prolificacy-in dairy Sarda ewes at the end of lactation. To assess whether LO supplementation leads to the adsorptions of PUFAs and their subsequent utilization by the body tissues, milk composition and fatty acid content were analyzed. Forty-eight ewes were assigned to the following groups: the control group (CT; N = 24), fed with a control diet without LO; and the treatment group (LO; N = 24), fed with a diet supplemented with LO (10.8 g/ewe/day). Both diets had similar crude protein and energy levels and were offered for 38 days (-21 to +17 days after artificial insemination). The trial included an adaptation period (7 days) followed by a regular supplementation (31 days) period. Estrus synchronization was induced in all the ewes using an intravaginal sponge and equine chorionic gonadotropin. Fifty-five hours after pessaries withdrawal, all ewes were inseminated using the cervical route and fresh semen. Cholesterol (p < 0.01), high-density lipoprotein (p < 0.001), and triglyceride (p < 0.05) levels in plasma were higher in the LO group. Plasmatic levels of non-esterified fatty acids were lower in the LO group after the end of the supplementation period (p < 0.05). Milk unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), PUFAs omega 3 (PUFAs-omega 3) and 6 (PUFAs-omega 6), and trans fatty acids were higher in the LO group (p < 0.001), while saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were higher in the CT group during the supplementation period (p < 0.001). Three days after the end of the supplementation period, the content of milk UFAs (p < 0.05), PUFAs (p < 0.001), MUFAs, and PUFAs-omega 6 (p < 0.01) were still higher in the LO group. whereas SFA was higher in the CT group (p < 0.01). There was no difference between groups in terms of ovulation rate, progesterone levels in plasma, fertility rate, prolificacy, and total reproductive wastage. However, the total area of luteal tissue was higher in the LO group (p < 0.01). Results obtained demonstrated that LO supplementation exerts a positive role in corpus luteum size at the onset of the peri-implantation period in Sarda dairy ewes. Additionally, the results obtained in the present study showed that the use of dietary bypass LO affects lipid metabolites in plasma and milk fatty acid profiles, demonstrating the ALA uptake by body tissues.

AB  - Fat-tail sheep exhibit a unique trait whereby substantial adipose tissue accumulates in the tail, a phenotype that is advantageous in many agroecological environments. In this study, we conducted histological assays, transcriptome analysis and functional assays to examine morphogenesis, characterize gene expression, and elucidate mechanisms that regulate fat tail development. We obtained the microstructure of tail before and after fat deposition, and demonstrated that measurable fat deposition occurred by the 80-day embryo (E80) stage, earlier than other tissues. Transcriptome profiling revealed 1,058 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with six markedly different expression trends. GSEA enrichment and other downstream analyses showed important roles for genes and pathways involving in metabolism and that mitochondrial components were specifically overexpressed in the fat tail tissue of the 70-day embryo (E70). One hundred and eighty-three genes were further identified by leading edge gene analysis, among which, 17 genes have been reported in previous studies, including EEF1D, MTFP1, PPP1CA, PDGFD. Notably, the MTFP1 gene was highly correlated with the expression of other genes and with the highest enrichment score and gene expression change. Knockdown of MTFP1 in isolated adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) inhibited cell proliferation and migration ability, besides, promoted the process of adipogenesis in vitro.

AB  - High-density lipoproteins (HDL) undergo adverse remodeling and loss of function in the presence of comorbidities. We assessed the potential of lipid-lowering approaches (diet and rosuvastatin) to rescue hypercholesterolemia-induced HDL dysfunction. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in 32 pigs for 10 days. Then, they randomly received one of the 30-day interventions: (I) hypercholesterolemic (HC) diet; (II) HC diet + rosuvastatin; (III) normocholesterolemic (NC) diet; (IV) NC diet + rosuvastatin. We determined cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), antioxidant potential, HDL particle number, HDL apolipoprotein content, LDL oxidation, and lipid levels. Hypercholesterolemia time-dependently impaired HDL function (-62% CEC, -11% antioxidant index (AOI); p < 0.01), increased HDL particles numbers 2.8-fold (p < 0.0001), reduced HDL-bound APOM (-23%; p < 0.0001), and increased LDL oxidation 1.7-fold (p < 0.0001). These parameters remained unchanged in animals on HC diet alone up to day 40, while AOI deteriorated up to day 25 (-30%). The switch to NC diet reversed HDL dysfunction, restored apolipoprotein M content and particle numbers, and normalized cholesterol levels at day 40. Rosuvastatin improved HDL, AOI, and apolipoprotein M content. Apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein C-III remained unchanged. Lowering LDL-C levels with a low-fat diet rescues HDL CEC and antioxidant potential, while the addition of rosuvastatin enhances HDL antioxidant capacity in a pig model of hypercholesterolemia. Both strategies restore HDL-bound apolipoprotein M content.

AB  - Oocytes and embryos are highly sensitive to environmental stress in vivo and in vitro. During in vitro culture, many stressful conditions can affect embryo quality and viability, leading to adverse clinical outcomes such as abortion and congenital abnormalities. In this study, we found that valeric acid (VA) increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, decreased the level of reactive oxygen species that the mitochondria generate, and thus improved mitochondrial function during early embryonic development in pigs. VA decreased expression of the autophagy-related factors LC3B and BECLIN1. Interestingly, VA inhibited expression of autophagy-associated phosphorylation-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phosphorylation-UNC-51-like autophagy-activated kinase 1 (p-ULK1, Ser555), and ATG13, which reduced apoptosis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can signal through G-protein-coupled receptors on the cell membrane or enter the cell directly through transporters. We further show that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) was necessary for the effects of VA on embryo quality, which provides a new molecular perspective of the pathway by which SCFAs affect embryos. Importantly, VA significantly inhibited the AMPK-ULK1 autophagic signaling pathway through MCT1, decreased apoptosis, increased expression of embryonic pluripotency genes, and improved embryo quality.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology such as rest/activity and hormones are driven by an internal clock and persist in the absence of rhythmic environmental cues. However, the period and phase of the internal clock are entrained by the environmental light/dark cycle. Consequently, aberrant lighting conditions, which are increasing in modern society, have a strong impact on rhythmic body and brain functions. Mice were exposed to three different lighting conditions, 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (LD), constant darkness (DD), and constant light (LL), to study the effects of the light/dark cycle and aberrant lighting on the hippocampus, a critical structure for temporal and spatial memory formation and navigation. Locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone levels were analyzed as readouts for circadian rhythms. Spatial working memory via Y-maze, spine morphology of Golgi-Cox-stained hippocampi, and plasticity of excitatory synapses, measured by number and size of synaptopodin and GluR1-immunreactive clusters, were analyzed. Our results indicate that the light/dark cycle drives diurnal differences in synaptic plasticity in hippocampus. Moreover, spatial working memory, spine density, and size and number of synaptopodin and GluR1 clusters were reduced in LL, while corticosterone levels were increased. This indicates that acute constant light affects hippocampal function and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - We previously developed chicken interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mutants as single-dose adjuvants that induce protective immunity when co-administered with an avian vaccine. However, livestock such as pigs may require a vaccine adjuvant delivery system that provides long-lasting protection to reduce the need for successive booster doses. Therefore, we developed chitosan-coated alginate microparticles as a carrier for bovine serum albumin (BSA) or porcine IL-1 beta (pIL-1 beta) and assessed their physical, chemical, and biological properties. Electrospraying of the BSA-loaded alginate microparticles (BSA/ALG MPs) resulted in an encapsulation efficiency of 50%, and those MPs were then coated with chitosan (BSA/ALG/CHI MPs). Optical and scanning electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize these MPs. The BSA encapsulation parameters were applied to ALG/CHI MPs loaded with pIL-1 beta, which were not cytotoxic to porcine fibroblasts but had enhanced bio-activity over unencapsulated pIL-1 beta. The chitosan layer of the BSA/ALG/CHI MPs prevented burst release and facilitated sustained release of pIL-1 beta for at least 28 days. In conclusion, BSA/ALG/CHI MPs prepared as a carrier for pIL-1 beta may be used as an adjuvant for the formulation of pig vaccines.

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from goat blood using a modified Landesberg method. A PRP/calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) composite paste was then prepared by combining PRP with injectable CPC, whereby the platelet counts in PRP increased by about 5.9-fold compared to that in the whole blood. Additionally, the levels of PDGF-AB, TGF-beta, and VEGF in PRP were significantly higher than those in the whole blood. The new PRP/CPC composite exhibited significantly better injectability, initial setting time, final setting time, and washout resistance compared with CPC alone. A lumbar vertebral defect model was established in 18 Hainan indigenous male black goats via a retroperitoneal approach. Six lumbar vertebrae from each goat were randomized to three groups: a control group receiving normal saline, a CPC group using CPC paste alone, and a PRP/CPC group treated with the autologous PRP/CPC composite paste. The goats were maintained under standard feeding conditions postoperatively. Six goats were euthanized at 1, 3, and 6 months after operation to obtain vertebral specimens for assessment of vertebral strength and stiffness. Digital radiographical imaging at 6 months after operation showed that the vertebrae had normal growth and morphology in all groups. At 1, 3, and 6 months after operation, the vertebral strength and stiffness in PRP/CPC group were significantly greater than those in CPC-alone group. In addition, both vertebral strength and stiffness showed further improvement with the extension of postoperative recovery time. The PRP/CPC composite exhibited commendable rheological properties, and its application in repair of vertebral bone defects yielded favorable biomechanical properties. Furthermore, the new autologous PRP/CPC composite showed excellent biocompatibility and tissue repair capability and may prove to be a suitable candidate for repair of load-bearing bone defects, particularly those present in vertebrae.
   Impact Statement This study demonstrates that the platelet-rich plasma (PRP)/calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) composite prepared via CPC-PRP combination has a significantly prolonged setting time, enhanced injectability and washout resistance, and remarkable rheological properties. It exhibits superior biomechanical properties in repair of vertebral bone injuries by increasing vertebral strength and stiffness. This innovation provides a robust scientific foundation for the clinical application of the PRP/CPC composite in addressing load-bearing bone defects in critical anatomical regions such as the vertebrae.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite causing significant mortality in captive wildlife, especially marsupials. Historically, treatment has been unrewarding and no vaccine was available. An intranasal vaccine based on purified inactivated T. gondii was developed for toxoplasmosis prevention. A vaccination campaign started in early 2017 and was successful in preventing toxoplasma-related mortality in marsupials in many European and South American zoos. Amongst the vaccinated wallabies, about 30% were T. gondii seropositive before the vaccination, and no toxoplasma-related deaths were observed since the administration of the vaccine. The objective of this case study was to assess the potential effect of the vaccination on a seropositive wallaby. It is important to note that this vaccine doesn't induce any humoral response in sheep, and squirrel monkeys but induces a strong T-cell response. A T. gondii seropositive Yellow-footed rock wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus) from Copenhagen Zoo received two doses of the aforementioned intranasal vaccine. Blood samples were collected before each vaccination and used for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. The impact of the vaccination on the lymphocyte phenotype was characterized by flow cytometry. Cell size, represented by forward scatter, and granularity, represented by side scatter parameters were analyzed. Two doses of the vaccine induced a respective 30.1 and 25.6% increase in cell size and granularity in lymphocytes stimulated with T. gondii antigens, as assessed by flow cytometry. These changes were likely correlated with T-cell activation, which indicates that two doses of the vaccine might have boosted the already-existing T-cell memory response against T. gondii in a seropositive animal. No morphological changes were observed in lymphocytes from an unvaccinated seronegative wallaby. This is the first documented case of boosting an already-existing cellular immune response against toxoplasmosis by the vaccine in a seropositive Yellow-footed rock wallaby.

AB  - Background: Social stress factors in schizophrenia have long-term effects, but will only induce symptoms in a portion of individuals, even if exposed to identical stress.Methods: In the current experiment, we examined mice with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) injury to select for members of a "stress-susceptible group," and observed the changes in their behavior and the expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the amygdala and hippocampus.Results: We observed that after chronic social defeat stress, 72.6% of the 6-OHDA lesioned mice exhibited stress response to aggressors, compared to 52.3% of the blank control group. Both the 6-OHDA lesion + social defeat and social defeat groups exhibited anxiety and depression-like behavior. However, social cognitive impairment in the mice from the 6-OHDA lesion + social defeat group was more significant and the D1 expression levels in the amygdala were significantly decreased.Conclusion: These results suggest that the reason that adolescent mice with cortical injury were highly sensitive to defeat stress and had more prominent social cognitive impairment may be the decreased selectivity of D1 in the amygdala.

AB  - In a newborn pig cystic fibrosis (CF) model, the ability of gland-containing airways to fight infection was affected by at least two major host-defense defects: impaired mucociliary transport and a lower airway surface liquid (ASL) pH. In the gland-containing airways, the ASL pH is balanced by CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) and ATP12A, which, respectively, control HCO3- transport and proton secretion. We found that, although porcine small airway tissue expressed lower amounts of ATP12A, the ASL, of epithelial cultures from CF distal small airways (diameter < 200 mu m) were nevertheless more acidic (compared with non-CF airways). Therefore, we hypothesized that gland-containing airways and small airways control acidification using distinct mechanisms. Our microarray data suggested that small airway epithelia mediate proton secretion via ATP6V0D2, an isoform of the V0 d subunit of the H+-translocating plasma membrane V-type ATPase. Immunofluorescence of small airways verified the expression of the V0 d2 subunit isoform at the apical surface of Muc5B(+) secretory cells, but not ciliated cells. Inhibiting the V-type ATPase with bafilomycin A1 elevated the ASL pH of small airway cultures, in the presence or absence of HCO3-, and decreased ASL viscosity. These data suggest that, unlike large airways, which are acidified by ATP12A activity, small airways are acidified by V-type ATPase, thus identifying V-type ATPase as a novel therapeutic target for small airway diseases.

AB  - Prolonged consumption of diets high in saturated fat and sugar has been related to obesity and overweight, which in turn are linked to cognitive impairment in both humans and rodents. This has become a current issue, especially in children and adolescents, because these stages are crucial to neurodevelopmental processes and programming of adult behavior. To evaluate the effects of gestational and early exposure to an obesogenic diet, three groups with different dietary patterns were established: high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFS), standard diet (SD), and a dietary shift from a high-fat, high-sucrose diet to a standard diet after weaning (R). Spatial learning and behavioral flexibility in adult male and female Wistar rats were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) at PND 60. Furthermore, regional brain oxidative metabolism was assessed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Contrary to our hypothesis, the HFS diet groups showed similar performance on the spatial learning task as the other groups, although they showed impaired cognitive flexibility. The HFS group had increased brain metabolic capacity compared to that of animals fed the standard diet. Shifting from the HFS diet to the SD diet after weaning restored the brain metabolic capacity in both sexes to levels similar to those observed in animals fed the SD diet. In addition, animals in the R group performed similarly to those fed the SD diet in the Morris water maze in both tasks. However, dietary shift from HFS diet to standard diet after weaning had only moderate sex-dependent effects on body weight and fat distribution. In conclusion, switching from an HFS diet to a balanced diet after weaning would have beneficial effects on behavioral flexibility and brain metabolism, without significant sex differences.

AB  - Variations in disease resistance among pig breeds have been extensively documented, with Sertoli cells (SCs) playing a pivotal role in spermatogenesis. Infections can induce oxidative stress, which can lead to damage to these cells. This study aimed to compare the levels of oxidative stress in SCs from Rongchang and Landrace pig breeds following LPS challenge. SCs were isolated, cultured, and stimulated with LPS to assess cell viability and markers of oxidative stress. Cell viability was evaluated along with oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxide, malondialdehyde, and antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial function was assessed using JC-1 and Calcein AM probes. Transcriptomic analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) explored enriched pathways. IL20RA, identified through transcriptomics, was validated using the siRNA knockdown technique. The results showed that Rongchang SCs exhibited lower levels of oxidative stress compared to Landrace SCs along with higher activity of antioxidant enzymes. IL20RA emerged as a key regulator since its knockdown affected mitochondrial superoxide production and catalase secretion. The findings suggest that Rongchang SCs possess superior antioxidant capacity, possibly due to the IL20RA-mediated protection of mitochondria, thereby providing insights into breed-specific resistance against oxidative stress and highlighting the role of IL20RA in maintaining stem cell function.

AB  - Simple Summary Monitoring changes in the utilization of forages across rangelands can be time consuming and difficult with untrained personnel. The use of real time positioning for cattle is becoming commercially available with the improvements in technology. The objective of this case study was to identify the changes in livestock social associations and spatial location at two stocking densities throughout a six-week grazing period. Both pastures used similar sized herds with 35 and 29 animals tracked with global positioning systems set at 30-min intervals. A half-weight index value was calculated for each pair of tracked cattle to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Throughout the study, forage utilization increased from 5 to 24% and from 10% to 20% and forage mass decreased from 2601 kg ha(-1) to 1828 kg ha(-1) and 2343 kg ha(-1) to 1904 kg ha(-1), in the high stocking density pasture and low stocking density pasture, respectively. Utilization of forages throughout the trial forced cattle to disperse and travel further from water sources to find new feeds. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association, identify when cows disperse, and improve recognition for the need of pasture rotation to avoid rangeland degradation. Proper grazing management of arid and semi-arid rangelands requires experienced personnel and monitoring. Applications of GPS tracking and sensor technologies could help ranchers identify livestock well-being and grazing management issues so that they can promptly respond. The objective of this case study was to evaluate temporal changes in cattle association patterns using global positioning system (GPS) tracking in pastures with different stocking densities (low stocking density [LSD] = 0.123 animals ha(-1), high stocking density [HSD] = 0.417 animals ha(-1)) at a ranch near Prescott, Arizona. Both pastures contained similar herd sizes (135 and 130 cows, respectively). A total of 32 cows in the HSD herd and 29 cows in the LSD herd were tracked using GPS collars at location fixes of 30 min during a 6-week trial in the summer of 2019. A half-weight index (HWI) value was calculated for each pair of GPS-tracked cattle (i.e., dyads) to determine the proportion of time that cattle were within 75 m and 500 m of each other. Forage mass of both pastures were relatively similar at the beginning of the study and forage utilization increased from 5 to 24% in the HSD pasture and increased from 10 to 20% in the LSD pasture. Cattle in both pastures exhibited relatively low mean association values (HWI < 0.25) at both spatial scales. Near the end of the study, cattle began to disperse likely in search of forages (p < 0.01) and travelled farther (p < 0.01) from water than during earlier periods. Real-time GPS tracking has the potential to remotely detect changes in animal spatial association (e.g., HWI), and identify when cows disperse, likely searching for forage.

AB  - One of the principal problems in swine production is neonatal mortality, especially in primiparous sows. Caffeine has been shown to be an efficacious neonatal stimulant that reduces mortality while improving key metabolic indicators associated with hypoxic processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of inducing parturition with a full dose (FD) (175 mu g) or split dose (SD) (87.5 + 87.5 mu g) of cloprostenol (PGF2 alpha), with and without the administration of a single dose of caffeine (420 mg), on the vitality, clinical status, surface temperature, and weight at weaning of neonate pigs. In this experiment, the duration of farrowing was affected by the induction technique, as the PGF2 alpha SD and PGF2 alpha SD + caffeine treatment groups reduced this time by as much as 100 min compared to PGF2 alpha FD and PGF2 alpha FD + caffeine. The groups that received caffeine presented the best values for the indicators of the neonate performance, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), glucose, surface temperature at 24 h, and weight at 21 days, especially the PGF2 alpha SD + caffeine group. PGF2 alpha FD had the lowest neonate performance and metabolic variables. Inducing birth with PGF2 alpha SD is more efficient, and adding caffeine improves the performance and metabolic variables of piglets born from primiparous sows.

AB  - Lithium -nickel -manganese -cobalt -oxides (NMC) embedded in solid -electrolytes are being extensively applied as composite cathodes to match the high energy density of metallic anodes. During charge/discharge, the cathode composite often degrades through the evolution of micro -cracks within the grains, along the grain boundaries, and delamination at the particle -electrolyte interface. Experimental evidence has shown that regulating the morphology of grains and their crystallographic orientations is an effective way to relieve the volume -expansion -induced stresses and cracks, consequently stabilizing the electrochemical performance of the electrode. However, the interplay among the crystal orientation, grain morphology, and chemo-mechanical behavior has not been holistically studied. In that context, a thermodynamically consistent computational framework is developed to understand the role of microstructural modulation on the chemo-mechanical interactions of a polycrystalline NMC secondary particle embedded in a sulfide -based solid electrolyte. A phase -field fracture variable is employed to consider the initiation and propagation of cracks. A set of diffused phase -field parameters is adopted to define the transition of chemo-mechanical properties between the grains, grain boundaries, electrolyte, and particle -electrolyte interfaces. This modeling framework is implemented in the open -source finite element package MOOSE to solve three state variables: concentration, displacement, and phase -field damage parameter. A systematic parametric study is performed to explore the effects of aspect ratio, the crystal orientation of grains, and the interfacial fracture energy through the chemo-mechanical analysis of the composite electrode. The findings of this study offer predictive insights for designing solid-state batteries that provide stable performance with reduced fracture evolution.

AB  - Mountain dairy products are recognised as high-quality food but there are still few studies concerning the effects of seasonality and herd management on the profile of bioactive compounds in cheeses. This study was planned to assess the effect of season (summer versus winter) and feeding management (pasture versus integration) on fatty acids (FAs) profile, anti-hypertensive (ACE-IA) and anti-oxidant properties (ABTS-SA, FRAP), total thiol (SH) and phenolic (TP) contents of cheeses from two dairy cow farms (Farm A and Farm B) located in Piedmontese Alps (Italy). Cheese samples collected in the farms were submitted to an integrated analytical approach and the results were processed by full factorial ANOVA and PCA. The trends observed from the FAs profile confirmed the beneficial influence of supplying fresh forage to lactating cows. The ACE-IA was higher in summer than in winter cheese but depended upon the farm factor. Among the indicators of antioxidant activity, only the ABTS-SA was affected by the season, even though with significant differences between the farms. The TP content did not show any clear pattern, but it was higher than the values described in the literature. The PCA of all the data showed that several FAs and the ABTS-SA gave relevant contributions to clearly group the cheese samples according to the production season or farm. In conclusion, alpine cheese exhibited high nutritional quality under the consumers' health standpoint, and the identification of the healthier summer cheeses for traceability or labelling purposes, can be obtained.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which leads to motor and non -motor symptoms (NMS). NMS can appear many years before the classical motor symptoms and are associated with the neurodegeneration of several nuclei; in this work, we highlight the neurodegeneration of Locus coeruleus (LC) in PD. The aim was to investigate the effects of depleting SNpc and LC catecholaminergic neurons on behavioral and neurobiological endpoints. Here we used 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to induced neurotoxic damage in three independent experimental groups: SNpc lesion group, which 6-OHDA was injected into CPu (CPu-6-OHDA), LC lesion group, which 6-OHDA was injected directly on LC to selectively caused a damage on this nucleus (LC-6-OHDA), and the combined SNpc and LC lesion group (CL-6-OHDA). Next, the behavioral studies were performed using the Morris water maze (MWM), open field (OF), and elevated plus maze (EPM). After stereotaxic surgeries, the animals showed a loss of 67% and 77% of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) reactive neurons in the SNpc and LC, respectively. The behavioral analysis showed the anxiety -like behavior in CL-6-OHDA group in the EPM test; in the MWM test, the combined lesions (CL-6-OHDA) showed an impairment in memory acquisition and spatial memory; and no changes were observed in locomotor activity in all the tests. Furthermore, our investigation demonstrating the effects of depleting SN and LC catecholaminergic neurons on behavioral and neurobiological parameters. All these data together lead us to believe that a bilateral PD model including a LC bilateral degeneration is potentially a more accurate model to evaluate the NMS in the pathological development of the disease in rodents.

AB  - Recently, increasing attention has been paid to sheep milk products, which are high in saturated fatty acids (SFA), and the extent of their impact on human health. This study aimed to identify SNPs for PI, PIII, and Exon 53 in the ACACa gene and their association with the MC and FA profiles in Najdi sheep milk. A total of 76 multiparous Najdi ewes were used, and they were maintained using the same feeding system. Milk and blood samples were collected during the first lactation. A genetic polymorphism analysis identified 20 SNPs: 4 SNPs on PI, 6 SNPs on PIII, and 10 SNPs on Exon 53. In PI, the SNP g.4412G > A was associated (p < 0.05) with palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1 n-7) and linoleic acid (LA), while SNP g.4485C > G was associated with CLA and vaccenic acid (VA) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in PIII, two SNPs (g.1168A > G and g.1331G > T) were associated with milk protein (p < 0.05), while the SNP g.6860G > C in Exon 53 was associated with milk fat (p < 0.05). SNPs in the Najdi breed have been shown to be strongly related to milk fat and EFA contents. This could support a genetic selection program and the control of milk traits in the Najdi breed of high-quality dairy sheep.

TI  - Pharmaceuticalised livelihoods: antibiotics and the rise of 'Quick Farming' in peri-urban Uganda

AB  - The 'livestock revolution' has seen the lives and livelihoods of peri-urban peoples increasingly intertwine with pigs and poultry across Africa in response to a rising demand for meat protein. This 'revolution' heralds the potential to address both poverty and nutritional needs. However, the intensification of farming has sparked concern, including for antibiotic misuse and its consequences for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These changes reflect a micro-biopolitical conundrum where the agendas of microbes, farmers, publics, authorities and transnational agencies are in tension. To understand this requires close attention to the practices, principles and potentials held between these actors. Ethnographic research took place in a peri-urban district, Wakiso, in Uganda between May 2018 and March 2021. This included a medicine survey at 115 small- and medium-scale pig and poultry farms, 18 weeks of participant observation at six farms, 34 in-depth interviews with farmers and others in the local livestock sector, four group discussions with 38 farmers and 7 veterinary officers, and analysis of archival, media and policy documents. Wide-scale adoption of quick farming was found, an entrepreneurial phenomenon that sees Ugandans raising 'exotic' livestock with imported methods and measures for production, including antibiotics for immediate therapy, prevention of infections and to promote production and protection of livelihoods. This assemblage - a promissory assemblage of the peri-urban - reinforced precarity against which antibiotics formed a potential layer of protection. The paper argues that to address antibiotic use as a driver of AMR is to address precarity as a driver of antibiotic use. Reduced reliance on antibiotics required a level of biosecurity and economies of scale in purchasing insurance that appeared affordable only by larger-scale commercial producers. This study illustrates the risks - to finances, development and health - of expanding an entrepreneurial model of protein production in populations vulnerable to climate, infection and market dynamics.

AB  - Simple Summary The petroleum industry is a major source of energy and economic development but can pollute the environment and negatively impact animal and human health. Heavy metals are environmental pollutants and can reach the human body in direct and indirect ways. We investigated the levels of heavy metals in the soil and in the milk, blood, muscle, liver, and kidney of Arabian camels living near a petroleum industry site in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Our results revealed increased lead levels, cadmium, nickel, and vanadium in the soil and different tissues of camels. In addition, liver and kidney dysfunction, tissue damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were reported. These findings may be of public interest and call attention to the assessment of the impact of the petroleum industry on the environment and the health of nearby communities. The petroleum industry can impact the environment and human health. Heavy metals (HMs), including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and vanadium (V), are toxic pollutants found in petroleum that can cause several severe diseases. This study investigated the impact of the oil industry on the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, pointing to HMs accumulation, tissue injury, redox imbalance, inflammation, and apoptosis. Soil and camel samples (milk, blood, muscle, liver, and kidney) were collected from a site near an oil industry field and another two sites to analyze HMs. Pb, Cd, Ni, and V were increased in the soil and in the camel's milk, blood, muscle, liver, and kidney at the polluted site. Serum aminotransferases, urea, and creatinine were elevated, and histopathological alterations were observed in the liver and kidney of camels at the oil industry site. Hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, Bax, and caspase-3 were increased, whereas cellular antioxidants and Bcl-2 declined in camels at the oil extraction site. In conclusion, the oil industry caused soil and tissue accumulation of HMs, liver and kidney injury, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in camels living close to the oil extraction site. These findings pinpoint the negative impact of the oil industry on the environment, animal, and human health.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a typical environmental endocrine disruptor. Its main metabolite mono(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is highly reactive and toxic that plays a major role in metabolizing. Metastasisassociated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is one of Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which has a significant part in regulating synapse formation and maintenance. In this study, the extracted primary hippocampal neurons were used as the research object, and the MEHP exposure model was established. The optical microscope, immunofluorescence experiment and immunocytochemistry experiment were used to take pictures to analyze the changes in dendritic length, dendritic spines and synaptic density. PCR experiments were used to detect the expression of lncRNA MALAT1, mRNA cAMP response element bind protein (CREB), Postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), and Neuroligin1 (NLGN1). And, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and negative control (NC) transfection were used to established MALAT1 knock down model of primary hippocampal neurons to analyze changes in synaptic density and the underlying mechanisms. Results indicated that exposure to MEHP reduced dendritic length, the density of dendritic spines and synapses density of primary hippocampal neurons. It also altered lncRNA MALAT1 and reduced mRNA CREB, PSD95, NLGN1 expressions. After knocking down MALAT1, the damages of dendrites and synapses as well as the down-regulating of CREB/PSD95 caused by MEHP were restored in neurons. These results suggested that MEHP exposure could decrease the dendritic length, dendritic spine and synapse density of hippocampal neurons and impair hippocampal synapses, which might be attributed to down-regulated CREB/PSD95 induced by alterated lncRNA MALAT1.

AB  - The role of fertilizers in increasing nutritional content and making host plants more attractive to herbivores has been repeatedly proved. This study investigated the effect of applying three levels of nano-chelated fertilizer (vegetables and summer crops specific fertilizer) (2, 3, and 4 kg/ha) on the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT), ascorbic acid (ASA), flavonoid, and phenolic compounds in cucumber plant (Cucumis sativus L.). Additionally, the research surveyed the influence of fertilization and cucumber metabolite compounds on the life history of Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) in a tri-trophic context. Host plant content analysis showed that biotic stress resulting from the aphid infestation in cucumber plants increased the POD, PPO, CAT activity, and MDA contents. However, it decreased PAL activity, flavonoid, and phenol contents in the control treatment and 2, 3, and 4 kg/ha of nano-chelated fertilizer levels. Moreover, plant fertilization increased the herbivore population growth rates and decreased the predator population growth rates by affecting the nutritional contents and quality of the host plant. Accordingly, the aphid's intrinsic rate of increase (r) was ranged from 0.319 to 0.365 day-1. While finite rate of increase (lambda) was estimated as 1.376 to 1.441 day(-1) on control to 2 kg/ha nano-chelated fertilizer treatment. In addition, the intrinsic rate of increase of C. carnea was 0.116 to 0.131 and the finite rate of increase was 1.123 to 1.139 day(-1) on 2 kg/ha nano-chelated fertilizer and control treatments, respectively. The maximum and minimum net reproductive rate (R0) values of the aphid were recorded on 3 kg/ha nano-chelated fertilizer and control treatments as 46.34 and 37.18 offsprings, respectively, whilst these values ranged from 145.51 on 2 kg/ha to 196.93 offsprings on 4 kg/ha regimes for the green lacewing. Notably, the utilization of 2, 3, and 4 kg/ha of nano-chelated fertilizer promotes cucumber defensive metabolites compounds such as PAL, POD, CAT, flavonoid, and ASA and induces the plant's resistance to melon aphids directly. It can be concluded that the utilization of nano-chelated fertilizer potentially can enhance cucumber plant resistance to A. gossypii by improving the antioxidant metabolite compounds, and be an effective part of integrated pest management programs.

AB  - In mammals, the melatonin (Mel) concentration in the gastrointestinal tract is 400 times greater than in the pineal gland. However, the origin of Mel in the gastrointestinal tract and its role in reproductive regulation remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed three potential Mel sources (feed, microorganisms, and the rumen wall) for their contribution to high Mel levels in the rumen and their biological effects. The feed contained high Mel concentrations, and Mel in rumen fluid and blood peaked two hours after feeding. Rumen microbial analysis showed a strong positive correlation between Mel and specific microbes, including Megasphaera, Butyrivibrio, Acetobacter, and Olsenella. In vitro experiments indicated that rumen microorganisms synthesized Mel from tryptophan. The rumen wall also contains key enzymes, AANAT and HIOMT, which catalyze Mel synthesis and membrane receptors MT1 and MT2 that mediate the function of Mel, suggesting that the rumen wall synthesizes Mel. Mel peaked in both rumen fluid and blood two hours after feeding. Feeding also altered blood levels of Mel, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P4), and Estradiol (E2), with a correlation between Mel and fluctuations in GnRH, LH, P4, and E2 levels. Our findings suggest that feed is the primary source of high Mel levels in the rumen and impacts reproductive hormone fluctuations. This study elucidates the origin of high rumen Mel concentrations and reveals that food intake affects the natural secretion of various hormones, offering a new perspective on food sources for regulating reproductive physiology.

AB  - Toxorhynchites mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), also known as elephant mosquitoes or mosquito eaters, are the largest mosquitoes globally and do not bite humans but prey on other mosquito larvae. We used a dipping and pipetting methods to collect larvae of Toxorhynchites spp. and Aedes mosquitoes from discarded tires. In a laboratory study, we investigated how container type, water volume, and depth affect the predation behavior of Toxorhynchites spp., and we also examined its predation efficiency during both day and night. Our research revealed that an individual Toxorhynchites spp. larva can consume up to 45 Aedes larvae, with mean predation of 25.18 (+/- 9.35) larvae in 24 h. Interestingly, predation rates and impacts remained consistent regardless of container type, water volume, or depth. While predation was more active during the day, there were no significant differences between daytime and nighttime predation abilities. These findings highlight Toxorhynchites spp. larvae as a promising biological control agent for mosquito management in various settings, independent of seasonal or light conditions, especially for the Aedes spp.

AB  - Grasses hosting Epichloe endophytes are protected against herbivores due to the production of various fungal alkaloids. Previous research has found that high foliar phosphorus concentrations reduce the level of the alkaloid ergovaline, thereby reducing the endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance. Yet, the impact of phosphorus on ergovaline biosynthesis versus its influence on endophyte growth and synthesis of other fungal alkaloids remains unresolved. Our objective was to elucidate these relationships. We grew endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic Festuca arundinacea plants and fertilised them with different doses of phosphorus. Later, half of the plants from each treatment were challenged with larvae of the generalist chewing insect Spodoptera frugiperda. We assessed the relationships between foliar phosphorus levels, fungal mycelium and alkaloid concentrations, as well as their impacts on larvae performance, herbivore-caused damage and plant biomass.<br /> Endophyte mycelial biomass in plant tissue was found to be independent of foliar phosphorus concentration. The alkaloids lolines and peramine showed a linear relationship with mycelial biomass but no correlation with foliar phosphorus. Surprisingly, high ergovaline concentrations were positively associated with an interaction between endophyte mycelial biomass and foliar phosphorus concentration. Although herbivory increased loline concentration, only high concentrations of ergovaline and peramine were related to reduced S. frugiperda larvae weight gain. However, endophyte presence did not reduce herbivory damage on plants.<br /> Contrary to expectation, we did not find a negative but a positive association between concentrations of foliar phosphorus and ergovaline alkaloid, through its interaction with endophyte mycelial biomass. Alternatively, our findings suggest that phosphorus plays a crucial role in modulating the Epichlo & euml;-mediated defensive mutualism, primarily through its effects on ergovaline rather than on endophyte concentration or production of other alkaloids.

AB  - This study investigated concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3, and air quality index (AQI) values across 368 cities in mainland China during 2015-2018. The study further examined relationships of air pollution status with local industrial capacities and vehicle possessions. Strong correlations were found between industrial capacities (coal, pig iron, crude steel and rolled steel) and air pollution levels. Although statistical and significant reductions of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and AQI values were observed in response to various laws and regulations in industrial sectors, both particle and gaseous pollutants still had annual average concentrations above recommended limits. In order to further reduce air pollution, more efforts can be done to control traffic emissions caused by minicars and heavy trucks, which was revealed after investigating 16 vehicle types. This was also consistent with the apparent air quality improvement during the COVID-19 lockdown period in China in 2020, despite industrial operations being still active at full capacities.

AB  - This study describes a left hemihepatectomy combined with a right lateral hepatic lobectomy. It compares the inflammatory response associated with laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH group, n = 7) with conventional open hepatectomy (OH group, n = 7). Blood was collected before surgery as well as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after surgery to determine the white blood cell count and levels of serum cortisol (COR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The left hemihepatectomy combined with a right lateral hepatic lobectomy was completed in miniature pigs. The average operative time was 139.00 +/- 9.07 min, which was longer than that in the OH group (121.67 +/- 3.02 min). The length of surgical incision associated with the OH group was 17.93 +/- 1.09 cm, significantly longer than that related to the LH group (5.10 +/- 0.17 cm). The estimated mean blood loss in the LH group was 136.43 +/- 63.24 mL, which was significantly lower than that in the OH group. No severe complications (e.g., massive bleeding, bile leakage, and air embolism) were reported. The CRP levels, COR, and IL-6, increased significantly in the OH group and then slowly returned to their preoperative levels. A postoperative laparoscopic exploration revealed that the incised portion of the liver adhered to the omentum, but no additional abnormalities were observed. These findings indicate that a 4-trocar method for laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy combined with a right lateral hepatic lobectomy is safe and feasible. The inflammatory response for those receiving LH are lower than that for those receiving OH. This porcine model can be used as a research analog for liver disease and regeneration.

AB  - This experiment aimed to determine how Cd exposure impacts CD4 cell activation, macrophage cells, pinocytosis activity, metallothionine expression, and Cd levels in juvenile Gambusia affinis gills. Four treatment groups were used, with one control and treatments A, B, C, and D at dosages of 0.03 mg/L, 0.023 mg/L, 0.015 mg/L, and 0.008 mg/L, respectively. The results showed that the number of CD4 with CD8 cell markers differed significantly from each treatment compared to the control (0.33%). The value in A, namely 0.54%, was the highest, followed by B, C, and D of 0.46%, 0.44%, and 0.42%, respectively. The number of macrophages increased as the Cd level of the medium increased, as did the activity of pinocytosis. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence test on the gills with the Anti-MT Mouse and goat IgG fluoresce in Rhodamine on the gills showed that luminescence increased with increasing Cd levels in the gills. Similarly, the MT intensity increased at Cd-exposed gills as compared to the control. As the Cd level in the gills increased, the MT levels ascended significantly. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study used 40 castrated male pigs to determine the protective effects of a new selenium molecule (hydroxy selenomethionine, OH-SeMet) on dietary oxidative stress (DOS) induced hepatic lipid metabolism disorder, and corresponding response of selenotranscriptome. The pigs were randomly grouped into 5 dietary treatments and fed a basal diet formulated with either normal corn and oils or oxidized diet in which the normal corn and oils were replaced by aged corn and oxidized oils, and supplemented with OH-SeMet at 0.0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mg Se/kg for a period of 16 weeks (n = 8). The results showed that DOS induced liver damage, increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, decreased serum triacylglycerol (TG) level, suppressed antioxidant capacity in the liver, and changed lipid metabolism enzyme activity, thus causing lipid metabolism disorder in the liver. The DOS-induced lipid metabolism disorder was accompanied with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, changes in lipid metabolism-related genes and selenotranscriptome in the liver. Dietary Se supplementation partially alleviated the negative impact of DOS on the lipid metabolism. These improvements were accompanied by increases in Se concentration, liver index, anti-oxidative capacity, selenotranscriptome especially 11 selenoprotein-encoding genes, and protein abundance of GPX1, GPX4 and SelS in the liver, as well as the decrease in SelF abundance. The Se supplementation also alleviated ER stress, restored liver lipid metabolism enzyme activity, increased the mRNA expression of lipid synthesis-related genes, and decreased the mRNA levels of lipidolysis-related genes. In conclusion, the dietary Se supplementation restored antioxidant capacity and mitigated ER stress induced by DOS, thus resisting hepatic lipid metabolism disorders that are associated with regulation of selenotranscriptome.

AB  - NUDT3 is a leading candidate gene that strongly linked to pig fatness traits, however, its function in porcine adipocytes remains poorly understood. Here, the percentage of EdU+ cells was significantly reduced when NUDT3 was knocked down, as was the expression of cell cycle repressors. NUDT3 overexpression yielded the opposite outcome. Moreover, the knockdown of NUDT3 resulted in more lipid droplets in adipocytes, whereas its enforced expression had the reverse effect. In addition, exogenous expression of NUDT3 in adipose tissue significantly reduced fat expansion triggered by a high-fat diet in mice. At molecular level, integrative RIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes influenced by NUDT3 overexpression or knockdown were significantly enriched in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and western blot confirmed that AKT phosphorylation was significantly increased by NUDT3 knockdown, while the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR were significantly decreased by the enforced NUDT3 expression both ex vivo and in vivo. Notably, rs694899689 was identified as a potential genetic variant for modulates NUDT3 expression and impacting backfat thickness in pigs through analysis of multi-omics data, CRISPRi (CRISPR interference) and dual luciferase reporter assays. Overall, our work established NUDT3 as a novel negative regulator of adipogenesis and lipid deposition and revealed that rs694899689 might serve as a potential molecular marker for pig breeding.

AB  - IntroductionType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with cognitive impairment has a high incidence rate globally, and there is a need to investigate the relationship among the glymphatic system, hippocampus microstructure, and cognition in T2DM. The present study aims to delineate changes in the perivascular space index (ALPS-index) among T2DM patients with different cognitive states and investigate any possible correlation between the ALPS-index and the diffusive indicators of the bilateral hippocampi in T2DM. In addition, we seek to identify specific cognitive domains with substantial correlation with the ALPS-index in the general population.MethodsA total of 113 participants were recruited, comprising 37 T2DM patients with normal cognitive function (DMNC), 39 T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment (DMMCI), and 37 healthy controls (HC). Clinical information, neuropsychological assessments, and experienced multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scans were recorded from all the participants. A noninvasive method was applied to obtain all ALPS-index measures, such as the left, right, and average ALPS-index, along with diffusive indicators of the bilateral hippocampi, comprising fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD).ResultsA statistically marginal difference in the average ALPS-index was noted among HC, DMNC, and DMMCI groups. According to binary logistic regression analysis results, the average ALPS-index significantly altered the cognitive function in T2DM. Partial correlation analyses revealed a positive association between the average ALPS-index and FA, as well as a negative association with MD and RD in the bilateral hippocampi of the T2DM groups. In the general population, partial correlation analysis indicated that the average ALPS-index correlated with the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) immediate recall scores.ConclusionIn summary, our findings demonstrated that glymphatic system function in the brain progressively deteriorates with worsening cognitive impairment among T2DM patients. Moreover, T2DM significantly disrupts the relationship patterns between the glymphatic system and bilateral hippocampal microstructure. Thus, the mean ALPS-index may act as a novel neuroimaging biomarker for assessing cognitive function in T2DM.

AB  - Several species of drywood termites, subterranean termites, and fungus-growing termites cause extensive economic losses annually worldwide. Because no universal method is available for controlling all termites, correct species identification is crucial for termite management. Despite deep neural network technologies' promising performance in pest recognition, a method for automatic termite recognition remains lacking. To develop an automated deep learning classifier for termite image recognition suitable for mobile applications, we used smartphones to acquire 18,000 original images each of four termite pest species: Kalotermitidae: Cryptotermes domesticus (Haviland); Rhinotermitidae: Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Reticulitermes flayiceps (Oshima); andTermitidae: Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki). Each original image included multiple individuals, and we applied five image segmentation techniques for capturing individual termites. We used 24,000 individual-termite images (4 species x 2 castes x 3 groups x 1,000 images) for model development and testing. We implemented a termite classification system by using a deep learning-based model, MobileNetV2. Our models achieved high accuracy scores of 0.947, 0.946, and 0.929 for identifying soldiers, workers, and both castes, respectively, which is not significantly different from human expert performance. We further applied image augmentation techniques, including geometrical transformations and intensity transformations, to individual-termite images. The results revealed that the same classification accuracy can be achieved by using 1,000 augmented images derived from only 200 individual-termite images, thus facilitating further model development on the basis of many fewer original images. Our image-based identification system can enable the selection of termite control tools for pest management professionals or homeowners.

AB  - Background: Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic mycosis in the United States, typically affecting immunocompromised individuals. Diagnosis of histoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients is rare, particularly among young infants, with only a few cases reported. Case presentation: We present a 4-month-old female with a history of prematurity who initially presented with 11 days of fever. She visited her local emergency department, where she was diagnosed with Rhino/ enterovirus bronchiolitis. Pancytopenia was noted at that time, attributed to viral bone marrow suppression. Persistent fever and pancytopenia led to her transfer to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On admission, she exhibited hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, elevated procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Additionally, T cell deficiency was observed. Initially, there was concern for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; however, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate confirmed T cell deficiency. As fever persisted on day 19, further investigations were conducted, including a positive beta-D-glucan assay. Subsequent urine and serum Histoplasma antigen tests were positive, with metagenomic sequencing confirming the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Treatment comprised one week of amphotericin B followed by three months of oral itraconazole. Resolution of fever, pancytopenia, T cell deficiency, and hepatosplenomegaly occurred, and the patient has shown no signs of recurrence to date. Conclusions: This case serves as a reminder to clinicians regarding the necessity of considering disseminated histoplasmosis in young infants who present with fever of unknown origin, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly, despite its rarity. Failure to do so can lead to fatal outcomes. (c) 2025 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of SFMM.

AB  - Pestiviruses, including classical swine fever virus, remain a concern for global animal health and are responsible for major economic losses of livestock worldwide. Despite high levels of vaccination, currently available commercial vaccines are limited by safety concerns, moderate efficacy, and required high doses. The development of new vaccines is therefore essential. Vaccine efforts should focus on optimizing antigen presentation to enhance immune responses. Here, we describe a simple herringbone-dimer strategy for efficient vaccine design, using the classical swine fever virus E2 expressed in a rice endosperm as an example. The expression of rE2 protein was identified, with the rE2 antigen accumulating to 480 mg/kg. Immunological assays in mice, rabbits, and pigs showed high antigenicity of rE2. Two immunizations with 284 ng of the rE2 vaccine or one shot with 5.12 lg provided effective protection in pigs without interference from pre-existing antibodies. Crystal structure and small-angle X-ray scattering results confirmed the stable herringbone dimeric conformation, which had two fully exposed duplex receptor binding domains. Our results demonstrated that rice endosperm is a promising platform for precise vaccine design, and this strategy can be universally applied to other Flaviviridae virus vaccines.

AB  - Neuropeptide B (NPB) affects energy homeostasis and metabolism by binding and activating NPBWR1 and NPBWR2 in humans and pigs. Recently, we reported that NPB promotes the adipogenesis of rat white and brown preadipocytes as well as 3T3-L1 cells. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of NPB on the proliferation and differentiation of white porcine preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. We identified the presence of NPB, NPBWR1, and NPBWR2 on the mRNA and protein levels in porcine white preadipocytes. During the differentiation process, NPB increased the mRNA expression of PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta, C/EBP alpha, PPAR gamma, and C/EBP beta protein production in porcine preadipocytes. Furthermore, NPB stimulated lipid accumulation in porcine preadipocytes. Moreover, NPB promoted the phosphorylation of the p38 kinase in porcine preadipocytes, but failed to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. NPB failed to stimulate the expression of C/EBP beta in the presence of the p38 inhibitor. Taken together, we report that NPB promotes the differentiation of porcine preadipocytes via a p38-dependent mechanism.

AB  - The timing of puberty onset is reliant on increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This elicits a corresponding increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) due to a lessening of sensitivity to the inhibitory actions of estradiol (E-2). The mechanisms underlying the increase in GnRH release likely involve a subset of neurons within the arcuate (ARC) nucleus of the hypothalamus that contain kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin (KNDy neurons). We aimed to determine if KNDy neurons in female sheep are critical for: timely puberty onset; the LH surge; and the response to an intravenous injection of the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) agonist, senktide. Prepubertal ewes received injections aimed at the ARC containing blank-saporin (control, n = 5) or NK3-saporin (NK3-SAP, n = 6) to ablate neurons expressing NK3R. Blood samples taken 3/week for 65 days following surgery were assessed for progesterone to determine onset of puberty. Control ewes exhibited onset of puberty at 33.2 +/- 3.9 days post sampling initiation, whereas 5/6 NK3-SAP treated ewes didn't display an increase in progesterone. After an artificial LH surge protocol, surge amplitude was lower in NK3-SAP ewes. Finally, ewes were treated with senktide to determine if an LH response was elicited. LH pulses were evident in both groups in the absence of injections, but the response to senktide vs saline was similar between groups. These results show that KNDy cells are necessary for timely puberty onset and for full expresson of the LH surge. The occurrence of LH pulses in NK3-SAP treated ewes may indicate a recovery from an apulsatile state.

AB  - Widespread use of the pyrethroid insecticide beta-cypermethrin (beta-CYP) has led to adverse effects on nontarget populations within agroecosystems. Despite the efficacy of beta-CYP in pest control, its toxicological and defense mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we explored the toxicological effects, antioxidant mechanisms and immune response against beta-CYP using Drosophila melanogaster, a wellestablished model organism for the study of insect biology, to represent the broader class of nontarget organisms. We exposed Drosophila larvae to 0.667 mu g/mL beta-CYP and revealed that delayed development and caused intestinal epithelial damage in larvae. To gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of these effects, RNA sequencing analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation were performed. These analyses revealed that the messenger RNA levels of glutathione S-transferase were increased, third instar larvae exhibited an increase in reactive oxygen species content and a corresponding increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in response to beta-CYP exposure, indicating an upregulated response to oxidative stress. Beta-CYP also activated Hippo pathway to resist apoptosis and promote cell proliferation. Moreover, beta-CYP induced melanization and Toll immune pathways involved in immune response in Drosophila larvae, specifically the Toll pathway gene Drs. This activation suggests that Drosophila increases antioxidant defenses and promotes mitosis in damaged tissues as compensatory mechanisms to mitigate the cytotoxic effects of beta-CYP. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of beta-CYP-induced toxicity and the defense mechanisms in insects; they may also inform strategies for the sustainable use of insecticides and the development of mitigation measures to protect nontarget species in agroecosystems.

AB  - High-solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD), as an emerging disposal technology for swine manure, was commonly hampered by the long lag phase and slow startup, resulting in poor performance. Rapid startups by different leachate reflux forms can solve the problem, but related study was scarcely reported. Therefore, metagenomic analysis was used to exploit the effects of different rapid startups on the biogas performance, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) removal and microbial metabolic pathway during HSAD. Compared anaerobic digestion with natural start (T1), three different rapid startups were set, including with autologous leachate reflux (T2), with water reflux (T3) and with exogenous leachate reflux (T4). The results showed that rapid startups (T2-T4) enhanced biogas yield and the cumulative methane yield was increased by 3.7-7.3 times compared with the control. Totally, 922 ARGs were found, most of which belonged to multidrug and MLS ARGs. About 56% of these ARGs could be reduced in T4, while just 32% of ARGs were reduced in T1. Antibiotic efflux pump is the main mechanism of microbial action, which could be decreased largely by these treatments. Moreover, all the rapid startups (T2-T4) made Methanosarcina content (9.59%-75.91%) higher than that in the natural startup of T1 (4.54%-40.27%). This is why these fast-startups helped methane production fast. Network analysis showed that microbial community and environmental factors (pH and VFAs) both contributed to the spread of ARGs. The reconstructed methane metabolic pathway by different identified genes showed that all methanogenesis pathways existed but acetate metabolic pathway was dominant. And the rapid startups made the abundance of acetate metabolic (M00357) higher than the natural startup.

AB  - High-density interconnect (HDI) technology for liquid metal (LM)-based stretchable printed circuit boards is crucial for expanding their applicability. HDI technology provides high-resolution multilayer circuits with a high density of components, as required for next generation of neuroprobes and ultrasonic and sensor arrays. This study presents a HDI technique utilizing laser engraved micro grooves in silicone with a protective lift-off mask of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and subsequent microscale LM particle spray deposition. This approach achieves high-resolution LM patterns and enables multilayer connectivity and high-density integration of components simultaneously, that is, realizing HDI technology. It is demonstrated using a stretchable 0201 LED display with a density of six leads per mm2 and a cochlear implant (CI) electrode array. The demonstrated manufacturing of the CI has the potential to enable fully automated printed circuit board manufacturing of such implants with increased precision and throughput. Implants in guinea pigs show that the CI is capable of activating the auditory neuron with electrical auditory brainstem response (eABR) and electrical compound action potential (eCAP) of high quality. Moreover, the U-shaped cross section of the LM interconnects provides a higher mechanical shock resistance of the circuit than that of normal rectangular cross sections.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, no studies in the literature have reported on the relationship between the pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) concentration and undernutrition during pregnancy in sheep. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of undernutrition on the blood concentration of PAGs in pregnant ewes carrying single and multiple fetuses, undergoing either dietary energy restriction or receiving 100% of their energy requirements during the period of maximal placenta growth. From d 24 to 100 of pregnancy, the ewes were fed ryegrass hay and two different iso-proteic concentrates, fulfilling either 100% of the ewes' energy requirements (control group; n = 30, 14 singleton pregnancies, 16 multiple pregnancies) or only 50% (feed-restricted group; n = 29; 11 singleton pregnancies, 18 multiple pregnancies). Blood samples were collected from all the ewes the day before intravaginal sponge insertion (T0) and, thereafter, every 30 days starting from d 24 of gestation (T1) until d 30 after parturition (T6), to determine the PAG, progesterone, NEFA, total protein, and glucose concentrations. Our results showed that PAG concentrations are not only influenced by the number of fetuses, but also by the ewe's diet. In particular, the PAG marginal means were higher in the feed-restricted group than in the control group (7.8 +/- 0.6 and 10.8 +/- 0.9 ng/mL for the control and feed-restricted groups, respectively; p = 0.040). This finding confirms that a dietary restriction between d 24 and d 100 of gestation leads to a growth in placental functions as inferred from the increase in the concentration of the PAG levels. Therefore, the measurement of PAG concentrations, in addition to serving as a marker of pregnancy, can also serve as a marker of placental functionality.

AB  - The medicinal-oil plant Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz belongs to the Brassicaceae family. Various experiments have shown that the plant has much fewer water requirements and more resistance to spring cold than other oilseeds, especially Rapeseed. In this study, 136 camelina double haploid lines from anther culture progeny (F1) of crosses of 27 selected parents from different countries were generated. After ensuring that the lines were double haploid, biochemical markers were used to investigate genetic diversity. In the biochemical markers section, grain oil content, grain protein and type of fatty acids were measured. The experiment was carried out based on a randomized complete block design with four replications. To determine fatty acids using chromatography, 18 types of fatty acids were identified in camelina seed oil. Genetic parameters including phenotypic and genotypic variation coefficients, heritability and genetic advance were estimated. In this study, the highest phenotypic and genotypic variation in fatty acids (C14:0-C16:1) were estimated. Also, the highest general heritability for fatty acids (96.49% for C20:0, 98.92% for C20:2 and 98.59% for C20:3) were assessed. In this reserach, two lines with values of 35.81-36.67% linolenic acid and four lines with values between 22.08-23% of linoleic acid were identified. Also, the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 ranged between 0.479 0 and 0.759.

AB  - Herein, we evaluated the hepatic lipid metabolic profiles of bovine fetuses in response to maternal vitamin and mineral supplementation (VMSUP; supplemented (VTM) or not (NoVTM)) and two different rates of gain (GAIN; low gain (LG), 0.28 kg/d, or moderate gain (MG), 0.79 kg/d). Crossbred Angus heifers (n = 35; initial BW = 359.5 +/- 7.1 kg) were randomly assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, resulting in the following treatment combinations: NoVTM-LG (n = 9), NoVTM-MG (n = 9), VTM-LG (n = 9), and VTM-MG (n = 8). Heifers received their treatments until d 83 of gestation, when they were ovariohysterectomized. Fetuses were harvested and liver samples were analyzed via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy to characterize lipid profiles and abundances. We identified 374 biochemicals/metabolites belonging to 57 sub-pathways of the lipid metabolism super-pathway. The majority of the biochemicals/metabolites (n = 152) were significantly affected by the main effect of GAIN. Maternal moderate rates of gain resulted in greater abundances (p <= 0.0001) of omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoate, docosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate) and lower abundances (p <= 0.0001) of omega-6 fatty acids. Further, MG resulted in the accumulation of several diacylglycerols and depletion of the majority of the monoacylglycerols. Concentrations of nearly all acylcarnitines (p <= 0.03) were decreased in VTM-LG fetal livers compared to all other treatment combinations, indicating a greater rate of complete oxidation of fatty acids. Levels of secondary bile acids were impacted by VMSUP, being greater (p <= 0.0048) in NoVTM than in VTM fetal livers. Moreover, NoVTM combined with lower rate of gain resulted in greater concentrations of most secondary bile acid biochemicals/metabolites. These data indicate that maternal diet influenced and altered fetal hepatic lipid composition in the first trimester of gestation. Maternal body weight gain exerted a greater influence on fetal lipid profiles than vitamin and mineral supplementation. Specifically, lower rate of gain (0.28 kg/d) resulted in an increased abundance of the majority of the biochemicals/metabolites identified in this study.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been explored as a new treatment method for improving cognitive and motor functions. However, the neuronal mechanisms of tDCS in modulating brain functions, especially cognitive and memory functions, are not well understood. In the present study, we assessed whether tDCS could promote neuronal plasticity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in rats. This is important because the hippocampus-prefrontal pathway is a key pathway in cognitive and memory functions and is involved in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, the effect of anodal or cathodal tDCS on the medial prefrontal cortex was investigated in rats by measuring the medial prefrontal cortex response to electrical stimulation applied to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Following anodal tDCS, the evoked prefrontal response was potentiated compared to that in the pre-tDCS condition. However, the evoked prefrontal response did not show any significant changes following cathodal tDCS. Furthermore, the plastic change of the prefrontal response following anodal tDCS was only induced when hippocampal stimulation was continuously applied during tDCS. Anodal tDCS without hippocampal activation showed little or no changes. These results indicate that combining anodal tDCS of the prefrontal cortex with hippocampal activation induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in the hippocampus-prefrontal pathway. This LTP-like plasticity can facilitate smooth information transmission between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex and may lead to im-provements in cognitive and memory function.

AB  - Spatial memory is a fundamental cognitive function that enables humans and other species to encode and recall the locations of items in their environments. Humans employ diverse strategies to support spatial memory, including the use of cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are mental representations of the environment that organize its content along two or more continuous dimensions. In allocentric cognitive maps, these dimensions form a Cartesian coordinate system referenced to the environment. In egocentric cognitive maps, the dimensions form a polar coordinate system centered on the subject. To better understand how humans employ allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps for spatial memory, we performed a behavioral study with a novel task designed to directly and explicitly assess both types of cognitive maps. During encoding periods, participants navigated through a virtual environment and encountered objects at different locations. During recall periods, participants aimed at remembering these locations in abstract allocentric and egocentric coordinate systems. Our results show that relationships between the objects and the environment, such as their distance to boundaries and corners, were associated with allocentric memory performance. Relationships between the objects and the participant, including their distance and orientation to the participant's starting position, were linked to egocentric memory performance. Spatial feedback during recall supported performance within allocentric and egocentric domains, but not across domains. These findings are compatible with the notion that allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps operate as (partially) independent systems for spatial memory, each specialized in processing specific types of spatial relationships.

AB  - Hippopotamuses were present in Western Europe during the Pleistocene with at least two continental species: Hippopotamus antiquus and H. amphibius. The former was the large European hippopotamus, which appeared in the fossil record around 2 Ma and successfully spread across Europe before its last appearance datum (LAD) in Portugal and Greece, dated to 0.4 Ma. The extant hippopotamus, H. amphibius, first occurred in Africa around 1.5 Ma, and was well-established in Europe during the Late Pleistocene; however, its first occurrence datum (FOD) in Europe is still highly debated. Most of the H. amphibius remains collected from Middle Pleistocene localities are either badly preserved and fragmented or lacking clear stratigraphical data, in turn leading to doubtful specific attributions. A well-preservedmandible herein described, collected from Fosso Malafede (Latium, central Italy), allows to re-assess the occurrence of H. amphibius and to critically revise its earliest records. The morphological and morphometric characters of the studied remain, such as the general robustness of the studied mandible, the convex ventral profile of the mandibular corpus, the length of the teeth series, and the shape of the sagittal cross section of the mandibular symphysis, allow us to ascribe it to Hippopotamus amphibius. Fosso Malafede has been chronologically assigned to MIS 7 (similar to 0.25 Ma) and represents one of the best preserved H. amphibius specimen of the Middle Pleistocene of the European mainland. Accordingly, we discuss biochronological and paleobiogeographic implications, suggesting a critical revision of several remains from the Middle Pleistocene of southern Europe.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a range of disorders characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Although this spectrum of disorders is associated with adult obesity, recent evidence suggests that this condition could also occur independently of obesity, even in children. Previously, we reported that pigs fed a formula containing medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) developed hepatic steatosis and weighed less than those fed an isocaloric formula containing long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Our objective was to determine the association between NAFLD and the skeletal muscle transcriptome in response to energy and lipid intake. Neonatal pigs were fed one of three formulas: a control formula (CONT, n = 6) or one of two isocaloric high-energy formulas containing either long (LCFA, n = 6) or medium (MCFA, n = 6) chain fatty acids. Pigs were fed for 22 d, and tissues were collected. Body weight at 20 and 22 d was greater for LCFA-fed pigs than their CONT or MCFA counterparts (p < 0.005). Longissimus dorsi weight was greater for LCFA compared with MCFA, while CONT was intermediate (p < 0.05). Lean gain and protein deposition were greater for LCFA than for CONT and MCFA groups (p < 0.01). Transcriptomic analysis revealed 36 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MCFA and LCFA, 53 DEGs between MCFA and CONT, and 52 DEGs between LCFA and CONT (FDR < 0.2). Feeding formula high in MCFAs resulted in lower body and muscle weights. Transcriptomics data suggest that the reduction in growth was associated with a disruption in cholesterol metabolism in skeletal muscles.

AB  - Exposure to alkaline stress is common in aquatic practices. The present research investigated the detrimental impacts of rearing Nile tilapia under alkaline water stress by investigating the liver function indices and transcriptomic profile. A 30-day study was conducted on 160 fish (16.02 +/- 0.14 g) split into four groups, each with four replicates. Group 1 (G1) and G2 were fed on a basal diet fortified with 0 and 75 g/kg diet camel whey protein hydrolysates (CWP) and reared in freshwater (carbonate alkalinity = 1.4 mmol/L, pH = 7.19). Moreover, G3 and G4 were fed on a basal diet enriched with 0 and 75 g/kg diet CWP and reared in alkaline water (carbonate alkalinity = 23.8 mmol/L; pH = 8.65). The outcomes revealed elevated lipid indices (triglycerides, cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoproteins) and liver enzymes (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) with lowered protein indices (total protein, albumin, and globulin) in alkaline-reared fish. Moreover, oxidative stress was initiated through lowered antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione) and higher malondialdehyde in the alkaline-exposed fish. Alkaline stress induced the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin and MAPK pathway (mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun NH terminal kinase, and MAPK-1) with down-regulation of the autophagy-related genes (ATG-5, ATG-7, and ATG-13) and cathepsin B expression. Feeding on a CWP-supplemented diet resulted in significant modulation of the lipid profile, liver enzyme activity, and improvement in protein indices and antioxidant enzyme activity. Furthermore, modulation of the transcriptomic profile of the hepatic tissue of the alkaline-exposed fish was noticed due to feeding on a CWP-supplemented diet. Overall, CWP dietary addition at a level of 75 g/kg diet can alleviate the alkaline stress exposure in Nile tilapia. These outcomes could contribute to understanding the physiological circumstances of Nile tilapia when reared in alkaline water as well as provide a novel dietary additive for mitigating the bad consequences due to alkaline-stress exposure.

AB  - The decline in antioxidant defenses make it easily for human and animals to suffer from liver damage and diseases induced by oxidative stress, causing enormous losses to human health and livestock production. As one of the canonical protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), ubiquitination is widely involved in cell pro-liferation, apoptosis and damage/repair response, and is proven to be involved in the ability of mammals to resist oxidative stress. To explore whether alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a safe and efficient antioxidant, plays a role in regulating liver antioxidant status by PTMs, proteins in livers of pigs fed with LA were analyzed at the level of proteome and ubiquitylome. Based on proteome-wide enrichment of ubiquitination, a total of 7274 proteins were identified and 5326 were quantified, we also identified 1564 ubiquitination sites in 580 ubiquitinated proteins, among which there were 136 differentially ubiquitinated sites in 103 differentially ubiquitinated proteins upon LA. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that these differential proteins were mainly enriched in tryptophan metabolic pathway, and accompanied by significantly improvement of liver antioxidant capacity. We revealed the regulatory effect of LA on ubiquitination of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and other key proteins in tryptophan metabolism pathway of pig liver for the first time.

AB  - COVID-19 infection has been a key threat to the public health system globally, with an estimated 248 mil-lion cases worldwide. COVID-19 patients are subject to a higher risk of developing chronic respiratory disorders that are closely associated with long-term disability, multi-morbidity, and premature mortality. Although there have been recent advancements in respiratory treatment regimens, there has also been increased interest in the use of medicinal mushrooms in bridging the unaddressed pathways of action within the treatment algorithms. In this review, we provide a collection of medicinal mushrooms that are beneficial in promoting respiratory health and potentially reducing COVID-19 symptoms in patients who are newly diagnosed and those who have recovered. While reviewing the use of immunomodulatory pathways, which have shown promising results in tackling side effects and post-COVID syndromes, we also provide insights into how the antioxidant elements present in medicinal mushrooms help to achieve the same results, especially in the prophylactic and therapeutic management of COVID-19 infection. To date, medicinal mushrooms are regarded as a functional food, which, however, need further quality, safety, and efficacy assessments. These requirements are also highlighted in the present review to promote the future development and application of medicinal mushrooms for better respiratory health.

AB  - Simple Summary Horseback safari rides, where tourists are led by experienced guides on horseback to find and observe wildlife, are a popular activity in Africa. However, close encounters between horses and wildlife on safari rides may be stressful for both types of animals. In this study we looked at the behaviour of horses and wildlife during close encounters on horseback safari rides, focusing on their behaviour at the start and end of each encounter, and the most extreme behaviour seen. Encounters with seven wildlife species were observed, all large herbivores. The seven species differed in their behaviour towards the horses. The horses also differed in their behaviour towards the different wildlife species, being more wary of giraffe. Horses generally approached the wildlife species at walk and few flight behaviours were observed. Further studies, including those incorporating physiological measures of stress, are recommended. In Africa, wildlife-watching experiences create substantial revenue from tourists that can finance wildlife conservation. Horseback safaris, where an experienced guide takes guests through the bush on horseback to observe plains game species, are a popular activity. Close encounters between ridden horses and game species are unnatural and potentially stressful situations, and horseback safaris may have adverse impacts on both the horses and the wildlife they have come to observe. This study aims to provide a preliminary insight into the behavioural responses of horses and herbivorous plains game species, including giraffe, zebra and impala, as a proxy measure of the potential welfare implications of horseback safaris. Seventeen group safari rides were observed encompassing 72 encounters with plains game species. Game species differed in their response to encounters with the horseback safari ride. Equine response behaviour appeared to be influenced by the species of game encountered. Horses seemed more wary of giraffe than other species, with a higher percentage of horses showing stationary and retreat behaviour at the start of giraffe encounters. They were also most likely to shy at giraffe. The behavioural responses suggest that game encounters can elicit a stress response in both animal groups, although it is not usually extreme, potentially indicating that some degree of habituation has occurred. Balancing the welfare of both the horses and the plains game species along with tourist preferences may be challenging in this context.

AB  - PLAGL2 is upregulated in various tumors, including bladder cancer (BCa). However, the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic effects of PLAGL2 in BCa remain unclear. In our study, we proved that PLAGL2 was overexpressed in BCa tissues and correlated with decreased survival. Functionally, PLAGL2 deficiency significantly suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of BCa cells in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining, luciferase reporter, and ChIP assays revealed that overexpressed PLAGL2 disrupted the Hippo pathway and increased YAP1/TAZ activity by transactivating RACGAP1. Further investigations demonstrated that PLAGL2 activated YAP1/TAZ signaling via RACGAP1-mediated RhoA activation. Importantly, the RhoA inhibitor simvastatin or the YAP1/TAZ inhibitor verteporfin abrogated the proproliferative and prometastatic effects of BCa enhanced by PLAGL2. These findings suggest that PLAGL2 promotes BCa progression via RACGAP1/RhoA GTPase/YAP1 signaling. Hence, the core nodes of signaling may be promising therapeutic targets for BCa.

AB  - Simple Summary Hemp has become a rapidly growing industry in the United States in recent years. However, due to many decades of prohibition, there has been relatively little research on insect pests and their interactions with natural enemies in hemp production systems. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessment of corn earworm (CEW) Helicoverpa zea parasitism in a hemp system. Corn earworm larvae exhibited high parasitism rates by tachinid flies resulting in elevated mortality. Host mortality increased with the number of tachinid eggs per larva even though typically only one parasitoid successfully developed per host. Larger CEW larvae were more likely to survive parasitism, but frequently, neither parasitoid nor host larvae successfully developed. Our results suggest that tachinid flies hold promise as biological control agents for populations of this important pest attacking hemp. In a survey on hemp grown in western Kentucky we found an average of 27.8 CEW larvae per plant. We recorded 45% parasitism of CEW in these fields by two species of tachinid flies, Winthemia rufopicta and Lespesia aletiae. Most parasitized larvae were third to sixth instars at the time of collection. We found up to 22 tachinid eggs per host larva, 89% of which typically bore between 1 and 5 eggs on the thorax. 45.9% of CEW bearing eggs died. The number of tachinid eggs per host was unrelated to host body mass, but both the number of tachinid eggs and caterpillar body mass influenced CEW survival. Larger CEW often survived parasitism and the number of fly eggs was negatively related to survival rate. The emergence of adult flies was positively correlated with the number of eggs, but no influence of the host size was found. High mortality of CEW larvae and the parasitoids developing within them in this system suggests that secondary chemicals (or poor nutrition) of the hemp diet may be negatively affecting host and parasitoid development and influencing their interactions.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that is found in feed ingredients derived from grains such as corn and wheat. Consumption of DON-contaminated feed has been shown to cause damage to the intestine, kidneys, and liver. However, the molecular mechanism by which DON exerts its effect in the small intestine is not completely understood. As a result, we profiled gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells treated with DON and examined the molecular function in vitro. We hypothesized that DON could induce apoptosis via the FOXO3a-signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells based on these findings. DON induced the apoptosis and the translocation of FOXO3a into the nucleus. Moreover, the inhibiting of FOXO3a alleviated the apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related genes (TRAL, BCL-6, CASP8, and CASP3). ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment suppressed the translocation of FOXO3a into the nucleus. Our discovery suggests that DON induces apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells through the FOXO3a-signaling pathway.

AB  - Every year, up to 11 million burns are recorded. They are first among all traumas, leading to over 300,000 deaths around the globe every year. Burns caused by fire are also one of the main causes of deaths and disability-adjusted life years in countries with low and average levels of income. This research analyzed an experimental modeling of burn treatment using anti-burn drugs. Laboratory guinea pigs were traumatized with 2-3 degree burns with the burnt area of 15-20% of the skin surface. We compared the therapeutic efficacies of the experimental drug based on polyethylene glycol and the officinal medicinal drug - the ointment Pantestin. We assessed pathophysiological and pathomorphological changes over the process of burns, microbial landscape on the skin and in the microbiome of the internal environment of the guinea pigs. The most effective drug was the experimental anti-burn ointment based on polyethylene glycol. On the third day of the experiment, the Pantestin drug ensured the survival of 14.7% of the experimental animals compared with 57.1% survival using the ointment of the experimental drug and 100% death of the control animals that received no anti-burn therapy. The dominant bacterial pathogens that induce pathogenesis of the burn process are purulent-necrotic and toxicogenic ubiquitous prokaryotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa, hemolytic capsular variant of Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. From the burn wound, various prokaryotic microflora were isolated, and since day three after the infliction of the burn, in microbiome of the large intestine, no more indigenous bioindicators of the macroorganism's physiological wellbeing - Aerococcus viridans and Mycobacterium vaccae, were isolated against the background of rapid decrease in isolation of lactobacteria, bifidobacteria, and saccharolytic yeasts.

AB  - Background: Exposure to individual phthalates and the mediation effect of oxidative stress in association with asthma and allergic symptoms have been studied previously. Little is known about the mixture effect of phthalates on health outcomes. Thus, we investigated the effect of a mixture of ten phthalate metabolites in association with wheeze, rhino-conjunctivitis, and eczema. The mediating effect of three oxidative stress biomarkers was also assessed.
   Methods: Levels of 10 phthalate metabolites and 3 oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in 386 urine samples from 7-year-old children. Parents reported demographic and allergic symptoms using ISAAC questionnaires. Logistic regression for individual metabolites and mixture analysis weighted quantile sum (WQS) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were fitted to examine the association between phthalate metabolite exposure and health outcomes. Baron and Kenny's regression approach was used for mediation analysis.
   Results: In logistic regression model showed mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.97) and mono carboxy-isononyl phthalate (cx-MINP) (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.86) were associated with wheeze. The WQS index had a significant association (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.96) with wheeze and (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82) with eczema. Mono-isononyl phthalate (MINP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) were the most highly weighted metabolites. In the BKMR model, diisononyl phthalate (DINP) metabolites showed the highest group posterior inclusion probability (PIP). Among DINP metabolites, MINP in wheeze, cx-MINP in rhino-conjunctivitis and OH-MINP in eczema showed the highest conditional PIPs. The overall metabolites mixture effect was associated with eczema. We did not find any mediation of oxidative stress in the association between phthalates and symptoms. No significant association between phthalate metabolites and oxidative stress was observed in this study.
   Conclusion: Mixture of phthalate metabolites were associated with wheeze and eczema. The main contributors to the association were DEHP and DINP metabolites. No mediation of oxidative stress was observed.

AB  - The modern pteridophyte genus Equisetum is the only survivor of Sphenopsida, an ancient Glade known from the Devonian. This genus, of nearly worldwide distribution, comprises approximately 15 extant species. However, genomic information is limited. In this study, we assembled the complete chloroplast genome of the giant species Equisetum xylochaetum from a metagenomic sequence and compared the plastid genome structure and protein-coding regions with information available for two other Equisetum species using network analysis. Equisetum chloroplast genomes showed conserved traits of quadripartite structure, gene content, and gene order. Phylogenetic analysis based on plastome protein-coding regions corroborated previous reports that Equisetum is monophyletic, and that E. xylochaetum is more closely related to E. hyemale than to E. arvense. Single-gene phylogenetic estimation and haplotype analysis showed that E. xylochaetum belonged to the subgenus Hippochaete. Single-gene haplotype analysis revealed that E. arvense, E. hyemale, E. myriochaetum, and E. variegatum resolved more than one haplotype per species, suggesting the presence of a high diversity or a high mutation rate of the corresponding nucleotide sequence. Sequences from E. bogotense appeared as a distinct group of haplotypes representing the subgenus Paramochaete that diverged from Hippochaete and Equisetum. In addition, the taxa that were frequently located at the joint region of the map were E. scirpoides and E. pratense, suggesting the presence of some plastome characters among the Equiseum subgenera.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was conducted to comprehensively understand the functional mechanisms of CD8(+/-) porcine gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells related to the immune system using RNA-sequencing technology. In total, 646 upregulated and 561 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for CD8(+) were identified and functional annotation was performed. A cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway were enriched in the upregulated DEG group, whereas the B cell receptor signaling pathway was enriched in the downregulated DEG group. Chemokine-related genes (CXCR3, CCR5, CCL4, CCL5), interferon gamma (IFNG), and CD40 ligand (CD40LG) identified in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and TCR signaling pathway may affect the inter-regulation of immune signaling. Our results are expected to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of porcine gamma delta T cells. We aimed to comprehensively understand the functional mechanisms of immunity, especially of the CD8(+/-) subsets of gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells, using an RNA-sequencing analysis. Herein, gamma delta T cells were obtained from bronchial lymph node tissues of 38-day-old (after weaning 10-day: D10) and 56-day-old (after weaning 28-day: D28) weaned pigs and sorted into CD8(+) and CD8(-) groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on the CD8 groups at D10 and D28 time points. We confirmed 1699 DEGs between D10 CD8(+) versus D10 CD8(-) groups and 1784 DEGs between D28 CD8(+) versus D28 CD8(-) groups; 646 upregulated and 561 downregulated DEGs were common. The common upregulated DEGs were enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, and the common downregulated DEGs were enriched in the B cell receptor signaling pathway. Further, chemokine-related genes, interferon gamma, and CD40 ligand were involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and TCR signaling pathway, which are associated with inter-regulation in immunity. We expect our results to form the basic data required for understanding the mechanisms of gamma delta T cells in pigs; however, further studies are required in order to reveal the dynamic changes in gamma delta T cells under pathogenic infections, such as those by viruses.

AB  - Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) overexpression significantly inhibits lipid deposition during yak intramuscular preadipocyte (YIMA) differentiation; however, the regulatory mechanism remains unknown. We elucidated the role of SIRT1 in YIMA differentiation using lentivirus-mediated downregulation technology and conducted mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq assays using H3K9ac antibodies after SIRT1 overexpression in order to reveal SIRT1 targets during YIMA adipogenesis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed in order to identify the functional annotation of common genes. In addition, a potential target of SIRT1 was selected to verify its effects on the differentiation and proliferation of YIMAs. SIRT1 interfered with lipid deposition and promoted YIMA differentiation. In total, 143,518 specific peaks were identified after SIRT1 overexpression, where genes associated with downregulation peaks were enriched in transcription, gene expression, lipid-related processes, and classical lipid-related pathways. The H3K9ac signal in the whole genome promoter region (2 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site (TSS)) was weakened, and the peaks were distributed across all gene functional regions. Genes that lost signals in their TSS region or gene body region were enriched in both biological processes and pathways associated with lipogenesis. The ChIP-seq results revealed 714 common differential genes in mRNA-seq, which were enriched in "MAPK signaling", "lipid and atherosclerosis", "mTOR signaling", and "FoxO signaling" pathways. A total of 445 genes were downregulated in both their H3K9ac signals and mRNA expression, and one of their most significantly enriched pathways was FoxO signaling. Nine genes (FBP2, FPGT, HSD17B11, KCNJ15, MAP3K20, SLC5A3, TRIM23, ZCCHC10, and ZMYM1) lost the H3K9ac signal in their TSS regions and had low mRNA expression, and three genes (KCNJ15, TGM3, and TRIM54) had low expression but lost their H3K9ac signal in the gene body region. The interference of TRIM23 significantly inhibited fat deposition during preadipocyte differentiation and promoted cell proliferation by increasing S-phase cell numbers. The present study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of intramuscular fat content deposition and the epigenetic role of SIRT1 in adipocyte differentiation.

AB  - Gastrointestinal parasite (GIP) infections pose significant challenges in pasture-based sheep farming, leading to economic losses and welfare concerns. This study aimed to uncover the genetic basis of resistance to Moniezia spp. infections in Central Anatolian Merino (CAM) sheep. Genome-Wide Association Analysis (GWAS) was conducted between Moniezia spp. egg burden and genomic data from 226 CAM lambs. Thirteen significant Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, with five surpassing the genome-wide threshold and eight exceeding the chromosome-wide threshold. Functional annotation revealed associations with genes involved in immune function, notably CD79A and MAP3K7. CD79A, integral to B-cell activation and antibody production, plays a key role in the immune response against parasitic infections. Its interaction with helminth-derived proteins modulates B-cell function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. MAP3K7, a central regulator of immune signaling pathways, modulates host responses to helminth infections by influencing NF-kappa B activity. Additionally, it regulates macrophage function in bacterial infections, showcasing its versatility in mediating immune responses against diverse pathogens. From a practical perspective, the findings of the current research underscore the potential of integrating genomic information into breeding programs to bolster disease resilience in livestock populations for sustainable production purposes. However, further research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of identified SNPs and associated genes. This study underscores the potential of genomic approaches in combating parasitic diseases and promoting sustainable agriculture in sheep production systems.

AB  - Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of its concentration and impact on the climate. In the present study, we investigate the trends, sources and distribution of CH4 in South Africa. The study uses satellite datasets from Sentinel-5P and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The study also uses credible datasets from the World Bank, Statistics South Africa and the Global Methane Initiative (GMI). The results show an increasing trend of CH4 from 1970-1989. A turning point is observed in 1989, where a decreasing trend is observed from 1989-2001. An increasing trend is then observed from 2001 to 2021. A high concentration of CH4 is observed in the northern and interior parts of South Africa. The results also show that CH4 concentration is influenced by seasonal variations. The September-October-November (SON) season has the highest CH4 concentration distribution in South Africa. The World Bank, Statistics South Africa and the GMI CH4 indictors show that agricultural activities, i.e., involving livestock, are the greatest emitters of CH4 in South Africa, followed by landfill sites. From the livestock data, sheep are the highest emitters of CH4. The increasing CH4 trend is a concern and efforts need to be made to drastically reduce emissions, if South Africa is to meet the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, 2015 Paris Agreement, sustainable development goal 13 (SDG 13) and the COP26 outcome agreements.

AB  - In order to explore the effects of the composition and structure of soil's dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its electron transfer capacity (ETC) on the bioavailability of the potential toxic elements chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) after the application of decomposed pig manure organic fertilizer, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEMs), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and electrochemical methods were used to analyze the composition characteristics of DOM in soil solution and the changes in the ETC, and the dynamic relationship between the relative content of DOM, ETC and various forms of potential toxic elements was explored by means of a Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA). Among them, Cr, Pb and Cd were the elements with significant biological toxicity in farmland soil. The results indicated the following: (1) The soil DOM before and after returning the organic fertilizer to the field contained four components: UV and UVA humic-like (C1), tryptophan-like and UVA humic-like (C2), Exogenous and visible humic-like (C3) and tyrosine-like (C4). Humus-like was the main component. (2) After applying organic fertilizer, the relative contents of the DOM humus and tyrosine-like components in the soil increased by 8% and 8.73%, respectively. In this process, the DOM electron-accepting capacity (EAC) and electron-donating capacity (EDC) increased by 39.98% and 27.91%, respectively. (3) The humic-like fraction showed a highly significant positive correlation with ETC (p < 0.01), and the tyrosine-like fraction showed a significant negative correlation with ETC (p < 0.05). (4) The humus-like substance and ETC were positively correlated with the total amount, reducible state and oxidizable state of the potential toxic elements and negatively correlated with the weak acid extracted state and residue state; this showed that the humus-like components and ETC were more helpful for the transformation of the weak acid extracted state to the reducible state, oxidizable state and residue state in the interaction between the DOM components and Cr, Pb and Cd. In summary, the reasonable application of organic fertilizer could improve the relative content of DOM and ETC in soil, inhibit the biological toxicity of potential toxic elements in soil and provide a theoretical basis for the safe use of organic fertilizer.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) in ruminants is closely associated with disease; thus, improving antioxidant capacity is an important strategy for maintaining host health. Bupleuri Radix (BR) could significantly improve host health and stress levels. However, the clear antioxidant mechanism of the function of BR remains unknown. In the current study, LC-MS metabolomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to explore the effects of BR on rumen microbiota and metabolites in Shanbei Fine-Wool Sheep (SFWS), and Spearman correlation analyses of rumen microbiota, metabolites, and OS were performed to investigate the mechanism of antioxidant function of BR. Our results indicated that as SFWS grows, levels of OS and antioxidant capacity increase dramatically, but providing BR to SFWS enhances antioxidant capacity while decreasing OS. Rumen microbiota and OS are strongly correlated, with total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) showing a significant negative correlation with Succiniclasticum and a positive correlation with Ruminococcus. Importantly, the Chao1 index was significantly negatively correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA) and positively correlated with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and T-AOC. Two biomarkers connected to the antioxidant effects of BR, 5,6-DHET and LPA (a-25:0/0:0), were screened according to the results of metabolomics and Spearman analysis of rumen contents, and a significant relationship between the concentration of rumen metabolites and OS was found. Five metabolic pathways, including glycerolipid, glutathione, nucleotide, D-amino acid, and inositol phosphate metabolism, may have a role in OS. The integrated results indicate that rumen microbiota and metabolites are strongly related to OS and that BR is responsible for reducing OS and improving antioxidant capacity in post-weaned SFWS. These findings provide new strategies to reduce OS occurring during SFWS growth.

AB  - Simple Summary Ewe nutrition during gestation, either in excess or in deficit, may influence fetal development and the postnatal life of the lamb. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of use the of energy (ME) and energy/protein (MECP) supplementation in the ewe's diet in the last third of gestation on maternal placental and endocrine characteristics, as well as on the behavior of neonatal lambs and productive performance. ME and MECP ewes had higher serum concentrations of triiodothyronine and cortisol on the day of lambing. However, only ME ewes had higher placental efficiency and lower total cotyledon weight. The ME and MECP diets increased birth weight at weaning and reduced the time to kneel, to try to stand, and the latency to stand of the lambs. It is concluded that overnutrition in the last third of gestation was positive for the sheep production system, with improved production rates, hormonal profile, placental characteristics and neonatal behavior. These results are valuable to society because they indicate a management strategy during the reproductive season that can be adopted by sheep producers to increase the productivity of their flocks. The objective of the study was to evaluate energy or energy/protein supplementation in the ewe diet, in the last third of gestation, on maternal placental and endocrine characteristics, as well as its effects on the behavior of neonatal lambs and productive performance until weaning. A total of 128 ewes were used, and the experimental diet was fed from 100 days gestation until lambing, with the birth of 172 lambs. The ewes were distributed into three treatments: CTL (control, n = 43) with metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) intake according to NRC (1985); ME (energy supplementation, n = 44) plus 21% ME; and MECP (energy/protein supplementation, n = 41) plus 26% ME and CP. Body weight, body condition score, serum hormone concentrations, placental characteristics, lamb performance and behavior, and production efficiency of the ewe from lambing to weaning were measured. ME and MECP ewes were heavier before (p = 0.006) and just after lambing (p = 0.002) and had higher serum triiodothyronine (p = 0.001) and cortisol (p = 0.004) concentrations on the day of lambing. ME ewes had higher placental efficiency (p = 0.036) and lower total cotyledon weight (p = 0.011). ME and MECP diets increased both lamb birth weight (p = 0.015) and weaning weight (p = 0.009). Production efficiency at birth and at weaning was not influenced (p > 0.05) by treatments. Lamb behavior was influenced by the ME and MECP diets, reducing the time to kneel (p <= 0.05), to try to stand (p <= 0.05), and the latency to stand (p <= 0.005). It is concluded that overnutrition in the last third of gestation was positive for the ovine production system, with improved production rates, hormonal profile, placental characteristics, and neonatal behavior.

AB  - To investigate the effects of different niacin treatments on low pH-induced goat rumen epithelial cells acidosis, cells were exposed to solutions with a pH of 7.4, 5.8, 5.6, 5.2, and 5.0 for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. The precise pH was adjusted using volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). All the cell viability in low pH treatment declined more than 50% for 12 h stimulation, and cells treated with low pH for 12 h was selected to be optimal ruminal acidosis model. Cells were then cultured with niacin (0, 20, 40, 80, 160, or 320 mM) for 12 h before, concurrent, and after 12 h treatment with low pH. Results showed that, 1) Pre-treatment protection of niacin: pre-treatment with 20 or 40 mM niacin increased the cell viability under pH 5.8, while 80-320 mM niacin decreased the cell viability compared with the control group (P < 0.01). Under pH 5.5, results were similar to those under pH 5.8, except for pre-treatment with 40 mM niacin with no significant effect on the cell viability. Under pH 5.2 or 5.0, pre-treatment with niacin reduced the cell viability compared with the control group (P < 0.01). 2) Concurrent treatment protection of niacin: under all pH value, all concurrent treatment with niacin reduced the cell viability compared with the control group (P < 0.01). 3) Post-treatment protection of niacin: under pH 5.8 or 5.5, post-treatment with 20 or 40 mM niacin increased the cell viability compared with the control group, while 80-320 mM niacin decreased the cell viability (P < 0.01). Under pH 5.2 or 5.0, post-treatment with niacin reduced the cell viability compared with the control group (P < 0.01). These results may provide a reference for ruminal acidosis mitigation. Low-concentration niacin could relieve subacute ruminal acidosis, and it could be added after symptoms appear. However, niacin had a negative role in the protection of acute ruminal acidosis.

AB  - Diet and feeding behavior data are crucial to a deep understanding of the behavioral response and adaptation of primates to a high-altitude environment. From August 2019 to June 2021, we collected data on the feeding behavior of a high-altitude rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta group from Yajiang County, Western Sichuan Plateau, which has an altitude of over 3,500 m. The results showed that feeding (33.0 +/- 1.8%) and moving (28.3 +/- 2.6%) were the dominant behavior of rhesus macaques. Macaques ate 193 food items, comprising 11 food categories from 90 species. Our study found that plant roots (30.9 +/- 30.1%) and young leaves (28.0 +/- 33.1%) were the main foods eaten by macaques. The preferred foods of rhesus macaques were young leaves, fruits, and seeds, and the consumption of these items was positively correlated with its food availability. When the availability of preferred foods was low, macaques took plant roots, barks, and fallen leaves as fallback foods. In particular, roots were a dominant food item in winter, and this way of feeding became a key survival strategy. Our results suggest that, facing the relative scarcity and strong seasonal fluctuations of food resources in high-altitude habitat, macaques adopt active foraging strategies, relying on a variety of food species and adjusting flexibly their food choices based on food availability, which may help to maximize the energy efficiency of high-altitude macaques.

AB  - Achnatherum sibiricum can be infected by two species of fungal endophytes, Epichloe gansuensis (Eg) and Epichloe sibirica (Es). In this study, the metabolites of Eg, Es, and their infected plants were studied by GC-MS analysis. The results showed that the metabolic profiles of Eg and Es were similar in general, and only six differential metabolites were detected. The direct effect of endophyte infection on the metabolites in A. sibiricum was that endophyte-infected plants could produce mannitol, which was not present in uninfected plants. Epichloe infection indirectly caused an increase in the soluble sugars in A. sibiricum related to growth and metabolites related to the defense against pathogens and herbivores, such as alpha-tocopherol, alpha-linolenic acid and aromatic amino acids. Epichloe infection could regulate galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism of host grass. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation in the metabolite contents between the endophyte and the host.

AB  - Yellow Camellia (Camellia sect. chrysantha) is a rare ornamental plant and an important germplasm resource globally. Camellia nitidissima thrives in normal acidic soils, while Camellia limonia can adapt to the calcareous soils found in karst areas. Our previous study on the karst adaptation of yellow camellias revealed that the expression levels of heat shock protein 20(HSP20) were higher in Camellia limonia than in Camellia nitidissima. However, the functions of the HSP20 gene of Camellia limonia remain unclear to data. In this study, the HSP20 genes of Camellia limonia (ClHSP20-OE lines) and Camellia. nitidissima (CnHSP20-OE lines) were cloned and overexpressed heterologously in Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, we overexpressed the HSP20 gene of Arabidopsis (AtHSP20-OE lines) was also overexpressed, and the T-DNA inserted mutants (athspmutant lines) were also used to determine the functions of HSP20 genes. Under high calcium stress, the chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content and humidity of leaves were increased in ClHSP20-OE lines, while those of other lines were declined. The size of the stomatal apertures, stomatal conductance, and the photosynthetic efficiency of ClHSP20-OE lines were higher than those of the other lines. However, the accumulation of H2O2 and O2- in the leaves of ClHSP20-OE lines was the lowest among all the lines. Energy spectrum scanning revealed that the percentage of calcium on the surfaces of the leaves of ClHSP20-OE lines was relatively low, while that of athspmutant lines was the highest. The ClHSP20 gene can also affected soil humidity and the contents of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expressions of FBA5 and AT5G10770 in ClHSP20-OE lines was significantly up-regulated compared to that of CnHSP20-OE lines. Compared to that of athspmutant lines, the expressions of DREB1A and AT3G30460 was significantly upregulated in AtHSP20-OE lines, and the expression of POL was down-regulated. Our findings suggest that the HSP20 gene plays a crucial role in maintained photosynthetic rate and normal metabolism by regulating the expression of key genes under high-calcium stress. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying the karst adaptation in Camellia. limonia and provides novel insights for future research on karst plants.

AB  - New therapeutic molecules for farm animals are needed to address worldwide problems in the food industry, like the rise of resistance among ruminant parasites and pathogenic microbes. Since in vivo testing would involve an excessive number of animals, with consequent ethical and economic issues, the generation of sheep intestinal organoids represents a promising close-to-reality in vitro model for veterinary drug development; however, the characterization and application of such organoids remain limited. In this study, ovine intestinal organoids were generated from adult LGR5+ stem cells from the intestinal crypts of freshly slaughtered lambs, and developed in an in vitro culture system. Morphological analysis via brightfield microscopy and immunocytochemical staining revealed a pseudostratified epithelium with multiple cell types, and distinct apical-basal polarity, while RNA sequencing validated the preservation of the physiological characteristics of the original organ. The development and characterization of a robust and reproducible protocol for culturing sheep duodenum intestinal organoids in a high-throughput screening (HTS) compatible format demonstrated reliability in HTS applications, with Z'-factor tests indicating robust assay performance. Dose-response studies using pre-identified compounds showed comparable pharmacodynamic profiles between mouse and sheep organoids. These findings establish sheep intestinal organoids as an innovative tool for veterinary pharmacology and toxicology, offering a cost-effective and sustainable platform to address challenges such as drug resistance and improve livestock health.

AB  - The present is a palaeobiological and taphonomic analysis of a Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 4-3 (Late Pleisto-cene) assemblage of animal remains and hominin artefacts from layers 7-5 of Bis ' nik Cave, Czestochowa Upland, Poland. The analysis indicates that the bone assemblage is the result of a time-averaged palimpsest of both biotic and episodic abiotic events, the former consisting of many successive generations of animals and hominins that frequented the cave, and the latter including hydraulic winnowing. In fact, the taphonomic history of the fossil assemblage from Bis ' nik Cave's layers 7-5 is partially obscured by the overprint of hydraulic winnowing, which purportedly removed a certain amount of the original specimens. Besides evidence of cave bear deaths from non-violent, hibernation-related mortality and of occupation by generations of denning wolves and hyaenas, there is a wealth of flint artefacts, alongside remains of a few fireplaces and of a structure built in the cave by hominins to partition the cave chambers. The studied layer contains an impressive number of shed antlers, primarily of the red deer Cervus elaphus. Crocuta crocuta spelaea is normally held responsible for such accumulations of shed antlers in various European caves; Bis ' nik Cave's layers 7-5 will therefore simply add to the list. However, the role of accumulator of shed antlers attributed to the Pleistocene spotted hyena does not match the behaviour of its modern counterpart and seems not accounted for metabolically. The only reasonable alternative is that the antlers were collected by hominins. From this alternative perspective the cave would have functioned as a warehouse, where naturally shed antlers were stored as raw material, potentially to be shaped into tools and/or employed as tools to make other tools. The palaeobiological and taphonomic analysis presented here provides new insights into the succession of pre-and postdepositional events that involved the bone remains accumulated in the cave, as well as into the interactions between the animals and hominins of the time. More importantly, if hominins, and not hyaenas, were responsible for the amassment of the shed antlers in Bis ' nik Cave, this study raises doubts as to the hyaenid or human origin of other similar cave accumulations of shed antlers throughout Europe.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. sinensis) is a deciduous shrub or small tree in the Elaeagnaceae family. It is dioecious, featuring distinct structures in female and male flowers. The MADS-box gene family plays a crucial role in flower development and differentiation of floral organs in plants. However, systematic information on the MADS-box family in sea buckthorn is currently lacking. This study presents a genome-wide survey and expression profile of the MADS-box family of sea buckthorn. We identified 92 MADS-box genes in the H. rhamnoides ssp. Sinensis genome. These genes are distributed across 12 chromosomes and classified into Type I (42 genes) and Type II (50 genes). Based on the FPKM values in the transcriptome data, the expression profiles of HrMADS genes in male and female flowers of sea buckthorn showed that most Type II genes had higher expression levels than Type I genes. This suggesting that Type II HrMADS may play a more significant role in sea buckthorn flower development. Using the phylogenetic relationship between sea buckthorn and Arabidopsis thaliana, the ABCDE model genes of sea buckthorn were identified and some ABCDE model-related genes were selected for qRT-PCR analysis in sea buckthorn flowers and floral organs. Four B-type genes may be involved in the identity determination of floral organs in male flowers, and D-type genes may be involved in pistil development. It is hypothesized that ABCDE model genes may play an important role in the identity of sea buckthorn floral organs. This study analyzed the role of MADS-box gene family in the development of flower organs in sea buckthorn, which provides an important theoretical basis for understanding the regulatory mechanism of sex differentiation in sea buckthorn.

AB  - Dietary restriction, such as low glycemic index diet (LGID), have been successfully used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. However, if such diet could also counteract antiepileptogenesis is still unclear. Here, we investigated whether the administration of LGID during the latent pre-epileptic period, prevents or delays the appearance of the overt epileptic phenotype. To this aim, we used the Synapsin II knockout (SynIIKO) mouse, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in which seizures manifest 2-3 months after birth, offering a temporal window in which LGID may affect epileptogenesis. Pregnant SynIIKO mice were fed with either LGID or standard diet during gestation and lactation. Both diets were maintained in weaned mice up to 5 months of age. LGID delayed the seizure onset and induced a reduction of seizures severity only in female SynIIKO mice. In parallel with the epileptic phenotype, high-density multielectrode array recordings revealed a reduction of frequency, amplitude, duration, velocity of propagation and spread of interictal events by LGID in the hippocampus of SynIIKO females, but not mutant males, confirming the gender-specific effect. ELISA-based analysis revealed that LGID increased cortico-hippocampal allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels only in females, while it was unable to affect ALLO plasma concentrations in either sex. The results indicate that the gender-specific interference of LGID with the epileptogenic process can be ascribed to a gender-specific increase in cortical ALLO, a neurosteroid known to strengthen GABAergic transmission. The study highlights the possibility of developing a personalized gender-based therapy for temporal lobe epilepsy.

AB  - Emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens has been recognized as a major public health con-cern worldwide. In the present study, antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative bacteria (AMRGNB) and AMR genes were assessed in semi-aquatic wild animals from a highly populated and intensive farming region of Spain, Catalonia. Clo-acal/rectal swab samples were collected from 241 animals coming from invasive species Trachemys scripta (n = 91) and Neovison vison (n = 131), and endangered-protected species Lutra lutra (n = 19). Accordingly, 133 (55.2%) iso-lates were identified as AMRGNB. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens were among the bacteria most fre-quently isolated in all animal species, but other nosocomial agents such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. or Citrobacter freundii, were also prevalent. The phenotypic susceptibility testing showed the highest resistance to beta-lactams (91%). Molecular analysis showed 25.3% of turtles (15.4% ESBL/Ampc genes), 21% of Eurasian otters (10.5% ESBL/Ampc genes) and 14.5% of American minks (8.4% ESBL/Ampc genes) were positive to AMR genes. The genotyping frequency was tetM (20.6%), blaCMY-2 (13%), ermB (6.1%), blaCMY-1 (4.6%), blaCTX-M-15 (3.1%) and mcr-4 (0.8%). Turtles had a larger prevalence of AMRGNB and AMR genes than mustelids, but American mink car-ried mcr-4 colistin-resistance gene. Moreover, cluster analysis of AMR gene distribution revealed that an ESBL/AmpC cluster in a highly populated area comprising big metropolitan regions, and another tetM/emrB cluster in an expended area with highly intensive livestock production. Although the mcr-4 positive case was not included in those clusters, that case was found in a county with a high pig farm density. In conclusion, semi-aquatic wild animals are a good sentinel for environmental contamination with AMRGNB and AMR genes. Therefore, One Health Approach is urgently needed in highly populated regions, and with intensive livestock production like Catalonia.

AB  - BACKGROUNDEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are recognized as effective biocontrol agents against various soil-dwelling pests. However, their efficacy in managing leaf pests is often constrained by factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation and desiccation.RESULTSWe evaluated the protective effects of five plant-derived substances, including grape seed extract, sodium copper chlorophyllin, vitamin C, beta-carotene and lutein, on Steinernema carpocapsae upon exposure to three wavelengths of artificial ultraviolet radiation (UVA, UVB, UVC). The five protectants showed efficient protective effects. Notably, grape seed extract, sodium copper chlorophyllin and vitamin C exhibited significant protective effects on infective juveniles (IJs) even after exposure to UVC for 4, 8 and 12 h. Under natural sunlight conditions, we combined these UV protectants with three humectants and evaluated their effects on IJ viability. Orthogonal experiments revealed that the combination treatment of 0.2% grape seed extract and 0.1% fire blocking gel yielded the highest IJ survival rate. This foliar formulation was tested in the field, leading to significantly higher mortality of Tuta absoluta compared with EPNs only.CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that the formulation containing UV protectants and humectants effectively overcome the limitations encountered in the foliar application of EPNs, thereby enhancing their potential for pest management in agricultural contexts.

AB  - The management of livestock effluents to reduce their environmental impact requires knowledge of not only the quantity produced but also the availability of agricultural areas, the condition of contiguous areas and the opportunity to exploit the energetic value of effluents. In this paper, a description of the Italian livestock system is provided, with a focus on its consequences in terms of the nitrogen load and biogas potential produced by the management of effluents. The analysis considered 9,589 million animal units (AU) and indicated an overall nitrogen production of 508 x 10(6) tons, while the methane potential can reach 1,764 x 10(6) m(3), equal to 6.1% of the national electric energy consumption. To organize effective collection and treatment of effluents, their spatial distribution was investigated using spatial statistical tools: Moran's index and local indicator of spatial association (LISA). Moran's index analysis showed that animal units (Moran's I = 0.63), nitrogen load per hectare of UAA (Moran's I = 0.35) and methane potential per square kilometre (Moran's I = 0.58) were significantly clustered. Using LISA, a series of maps and scatter plots were elaborated to identify clusters of high nitrogen loads and high methane production. The analysis showed that 764 municipalities are included in clusters of a high density of livestock, and 635 municipalities resulted in clusters of high methane potential. The results demonstrated the robustness of these instruments to evaluate the presence of nitrogen/biogas production clusters and the possibility of combining the treatment of nitrogen and the production of biogas from animal effluents. Analysing the distribution of livestock and the 2,723 biogas plants operating in Italy, the study found that 75.0% of the bioresources are available 5 km from the nearest biogas plant, 89.9% at 10 km, 94.7% at 15 km and 97.4% at 20 km.

AB  - Simple Summary Breeders use breeding goals to guide genetic gain in a population in a desired direction. Breeding goals consist of economically interesting traits, in which each trait receives an economic value. For example, to increase the size of a piglet litter, breeders use a breeding goal that includes the trait "number of live piglets in a litter" for a specific day after birth. While the litter size is selected using the trait "number of live piglets," it is composed of two traits: "total number born" and "number of dead piglets." The current study used simulations to illustrate that selection for litter size could be improved by selecting for the latter two traits rather than the former. This approach corrects for the fact that these two traits are genetically related to each other, but they also have genetic differences. Further, splitting one trait into two traits allows breeders to focus on the specific elements of a trait. For example, organic pig breeders could select for better piglet welfare by splitting "number of live piglets" into two traits, giving a negative economic value to the number of dead piglets. Selection for the number of living pigs on day 11 (L11) aims to reduce piglet mortality and increase litter size simultaneously. This approach could be sub-optimal, especially for organic pig breeding. This study evaluated the effect of selecting for a trait by separating it into two traits. Genetic parameters for L11, the total number born (TNB), and the number of dead piglets at day 11 (D11) were estimated using data obtained from an organic pig population in Denmark. Based on these estimates, two alternative breeding schemes were simulated. Specifically, selection was made using: (1) a breeding goal with L11 only versus (2) a breeding goal with TNB and D11. Different weightings for TNB and D11 were tested. The simulations showed that selection using the first breeding scheme (L11) produced lower annual genetic gain (0.201) compared to the second (TNB and D11; 0.207). A sensitivity analysis showed that the second scheme performed better because it exploited differences in heritability, and accounted for genetic correlations between the two traits. When the second breeding scheme placed more emphasis on D11, D11 declined, whereas genetic gain for L11 remained high (0.190). In conclusion, selection for L11 could be optimized by separating it into two correlated traits with different heritability, reducing piglet mortality and enhancing L11.

AB  - Animal behaviors are key signs of animals' stress, disease, and overall well-being. This study was conducted in an experimental farrowing building using eighteen sow pens: nine exposed to natural heat stress under summer indoor temperatures and nine receiving cooling treatments via innovative cooling pads. Sow and piglet behaviors were recorded in an ethogram through direct visual observation every 5 min for 48 h. Passive infrared detectors were used for continuous pig behavior monitoring every sec. Zmodo wireless cameras were used for video monitoring to validate sensor detection results. Visual observation revealed distinct pig behaviors between the treatments. The sows had peak times in eating, standing, and drinking approximately from 05:00 to 12:00 and from 16:00 to 22:00. The sows under heat stress spent 49.3% more time lying (p < 0.01). They spent 10.7% less time sleeping (p < 0.05). Piglets under heat stress spent more time sleeping but less time nursing. The sensor outputs and pig moving behaviors (i.e., sow eating + standing + drinking + sitting + piglet walking) had a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.81 for heat stress and rho = 0.74 for cooling). In contrast, there were strong-to-moderate negative correlations (rho = -0.77 for heat stress and rho = -0.56 for cooling) between the sensor outputs and sow on-body behaviors (i.e., sow lying + nursing + sleeping). Video recordings validated the response and sensitivity of the sensors, with them able to quickly capture changes in pig behaviors and provide behavioral information about the nuanced pig movements.

AB  - Studying the effects of predation in cryptic herbivorous insects is difficult because many spend all or most of their life cycle inside their host plant. Here, we designed and 3D-printed artificial coffee berries to study predation of coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), by flat bark beetles, Cathartus quadricollis (Guerin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae). The 3D-printed berries were tested under laboratory and field conditions and the results confirmed the usefulness of 3D-printed materials to create life-like models for studying predation.

AB  - In vitro maturation (IVM) is a very important technology for the modernization of animal husbandry. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mitochondria-targeting antioxidant mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ) was known for its protective role in a variety of tissues and cells; however, its function in Tibetan sheep oocytes is not fully understood. This study used a Tibetan sheep model to evaluate the effects of oocytes exposed to MitoQ on maturation and subsequent embryonic development. During IVM, cumulus-oocyte-complexes were exposed to 0-400 nM MitoQ to evaluate the viability of cumulus cells expansion and oocyte maturation, and determine the optimal concentration of 100 nM. Here, we discovered that 100 nM MitoQ addition to the medium improved the Tibetan sheep oocyte maturation rate (P < 0.05) and cumulus cells expansion rate (P > 0.05). In addition, immunostaining showed that decreased ROS levels (P < 0.01), increased GSH levels (P < 0.01). MitoQ-treated oocytes showed enhanced mitochondrial activity (P < 0.01) and mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.05). MitoQ increased Ca2 + levels (P < 0.01) and attenuated early apoptosis (P < 0.01). No differences were observed for cleavage rate (P > 0.05), and improved number of blastocyst cells and the blastocyst rate (P < 0.05) after in vitro fertilization. Moreover, various genes associated with oocyte oxidative stress (GCLC, SOD1) in mature oocytes were beneficially regulated in the MitoQ-treated oocytes. In conclusion, MitoQ can enhance the oocyte maturation rate, improve subsequent embryonic development in Tibetan sheep.

KW  - image processing
AB  - Classifying sports videos is complex due to their dynamic nature. Traditional methods, like optical flow and the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), are limited by their need for expertise and lack of universality. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers more effective feature recognition in sports videos, but standard CNNs struggle with fast-paced or low-resolution sports videos. Our novel neural network model addresses these challenges. It begins by selecting important frames from sports footage and applying a fuzzy noise reduction algorithm to enhance video quality. The model then uses a bifurcated neural network to extract detailed features, leading to a densely connected neural network with a specific activation function for categorizing videos. We tested our model on a High-Definition Sports Video Dataset covering over 20 sports and a low-resolution dataset. Our model outperformed established classifiers like DenseNet, VggNet, Inception v3, and ResNet-50. It achieved high precision (0.9718), accuracy (0.9804), F-score (0.9761), and recall (0.9723) on the high-resolution dataset, and significantly better precision (0.8725) on the low-resolution dataset. Correspondingly, the highest values on the matrix of four traditional models are: precision (0.9690), accuracy (0.9781), F-score (0.9670), recall (0.9681) on the high-resolution dataset, and precision (0.8627) on the low-resolution dataset. This demonstrates our model's superior performance in sports video classification under various conditions, including rapid motion and low resolution. It marks a significant step forward in sports data analytics and content categorization.

AB  - Litter size is an important indicator to measure the production capacity of commercial pigs. Spontaneous embryo loss is an essential factor in determining sow litter size. In early pregnancy, spontaneous embryo loss in porcine is as high as 20-30% during embryo implantation. However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying spontaneous embryo loss at the end of embryo implantation remains unknown. Therefore, we comprehensively used small RNA sequencing technology, bioinformatics analysis, and molecular experiments to determine the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in the healthy and arresting embryo implantation site of porcine endometrium on day of gestation (DG) 28. A total of 464 miRNAs were identified in arresting endometrium (AE) and healthy endometrium (HE), and 139 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were screened. We combined the mRNA sequencing dataset from the SRA database to predict the target genes of these miRNAs. A quantitative real-time PCR assay identified the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed on differentially expressed target genes of DEMs, mainly enriched in epithelial development and amino acids metabolism-related pathways. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the dual-luciferase report gene assay to confirm miRNA and predicted target gene binding. miR-205 may inhibit its expression by combining 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTR) of tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1 (TINAGL1). The resulting inhibition of angiogenesis in the maternal endometrium ultimately leads to the formation of arresting embryos during the implantation period. This study provides a reference for the effect of miRNA on the successful implantation of pig embryos in early gestation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways are often thought to interact antagonistically in plants when mediating anti-herbivore resistance. However, we previously found that the two pathways in tea plant interact synergistically when treated with 1.5 mmol/L methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 20 mmol/L SA at 12 h intervals (MeJA+SA treatment). Here, we investigated how and why JA-SA synergism in tea plants affected chemotaxis of Parapanteles hyposidrae (Wilkinson) wasps, the parasite of tea geometers.RESULTSWasp attractiveness of MeJA+SA-treated plants was 1.3-fold higher than MeJA-treated plants, although SA-treated plants could not attract more wasps. Five attractive compounds, including (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), indole and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, were emitted more by MeJA+SA-treated than MeJA-treated plants. Based on the difference in volatiles induced by MeJA and MeJA+SA treatments, five attractive components were separately added to artificial MeJA-induced volatiles (MV) or taken out from artificial MeJA+SA-induced volatiles (MSV). The attractiveness of MV to wasps was enhanced when DMNT or indole was added, whereas the attractiveness of MSV decreased when DMNT, indole or linalool was taken out. When DMNT and indole were both added into MV, the attractiveness of volatile blend to wasps became similar to MSV.CONCLUSIONIncreased DMNT and indole emissions are the key cues causing volatiles mediated by JA-SA synergism to be more attractive to P. hyposidrae wasps than those mediated by JA pathway alone. This provides new insights into the phytohormone pathway networks in tea plants and the development of natural enemy attractants. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Available phosphorus (AP) deficiency in soil is an important limiting factor in agricultural and forestry production. Thus, microbes with high P mobilization capacity are of great concern, especially for acidic soil where most P is fixed by Fe. Camellia oleifera is a typical acidic soil-planted oil crop with a high status in forestry economic systems in China. In this study, Streptomyces sp. CoT10 was screened and identified from C. oleifera endophytes. CoT10 could effectively mobilize different P resources, particularly showing a high solubility of 72.49 mg L-1 for FePO4, and was prominent in the production of different siderophores. Here, we initially assumed and confirmed that the Fe-P mobilization function of CoT10 was directly mediated by its siderophores. Application of CoT10 in C. oleifera could benefit P fraction transformation by mobilizing insoluble P and Fe, thus improving 15.35% AP content in soil and promoting plant growth with high P and Fe acquisition. In addition, CoT10 inoculation improved microbial diversity, with the proportions of some dominant groups, such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, obviously enriched by 21.32%, 7.93%, and 38.95%, respectively. In addition, redundancy analysis (RDA), network analysis and functional prediction indicated that CoT10 inocu-lation improved the microbial interactions in C. oleifera rhizosphere soil and balanced the soil microbial P-and Fe-related functional roles. The results of Streptomyces sp. CoT10 and its siderophores provide a valuable approach to regulate P mobilization in iron-rich soil for the sustainable and eco-friendly development of plant -related industries.

AB  - The current study aimed to produce synbiotic cheese, adding inulin and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis as prebiotics and probiotics, respectively. The physicochemical analysis, minerals and organic acids content, sensory evaluation, and probiotic count of the cheese were performed during the ripening. The significant effect of inulin (p <= 0.01) was found during the ripening period, and changes in physiochemical composition, minerals, and organic acid contents were also observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the cheese revealed that inulin could improve the cheese structure. Meanwhile, inulin increased the likeliness of the cheese, and its probiotic viability remained above 10(7) colony forming unit (CFU) per gram during ripening.

AB  - Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, has brought about enormous human suffering and tremendous economic burden to animal husbandry in China. However, Inner Mongolia is the hardest hit area of brucellosis in China. A total of 132,037 human cases have been reported from 2010 to 2020. Endogenous mechanisms of brucellosis spreading across Inner Mongolia till remains to be revealed. We propose a periodic epidemic model to investigate the effect of periodic parameter changes on brucellosis epidemics. Then we evaluate the basic reproduction number R-0 and analyze the global dynamics of the model. Furthermore, key parameters related to periodic transmission are estimated based on the monthly data of human brucellosis cases and the trend of newly infected human brucellosis cases are predicted in Inner Mongolia. Our modeling results illustrate that periodical birth and sheep shearing play a significant role in inducing periodical outbreak of brucellosis in Inner Mongolia. Moreover, it is exhibited that the annual peak number and the final scale of human brucellosis cases will he reduced dramatically with the delayed peak time of sheep birth. While the annual peak time will be lagged and the annual peak number will be decreased as the peak time of sheep shearing is postponed. In addition, we discover that it is difficult to stem brucellosis even if all sheep are vaccinated besides ewes. Nevertheless, the detection rate exceed a certain value 0.032 or the decaying rate of Brucella surpass a critical value 0.585, the human brucellosis can be regulated in Inner Mongolia according to the sensitivity analysis of R-0. The insights shed herein may contribute to the careful implementation of brucellosis control strategics in other regions.

AB  - Objective Bradykinin and bradykinin B2 receptors (B2R) play important roles in the enteric nervous system. Bradykinin is usually involved in inflammation and neuroprotection, dependent on the bradykinin-induced formation of prostaglandins (PGs). Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs. This study aimed to investigate the effect and the signaling mechanism of bradykinin stimulation on the release of prostaglandin E2 (pGE2) and the expression of COX2 in the enteric nervous system of guinea pigs. Methods Immunofluorescence was used to detecting the colocalization of COX2 with neural markers Anti-Hu and chAT in the primary cultured ileal submucosal plexus of guinea pigs. PCR and Western blot were used to detecting the effect of bradykinin evoking COX2 expression. Bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R) antagonist Leu-8 and B2R antagonist HOE-140 were preincubated before bradykinin stimulation. COX2 antagonist NS398 and COX1 antagonist FR12207 were used to observing the effect of bradykinin-induced pEG2 release. Results The results showed that COX2 was co-localized with neural markers Anti-Hu and chAT on ileal submucosal plexuses. Bradykinin induced COX2 expression was blocked by the B2R antagonist. The release of pGE2 by bradykinin stimulation in ileal submucosal plexuses was significantly decreased when incubating with the COX2 antagonist. Conclusion COX2 expression evoked by B2R signaling as an excitatory neurotransmitter in bradykinin stimulated pGE2 secretion, which provides a reasonable explanation for the role of bradykinin in intestinal inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Background Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii which is among the major agents of community-acquired pneumonia in French Guiana. Despite its relatively high incidence, its epidemiology in French Guiana remains unclear, and all previous studies have considered transmission from livestock unlikely, suggesting that a wild reservoir is responsible for transmission.
   Methods A country-wide seroprevalence survey of 2697 participants from French Guiana was conducted. Serum samples were tested for phase II IgG antibodies by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Factors associated with Q fever were investigated, and a serocatalytic model was used to reconstruct the annual force of infection.
   Findings The overall weighted seroprevalence was estimated at 9.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.2%-11.0%). The model revealed constant, low-level circulation across French Guiana, particularly affecting middle-aged males (odds ratio (OR): 3.0, 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.7-5.8) and individuals living close to sheep farms (OR: 4, 95% CrI: 1.5-12). The overall annual number of cases was estimated at 579 (95% CrI: 492-670). In the region around Cayenne, the main urban municipality, the high seroprevalence was explained by an outbreak that may have occurred between 1996 and 2003 and that infected 10% (95% CrI: 6.9%-14%) of the population and males and females alike.
   Interpretation This study reveals for the first time Q fever dynamics of transmission and the role of domestic livestock in transmission in French Guiana and highlights the urgent need to reinforce Q fever surveillance in livestocks of the entire Guianese territory.

AB  - Hematopoiesis occurs in different anatomical niches throughout the life of the individual. The first hematopoietic extra-embryonic stage is replaced by a intra-embryonic stage that occurs in a region that is adjacent to the dorsal aorta. Then, the prenatal hematopoietic function is continued by the liver and spleen, and later by the bone marrow. The objective of the present work was to describe the morphological characteristics of hepatic hematopoiesis in the alpaca and to analyze the proportion of the hematopoietic compartment of the organ and the cell types, at different times of ontogeny. Sixty-two alpaca samples were collected from the municipal slaughterhouse of Huancavelica, Peru. They were processed by routine histological techniques. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, special dyes, immunohistochemical techniques and supplementary analyses by lectinhistochemistry, were performed. The prenatal liver is an important structure in the expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Their hematopoietic activity was characterized by four stages: initiation, expansion, peak, and involution. The liver started its hematopoietic function at 21 days EGA and it was maintained until shortly before birth. Differences were found in the proportion and morphology of the hematopoietic tissue in the different groups corresponding to each gestational stage.

AB  - The present study aimed to use a comprehensive approach for evaluating 12 factors related to embryo quality (shape, size and transparency), donors (age, ET type, number of recovered embryos and day of uterine flushing), recipients (age), males (age and individual variations) and environment (season and year) which could affect the outcome of ET in terms of pregnancy (PR) and pregnancy losses in dromedary camels. During three breeding seasons, 116 donor females were mated repeatedly at 12- to 14-day intervals by fertile male camels (n = 33) without stimulation of the ovaries (WSPO). Superovulation (SPO ET) regimen was applied for each donor female twice or thrice per season. In the occasions of applying superovulation regimen, donor females having an ovulatory follicle were mated instead of GnRH administration and superovulation regimen was applied 4 days post-mating (MIX ET). The uteri of all donor females were flushed at Day 8 or 9 post-mating, and a total of 2,095 embryos were recovered and transferred individually to 924 recipient females. Pregnancy diagnoses were conducted at Day 10 after ET (Days 18-19 of gestation) by using progesterone assay and by transrectal ultrasonography (TRU) at Days 30 and 60 of gestation. By using logistic regression analysis, transparency of embryos and age of recipient females had significant effects on PR at Days 18-19 (p < .01), 30 (p < .01) and 60 (p p < .05, respectively) of gestation. The shape of embryos had significant effects on the PR at Days 30 (p < .05) and 60 (p < .01) of gestation. Type of ET and the breeding season (year) had significant (p < .05) effects on the PR at Day 30, while day of flushing had the same effect on PR at Day 60. Regarding the pregnancy losses, transparency and shape of the embryo, type of ET, breeding season had significant (p < .05) effect on the late embryonic mortalities (LEM) and shape and season of year had significant (p p < .05, respectively) effect on LEM/early foetal mortalities (EFM). Regarding male individual factor, there was a tendency for a significant (p = .055) effect of male camels on the PR at Days 18-19 and rate of LEM. In conclusion, transferring a spherical, transparent or a large-sized embryo (>750 mu m) into recipient females ageing between 8 and 11 y could greatly improve the PR from Days 18 to 60 of gestation. Also, embryo recovered from donor females with Mix ET type or embryos sired by certain male camel or at Day 8 post-mating of the donor could improve the 2-month PR. In addition, transferring a transparent or spherical-shaped embryo or embryos recovered from donor females with SPO or Mix ET could reduce the pregnancy losses during the first 2 months of pregnancy.

AB  - The animal product most used as a stimulatory additive for cell cultivation is still fetal bovine serum (FBS). Besides the ethical concerns regarding serum collection, the main problems of FBS are batch-to-batch variability and the resulting risk of lower reproducibility, the differences between species, the presence of undefined/unknown components, and the risk of contamination. In contrast, pig blood, which is a by-product of slaughter, is a sufficiently available and sustainable resource with a high degree of standardization in terms of donor age, weight, and genetics. The variations in preparations from pig slaughter blood seem to be comparatively low, and consequently, batch effects might be much smaller, suggesting that the reproducibility of the research data obtained may be increased. Our pilot study aimed to investigate, as a proof of concept, whether adult human and porcine stem cells of different tissue origins proliferate and differentiate adequately when FBS is completely or partially replaced by porcine serum (PS). We could show that the human and porcine stem cells were vital and proliferated under partial and full PS supplementation. Furthermore, using PS, the two cell types studied showed tissue-specific differentiation (i.e., lipid vacuoles as a sign of adipogenic or myotubes as a sign of myogenic differentiation). In conclusion, the pig slaughter blood-derived serum has promising potential to be a replacement for FBS in adult stem cell cultures. Therefore, it could serve as a basis for the development of new cell culture supplements.

AB  - While time spent in slow wave sleep (SWS) after learning promotes memory consolidation in the healthy brain, it is unclear if the same benefit is obtained in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are potentiated during SWS and thus may disrupt memory consolidation processes thought to depend on hippocampal-neocortical interactions. Here, we explored the relationship between SWS, IEDs, and overnight forgetting in patients with TLE. Nineteen patients with TLE studied object-scene pairs and memory was tested across a day of wakefulness (6 hrs) and across a night of sleep (16 hrs) while undergoing continuous scalp EEG monitoring. We found that time spent in SWS after learning was related to greater forgetting overnight. Longer duration in SWS and number of IEDs were each associated with greater forgetting, although the number of IEDs did not mediate the relationship between SWS and memory. Further research, particularly with intracranial recordings, is required to identify the mechanisms by which SWS and IEDs can be pathological to sleepdependent memory consolidation in patients with TLE.

AB  - BACKGROUND This 21-day study evaluated the effects of feeding durations of graded levels (RSL) of raw potato starch (RPS) or high amylose corn starch (HCS) on growth performance, energy utilization and intestinal biochemical metrics in broiler chickens. In total, 300 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 10 treatments: three RSL (25 and 50 g kg(-1 ) of RPS and 35 g kg(-1) of HCS) and three feeding durations (RSD) (21, 14 or 7 days), plus a corn-soybean meal control diet. RESULTS There were significant effects (P < 0.05) of RSL on feed conversion ratio (FCR), apparent ileal digestible energy (AIDE) and nitrogen-corrected metabolizable energy (AMEn). Birds fed 25 g kg(-1 )RPS had greater FCR than those fed 35 g kg(-1) HCS. The AIDE and AMEn were greater in birds fed 35 g kg(-1) HCS, except AIDE at 50 g kg(-1 ) RPS and control diets. The RSD x RSL interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for jejunal glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and RSD for mucin-2 (MUC-2) expression. Birds fed 25 g kg(-1) RPS for 21 and 14 days had higher GLP-2 expression than those fed for 7 days. MUC-2 expression was greater for 21 and 14 days of RS feeding than 7 days. CONCLUSION The RSL modulated growth performance and nutrient uptake, whereas gene expression was associated with RSD and RSL synergistic effects. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Small ruminant farming enterprises in eastern T & uuml;rkiye have the potential to establish a sustainable model for organic livestock production but face structural challenges. This study aimed to develop an organic livestock model based on sustainability by examining the socio-demographic characteristics, management practices, and perceptions regarding animal health and the welfare of small ruminant farmers in the eastern province of Mu & scedil;, T & uuml;rkiye. A face-to-face survey was conducted with 364 randomly selected farmers, assessing parameters such as animal genotype, pasture conditions, forage cultivation, chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, nutrition, reproduction, health services, and shelter conditions. Results showed that small ruminants in Mu & scedil; were well adapted to local conditions and were disease-resistant. They were fed with forage grown without chemicals and had unlimited outdoor and pasture access. The production process avoided hormones, antibiotics, and growth promoters, with reproduction occurring through natural mating. Challenges included inadequate pasture productivity, insufficient animal welfare conditions, low record-keeping rates, lack of effective organization, and insufficient awareness of organic practices among farmers. Notably, 81.9% of farmers described their pasture quality as moderate or poor, while 63.2% stated that they had no knowledge of organic practices. In conclusion, the Mu & scedil; model offered concepts that could aid the transition to organic livestock farming and support sustainable extensive small ruminant farming globally. Farmers should be educated, informed, and organized, with support throughout the supply and marketing processes.

AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) is involved in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway which regulates cell proliferation, polarity, differentiation, migration, metabolism and survival. However, the function of Ror2 in the silkworm Bombyx mori is still undisclosed. In the present investigation, we have made an effort to clone the silkworm Ror2 gene (BmRor2). The sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) was 1914 bp in size and encoded a protein with the conserved domains of Ror2 protein. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the BmRor2 gene expression level was the highest in the head among all identified tissues on 3rd day of the fifth instar larvae. In the gonads of the different development stages, the BmRor2 gene expression level was highest on the 4th day of the fourth instar larvae. The immunofluorescence assay indicated that the BmRor2 protein was located at the cytomembrane. The effects of BmRor2 protein on the expression levels of genes related to TGF-beta, Hippo, JAK-STAT and Notch signaling pathways were investigated by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of crumbs (crb), warts (wts), alpha-catenin (cat), four-jointed (fj), decapentaplegic (dpp), kibra ortholog (kibra), serrate (serr) and c-myc (myc) genes were down-regulated, whereas, suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (socs 2) gene expression was up-regulated in the cultured BmN cells after the BmRor2 expression level was up-regulated. Further, cell proliferation was demoted and the size of cells was decreased when BmRor2 expression level was elevated. Our current finding recommended that BmRo2 can regulate TGF- beta, Hippo, JAKSTAT, and Notch signaling pathways, and affect cell proliferation and size.

AB  - It would not surprise that two related termite species are similar in many traits, especially those related to reproduction such as similarity in sexual organs, spermathecae, gametes, glands in genital organs and micropyles of eggs. Because similarities of them are thought to be directly linked to increase their reproductive fitness. Moreover, the key data showing successful hybridization between the two termite species under laboratory conditions and in the field. The present study was conducted on the base of morphometric analyses and histological examinations of the sperm, testes, vas deferens, accessory glands, ejaculatory duct and spermathecae of Reticulitermes flaviceps and R. chinensis. The accessory glands of male alates were found without spermatozoa in both termites. The patterns of spermatogenesis in the alate testes of both species were quite similar and the gametes (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperm) produced in a sequence of essential developmental processes. The aflagellated sperm were transferred by male numerous times in a day after few copulations. They were stored alive in spermatheca by female and used for fertilization of oocytes. The nutrition was obtained by the sperm from the secretory cells, for a living and being functional during storage in the spermathecae. The spermathecae have finger shape and their thick walls divided into 4 type cells. Anatomically spermathecae of the two termite species consisted of lumens, ductules, and few glands, in thick wall structures. While the entire examinations revealed no more differences in the sexual organs of the two different species since R. flaviceps and R. chinensis can hybridize under experimental conditions as well as in wild to produce offspring. The similarity in the structure of sexual organs of both heterospecies provides possible evidence for the successful hybridization.

AB  - Simple Summary The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season had a devastating impact on native fauna. It was estimated that 3 billion animals were affected by the fires, but there are few accounts of the species or numbers of animals rescued and rehabilitated post-fire. We reviewed rescue, triage, rehabilitation and release reports for marsupials from two regions: the state of New South Wales (NSW) and Kangaroo Island, South Australia. In NSW, only 889 marsupial rescues were reported, despite estimates of 46.8 million marsupials inhabiting the fire zones. Three marsupial groups dominated the rescue statistics: kangaroos and wallabies (n = 458), koalas (n = 204), and possums (n = 162), with smaller numbers of other marsupial species. The probability of survival and release was lowest for kangaroos and wallabies (15% +/- 4%) compared with koalas (47% +/- 4%) and possums (55% +/- 10%). Injury type was a significant predictor of survival for all groups, with malnourished/moribund animals or those with traumatic injuries less likely to survive. In both jurisdictions, koalas were over-represented, and possums under-represented, in rescue statistics relative to baseline population densities and pre-fire wildlife rescue trends. Triage decisions also varied by species, with koalas more likely to enter care, whereas other species were more likely to be euthanised at triage. Koalas were more likely to die during rehabilitation, with 73% dying or being euthanised between day 1 and 30 post-rescue, representing a potential welfare concern. These species differences in presentation post-fire warrant further investigation, as do the differences in triage, survival and release outcomes. These data highlight the need for detailed record keeping and data sharing, and the development of consistent and evidence-based triage, treatment and euthanasia guidelines for all species.Abstract The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season had a devastating impact on native wildlife. It was estimated that 3 billion native animals were impacted by the fires, yet there are few estimates of the number of animals that were rescued and rehabilitated post-fire. Focusing on the state of New South Wales (NSW) and Kangaroo Island, South Australia, we used a case study approach to determine the number of marsupials that were reported rescued due to the 2019-2020 bushfires in these areas and analysed species-specific trends in rescue and release success. In NSW, we found 889 reports of fire-affected marsupials in 2019-2020, mostly comprising kangaroos and wallabies (macropods; n = 458), koalas (n = 204), and possums (n = 162), with a smaller number of wombats (n = 43) and other marsupial species. Most reports of fire-affected marsupials occurred 6-8 weeks after fire ignition, and there was no difference in temporal frequency of rescues between marsupial groups. For the three main groups, the probability of survival and subsequent release differed, with macropods having the lowest probability of release after rescue (0.15 +/- 0.04) compared to koalas (0.47 +/- 0.04) and possums (0.55 +/- 0.10). The type of injury was the main predictor of survival during rehabilitation for all three marsupial groups, with those malnourished/moribund or with traumatic injuries less likely to survive rehabilitation. Death or euthanasia occurred on the day of rescue for 77% of macropods, 48% of possums and 15% of koalas.
   Koalas most often died during rehabilitation rather than on the day of rescue, with 73% either dying or being euthanised between day 1 and 30 post-rescue, representing a potential welfare concern. On Kangaroo Island, koalas were the most frequently rescued marsupial species; most euthanasia cases and deaths occurred in a hospital, whereas other marsupials were mostly euthanised at triage. In both jurisdictions, koalas were over-represented while possums were under-represented relative to baseline population densities and wildlife rescue trends in the years before the 2019-2020 bushfires. These species differences in presentation post-fire warrant further investigation, as do the differences in triage, survival and release outcomes. It is hypothesised that the high intensity and large scale of the 2019-2020 fires impeded marsupial fire evasion tactics, as evidenced by the small number of animals found for rescue, and the differing rates of presentation relative to underlying population densities for the main marsupial groups. Based on our findings, there is a need for detailed record keeping and data sharing, development of consistent and evidence-based triage, treatment and euthanasia guidelines and deployment of trained wildlife emergency rescue teams with advanced search techniques to minimise animal suffering where safe to do so.

AB  - Weaknesses in the sheep meat production chain are largely related to non-specialized systems in the production of this product, which results in the supply of low-quality meat to the consumer market. In this regard, the intensification of animal management is becoming increasingly important. In this study, we evaluated the growth curves of Santa Ines lambs from the suckling phase to weaning to monitor their weight development according to sex and type of birth. Simple and multiple regression equations were evaluated to estimate live weight at weaning. We also found that the best equations for estimating the weight of lambs, regardless of sex and type of birth, were models with more than one biometric measure. However, from a practical point of view, body length and barrel girth can be efficiently used to estimate the weight of Santa Ines sheep at 84 days of age. Monitoring weight development is essential for decision-making and assessing the effectiveness of management strategies. However, this practice is often hindered by the lack of scales on farms. This study aimed to characterize the weight development and growth curves of male and female Santa Ines lambs from birth to weaning, managed on pasture with creep-fed concentrate supplementation. Data from 212 lambs during the pre-weaning phase were analyzed. The animals were weighed every seven days to evaluate total weight gain and average daily gain. Biometric measurements were taken every 28 days. Mixed models were used to assess the effects of sex and birth type on birth and weaning weights. Simple and multiple linear regression models were employed to estimate live weight using biometric measurements. The non-linear Gompertz model was utilized to describe weight development and formulate growth curves. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. An interaction effect between birth type and sex (p < 0.05) was noted for birth weight, with the lowest weight observed in twin-birth females (2.96 kg) and the highest in single-birth males (3.73 kg) and females (3.65 kg) (p > 0.05). Birth type significantly influenced average daily gain, total weight gain, and weaning weight (p < 0.05). The Gompertz model accurately depicted the growth curves, effectively describing the weight development. Pearson's correlation coefficients between biometric measurements and weight were positive and significant (p < 0.05), ranging from 0.599 for hip height to 0.847 for heart girth. Consequently, the simple and multiple regression equations demonstrated high precision in predicting weaning weight. In conclusion, twin-birth lambs receiving concentrate supplementation via creep-feeding and managed on pasture showed different developmental patterns compared to single-birth lambs under the same conditions. The Gompertz model proved effective for monitoring development during the pre-weaning phase. All simple and multiple linear regression models were effective in predicting weaning weight through biometric measurements. However, for practical application, the model incorporating two measurements-body length and abdominal circumference-is recommended.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of micropollutants on fish health from Segredo hydroelectric reservoir (HRS) along the Igua & ccedil;u River, Southern Brazil, contaminated by urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. This is the first comprehensive study assessment in the river after the severe drought in the 2020s in three fish species from different trophic levels Astyanax spp. (water column depth/omnivorous), Hypostomus commersoni (demersal/herbivorous), and Pimelodus maculatus (demersal/omnivorous). Animals, water, and sediment samples were collected from three distinct sites within the reservoir: Floresta (upstream), Iratim (middle), and Station (downstream). The chemical analysis revealed elevated concentrations of metals (Al, Cu, Fe) and the metalloid As in water, or Cu, Zn, and As in sediment, surpassing Brazilian regulatory limits, while the organic pollutants as DDT, PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs were found under the Brazilian regulatory limits. The metal bioaccumulation was higher in gills with no significant differences among sites. The species Astyanax spp. and H. commersoni displayed variations in hepatosomatic index (HSI) and P. maculatus in the condition factor index (K) between sites, while adverse effects due to micropollutants bioaccumulation were observed by biochemical, genotoxic, and histopathological biomarkers. The principal component analysis and integrated biomarker response highlighted the upstream site Floresta as particularly inhospitable for biota, with distinctions based on trophic level. Consequently, this multifaceted approach, encompassing both fish biomarkers and chemical analyses, furnishes valuable insights into the potential toxic repercussions of micropollutant exposure. These findings offer crucial data for guiding management and conservation endeavors in the Igua & ccedil;u River.

AB  - Dietary studies on insectivorous bat species in Southeast Asia are relatively few. We studied diet of the intermediate horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis, and the temporal variations in prey resource use. We also measured prey availability in order to explore whether this species is a generalist or specialist feeder. A total of 665 fecal samples were collected from 133 captured individuals from January to December 2019 in a tropical rainforest of Penang Island (Malaysia). A descriptive analysis of samples revealed a total of eight insect prey orders. The main taxon was Coleoptera (Percent Volume >50%), followed by Isoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, respectively (5-15%). Neuroptera and Psocoptera were occasionally found in the samples (each <1%). This result exhibits a degree of dietary specialization on coleopterans although the diet composition was flexible and significantly varied over time (among months and within nights). Based on light trapping, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera were frequent insects in the study area, while Isoptera was seasonally abundant. The correlation between variation in the diet and light trap for each prey taxon was mostly not statistically significant, suggesting that R. affinis do not consume prey in proportion to abundance and alternatively may discriminate between prey items when foraging and take prey in rank order. Given this, we further investigated the heavy consumption of absolute abundance of Coleoptera (high-ranking prey in diet). As a result, coleopterans were included in the diet regardless of the abundance of other prey showing a pattern of dietary specialization.

AB  - 1-(2-(4-(4-ethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)ethanone (ETAP) is a novel hybrid compound containing 1,2,3-triazole and acetophenone. It exhibits antidepressant-like effects in male mice, linked to modulation of serotonergic receptors and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibition. This study aimed to evaluate the involvement of the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, as well as MAO-B activity inhibition, in the antidepressant-like effect of ETAP in male mice, and to evaluate the antidepressant-like effect of ETAP in female mice. Male mice were treated with different dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors antagonists 15 min before administering ETAP (1 mg/kg, intragastrically, i.g.). The tail suspension test (TST) was performed 30 minutes later. Different male mice were treated with ETAP (1 mg/kg, i.g.), and 30 minutes later, were euthanized to assess MAO-B activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. To evaluate the antidepressant- like of ETAP in female mice, ETAP (1 mg/kg, i.g.) was administered, followed by the TST and the forced swimming test (FST) 30 minutes later. The dopaminergic antagonists haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.), SCH23390 (0.01 mg/kg, subcutaneously, s.c.), and sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p.), as well the noradrenergic antagonists prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p.), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p.), prevented the antidepressant-like effect of ETAP in the TST. MAO-B activity was unaffected by ETAP in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. ETAP (1 mg/kg, i.g.) induced a significant antidepressant-like effect in female mice in the TST and FST. These findings provide valuable insights into the antidepressant-like effect of ETAP, highlighting its potential for developing more effective depression treatments.

AB  - Mitochondrial (mt) genomes have played a major role in elucidating evolutionary relationships in ticks (Ixodida), especially in soft ticks (Argasidae). Mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced for representatives of most of the genera and other major lineages. This includes members of the Afrotropical, Nearctic, Neotropical and Palearctic Pavlovskyella Pospelova-Shtrom, 1950, which is a subgenus of Ornithodoros Koch, 1844. These continent-associated lineages do not form a monophyletic group: rather, the subgenus Pavlovskyella is paraphyletic. The only zoogeographic region for which mt genomes are not available is the Australasian region. Here we report the first mt genome of an Australasian Pavlovskyella: Ornithodoros (Pavlovskyella) gurneyi Warburton, 1926, the kangaroo soft tick. The companion paper to the present work, Barker et al. (2025), presents the mt genome, 18S and 28S rRNA of the only other known Australasian Pavlovskyella, McMillan's Australian tree-hollow argasid, Ornithodoros (Pavlovskyella) macmillani Hoogstraal & Kohls, 1966.] Our phylogenetic trees reveal that the two Australasian Pavlovskyella have their own clade (i.e. are sister-taxa) which does not have a sister-group relationship with species of Pavlovskyella from any of the four other zoogeographic regions. We propose that the Pavlovskyella from the Afrotropical, Australasian, Nearctic, Neotropical and Palearctic zoogeographic regions have independent evolutionary histories and thus are best considered different genera. Molecular dating leads us to propose that continental drift may have caused the evolution of five different lineages of Pavlovskyella, each in a different zoogeographic region of the world.

AB  - Characterizing and understanding the processes that shape the structure of ecological networks, which represent who interacts with whom in a community, has many implications in ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation. A highly debated question is whether and how the structure of a bipartite ecological network differs between antagonistic (e.g. herbivory) and mutualistic (e.g. pollination) interaction types. Here, we tackle this question by using a multiscale characterization of network structure, machine learning tools, and a large database of empirical and simulated bipartite networks. Contrary to previous studies focusing on global structural metrics, such as nestedness and modularity, which concluded that antagonistic and mutualistic networks cannot be told apart from only their structure, we find that they can be told apart by combining a meso-scale characterization of their structure and supervised machine learning. Motif frequencies appear particularly informative, with an over-representation of densely connected motifs in antagonistic networks and of motifs with asymmetrical specialization in mutualistic networks. These structural properties can be used to predict the type of interaction with relatively good confidence. Beyond this classical mutualism/antagonism dichotomy, we also find significant structural uniqueness linked to specific ecologies (e.g. pollination, parasitism). Our results clarify structural differences between antagonistic and mutualistic networks and suggest the investigation of the structural uniqueness of specific ecologies as a promising approach for characterizing interactions beyond the coarse antagonistic/mutualistic dichotomy.

AB  - Simple Summary The unbalance between availability and needs of human organs has drawn researchers' attention to xenotransplantation as an option to cope with this shortage. Pig organs have received substantial attention for being comparable to human's; nevertheless, compatibility constrains still block clinical applications. Transgenesis of human complement regulatory proteins, including the CD55 gene and its product the decay-accelerating factor (DAF), has been proposed to overcome xenorejection. This line of research has obtained interesting results along the years; however, most works assessing the impact of this strategy for xenotransplantation are limited to analyzing gene expression and assessing resistance to conventional serum challenge hemolysis assays, which provide somewhat reduced information prior to surgery. In this work, we tried to expand the analysis of the hCD55 transgene performance beyond common practice and into a better molecular understanding of its impact in xenotransplantation. We determined hCD55 gene expression, as well as hDAF protein presence, in different organs from five transgenic pigs, comparing readings from organs worthy for transplantation and other non-valuable organs and tissues. We also assessed the ability of transgenic cells, compared to non-transgenic, to withstand hemolysis and cytolysis. Finally, we made an effort to establish potential correlations between the hCD55 mRNA and hDAF protein levels detected. Xenotransplantation of pig organs receives substantial attention for being comparable to human's. However, compatibility constraints involving hyper-acute rejection (HAR) still block clinical applications. Transgenesis of human complement regulatory proteins has been proposed to overcome xenorejection. Pigs expressing human-CD55 have been widely tested in experimental surgery. Still, no standardized method has been developed to determine tissue expression of human decay-accelerating factor (DAF), hCD55's product, or to predict the ability to overpass HAR. Here we describe objective procedures addressing this need. Organs and tissues from five hCD55 transgenic pigs were collected and classified according to their xenotransplantation value. The ability to overcome HAR was assessed by classical complement pathway hemolysis assays. Quantitative PCR mRNA expression and Western blot protein level studies were performed. Real-time cytotoxicity assays (RTCA) on fibroblast cultures exposed to baboon and human sera informed on longer-term rejection dynamics. While greater hCD55/DAF expression correlated with better performance, the results obtained varied among specimens. Interestingly, the individual with highest mRNA and protein levels showed positive feedback for hCD55 transcript after challenge with human and baboon sera. Moreover, hCD55 expression correlated to DAF levels in the liver, lung and intestine, but not in the heart. Moreover, we found significant correlations among valuable and non-valuable tissues. In sum, the methodology proposed allows us to characterize the hCD55 transgene functioning and performance. Moreover, the correlations found could allow us to predict hCD55/DAF expression in surrogate tissues, thus eliminating the need for direct biopsies, resulting in preservation of organ integrity before xenotransplantation.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of temperature and rainfall on stem dynamics and the stability index in 5 cultivars of the genus Urochloa under semi-arid conditions. The cultivars evaluated were Camello I, Camello II, Mulato II, Convert 330 and Cobra, in a completely randomized design with 6 replicates. The temperature and precipitation during the evaluation period stimulated stem dynamics (P<0.05). Cobra and Mulato II cultivars presented densities higher than 4,000 stems/m2 on average, as a response to the higher number of tillers (769 and 718/ m2, respectively) even with a relatively high stem mortality (336 and 449 stems/m2, respectively). Having the maximum values of accumulated heat units during periods of little or no precipitation compromised the sward stability index (values <1.0). Cuts during the frost period (November) caused a 20 % increase in the mortality rate and, consequently, a decrease in the stability index of up to 0.83. The prevalent environmental conditions along with the continuous growth resulted in losses of stability of Urochloa cultivars, due to a lower tillering rate with respect to stems acute accent mortality rate.

AB  - Plant quality for herbivores is usually evaluated with molecular and physiological techniques and with herbivore performance bioassays. These performance assays are usually done either on intact plants or on detached plant parts, such as leaves, leaflets, and leaf discs. It is thus far unclear how performance experiments on intact plants and on plant parts compare. Plant quality may change in detached plant parts because of the mechanical wounding inflicted, which may induce plant defences. Moreover, plant defences are often systemic, i.e., involving the entire plant, and may not be fully expressed in leaf discs. We investigated the effects of plant quality on the performance of a phytophagous mite on intact plants and on leaf discs. Plant quality was manipulated by infesting intact tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L., Solanaceae) either with a strain of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) that induces plant defences, or with Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard, which suppresses defences, and using uninfested tomato plants as control. We subsequently evaluated the oviposition rate and survival of individual females of T. evansi on intact plants and on leaf discs as a measure of herbivore performance. The mites produced fewer eggs on detached leaf discs than on intact plants. However, the oviposition rate of T. evansi was lower on plants infested with the inducer T. urticae than on plants infested with the suppressor T. evansi, and than on uninfested plants, both on leaf discs and on intact plants. We conclude that both intact plants and leaf discs can be used to evaluate the effects of plant quality on performance of this herbivore.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acorn diets on the composition of fatty acid (FA) and the intramuscular fat (IMF) content in Yuxi black pigs. Methods: Ninety Yuxi black pigs with similar body weight (99.60 +/- 2.32 kg) were randomly divided into five groups. The control group was fed a basal diet, and the AD20, AD30, AD40, and AD50 groups were fed experimental diets which contained 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% acorns, respectively. The feeding experiment lasted for 120 days. Results: The results showed that compared with the control group, the content of SFA in longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris tissues in the AD30 group decreased by 8.57% and 20.10%, and the content of MUFA increased by 5.40% and 15.83%, respectively, while the PUFA content of biceps femoris increased by 5.40% (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the IMF content of the AD30 group was significantly higher than that of the control group in the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of the ATGL, PPAR gamma, and FABP4 genes in longissimus dorsi (p < 0.05) were up-regulated, and HSL were down-regulated (p < 0.05) in the AD30 group. In the biceps femoris of the AD30 group, it was observed that the expression levels of the ACC and FAS genes were up-regulated (p < 0.05), while HSL and ATGL genes were down-regulated (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the addition of appropriate amounts of acorn to the diet (a 30% acorn diet) could improve the nutritional value of pork.

AB  - Animal activity during the night period is of enormous importance, since it represents approximately half of animals' lives, and monitoring it during this period makes it possible to detect problems related to well-being and safety, and allows us to infer energy expenditure on the basis of their activity level. The present study analyzes a sheep activity dataset created during the night period to validate non-invasive techniques of monitoring that can be used to infer energy expenditure at night and to detect abnormal nocturnal activity. The study allowed us to detect cyclic changes in activity during the night period, which is composed of inactive and active periods, and to identify sheep lying positions. The analysis of the joint activity of the flock allowed us to perceive a time lag in the rest cycles, which consisted of periods of activity of ewes undone between elements of the flock. Although it does not allow us to identify the components of the period of inactivity, since the method used does not monitor brain activity, the results allow us to confirm the cyclical character of the nocturnal activity of sheep that has been reported in the literature, as well as their typical posture when lying down. Although this is an exploratory application with a very small number of animals, the similarity between the results obtained and the results documented in the existing literature, which have mostly been obtained using invasive methods, is encouraging, and suggests it is possible to rely on activity monitoring processes based on inertial sensors.

AB  - Simple Summary During pregnancy, maternal glucocorticoids control fetal growth and the maturation of fetal tissues. Synthetic glucocorticoids are commonly used to stimulate lung differentiation in pregnancies at high risk of premature birth. Despite their beneficial effects on fetal survival, their impact on the developing brain is less clear. Among postnatal factors that might have a profound effect on both the cognitive capacity and behavior of the offspring, high fructose consumption in the young population is of particular concern. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal synthetic glucocorticoid exposure additionally challenged with postnatal fructose overconsumption on locomotion, anxiety, and memory in adult male rat offspring. According to our results, prenatal glucocorticoid treatment induced changes in reactions to novel situations in male rats that might represent advantageous fetal developmental adaptation, while increased exploratory behavior, reduced anxiety, and improved ability to recognize novel objects could improve survival in an adverse postnatal environment. On the other hand, moderate fructose consumption did not appear to alter the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure, suggesting that fetal programming had a predominant influence.Abstract Early-life glucocorticoid overexposure induces diverse neurodevelopmental outcomes regarding stress reactivity and cognition. Increased fructose consumption has also been associated with alterations in cognitive capacity and behavior. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone exposure on synaptic plasticity, locomotion, anxiety, and recognition memory in adult male Wistar rat offspring, and whether these effects are potentiated by postnatal fructose consumption. Pregnant female rats were treated with dexamethasone during late gestation and male offspring were supplemented with a moderate dose of fructose. Recognition memory, locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed using a novel object recognition test, open-field test, and elevated plus maze, respectively. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity was estimated by the levels of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein 95, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II alpha, and their activating phosphorylations. Additionally, protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and its transcriptionally active phosphorylated form were evaluated. Prenatal dexamethasone treatment induced an anxiolytic-like effect, stimulation of exploratory behavior, and novelty preference associated with an increase in GR and GAP-43 protein levels in the hippocampus. Fructose overconsumption after weaning did not modify the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure. Applied prenatal dexamethasone treatment may induce changes in reactions to novel situations in male Wistar rats.

AB  - Despite China's considerable mercury (Hg) emissions, monitoring of methylmercury (MeHg) levels in its terrestrial environments remains limited. This study examined the occurrence and accumulation of MeHg in body feathers of 12 migratory terrestrial bird species originating from Siberia and northeastern China. Considerable variations in foraging habits and MeHg levels were observed among these species. Accipiters, including Eurasian and Japanese sparrowhawks (A. gularis and A. nisus) and northern goshawk (A. gentilis), along with insectivorous songbirds including grey-backed thrush (T. hortulorum) and orange-flanked bluetail (T. cyanurus), showed notable levels of MeHg (0.62-1.20 mg/kg). Up to 25 % of the individuals within these species were classified as low-risk based on feather Hg toxicity thresholds, while the remaining species fell into the no-risk category. Despite showing enriched 815N, MeHg concentrations in short-eared and long-eared owls (A. flammeus and A. otus) were lower than in sparrowhawks. The herbivorous oriental turtle dove (S. orientalis) exhibited significantly lower MeHg levels compared to all other species. There was a significant positive correlation between MeHg concentrations and 815N across species, highlighting the substantial biomagnification potential of MeHg within the terrestrial food web. Additionally, we found significantly higher MeHg levels in adults than juveniles in both sparrowhawk species. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing migratory bird feathers for monitoring terrestrial Hg contamination, and underscore the importance of further assessment.

AB  - We have completed the characterization of the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) myeloperoxidase (mpx) gene and protein, which we partially described in a previous study. The turbot mpx gene has 15 exons that encode a protein of 767 aa, with a signal peptide, propeptide and light and heavy chains, and also with haem cavities, a Ca+2-binding motif and several N- and O-glycosylation sites. The mature protein forms homodimers of about 150 kDa and is very abundant in turbot neutrophils. In addition to the mpx (epx2a) gene, another three peroxidase genes, named epx1, epx2b1 and epx2b2, were identified in the turbot genome. Epx1, Epx2b1 and Epx2b2 proteins also have signal peptides and many structural characteristics of mammalian MPO and eosinophil peroxidase (EPX). Mpx was strongly expressed in head kidney, while epx2b1 and epx2b2 were strongly expressed in the gills, and epx1 was not expressed in any of the tissues or organs analysed. In vitro stimulation of head kidney leucocytes with the parasite Philasterides dicentrarchi caused a decrease in mpx expression and an increase in epx2b1 expression over time. In turbot infected experimentally with P. dicentrarchi a significant increase in mpx expression in the head kidney was observed on day 7 postinfection, while the other genes were not regulated. However, mpx, epx2b1 and epx2b2 were downregulated in the gills of infected fish, and epx1 expression was not affected. These results suggest that the four genes responded differently to the same stimuli. Interestingly, BLAST analysis revealed that Epx1 and Mpx showed greater similarity to mammalian EPX than to MPO. Considering the phylogenetic and synteny data obtained, we concluded that the epx/mpx genes of Gnathostomes can be divided into three main clades: EPX1, which contains turbot epx1, EPX2, which contains turbot mpx (epx2a) and epx2b1 and epx2b2 genes, and a clade containing mammalian EPX and MPO (EPX/MPO). EPX/MPO and EPX2 clades share a common ancestor with the chondrichthyan elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) and the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) peroxidases. EPX2 was only found in fish and includes two sister groups. One of the groups includes turbot mpx and was only found in teleosts. Finally, the other group contains epx2b1 and epx2b2 genes, and epx2b1-2b2 loci share orthologous genes with other teleosts and also with holosteans, suggesting that these genes appeared earlier on than the mpx gene.

AB  - To facilitate the ongoing transition towards carbon neutrality, the use of renewable materials for additive manufacturing has become increasingly important. Here, we report for the first time the fabrication of microcapsules from biobased acrylate shells using microfluidics. To select the shell, a wide range of biobased acrylates disclosed in the literature was considered according to their tensile strength, ductile transition temperature and global availability. Once acrylate epoxidised soybean oil (AESO) was selected, its viscosity was adjusted to valuables suitable for the microfluidic device using two different diluting agents. Double emulsions were successfully produced using microfluidics, followed by photopolymerisation of the shell and characterisation of the capsules. Microcapsules containing AESO and isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) were produced with an outer diameter similar to 490 mu m, shell thickness ranging between 36 and 67 mu m, and production rates around 2.4 g/h. The mechanical properties of the shell were characterised as tensile strength of 29.2 +/- 7.7 MPa, Young's modulus of 1.7 +/- 0.4 GPa and the ductile transition temperature was estimated as 42 degrees C. To investigate physical triggering, microcapsules produced with a size of 481 +/- 4 pm and with a measured shell thickness around 6 pm were embedded in the cementitious matrix. The triggered shells were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the uniform distribution of the capsules in cement paste was confirmed using X-ray computed tomography (XCT). These advances can facilitate the wide application of biobased resins for the fabrication of microcapsules for self-healing in cementitious materials.

AB  - Intelligence can be referred to as the mental ability to learn, comprehend abstract concepts, and solve complex problems. Twin and adoption studies have provided insights into the influence of the familial environment and highlighted the importance of heritability in the development of cognition. Detecting the relative contribution of brain areas, neuronal structures, and connectomes has brought some understanding on how various brain areas, white/gray matter structures and neuronal connectivity process information and contribute to intelligence. Using histological, anatomical, electrophysiological, neuropsychological, neuro-imaging and molecular biology methods, several key concepts have emerged: 1) the parietofrontal-hippocampal integrations probably constitute a substrate for smart behavior, 2) neuronal activity results in structural plasticity of dendritic branches responsible for information transfer, critical for learning and memory, 3) intelligent people process information efficiently, 4) the environment triggers mnemonic epigenomic programs (via dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, loop interruption/formation and histone modification) conferring cognitive phenotypes throughout life, and 5) single/double DNA breaks are prominent in human brain disorders associated with cognitive impairment including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Along with these observations, molecular/cellular/biological studies have identified sets of specific genes associated with higher scores on intelligence tests. Interestingly, many of these genes are associated with dendritogenesis. Because dendrite structure/function is involved in cognition, the control of dendrite genesis/maintenance may be critical for understanding the landscape of general/specific cognitive ability and new pathways for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The sensitivity of pigs to deoxynivalenol (DON) might be increased by systemic inflammation (SI), which also has consequences for hepatic integrity. Liver lesions and a dys-regulated gene network might hamper hepatic handling and elimination of DON whereby the way of initiation of hepatic inflammation might play an additional role. First and second-pass exposure of the liver with LPS for triggering a SI was achieved by LPS infusion via pre- or post-hepatic venous route, respectively. Each infusion group was pre-conditioned either with a control diet (0.12 mg DON/kg diet) or with a DON-contaminated diet (4.59 mg DON/kg diet) for 4 wk. Liver transcriptome was evaluated at 195 min after starting infusions. DON exposure alone failed to modulate the mRNA expression significantly. However, pre- and post-hepatic LPS challenges prompted transcriptional responses in immune and metabolic levels. The mRNAs for B-cell lymphoma 2-like protein 11 as a key factor in apoptosis and IFN-gamma released by T cells were clearly up-regulated in DON-fed group infused with LPS post-hepatically. On the other hand, mRNAs for nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2, IFN-alpha and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 as ribosomal stress sensors were exclusively up-regulated in control pigs with pre-hepatic LPS infusion. These diverse effects were traced back to differences in TLR4 signalling.

AB  - Simple Summary: The occurrence of udder defects in ewes impacts the productive lifespan of the affected ewe and reduces their lamb production. This study investigated the effects of palpable udder defects on milk yield and milk composition in Romney ewes. The findings showed that the effect of udder-half defects on udder-half milk yield was substantial; however, there was no difference in individual (whole udder) ewe milk production between ewes with one udder-half defective and both normal udder-halves. This was due to a compensatory increase in milk production of the normal udder half when the other udder half was defective, with the exception being ewes that retained the defects for several weeks. No notable difference in milk composition was observed between defective and normal udder halves, except for solids non-fat (SNF). This study shows that udder defects affect milk production in non-dairy ewes, highlighting the potential effects on lamb production.
   In non-dairy ewes, udder defects hinder the survival and weight gain of their pre-weaned lambs. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of palpable udder defects on milk yield, somatic cell count (SCC), and milk composition in non-dairy Romney ewes. Ewes with a history of udder defects or normal udders were selected for the study. Of a total of 48 ewes that lambed, 30 ewes reared at least one lamb, and were milked six times, once weekly, for the first six weeks of lactation. Udder halves were palpated and scored at each milking event. Multivariate linear mixed models examined the impacts of udder defects on udder-half and whole-udder milk yield, SCC, and milk composition (fat, protein, lactose, total solids, and solids non-fat (SNF)). Across the six examinations, 24.7% of the total 352 udder-half examinations were observed to be defective. Udder halves that were defective at least once produced on average 57.9% less (p < 0.05) milk than normal udder halves, while normal udder halves with a contralateral defective half yielded 33.5% more (p < 0.05) milk than normal udder halves. Successive occurrence of both hard and lump udder defect categories in an udder-half, udder defect detection early in lactation, and a high frequency of udder defect detection were all associated with udder-half milk yield loss (p < 0.05). At the whole-udder level, no differences in milk yield (p > 0.05) were observed between those with one udder-half defective and both normal udder-halves. However, udders in which one udder half was categorised as hard but progressed to lump and remained as lump until 42 days of lactation produced less (p < 0.05) milk compared with normal udders. With the exception of SNF, there were no significant associations (p > 0.05) between milk composition parameters and udder defect. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of udder health in non-dairy ewes and the potential effect of udder defects on their lambs.

AB  - Dominance hierarchies can be interconnected with behaviours that are essential to manage social living, such as affiliative behaviours and social play, whose importance can already emerge in the early phases of life. Here, we carried out an observational study (all occurrences sampling) to investigate the possible interconnection between these three behavioural categories in a group of Maremmana beef cattle (n = 44, 6-21 months of age) in an extensive breeding system. We found that a clearly linear hierarchy is present in the group, and that the age of the animals positively correlated with their hierarchical ranks. Affiliative behaviours were directed up to the hierarchy: dominants received more affiliative behaviours and subordinates were generally starting the sessions, suggesting that affiliative behaviours may be used by subordinates to bond with dominants for possibly gaining some benefits. Social play mainly consisted of play fighting and dominant subjects played with the highest frequency. However, playful modality was independent from playmates' relative rank position, with longer-lasting sessions being characterized by unbalanced and unreciprocated patterns. This indicates that play fighting in cattle has a competitive rather than cooperative nature and that it may be used as physical training to develop competitive skills in all groupmates. When play fighting was punctuated by affiliative behaviours, the playful sessions lasted longer. In this view, affiliative behaviours can have a communicative value useful in downgrading the competition emerging during play fighting. In conclusion, under naturalistic conditions young animals of beef cattle express all the behavioural repertoire typical of adulthood and their agonistic, affiliative, and playful behaviours are strongly interconnected in shaping social dynamics. Thus, our study suggests that extensive farming conditions are ideal to study the behavioural strategies domestic animals enact to form cohesive social groups. Such information is needed to enhance management and welfare of domestic ungulates.

AB  - Grass-fed ruminant production does not have the convenience of feeding easily-storable grains during periods of low forage availability. This study examined the forage yield, quality, and utilization of warm- and cool-season annual forages grown under organic management during the mid-summer "feed gap" period. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. cv. Tetra Brand), winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack cv. common), oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Souris), millet (Panicum miliaceum L. cv. Crown Proso), corn (Zea mays L. cv. BMR84 and CM440 Canamaize), and sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench x Sorghum sudanense [Piper] Stapf cv. common) were grown in Carman, Manitoba, over 3 site-years in 2018 and 2019. Combined forage and weed dry matter (DM) yield was 7159 kg.ha(-1) for sorghum-sudangrass (29% weeds), 5506 kg.ha -1 for corn (36% weeds), 4687 kg.ha(-1) for oat (45% weeds), 4617 kg.ha(-1) for annual ryegrass (95% weeds), 4542 kg.ha(-1) for millet (28% weeds), and 2945 kg.ha(-1) for winter triticale (51% weeds); significant differences in crop and weed biomass were observed. All forage systems were palatable to sheep with utilization rates from 47% to 65%. When all quality parameters were considered, corn, winter triticale, millet, and oat displayed adequate quality for mid-summer grazing, while sorghum-sudangrass had suboptimal crude protein concentrations. Direct measurements of forage quality on weeds showed that weeds did not compromise forage quality. This Canadian first study demonstrated the potential of forage production for mid-summer grazing in an organic, grass-fed regime with oat, millet, and corn resulting in the best combination of yield and quality.

AB  - A previously developed Spherical-Gaussian method is used to incorporate 5-D anisotropy in two phase field models originally published by Moelans, here named epsilon and gamma models. Quaternions are used for representing both grains orientations and misorientations. A slice of fundamental zone for sigma 3 grain boundaries with given orientations and misorientations from Olmsted, are used to verify the outputted grain boundary energies under different cases. Local minima selected from the slice are kept as minima library and used in both models. 2-D gaussian switches are used to compare the studied system misorientations between pair of grains to the list of minima misorientations. The switch causes a reduction from the assigned base energy to that of the minima library energy, depending on the computed value. Using only 3 minima from the corners of the sigma 3 fundamental zone, the models are shown to reproduce energies in the full fundamental zone with a maximum error of around 30%. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is used to perform bicrystal simulations using both models; with variations in settings yielding close to accurate values as well as physical behaviors like faceting.

AB  - alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) is a protein implicated in physiological functions such as neurotransmitter release at the synapse and the regulation of gene expression in the nucleus. In addition, pathological aSyn assemblies are characteristic for a class of protein aggregation disorders referred to as synucleinopathies, where aSyn aggregates appear as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites or as glial cytoplasmic inclusions. We recently discovered a novel post -translational pyroglutamate (pGlu) modification at Gln79 of N-truncated aSyn that promotes oligomer formation and neurotoxicity in human synucleinopathies. A priori, the appearance of pGlu79-aSyn in vivo involves a two-step process of free N-terminal Gln79 residue generation and subsequent cyclization of Gln79 into pGlu79. Prime candidate enzymes for these processes are matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and glutaminyl cyclase (QC). Here, we analyzed the expression of aSyn, MMP-3, QC and pGlu79-aSyn in brains of two transgenic mouse models for synucleinopathies (BAC-SNCA and ASO) by triple immunofluorescent labellings and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We report a co-localization of these proteins in brain structures typically affected by aSyn pathology, namely hippocampus in BAC-SNCA mice and substantia nigra in ASO mice. In addition, Western blot analyses revealed a high abundance of QC, MMP-3 and transgenic human aSyn in brain stem and thalamus but lower levels in cortex/hippocampus, whereas endogenous mouse aSyn was found to be most abundant in cortex/ hippocampus, followed by thalamus and brain stem. During aging of ASO mice, we observed no differences between controls and transgenic mice in MMP-3 levels but higher QC content in thalamus of 6-month-old transgenic mice. Transgenic human aSyn abundance transiently increased and then showed decrease in oldest ASO mice analyzed. Immunohistochemistry revealed a successive increase in intraneuronal and extracellular formation of pGlu79-aSyn in substantia nigra during aging of ASO mice. Together, our data are supportive for a role of MMP-3 and QC in the generation of pGlu79-aSyn in brains affected by aSyn pathology.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal nutritionists are challenged to increase animal production with respect to competitiveness and efficiency yet at the same time produce products that are healthy for the consumer and friendly to the environment. Black (BTL) or green (GTL) tea leaves and their spent tea leaf residues (STL) are rich in polyphenols, and can be used to not only supplement animal diets but also reduce the environmental burden of their safe disposal. These tea products were assessed for their potential use as natural dietary additives in ruminant diets to not only optimize rumen in vitro digestibility and fermentation but also reduce methane (CH4) emission. Both types of tea leaves were effective in significantly reducing ammonia (NH3) and CH4 production without decreasing rumen degradability. Tea leaves and their STL inclusions increased the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio significantly. The GTL-containing diets had significantly greater rumen degradability but lower rumen NH3 compared with the BTL diets. Decreased rumen NH3 production in ruminants can be a possible sign of increasing bypass protein whilst reduced rumen CH4 release can be useful for enhancing energy use efficiency and environmentally friendly ruminant production. Black (BTL) or green (GTL) tea and their spent tea (STL) leaves can be used as natural dietary additives for ruminants. Experiment 1 used a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with four replicates (n = 4) to test the effects of three different inclusions of tea leaves at 0 (control), 50, and 100 g/kg DM of two different tea types (BTL and GTL) in two different total mixed diets containing either ryegrass hay (RH) or rice straw (RS) on in vitro rumen organic matter degradability (IVOMD), volatile fatty acids (VFA), pH, ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4) outputs over a 24 h incubation time. Experiment 2 followed a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with eight replicates (n = 8) to study the impacts of three different STL inclusions at 0, 100, and 200 g/kg DM of two different STL types (black and green) into two different total mixed diets containing either RH or RS on the same in vitro measurements. Both types of tea leaves decreased NH3 (p < 0.001) and CH4 (p < 0.01) without affecting (p > 0.05) rumen degradability, but the effect of their STL was less remarkable. Tea leaves and their STL inclusions improved (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio. Compared with BTL, GTL containing diets had higher IVOMD (p < 0.05) and A:P ratio (p < 0.05) but lower NH3 (p < 0.001). Reduced rumen NH3 and CH4 outputs can be useful for protein and energy use efficiency while an increased A:P ratio might lead to increased milk fat synthesis and reduced low-fat milk syndrome. The surplus or wasted tea leaf products could be used as sustainable sources of nutrients to optimize rumen function and minimize environmental impacts of feeding ruminant animals.

AB  - Mammals that live in cold climates endure months of exposure to low temperature in the winter. The incidence of respiratory diseases has increased. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic cold stress on lung inflammatory networks, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function via Yorkshire pig models, as well as the ameliorative effect of glucose as energy supplements. Here, two trials were conducted (chronic cold stress and glucose supplementation). The results showed that chronic cold stress induced obvious inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs and damaged the lung tissue structure. Compared with the Y-Con group, the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), nucleotide-binding domain, and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3), IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in the lungs of the Y-CS group was enhanced by chronic cold stress (p < 0.05). Moreover, chronic cold stress promoted the expression of the Bax and Mfn2 in lungs of Y-CS group (p < 0.05). Interestingly, dietary glucose supplementation significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs. Moreover, glucose supplementation inhibited the expression of TLR4, MyD88, HMGB1, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and Bax during chronic cold stress. In conclusion, chronic cold stress promoted inflammatory networks, apoptosis, and mitochondrial fusion in the lungs. Dietary glucose supplementation inhibited the inflammatory network during chronic cold stress.

AB  - The process of testis development in mammals is accompanied by the proliferation and maturation of Sertoli, Leydig and germ cells. Spermatogenesis depends on hormone regulation, which must bind to a receptor to exert its biological effects. The changes in Hu sheep testis cell composition and FSHR, LHR and AR expression during different developmental stages are unclear (newborn, puberty and adulthood). To address this, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed testis cell composition and hormone receptor expression changes during three important developmental stages of Hu sheep. We observed significant changes in the composition of somatic and germ cells in different Hu sheep testis developmental stages. Furthermore, we analyzed the FSHR, LHR and AR distribution and expression changes at three important periods and verified them by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Our results suggest that after birth, the proportion of germ cells increased gradually, peaking in adulthood; the proportion of Sertoli cells decreased gradually, reaching the lowest in adulthood; and the proportion of Leydig cells increased and then decreased, reaching the lowest in adulthood. In addition, FSHR, LHR and AR are mainly located in Sertoli, Leydig and germ cells. LHR and FSHR expression decreased with increasing age, while AR expression increased and then decreased with increasing age.

AB  - Sperm cytoplasmic droplets (CDs) are remnants of cytoplasm that can cause a number of problems if it not shed from the sperm after ejaculation. Exosomes can rapidly bind to sperm, but it is not clear whether exosomes can affect the migration and shedding of CDs. We first extracted and characterized seminal plasma exosomes from boar semen containing sperm with low or high rates of CDs. Then, the transcriptomic and proteomic detection of these exosomes were performed to analyze the differences between the two groups of seminal plasma exosomes. The results revealed that 486 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 40 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), and 503 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were identified between the low CD rate group and high CD rate group. Integrative multi-omics analysis showed that exosome components may affect migration and shedding of cytoplasmic droplets by influencing cytoskeletal regulation and insulin signaling, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, ECM-receptor interaction, axon guidance, insulin secretion, and the insulin signaling pathway. Overall, our study systematically revealed the DEGs, DEPs, and DElncRNAs in seminal plasma exosomes between low CD rate semen and high CD rate semen, which will help broaden our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the shedding of CDs.

AB  - Simple Summary Tingidae, or lace bugs, is a family of herbivorous true bugs, with approximately 2600 identified species in 318 genera classified in two or sometimes three subfamilies, among which the largest subfamily Tinginae comprises about 2500 species. Here, an account is given of the karyotypes of 16 lace bug species studied using conventional chromosomal techniques and FISH with two repetitive DNA probes, 18S rDNA and (TTAGG)(n). We also summarize and analyze all information accumulated to date on karyotypes of lace bugs. In general, such information is available for 60 species and 22 genera of Tinginae. We show that lace bugs are characterized by: (1) very conservative karyotypes, with six pairs of autosomes in a haploid set; (2) either an XY or X(0) sex chromosome system; (3) a conventional sequence of sex chromosome divisions in male meiosis; (4) absence of the (TTAGG)(n) mechanism for maintaining telomere integrity; (5) four discrete patterns of 18S rDNA chromosomal localization. We conclude that the search for chromosomal landmarks is of paramount importance for the characterization of the lace bug cytogenetics in more detail. The lace bug family Tingidae comprises more than 2600 described species in 318 genera that are classified into the subfamilies Tinginae (about 2500 species and 300 genera), Cantacaderinae, and Vianadinae. We provide data on karyotypes of 16 species belonging to 10 genera of the tribes Tingini and Acalyptaini (Tinginae) studied using conventional chromosome staining and FISH. The species of Tingini possess 2n = 12A + XY, whereas those of Acalyptaini have 2n = 12A + X(0). FISH for 18S rDNA revealed hybridization signals on one of the medium-sized bivalents in species of both tribes. FISH with a telomeric probe TTAGG produced no signals in any species. In addition, we provide a list of all data obtained to date on Tingidae karyotypes, which includes 60 species from 22 genera of Tinginae. The subfamily is highly conservative in relation to the number and size of autosomes, whereas it shows diversity in the number and chromosomal distribution of the rDNA arrays, which may be located either on a pair of autosomes (the predominant and supposedly ancestral pattern), on one or both sex chromosomes, or on an autosome pair and the X. The absence of the "insect" telomeric sequence TTAGG in all species implies that Tinginae have some other, yet unknown, telomere organization.

AB  - The selection of an appropriate promoter is important to the design and optimisation of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based cardiac gene therapies. The expression cassette design can impact efficacy and safety of the vector. This study is the first to use a novel AAV barcode-seq method for the simultaneous evaluation of a panel of cardiac-specific promoters in a high-throughput manner. Functional analyses of our cardiac promoter kit packaged in three different capsids were performed using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), HuH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, as well as mouse, rat, sheep and pig models. The cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter showed the most promise overall as a cardiac-specific promoter across all cardiac models tested. The results validate the barcode-seq technique as a powerful and versatile approach that enables high-throughput, quantitative analysis of various expression cassettes in commonly used models of cardiac gene therapy.

Thus, a balanced environment between free-radical production and the antioxidant-enzyme system is important. This study aimed to investigate differences in anti-oxidative activity in epididymis between high and low fertility levels of Hu sheep. A total of 179 Hu ram lambs aged 56 days were fed up to 6 months in the same environment. After feeding trial, all rams were slaughtered. According to the epididymis weight, cauda sperm concentration, and histo-morphological observation, 18 individuals were selected and divided into low fertility (n = 9) and high fertility (n = 9) groups. The RNA sequencing results showed 1404 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 735 genes upregulated and 669 genes downregulated in the high fertility group compared with the low fertility group. Sixteen DEGs related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, including GPX3, GPX5, LRP1, PLCB1, CRISP2, BSPH1, and ACSBG1, were screened by qPCR, and results were correlated well with the sequencing data. Antioxidative indices such as total antioxidant capacity (21.29 +/- 5.97 vs. 30.23 +/- 4.56 mM/gprot) and glutathione peroxidase (39.75 +/- 7.61 vs. 68.84 +/- 12.51 U/mgprot) increased in the high fertility group. However, the relative expression of mtDNA and malondialdehyde concentration (0.75 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.10 nmol/mgprot) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Therefore, epididymis from high-fertility group had strong antioxidative activity and protected spermatozoa from ROS. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study is focused on seasonal variation in groundwater quality, hydrochemistry, and associated human health risk in the Shivganga river basin, Western Maharashtra, India, to promote sustainable development of groundwater resources of this semi-arid region. The qualitative geochemical analysis, contamination levels, and human health risk assessment (HHRA) of groundwater are integral steps in groundwater management in the Deccan Plateau basalt flow region of India. Representative groundwater samples (n = 68) collected from the Shivganga River basin area of Pune district, Maharashtra, during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons in 2015 were analyzed for major cations and anions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO. 2017) drinking standards, EC. total dissolved solids, hardness, bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium surpassed the desirable limit. Boron and fluoride content exceeded the prescribed desirable limit of the WHO. The pollution and drinking suitability were assessed by computing pollution index of gmundwater (PIG), gmundwater quality index (GWQI), and HHRA particularly for boron and fluoride toxicity. PIG values inferred that about 6% of groundwater samples has moderate, 24% has low, and 70% has insignificant pollution in the PRM season, while only 1 sample (3%) showed high pollution, 6% showed low, and 91% showed insignificant pollution in the POM season. GWQI classification demonstrated that 27% and 15% samples are within the poor category, and only 15% and 18% of the samples fall into excellent water category in the PRIM and the POM seasons, respectively. Total hazard index (THI) revealed that 88% of children, 59% of adults, and about 38% of infants are exposed to non-carcinogenic risk, as THI values (>1) were noted for the PRM season, while 62% of children, 47% of adults, and 24% of infants are vulnerable to non-carcinogenic health hazard during the POM period.

AB  - Copper (Cu), an essential trace element in the metabolism of mammals, plays a central role in various metabolic processes. However, overdosing can lead to severe symptoms and even fatalities. Chronic Cu intoxication continues to be a problem in grazing and domestic animals, with sheep being particularly sensitive. There are few comparative studies on its impact on South American camelids (SACs). Therefore, this work presents the results of literature research combined with a case report on a 3-year-old female vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) presented to the clinic from a zoological garden in northern Germany. The animal showed reduced food intake, recumbency, bruxism, icteric mucous membranes and sclera. Auscultation revealed atony of the third compartment and the digestive tract. Similar to cases described in the literature, the animal showed rapid deterioration of its condition with unspecific symptoms of liver failure and rapid death. However, in contrast to descriptions in sheep, clinical icterus has not been previously reported in cases of other SACs. Laboratory findings from EDTA and serum samples revealed neutrophilia with a left shift, hypoproteinaemia, lymphopaenia, azotaemia, elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) in the serum. Hyperbilirubinaemia and significantly elevated serum and liver Cu levels were observed. Subsequent blood samples from the remaining vicunas and alpacas in the same enclosure showed no remarkable abnormalities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this case report represents the first documented case of Cu intoxication specifically in vicunas.

AB  - Environmental impacts of livestock production systems are a global concern, because of the large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses associated with feed production and livestock rearing. These losses are in part related to the system of livestock production and their feed rations and feed origin. This study aims to investigate the economic and environmental impacts of optimizing feed configurations of dairy farms in Inner Mongolia (China), using data from farm surveys, life cycle assessments and linear optimization programming. The findings of our study reveal that feed optimization may lower carbon footprints by 36-44%, nitrogen footprints by 35-42%, and phosphorus footprints by 42-71%, compared to the baseline. The need for cropland decreased by 11-38% per kilogram of milk, feed costs decreased by 15-48%, and net profit increased by 39-129%. Further, we found a statistically significant negative correlation between environmental footprints and feed self-sufficiency of dairy farms. Notably, energy-rich feeds, silage maize, and grass should be grown on-farm. These findings underscore the potential of adjusting feed rations and origin to decrease environmental footprints and enhance net profits of dairy farms. However, we observed several barriers to widespread adoption of optimal feed rations and origin, which relate to land scarcity, high land rental costs, and lack of trust and cooperation with nearby arable farms. Our research provides a scientific foundation for optimizing feed rations and origins for diverse dairy systems to achieve improved environmental and economic performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants, herbivores and natural enemies. Among these VOCs, methyl salicylate and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene are emitted as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) by soybean plants in response to feeding by the brown stink bug Eushistus heros. These HIPVs function as synomones, influencing the foraging behaviour of the egg parasitoid, Telenomus podisi, the main natural enemy of E. heros, one of the major soybean pests in Brazil. RESULTS: Laboratory experiments showed that two soybean cultivars, BRS 7580 and BRS 7880, produced similar qualitative blends of HIPVs, with methyl salicylate, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate being produced by both cultivars. Soybean cultivar BRS 7580 produced a significant lower amount of HIPVs compared to BRS 7880 but this difference did not affect the attractiveness of the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi. Field experiments using these two cultivars and synthetic applications of methyl salicylate and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene showed a substantial increase in egg parasitism in all treated areas. Parasitism rates ranged from 50% to 80% in areas where these HIPVs were deployed, compared to only 10% in untreated control areas. CONCLUSIONS: The egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi demonstrated an adept ability in recognising between HIPVs in soybean blends, even in the presence of significant quantitative differences. The results from the field experiment showed the potential of HIPVs in attracting natural enemies to specific target areas within fields. (E,E)-alpha-Farnesene showed an improved action during the later stages of soybean growth, notably at R6. In addition, this volatile attracted other families of natural enemies.

AB  - Working memory refers to the temporary retention of a small amount of information used in the execution of a cognitive task. The prefrontal cortex and its connections with thalamic subregions are thought to mediate specific aspects of working memory, including engaging with the hippocampus to mediate memory retrieval. We used an operant delayed-non match to position task, which does not require the hippocampus, to determine roles of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the nucleus reuniens thalamic region (RE), and their connection. We found that transient inactivation of the mPFC and RE using the GABA-A agonist muscimol led to a delayindependent reduction in behavioral performance in the delayed non-match to position paradigm. We used a chemogenetic approach to determine the directionality of the necessary circuitry for behavioral performance reliant on working memory. Specifically, when we targeted mPFC neurons that project to the RE (mPFC-RE) we found a delay-independent reduction in the delayed non-match to position task, but not when we targeted RE neurons that project to the mPFC (RE-mPFC). Our results suggest a broader role for the mPFC-RE circuit in mediating working memory beyond the connection with the hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a volatile substance derived from jasmonic acid (JA), and it responds to biotic and abiotic stresses by participating in interplant communication. Because MeJA is hydrophobic and it can easily move between plant cells, it is considered a propagable form of JA, which can utilize this method to induce plant defenses. Pests are able to 'eavesdrop' on plant signal molecules as cues for activating the detoxification system to protect themselves from plant defenses, and insects have evolved a variety of mechanisms to metabolize, sequester, or detoxify plant toxins. Spodoptera litura is an omnivorous insect that damages a variety of crops worldwide. We analyzed the growth of S. litura and its detoxification ability against xanthotoxin after exposure to different concentrations of MeJA fumigation, and the effective role of MeJA in inducing insects' defense response to the toxin was studied. We demonstrated that MeJA is effective at inducing S. litura defense response by increasing its detoxifying enzyme activities, but the enhanced detoxifying ability could not overcome the strong toxins. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a volatile substance derived from jasmonic acid (JA), and it responds to interbiotic and abiotic stresses by participating in interplant communication. Despite its function in interplant communication, the specific role of MeJA in insect defense responses is poorly understood. In this study, we found that carboxylesterase (CarE) activities, glutathione-S-transferase (GSTs) activities, and cytochrome mono-oxygenases (P450s) content increased more after the feeding of diets containing xanthotoxin, while larvae exposed to MeJA fumigation also showed higher enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner: lower and medium concentrations of MeJA induced higher detoxification enzyme activities than higher concentrations of MeJA. Moreover, MeJA improved the growth of larvae fed on the control diet without toxins and diets with lower concentrations of xanthotoxin (0.05%); however, MeJA could not protect the larvae against higher concentrations of xanthotoxin (0.1%, 0.2%). In summary, we demonstrated that MeJA is effective at inducing S. litura defense response, but the enhanced detoxifying ability could not overcome the strong toxins.

AB  - The most severe forms of kidney diseases are often associated with irreversible damage to the glomerular podocytes, the highly specialized epithelial cells that encase glomerular capillaries and regulate the removal of toxins and waste from the blood. Several studies revealed significant changes to podocyte cytoskeletal structure during disease onset, suggesting possible roles of cellular mechanosensing in podocyte responses to injury. Still, this topic remains underexplored partly due to the lack of appropriate in vitro models that closely recapitulate human podocyte biology. Here, we leveraged our previously established method for the derivation of mature podocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to help uncover the roles of yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator and mechanosensor, in podocyte injury response. We found that while the total expression levels of YAP remain relatively unchanged during Adriamycin (ADR)-induced podocyte injury, the YAP target genes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) are significantly downregulated. Intriguingly, TEAD1 is significantly downregulated in podocytes injured with ADR. By examining multiple independent modes of cellular injury, we found that CTGF and Cyr61 expression are downregulated only when podocytes were exposed to molecules known to disrupt the cell's mechanical integrity or cytoskeletal structure. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the YAP-TEAD1 signaling axis is disrupted when stem cell-derived human podocytes experience biomechanical injury. Together, these results could help improve the understanding of kidney disease mechanisms and highlight CTGF and Cyr61 as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for patient stratification.

AB  - Making decisions is fundamental to how we navigate, survive, and thrive in our environment. The quality of information used to support decisions is rarely perfect. Many decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty, arising from ambiguous or conflicting information. Conflict and ambiguity, though conceptually distinct, both generate uncertainty, a commonality that has led to overlapping and inconsistent terminology in the literature. Evidence from human and animal research suggests a behavioral dissociation in responding to conflict and ambiguity. This dissociation can be studied through the implementation of spatial or operant tasks in rodents which find close parallels in gambling tasks in humans. Pharmacological manipulations in rodents and fMRI studies in humans further suggest a dissociation in the neural processing of conflict and ambiguity such that fronto-striato-parietal circuits may be most important for interpreting ambiguous information, while the ventral striatum and ventral hippocampus are critical for resolving conflicting information. Overall, the neural representation and resolution of conflict and ambiguity remain relatively understudied despite the fundamental importance of these processes to understanding decision-making. We highlight the need for further research to differentiate these related yet distinct processes through implementation of carefully designed behavioral tasks with neural circuit-dissection techniques and the potential to pursue translational research between rodents and humans.

AB  - Introduction Trauma reexperiencing is dominated by recollection of sensory-perceptual elements of the trauma, pointing to involvement of the sensory thalamus. This study examined posttraumatic stress symptoms in relation to volumes of thalamic nuclei that were grouped based on their predominant functions. We hypothesized that reexperiencing, controlling for other symptom dimensions, would correlate with volumes of thalamic nuclei involved in primary and higher-order sensory processing. Methods Seventy-two trauma-exposed adults were interviewed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV and underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Scores were derived for reexperiencing, anxious arousal, dysphoric arousal, emotional numbing, and avoidance symptoms. These were entered as simultaneous predictors in five separate regression analyses, with age, sex, and total thalamus volume as covariates, predicting volumesf of five thalamus nuclear groupings corrected for intracranial volume: Specific sensory, associative-sensory, associative-cognitive, intralaminar, and motor groupings. Results Reexperiencing symptoms were significantly positively correlated with volumes of the motor thalamic grouping, which included the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventromedial nuclei. Anxious arousal was significantly negatively correlated with volumes of all five thalamic groupings. Conclusions Reexperiencing symptoms were correlated with volumes of the motor thalamus, while anxious arousal symptoms were related to all thalamic subregion volumes. Thalamic nuclei involved in motor functions, including oculomotor control and motor planning, may be implicated in posttraumatic reexperiencing symptoms.

AB  - In response to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion, proteolysis mediated by extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and its secreted ligand cyclophilin-A (CyPA) significantly contributes to cardiac injury and necrosis. Here, we aimed to investigate if, in addition to the effect on the funny current (I(f)), Ivabradine may also play a role against cardiac necrosis by reducing EMMPRIN/CyPA-mediated cardiac inflammation. In a porcine model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR), we found that administration of 0.3 mg/kg Ivabradine significantly improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac necrosis by day 7 after IR, detecting a significant increase in cardiac CyPA in the necrotic compared to the risk areas, which was inversely correlated with the levels of circulating CyPA detected in plasma samples from the same subjects. In testing whether Ivabradine may regulate the levels of CyPA, no changes in tissue CyPA were found in healthy pigs treated with 0.3 mg/kg Ivabradine, but interestingly, when analyzing the complex EMMPRIN/CyPA, rather high glycosylated EMMPRIN, which is required for EMMPRIN-mediated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation and increased CyPA bonding to low-glycosylated forms of EMMPRIN were detected by day 7 after IR in pigs treated with Ivabradine. To study the mechanism by which Ivabradine may prevent secretion of CyPA, we first found that Ivabradine was time-dependent in inhibiting co-localization of CyPA with the granule exocytosis marker vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 (VAMP1). However, Ivabradine had no effect on mRNA expression nor in the proteasome and lysosome degradation of CyPA. In conclusion, our results point toward CyPA, its ligand EMMPRIN, and the complex CyPA/EMMPRIN as important targets of Ivabradine in cardiac protection against IR.

AB  - Neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus play pivotal roles in modulating synaptic plasticity, shaping neuronal activity, and influencing learning and memory. Recently, it has been shown that the main sources of catecholamines to the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC), may have overlapping release of neurotransmitters and effects on the hippocampus. Therefore, to dissect the impacts of both VTA and LC circuits on hippocampal function, a thorough examination of how these pathways might differentially operate during behavior and learning is necessary. We therefore utilized two-photon microscopy to functionally image the activity of VTA and LC axons within the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in head-fixed male mice navigating linear paths within virtual reality (VR) environments. We found that within familiar environments some VTA axons and the vast majority of LC axons showed a correlation with the animals' running speed. However, as mice approached previously learned rewarded locations, a large majority of VTA axons exhibited a gradual ramping-up of activity, peaking at the reward location. In contrast, LC axons displayed a pre-movement signal predictive of the animal's transition from immobility to movement. Interestingly, a marked divergence emerged following a switch from the familiar to novel VR environments. Many LC axons showed large increases in activity that remained elevated for over a minute, while the previously observed VTA axon ramping-to- reward dynamics disappeared during the same period. In conclusion, these findings highlight distinct roles of VTA and LC catecholaminergic inputs in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region. These inputs encode unique information, with reward information in VTA inputs and novelty and kinematic information in LC inputs, likely contributing to differential modulation of hippocampal activity during behavior and learning.

AB  - Acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG) have been used as soft tissue graft substitutes for autografts in periodontal plastic surgical procedures. They have benefits like avoiding a second surgical site and patient morbidity that have been associated with autografts, but there is limited evidence available on their tissue response and wound healing process. This histomorphometric animal model study was carried out in mini pigs and it aimed to compare the two types of ADMG materials of porcine derivative with a control group through observation of parameters like epithelial and Keratinized layer thickness, angiogenesis, cellularity, matrix resorption, and inflammatory infiltrate. The surgical technique involved punctures on the edentulous areas stripping the epithelial tissue and exposing the underlying connective tissue, placement of the ADMGs in the appropriate control and test sites. Following this, gingival biopsies were procured at three different time intervals of 15, 45, and 90 days. There were significant differences in epithelial and Keratinized layer thickness among the three groups. This study concluded that there was no clear consensus on which graft material was superior but it gave an insight into the tissue response and wound healing process associated with the graft materials.

AB  - Dermatophytes are the group of keratinophilic fungi that cause superficial cutaneous infection, which traditionally belong to the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Dermatophyte infection is not only a threat to the health of small animals, but also an important zoonotic and public health issue because of the potential transmission from animals to humans. Rabbit dermatophytosis is often clinically identified; however, limited information was found in Asia. The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence and to evaluate the risk factors of dermatophytosis in pet rabbits in Northern Taiwan. Between March 2016 and October 2018, dander samples of pet rabbits were collected for fungal infection examination by Wood's lamp, microscopic examination (KOH preparation), fungal culture, and PCR assay (molecular identification). Z test and Fisher's exact test were performed to evaluate the potential risk factors, and logistic regression analysis was then performed to build the model of risk factors related to dermatophyte infection. Of the collected 250 dander samples of pet rabbits, 29 (11.6%) samples were positive for dermatophytes by molecular identification. In those samples, 28 samples were identified as the T. mentagrophytes complex and 1 sample was identified as M. canis. Based on the results of the Firth's bias reduction logistic analyses, animal source (rabbits purchased from pet shops) and number of rearing rabbits (three rabbits or more) were shown as the main risks for dermatophyte infection in the pet rabbits in Taiwan. The results of the present study elucidate the prevalence of rabbit dermatophyte infection, pathogens, and risk factors in Taiwan, and provide an important reference for the prevention and control of rabbit dermatophytosis.

AB  - Background Nitrogen is considered the most limiting nutrient element for herbivorous insects. To alleviate nitrogen limitation, insects have evolved various symbiotically mediated strategies that enable them to colonize nitrogen-poor habitats or exploit nitrogen-poor diets. In frugivorous tephritid larvae developing in fruit pulp under nitrogen stress, it remains largely unknown how nitrogen is obtained and larval development is completed. Results In this study, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics sequencing technologies as well as in vitro verification tests to uncover the mechanism underlying the nitrogen exploitation in the larvae of Bactrocera dorsalis. Our results showed that nitrogenous waste recycling (NWR) could be successfully driven by symbiotic bacteria, including Enterobacterales, Lactobacillales, Orbales, Pseudomonadales, Flavobacteriales, and Bacteroidales. In this process, urea hydrolysis in the larval gut was mainly mediated by Morganella morganii and Klebsiella oxytoca. In addition, core bacteria mediated essential amino acid (arginine excluded) biosynthesis by ammonium assimilation and transamination. Conclusions Symbiotic bacteria contribute to nitrogen transformation in the larvae of B. dorsalis in fruit pulp. Our findings suggest that the pattern of NWR is more likely to be applied by B. dorsalis, and M. morganii, K. oxytoca, and other urease-positive strains play vital roles in hydrolysing nitrogenous waste and providing metabolizable nitrogen for B. dorsalis.

AB  - - The Painted Wood Turtle (Rhinoclemmys pulcherrima) is a medium-sized turtle comprised of four subspecies that are distributed from northern Mexico to Costa Rica along the Pacific coast. Along this distribution, R. pulcherrima occurs in a variety of habitats, with many other turtle species, yet the ecology of R. pulcherrima remains poorly studied. Rhinoclemmys pulcherrima is popular in the international pet trade for its stunning red coloration, and in captive populations it is known as a semiterrestrial and omnivorous turtle. In this study, we conduct field work in 3 states in Mexico, and we use measurements on museum specimens to document ecology of R. pulcherrima. Field techniques utilized include visual encounter surveys, mark-recapture, radiotelemetry, and morphological measurements. This field work was complimented with limb, shell, and head measurements off all R. pulcherrima subspecies to explore potential ecological differences. Results from the field on the 3 subpopulations in Mexico demonstrated that R. p. pulcherrima and R. p. rogerbarbouri 1) exist in low densities and 2) occur near or in rocky-forest streams, and 3) adult size and sexual size dimorphisms can vary substantially among sites. Data on museum specimens suggest that southern subspecies (R. p. incisa and R. p. manni) could be more terrestrial, characterized by less interdigital webbing, taller shells, and larger heads than their northern counterparts R. p. pulcherrima and R. p. rogerbarbouri. This study provides the first ecological insight into the charismatic R. pulcherrima in the field and highlights important sources of variation among subpopulations and subspecies that merit future investigation. Last, our findings that R. pulcherrima exist in low densities is worrisome given that there is a high demand for all 4 species in the illegal pet trade.

AB  - Simple Summary A polyphenolic-rich extract from radiata pine bark (PBE) has been demonstrated to reduce in vitro ammonia nitrogen concentration without detrimentally affecting diet digestibility or ruminal fermentation parameters, suggesting that PBE can improve dietary protein use efficiency by increasing the protein outflow to the intestine. This in vivo study evaluates the effects of a short-term (21-d) supplementation with PBE at three concentrations (0, 1, and 2% dry matter basis) on animal performance, blood parameters, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in finishing Suffolk lambs. The supplementation with PBE improved sheep FA profile by (i) reducing the saturated FA and the sigma n-6/sigma n-3 ratio, (ii) increasing unsaturated FA, and (iii) increasing FAs that are beneficial to human health. Additionally, PBE supplementation enhances relative growth rate and dietary protein conversion without affecting intake, growth performance, blood parameters, or carcass traits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a short-term supplementation with a polyphenol-rich extract from radiata pine bark (PBE) on animal performance, blood parameters, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in finishing lambs. Twenty-seven Suffolk lambs (4 months old) fed a finishing diet were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: diet without PBE or diet supplemented with PBE on a 1 or 2% dry matter (DM) basis, for 35 d (14 d adaptation and 21 d of experimental period). Data were compared using Tukey's test and orthogonal and polynomial contrasts. The results indicated that the supplementation with PBE increased (p = 0.008) relative growth rate (RGR) and improved (p = 0.003) protein conversion (CPC), whereas weight gain, carcass characteristic, and blood parameters were unaffected (p >= 0.106). Total mono- and polyunsaturated FAs, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and vaccenic and oleic acids were linearly increased (p <= 0.016) by PBE supplementation. In contrast, total saturated FAs (sigma SFA), sigma n-6/sigma n-3 ratio, atherogenicity index (AI), thrombogenic index (TI), and the proportion of elaidic acid were linearly decreased (p <= 0.018). In conclusion, the supplementation with 1 or 2% DM of PBE improves subcutaneous FA profiles by increasing CLA and reducing sigma SFA, sigma n-6/sigma n-3 ratio, AI, and TI. Additionally, PBE supplementation has the potential to improve RGR and CPC, with unaffected intake, growth performance, blood parameters, or carcass characteristics.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is widespread in animal husbandry, which causes edema in immune organs and suppresses immune function of animals. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element involved in immune regulation and improves animals' immunity. In present study, growing and finishing pigs were used to determine the protective effects of the new organic Se (hydroxy selenomethionine, OH-SeMet) on dietary oxidative stress (DOS) induced inflammatory responses, and the corresponding response of selenotranscriptome in spleen and thymus. Forty castrated male pigs (25.0 +/- 3.0 kg) were randomly grouped into 5 dietary treatments (n = 8) and fed on basal diet (formulated with normal corn and normal oils) or oxidized diet (formulated with aged corn and oxidized oils) supplied with 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 mg Se/kg OH-SeMet, after 16 weeks, the corresponding indicators were determined. Results showed that DOS moderately increased the spleen and thymus index, decreased the antioxidant capacity of serum, spleen and thymus, and increased the concentration of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). The inflammatory response in spleen and thymus under DOS were discrepancies, DOS increased the expression of inflammation-related gene (IFN-beta and TNF-alpha) in thymus, while exhibited no impact on that of the spleen. Dietary OH-SeMet supplementation exhibited protective effects, which decreased the spleen and thymus index, improved the antioxidant capacity of serum, spleen and thymus, and decreased the serum IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels. Se supplementation exhibited limited impact on the inflammation-related genes in spleen, except decreased the mRNA expression of IL-8. On the contrary, Se supplementation showed more impact on that of the thymus, which decreased the mRNA expression of IL-8 and TNF-alpha, increased the expression of IFN-beta, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP1. In addition, selenotranscriptome responsive to dietary Se levels in spleen and thymus were discrepancies. Se supplementation increased the mRNA expression of the selenotranscriptome in thymus, while exhibited limited impact on that of in spleen. In conclusion, dietary OH-SeMet supplementation mitigates the DOS-induced immunological stress by increasing the antioxidant capacity and altering the expression of inflammation-related genes and selenotranscriptome in immune organs, and these response in spleen and thymus were discrepancies.

AB  - Introduction The differences of functional connectivity (FC) and functional asymmetry between left and right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (LMTLE and RMTLE) have not been completely clarified yet. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the FC changes and the FC asymmetric patterns of MTLE, and to compare the differences in FC and functional asymmetry between LMTLE and RMTLE. Methods In total, 12 LMTLE, 11 RMTLE patients, and 23 healthy controls (HC) were included. Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was used to evaluate FC. The right functional connectivity (rFC) and left functional connectivity (lFC) of each ROI were calculated. Asymmetry index (AI) was calculated based on the following formula: AI=100x(rFC-lFC)/[(rFC+lFC)/2]${\rm{AI\ }} = {\rm{\ }}100{\rm{\ }} \times {\rm{\ }}( {{\rm{rFC}} - {\rm{lFC}}} )/[ {( {{\rm{rFC}} + {\rm{lFC}}} )/2} ]$. Paired t-test and univariate analysis of variance were used to analyze FC asymmetry. Linear correlation analysis was performed between significant FC changes and lateralized ROIs and epilepsy onset age and duration. Results LMTLE and RMTLE patients showed different patterns of alteration in FC and functional asymmetry when compared with controls. RMTLE presented more extensive FC abnormalities than LMTLE. Regions in ipsilateral temporal lobe presented as central regions of abnormalities in both patient groups. In addition, the asymmetric characteristics of FC were reduced in MTLE compared with HC, with even more pronounced reduction for RMTLE group. Meanwhile, ROIs presented FC AI differences among the three groups were mostly involving left temporal lobe (L_hippo, L_amyg, L_TP, L_aMTG, and L_pTFusC). No correlation was found between significant FC changes and lateralized ROIs and epilepsy onset age and duration. Conclusion The FC and asymmetric features of MTLE are altered and involve both the temporal lobe and extra-temporal lobe. Furthermore, the altered FC and asymmetric features were distinctly affected in LMTLE and RMTLE compared to controls.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, poses a significant threat to greenhouse tomato production, potentially causing <= 40% yield loss. Although biological control using the specialist predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and generalist predator Macrolophus pygmaeus has proven effective in small-scale studies, their interactions in large commercial glasshouses remain poorly understood. This study develops a mathematical model incorporating spatial dynamics and multispecies interactions to bridge laboratory findings with commercial applications.RESULTSOur model incorporating diffusion patterns, plant defense and intraguild predation best predicted population dynamics (MSE: 0.221, 0.125 for T. urticae and P. persimilis, respectively). Spatial diffusion had the strongest impact on model accuracy, whereas all M. pygmaeus-induced effects were minimal in practice. The model achieved 77.2% directional accuracy in 3-week forecasts for T. urticae populations. Simulations revealed that early releases of P. persimilis (0.5 individuals per leaf) could effectively control T. urticae within 4 weeks.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates that many species interactions observed in small-scale experiments may not translate directly to effective biocontrol in commercial settings, which is likely to be a consequence of spatial dilution. We further found that spatial movements outweigh laboratory-observed effects. Lastly, our model enables 3-week advance predictions of T. urticae populations and provides evidence-based guidance for biocontrol agent release strategies, helping growers optimize their pest management decisions.

AB  - Most jurisdictions around the globe use leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs to find and fix methane leaks from oil and gas operations. In this work, we empirically evaluate the efficacy of LDAR programs using a large-scale, bottom-up, randomized controlled field experiment across similar to 200 oil and gas sites in Red Deer, Canada. We find that tanks are the single largest source of emissions, contributing to nearly 60% of the total emissions. The average number of leaks at treatment sites that underwent repair reduced by similar to 50% compared to the control sites. Although control sites did not see a reduction in the number of leaks, emissions reduced by approximately 36%, suggesting potential impact of routine maintenance activities to find and fix large leaks. By tracking tags on leaking equipment over time, we find a high degree of persistence; leaks that are repaired remain fixed in follow-up surveys, while non-repaired leaks remain emitting at a similar rate, suggesting that any increase in observed leak emissions following LDAR surveys are likely from new leaks. Our results show that a focus on equipment and sites that are prone to high emissions, such as tanks and oil sites, is key to cost-effective mitigation.

AB  - Several modeling tools commonly used for supporting flood risk assessment and management are highly effective in representing physical phenomena, but provide a rather limited understanding of the multiple implications that flood risk and flood risk reduction measures have on highly complex systems such as urban areas. In fact, most of the available modeling tools do not fully account for this complexity-and related uncertainty-which heavily affects the interconnections between urban systems evolution and flood risk, ultimately resulting in an ineffective flood risk management. The present research proposes an innovative methodological framework to support decision-makers involved in an urban regeneration process at a planning/strategic level, accounting for the multi-dimensional implications of flood risk and of different flood risk management strategies. The adopted approach is based on the use of System Thinking principles and participatory System Dynamics modeling techniques, and pursues an integration between scientific and stakeholder knowledge. Reference is made to one of the case studies of the CUSSH and CAMELLIA projects, namely Thamesmead (London), a formerly inhospitable marshland currently undergoing a process of urban regeneration, and perceived as being increasingly vulnerable to flooding. It represents an interesting opportunity for building a replicable modeling approach to integrate urban development dynamics with flood risk, ultimately supporting policy and decision-makers in identifying mitigation/prevention measures and understanding how they could help achieve multi-dimensional benefits (e.g., environmental, social and economic).
   Flooding is one of the most harmful natural disasters that cities may encounter, particularly considering the impacts of climate change and the highly dynamic evolution of urban areas. As traditional modeling approaches tend to provide an effective yet simplified view of flood risk assessment and management in urban areas, decision-makers need integrated approaches that can capture on the one hand the complex implications of flood events and flood risk management strategies in urban areas and, on the other hand, the impacts of urban development on flood risk. This work proposes an innovative approach based on qualitative modeling tools for urban flood risk analysis, which also incorporates the knowledge provided by local stakeholders. Although applied to a specific case study, the approach can be implemented in different contexts. The results highlight the importance of integrating urban dynamics and flood risk, especially in the preliminary identification of mitigation/prevention measures. However, further activities have already been started to support their operationalization.
   Stakeholders' knowledge can provide relevant insights into the urban dynamics related to flooding Causal Loop Diagrams support better integrating flood risk management in evolving urban systems Behavior Over Time graphs support scenario analysis including the impact of prevention/mitigation measures

AB  - An introduction to a novel habitat represents a challenge to plants because they likely would face new interactions and possibly different physical context. When plant populations arrive to a new region free from herbivores, we can expect an evolutionary change in their defense level, although this may be contingent on the type of defense, resistance or tolerance, and cost of defense. Here, we addressed questions on the evolution of tolerance to damage in non-native Spanish populations of Datura stramonium by means of two comparative greenhouse experiments. We found differences in seed production, specific leaf area, and biomass allocation to stems and roots between ranges. Compared to the Mexican native populations of this species, non-native populations produced less seeds despite damage and allocate more biomass to roots and less to stems, and had higher specific leaf area values. Plasticity to leaf damage was similar between populations and no difference in tolerance to damage between native and non-native populations was detected. Costs for tolerance were detected in both regions. Two plasticity traits of leaves were associated with tolerance and were similar between regions. These results suggest that tolerance remains beneficial to plants in the non-native region despite it incurs in fitness costs and that damage by herbivores is low in the non-native region. The study of the underlying traits of tolerance can improve our understanding on the evolution of tolerance in novel environments, free from plants' specialist herbivores.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea in piglets is caused by intestinal dysbiosis, characterized as an undesirable disruption of the physiological intestinal microbiota, which is associated with several stress factors, such as the isolation of piglets from sows, the adaptation to new environment and morphological changes in the intestine due to the transition from milk to solid feed intake. Pharmaceutical zinc oxide has been effectively used to alleviate these effects. However, since the dietary supplementation with pharmaceutical doses of zinc oxide (ZnO) in weaning pigs has been recently phased out in EU, this study aimed to determine the effect of a natural phytogenic formulation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and faecal microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Dietary inclusion of the natural phytogenic formulation significantly increased piglet performance and nutrient digestibility and reduced the E. coli and C. perfringens counts as well as the molar ratios of branched chain volatile fatty acids in faeces. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the tested natural phytogenic formulation could be considered as an effective alternative to pharmaceutical doses of ZnO to alleviate the challenges commonly occurring after weaning. A natural phytogenic formulation (NPF) was tested as an alternative to pharmaceutical zinc oxide (ZnO) in weaned piglets with respect to growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility and faecal microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Two dietary NPF levels (NPF: 1000 and 2000 mg/kg diet) were compared to a positive control (ZnO: 3000 mg ZnO/kg diet) and a negative control (CON: no added ZnO or NPF) using 84 weaned piglets from 29 d to 78 d (days of age). Feed conversion ratio was improved (p < 0.05) in ZnO and NPF piglets were compared to CON at 50 d. Dry matter, organic matter and crude protein (p < 0.05) digestibility was improved in NPF piglets compared to CON at 57 d. Compared to CON, NPF inclusion reduced E. coli (p < 0.05) and increased C. leptum subgroup (p < 0.01) at 57 d and 78 d, and reduced C. perfringens subgroup (p < 0.05; at 78 d). The ZnO reduced (p < 0.001) E. coli and C. perfringens subgroup (p < 0.01) compared to CON at 78 d. Moreover, ZnO and NPF reduced molar ratios of branched chain volatile fatty acids (p < 0.05) compared to CON, while NPF also increased butyric acid (p < 0.05) at 78 d. In conclusion, the NPF appeared to be a promising alternative to pharmaceutical doses of ZnO.

AB  - The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, in which epsilon 4 allele carriers have increased risk compared to the common epsilon 3 carriers. Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal and a potential neurotoxicant. We previously reported a gene-environment interaction (GxE) effect between ApoE4 and Cd that accelerates or increases the severity of the cognitive decline in ApoE4-knockin (ApoE4-KI) mice exposed to 0.6 mg/L CdCl2 through drinking water compared to control ApoE3-KI mice. However, the mechanisms underlying this GxE effect are not yet defined. Because Cd impairs adult neurogenesis, we investigated whether genetic and conditional stimulation of adult neurogenesis can functionally rescue Cd-induced cognitive impairment in ApoE4-KI mice. We crossed either ApoE4-KI or ApoE3-KI to an inducible Cre mouse strain, Nestin-CreER (TM):caMEK5-eGFP(loxP/loxP) (designated as caMEK5), to generate ApoE4-KI:caMEK5 and ApoE3-KI:caMEK5. Tamoxifen administration in these mice genetically and conditionally induces the expression of caMEK5 in adult neural stem/progenitor cells, enabling the stimulation of adult neurogenesis in the brain. Male ApoE4-KI:caMEK5 and ApoE3-KI:caMEK5 mice were exposed to 0.6 mg/L CdCl2 throughout the experiment, and tamoxifen was administered once Cd-induced impairment in spatial working memory was consistently observed. Cd exposure impaired spatial working memory earlier in ApoE4-KI:caMEK5 than in ApoE3-KI:caMEK5 mice. In both strains, these deficits were rescued after tamoxifen treatment. Consistent with these behavioral findings, tamoxifen treatment enhanced adult neurogenesis by increasing the morphological complexity of adult-born immature neurons. These results provide evidence for a direct link between impaired spatial memory and adult neurogenesis in this GxE model.

AB  - Clinical and animal studies have shown that gut microbiome disturbances can affect neural function and behaviors via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of several brain diseases. However, exactly how the gut microbiome modulates nervous system activity remains obscure. Here, using a single-cell nucleus sequencing approach, we sought to characterize the cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus derived from germ-free (GF), specific pathogen free, and colonized-GF mice. We found that the absence of gut microbiota resulted in cell-specific transcriptomic changes. Furthermore, microglia transcriptomes were preferentially influenced, which could be effectively reversed by microbial colonization. Significantly, the gut microbiome modulated the mutual transformation of microglial subpopulations in the two regions. Cross-species analysis showed that the transcriptome changes of these microglial subpopulations were mainly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), which were further supported by animal behavioral tests. Our findings demonstrate that gut microbiota mainly modulate the mutual transformation of microglial subtypes, which may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of AD and MDD.

AB  - Multivalent presentation of antigens using nanoparticles (NPs) as a platform is an effective strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines and thus induce a high level of organismal immune response. Our previous results showed that pre-existing porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) antibodies could increase the antibody levels of nanoparticle vaccines carried in PCV2 VLPs. Here, we have established a generalized nanoantigen display platform, Cap-Cat virus-like particles (VLPs). By combining PCV2 VLPs with the modular linker element SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 system, four porcine-derived viral protective antigens with different sizes and multimeric structures: the PRRSV B-cell epitope, the PEDV COE monomer, the CSFV E2 dimer, and the SIV HA trimer were efficiently demonstrated to elicit a strong immune response in mice. Crucially, the modification of antigens by the Cap-Cat VLPs platform enhanced the Th2 response and improved the Th1 response. The use of the platform demonstrates that HA antigen protects against lethal attacks by influenza viruses and reduces viral load in the lungs. We have demonstrated that the Cap-Cat VLPs platform demonstrates that antigens enhance the immune response by improving the processes of DC uptake, transport, lymph node (LN) localization, and immune cell activation. This "plug-and-display" assembly strategy facilitates the use of the Cap-Cat VLPs nanoantigen display platform for more applications and thus facilitates the development of more efficient, general-purpose porcine subunit vaccines.

AB  - This study explores the food transport efficiency of termite using an individual-based model. Termites are believed to have evolved tunneling patterns that optimize food search and transport efficiency. However, few studies have investigated transport efficiency due to the difficulty of field observations. The model is characterized by four control variables: the number of simulated termites participating in transport (k1), the distribution of high curvature sections of the termite tunnel (k2), a quantity related to the density of the tunnel sections (k3), and the duration of traffic jams (k4). As k3 increases, the total length of the high curvature section decreases. Our simulation results show that the E(k1, k2) maps for k3 and k4 contain two modes: Mode A shows that E decreases with increasing k1 due to an increase in traffic jams, while Mode B shows E increasing with increasing k1 due to a decrease in the density of curved sections and an increase in jamming resolution time. The partial rank correlation coefficient analysis reveals that k1 and k2 have a negative effect on E, while k3 and k4 have a positive effect, with k1 having the greatest influence on E, followed by k3, k4, and k2. The ecological implications of the simulation results are briefly described, and the limitations of the model are discussed.

AB  - Maytenus dhofarensis Sebsebe (Celestraceae) is a naturally growing shrub in Oman. It is not a reputed medicinal plant in Oman, but it is regionally endemic and causes shivering attacks on goats that graze on it. The chemical investigation of the hexane and chloroform extracts of the fruits and stems of M. dhofarensis afforded dihydro- beta-agarofuran-type sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloid (1), lupanyl myristoate (2) and lignanolactone (3). Compounds (1-3) are new isolates from M. dhofarensis. The structures of these compounds were assigned through comprehensive IR, NMR, and ESI-MS analyses, and the relative configurations of compounds 1 and 3 were deduced from density function theory (DFT) calculations and NMR experiments. Compound 1 was assayed against the kinase enzyme and showed no inhibition activity for p38 alpha and delta at a 10 mu M test concentration.

AB  - Numerous industries, including footwear, handicrafts, and the automobile industry, utilize leather materials. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of input power of the diode laser in laser cutting on vegetable chrome tanned buffalo leather to enhance the cutting process. In the present investigation, carbonization, kerf width, and material removal rate (MRR) were taken as performance measures. The diode-based laser beam machining was designed and fabricated with 2.5 W, 5.5 W, and 20 W diode laser to cut vegetable chrome tanned leather. The high-intensity 20 W diode laser produced lower carbonization, lower kerf width, and higher material removal rate compared with the 2.5 W and 5.5 W diodes. This improved performance was due to the adjustable features associated with this diode laser actuation in the form of circular shape with adjustable diameter. A high power with a lower spot size under pulsed mode can produce higher power density. Since a higher power density can establish less interaction time, it produces lower carbonization. Due to the ability of the 20 W diode laser driver to control the beam shape and size, it could produce a lower kerf width and higher MRR. The optimal parameters for cutting chrome vegetable tanned cow leather were a standoff distance of 18 mm, feed rate of 200 mm/min, and duty cycle of 70%.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary study with the aim of assessing the potential combined risk from consuming locally harvested food products in the Euro-Arctic region of Norway, Finland, and Russia. The three important contaminant groups-radioactive substances, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs)-were measured in food samples such as berries, mushrooms, fish, birds, reindeer, and moose; they were sampled in 2013-2015. To assess the combined pollution levels and investigate the trends, similarities, and variations between different contaminant groups, subsequent multivariate statistical analysis was performed. The results showed that, in general, the levels of radioactive substances, toxic elements, and POPs were below the permitted EU maximum content in food products. However, statistical analysis revealed some correlations, similarities, and peculiarities between the accumulation of different contaminants in various species, which allowed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of accumulation and interaction between different contaminant groups. It also gave a better insight into the possible added risks and helped pinpoint species that could serve as reference markers for the accumulation of different contaminants in food. Mushrooms, fish, and reindeer were found to be important markers in the combined risk assessments for the contents of metals and radioactive substances. Further research, as well as the development of methodologies for combined assessments, are recommended.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stress-related disorder which has been shown to be highly comorbid with, and commonly a precedent of, the eating disorders anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. The objective of this review is to discuss a potential overlapping neurobiological mechanism for this comorbidity. Alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission have been observed in all four of the aforementioned disorders. Excessive excitation via glutamate contributes to excitotoxicity, and over-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, both of which have implications for the deterioration of various brain structures. Prominent structures impacted include the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex, all of which are integral to the regulation of stress and eating. The current review suggests that altered glutamate function by trauma or extreme stress may facilitate PTSD and subsequent eating disorder onset, and that glutamatergic modulation may be a key treatment for individuals suffering from these conditions. This overlapping mechanism may help inform future research on individuals with comorbid PTSD and eating disorders, and it could also help inform ways to potentially prevent the onset of these conditions.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is the most devastating disease caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), impacting the pig industry worldwide and threatening food security and biodiversity. Although two vaccines have been approved in Vietnam to combat ASFV, the complexity of the virus, with its numerous open reading frames (ORFs), necessitates a more diverse vaccine strategy. Therefore, we focused on identifying and investigating the potential vaccine targets for developing a broad-spectrum defense against the virus. This study collected the genomic and/or transcriptomic data of different ASFV strains, specifically from in vitro studies, focusing on comparisons between genotypes I, II, and X, from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic differences between high-and low-virulence strains revealed six early genes, 13 late genes, and six short genes as potentially essential ORFs associated with high-virulence. In addition, many other ORFs (e.g., 14 multigene family members) are worth investigating. The results of this study provided candidate ORFs for developing ASF vaccines and therapies.

AB  - Physical activity and feeding patterns influence feed efficiency. This study aimed to examine feed and water intake, residual feed intake (RFI), and associated behavioral aspects in young Texel ewes using a multivariate approach. Forty Texel ewes (mean age: 130 +/- 7.54 days, mean body weight: 28.98 +/- 3.22 kg) were fed at an automatic feed and water station (Intergado (R)) for 72 days and classified by RFI as low (RFI-), medium (RFI +/-), or high (RFI+). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess variable influence on the sample distribution. The effect of RFI group on animal behavior was tested via Euclidean distance-based permutational analysis of variance, with effect size calculated using Eta squared (eta 2). Pairwise post-hoc comparisons were conducted on significant factors. PCA explained 66.6 % of the total variance, identifying key behavioral components related to water and feed consumption. Ewes consumed twice as much water as feed and exhibited more frequent visits to the trough than the drinking fountain. RFI significantly influenced animal behavior, with RFI+ ewes displaying higher water intake and more frequent visits to different feeders compared to RFI +/- and RFI- ewes. Behavior was most differentiated by water consumption traits, with RFI+ animals showing distinct patterns from RFI +/- and RFI- groups. These findings highlight the importance of water intake behavior in feed efficiency classification.

AB  - A process for extracting the antler tip peptides (ATPs) from Sika deer (Cervus nippon) antler tips was optimized using a method that combines single-factor experiment and response surface methodology. The optimal conditions involved papain as the hydrolase, an enzyme concentration of 5000 U/g, a hydrolysis time of 3.0 h, a temperature of 52.0 degrees C, a pH of 7.10, and a substrate concentration of 14%. Under these conditions, the clearance rate of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was 73.05 +/- 1.49%, and the degree of hydrolysis (DH) was 19.43 +/- 1.06%. The antioxidant compound ATPs-2 exhibited strong free radical and anion scavenging activity. In a model of Ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced oxidative damage, ATP-2 reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities, and alleviated UVB-induced cellular oxidative damage. A total of 6279 unique peptide sequences were identified in ATP-2, with 2496 potential bioactive peptides predicted using PeptideRanker. Of these, 12 peptides with PeptideRanker scores above 0.95 were analyzed using BIOPEP-UWM, identifying three antioxidant peptides: GPWPPGAP, GPAGPPGGPGL, and PGSPGPPGMPGP. Among them, GPWPPGAP displayed the highest antioxidant activity, with an IC50 value on DPPH radical of 1.1 mg/mL and a strong binding energy of -9.8 kcal/mol to MMP-1.

AB  - Stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders. Neuroinflammation is considered as one of the mechanisms by which stress alters the molecular and cellular plasticity in the nervous tissue and thus entails CNS dysfunction. The contribution of genetically determined features of the nervous system to the development of post-stress neuroinflammation has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, the dynamics of post-stress changes in mRNA levels of the il-1 ss and tnf genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 ss) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were evaluated in the blood and brain of two rat strains with high and low excitability thresholds of the nervous system (HT and LT, respectively). Changes in IL-1 ss and TNF mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR 24 h, 7, 24 and 60 days after long-term long-term emotional and painful stress in the blood and three brain structures involved in the development of post-stress pathology (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala). In highly excitable LT rats, IL- 1 ss mRNA level in the hippocampus and amygdala increased compared to the control 24 days after stress termination, while in low-excitable HT animals, an increase in the level of IL-1 ss mRNA was only detected in the hippocampus at the same time point. TNF mRNA level did not change in any of the rat strains at any of the post-stress time points. Genetically determined excitability of the nervous system is a promising marker of individual stress vulnerability, as manifested in post-stress disorders associated with developmental and time-course features of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tribal migratory shepherds (Gaddi) living in the Northwestern Himalayan region are well known for their nomadic lifestyle in which tribal migratory shepherds along with their livestock which mainly include sheep and goat migrate seasonally in the Northwestern Himalayan region from high hills to low hills for the survival of their livestock from cold winters and hot summer. Due to harsh environmental conditions, heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, wild animal attacks, no medical facilities, no transportation, and no electricity facilities tribal migratory shepherds mostly rely on plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use to treat livestock disease.
   Aim of study: The aim of our study is to conduct ethnoveterinary survey for the first time to document the contemporary oral ethnoveterinary knowledge of Gaddi shepherds living in Northwestern Himalayan region.
   Methodology: The documentation of plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use was executed through extensive field surveys from 2017 to 2019. Data were collected through direct interviews by administrating questionnaire among tribal migratory shepherds.
   Results: A total of 181 plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use belonging to the same or different families were documented during the seasonal migration of shepherds from Northwestern Himalayan region. Most frequently occurring family of plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary was Poaceae, leaves and roots were reported to be the most frequently used plant parts. Most frequently documented plant species for ethnoveterinary use were Cynodon dactylon, Chenopodium album, Zanthoxylum armatum, Aloe vera, Azadirachta indica and Cannabis sativa. Chrysopogon serrulatus, Cynodon dactylon, and Vitex negundo were reported with high use reports. Some of the endemic species of Northwestern Himalayan region such as Elymus himalayanus and Euphorbia pilosa and one endangered species Picrorhiza kurrooa were reported in current study.
   Conclusion: It is observed that there is a need to raise awareness among the tribal migratory shepherds about the sustainable use and conservation of some of the plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use.

AB  - Theta oscillations are believed to coordinate neuronal activity related to human cognition, especially for memory functions. Theta power during learning and retrieval has been found to correlate with memory performance success. Additionally, up-regulating theta oscillations during a post-encoding epoch crucial for memory consolidation was previously shown to benefit long-term memory for acquired motor sequences, pictures, and object-location associations. However, it remains to be determined whether such effects would be found for more ecological aspects of long-term episodic memory. Therefore, the current study assessed neurofeedback-based theta upregulation effects on movie memory. After viewing a 15-minute silent, narrative movie, participants engaged in neurofeedback-based theta/beta up-regulation, neurofeedback beta/theta up-regulation as an active control condition, or an unrelated passive control task. Memory was tested three times: once immediately after watching the movie (as baseline); 24 hours thereafter; and once again 1 week later. Memory performance 1 week after encoding was significantly enhanced in the theta/beta up-regulation group compared with the other groups. Additionally, changes in neurofeedback theta/beta ratio from baseline EEG recordings correlated with long-term memory gains in retrieving the movie's content. These findings highlight the relationship between post-learning theta oscillations and the consolidation of episodic memory for a naturalistic event.

AB  - Phenoloxidase (PO) is a significant biomolecule involved in humoral defence mechanism of invertebrates. Spontaneous melanization of insect haemolymph is the major hinderance for studying PO activity, as haemolymph was collected devoid of phenylthiourea. In the study, no visible melanization was observed in crude serum from the grub of Oryctes rhinoceros up to 30 min of incubation amongst crude haemolymph, diluted haemolymph, crude serum and diluted serum that were subjected to visual observation for spontaneous melanization reaction. Accordingly, crude serum was taken for evaluating PO activity. At the same time, as PO substrates tend to auto-oxidize and provide false optical density value, tris-buffered saline devoid of any substrates were used as blank for PO assays. The ideal wavelength at which maximum PO activity occurred for each substrate, namely, tyrosine, tyramine, dopamine, L-dopa, DL-dopa, catechol, protocatechuic acid and pyrogallol was determined as 407, 410, 429, 465, 403, 466, 428 and 400 nm, respectively. Additionally, time course of oxidation for each phenolic substrate by the serum PO were examined and DL-dopa was identified as the specific substrate for serum PO in the grub of O. rhinoceros. Furthermore, maximum PO activity was observed at 5 min of incubation for 10 mM of DL-dopa that was considered as optimum concentration. The ideal pH and temperature for serum PO activity was observed as 7.5 and 20 & DEG;C, respectively. These results suggested that standardizing a suitable substrate is an essential prerequisite to evaluate the real PO activity of serum which might significantly fluctuate in each insect model.

AB  - Lithium (Li), gallium (Ga) and indium (In) are industry-critical metals, with no known plant species that (hyper)accu-mulate these metals to any substantial degree. We hypothesised that sodium (Na) hyperaccumulators (i.e., halophytes) may accumulate Li, whilst aluminium (Al) hyperaccumulators may accumulate Ga and In, based on the chemical sim-ilarities of these elements. Experiments were conducted in hydroponics at various molar ratios for six weeks to deter-mine accumulation in roots and shoots of the target elements. For the Li experiment, the halophytes Atriplex amnicola, Salsola australis and Tecticornia pergranulata were subjected to Na and Li treatments, whilst for the Ga and In experi-ment, Camellia sinensis was exposed to Al, Ga, and In. The halophytes were able to accumulate high shoot Li and Na concentrations reaching up to similar to 10 g Li kg-1 and 80 g Na kg-1, respectively. The translocation factors for Li were higher than for Na (about two-fold) in A. amnicola and S. australis. The results from the Ga and In experiment show that C. sinensis is capable of accumulating high concentrations of Ga (mean 150 mg Ga kg-1), comparable with Al (mean 300 mg Al kg-1), but virtually no In (<20 mg In kg-1) in its leaves. Competition between Al and Ga suggests that Ga might be taken up via Al pathways in C. sinensis. The findings suggest that there are opportunities to explore Li and Ga phytomining on respective Li-and Ga-enriched mine water/soil/mine waste materials using halophytes and Al hyperaccumulators to complement the global supply of these critical metals.

AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system has been a recent focus of breeders owing to its potential to improve economically significant traits of livestock. The introduction of defined point mutations into the ovine genome via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair has been reported; however, indel and mosaic events observed in genetically modified animals limit the practical application of this system in sheep breeding. The FecGF mutation (g. G1111A, p. V371 M) in the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene is strongly associated with litter size in Belclare and Norwegian White Sheep. In the present study, we introduced the FecGF mutation in GDF9 by co-injecting the CRISPR/Cas9 system, single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN), and Scr7 into ovine zygotes. Scr7 at various concentrations (0 mu M, 1 mu M, and 2 mu M) had no adverse effects on embryonic development in vitro. No significant differences in total mutation, point mutation, and indel rates in embryos were observed among groups treated with different concentrations of Scr7. However, the mosaicism rates of embryos from zygotes microinjected with 1 and 2 mu M Scr7 were significantly lower than that for 0 mu M Scr7 (7.7% and 7.5% vs. 19.7%). We successfully obtained lambs with defined nucleotide substitutions by the coinjection of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, ssODN, and 1 mu M Scr7 into Altay sheep zygotes. The single nucleotide mutation efficiency was 7.69% (3/39) in newborn lambs, with one mosaic. Our findings provide evidence that Scr7 could improve the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the introduction of a defined point mutation in livestock to some extent.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Quick Wash (QW) treatment extracts phosphorus (P) from manure and municipal sludge (MS), producing an organic acidified by-product with adequate nitrogen (N):P ratio to meet crop N requirements. Yet, data on crop response to N using QW by-products are lacking. We evaluated the response of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and potential N leaching in sandy soil to N applications using raw wastes, their corresponding QW by-products, and ammonium sulfate (AMS) fertilizer. Treatments included a control (no amendment added), raw and acid-washed chicken litter, dairy and swine manure, MS, and AMS at 100, 200, and 400 kg N ha(-1). We found no significant differences in annual ryegrass yield and N uptake between the raw and acidified organic QW by-products. However, ryegrass produced 4-30% more biomass with AMS than organic amendments. The total residual soil inorganic N under AMS treatments ranged between 6.3 and 67.9 mg pot(-1) and accounted for 5-17% of the total N applied, but it was <1% for all the organic amendments. We found no differences in soil N leaching between raw and acid-washed forms of each organic soil amendment. Our results indicated that acidified organic QW by-products can improve environmental quality by substantially reducing the amount of applied P with no penalties for crop yield losses compared to raw manure and MS.

AB  - Voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels are the primary determinants of the action potential in excitable cells. Nav channels rely on a wide and diverse array of intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to achieve their full function. Glycogen synthase kinase 3(3 (GSK3(3) has been previously identified as a modulator of Nav1.6-encoded currents and neuronal excitability through PPI formation with Nav1.6 and phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Here, we hypothesized that GSK3(3 functions as a scaffold in a regulatory PPI complex with the Nav1.6 CTD. Mutagenesis screening using the split-luciferase complementation assay indicated that the axin-binding domain (ABD) of GSK3(3 (262-299) is necessary for complex formation between the Nav1.6 CTD and GSK3(3, and that residues within this domain are drivers of GSK3(3-mediated regulation of the channel. Overexpression of an ABD-GFP fusion construct in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing Nav1.6 significantly reduced Nav1.6 nanocluster density compared with GFP alone. In addition, overexpression of the ABD-GFP fusion construct ablates GSK3(3-mediated potentiation of Nav1.6-encoded currents and alters channel kinetics. Finally, in vivo AAV-mediated over- expression of the ABD-GFP construct in the CA1 hippocampal region induced a reduction in maximal action potential firing and an increase in action potential current threshold in a manner resembling previously reported effects of GSK3(3 silencing in neurons. Taken together, these results not only suggest that GSK3(3-mediated regulation of Nav1.6 extends beyond transient phosphorylation but also implicates the ABD as a critical regulatory domain that facilitates GSK3(30s functional effects on Nav1.6 and neuronal excitability.

AB  - Loss of ventricular action potential (AP) early phase 1 repolarization may contribute to the impaired Ca2+ release and increased risk of sudden cardiac death in heart failure. Therefore, restoring AP phase 1 by augmenting the fast transient outward K+ current (I-tof) might be beneficial, but direct experimental evidence to support this proposition in failing cardiomyocytes is limited. Dynamic clamp was used to selectively modulate the contribution of I-tof to the AP and Ca2+ transient in both normal (guinea pig and rabbit) and in failing rabbit cardiac myocytes. Opposing native Itof in non-failing rabbit myocytes increased Ca2+ release heterogeneity, late Ca2+ sparks (LCS) frequency and AP duration. (APD). In contrast, increasing I-tof in failing myocytes and guinea pig myocytes (the latter normally lacking I-tof) increased Ca2+ transient amplitude, Ca2+ release synchrony, and shortened APD. Computer simulations also showed faster Ca2+ transient decay (mainly due to fewer LCS), decreased inward Na+/Ca2+ exchange current and APD. When the Itof conductance was increased to similar to 0.2 nS/pF in failing cells (a value slightly greater than seen in typical human epicardial myocytes), Ca2+ release synchrony improved and AP duration decreased slightly. Further increases in Itof can cause Ca2+ release to decrease as the peak of the bell-shaped I-Ca-voltage relationship is passed and premature AP repolarization develops. These results suggest that there is an optimal range for I-tof enhancement that may support Ca2+ release synchrony and improve electrical stability in heart failure with the caveat that uncontrolled Itof enhancement should be avoided.

   Increased growth rates of ewe lambs between three and seven months of age can potentially have negative impacts on mammary development and milk production, affecting their capacity to wean a lamb as yearling ewes. This experiment was designed to examine the impacts of an increased growth rate of ewes between weaning and their first breeding at seven months of age on mammary development using ultrasonography and to establish if mammary ultrasound measures could be indicators of growth of yearling ewe progeny. Mammary measures were taken in late pregnancy, early lactation and weaning in 59 single-bearing yearling ewes either preferentially fed and achieving 47.9 kg at breeding at seven months of age, or fed to achieve 44.9 kg at breeding. Mammary measures did not differ between live-weight gain treatments, indicating no evidence of negative effects on mammary development of yearling ewes. Some mammary measures, however, were positively associated with the growth of the progeny to weaning suggesting that ultrasonography has the potential to identify yearling ewes that would wean heavier lambs.
   The experiment aimed to examine the impacts of an increased growth rate of ewes between three and seven months of age on udder development using ultrasound and to establish whether ultrasonography could be used to identify ewe mammary structures that may be indirect indicators of singleton growth to weaning. Udder dimensions, depths of gland cistern (GC), parenchyma (PAR) and fat pad (FP) were measured in late pregnancy (P107), early lactation (L29), and at weaning (L100) in 59 single-bearing yearling ewes selected from two treatments. The 'heavy' group (n = 31) was preferentially fed prior to breeding achieving an average breeding live-weight of 47.9 +/- 0.38 kg at seven months of age. The 'control' group (n = 28) had an average breeding live-weight of 44.9 +/- 0.49 kg. Udder dimensions, GC, PAR and FP did not differ between treatments. Lamb growth to L100 was positively associated (p < 0.05) with PAR at P107 and GC at L29. There was no evidence of negative effects of the live-weight gain treatments on udder development of yearling ewes as measured by ultrasonography. The results suggest that this ultrasound method has the potential to identify pregnant yearling ewes which would wean heavier singletons.

AB  - A total of 70 male growing non-castrated pigs (Large White), with a 23.07 +/- 2.87 kg average body weight (BW), were randomly allocated to three treatments in a 103 day trial: a CONTROL diet and two experimental diets, ALLIUM (5 g/kg of Allium spp. extract) and OLIVE (100 g/kg of olive pulp). Animals were slaughtered at 115 kg live body weight. Meat and fat quality were analyzed. Animals fed ALLIUM and OLIVE had higher water holding capacity (WHC) than those fed the control diet. No significant differences were observed between groups for cooking loss, drip losses and color CIELab. No antioxidant effect was observed on an oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) test. Animals fed OLIVE presented a more unsaturated fatty acid profile than CONTROL and ALLIUM. Meat from ALLIUM group and OLIVE showed her values of brightness and meat odor than CONTROL. Mean scores of sensory analyses (color, odor, flavor and juiciness) of cooked samples were similar for the three treatments, with the meat samples from the ALLIUM and OLIVE treatments being less hard. Consumers did not reflect a preference for any of the treatments. Both by-products could be used for pork production.

AB  - The tri-trophic interaction of plants, insect herbivores, and entomoviruses is an important topic in ecology and pest control. The susceptibility of insect herbivores to entomoviruses (e.g., nucleopolyhedroviruses) is influenced by host plants; however, the role of plant secondary metabolites in determining such susceptibility is poorly understood. Metabolomic analyses of Brassica oleracea, Glycine max, and Ipomoea aquatica plants, which differ in how they affect the susceptibility of Spodoptera exigua to nucleopolyhedroviruses among 14 plants, suggested that the plant secondary metabolites genistein, kaempferol, quercitrin, and coumarin play a role in influencing nucleopolyhedroviruses susceptibility. Subsequently, transcriptomic analysis of caterpillars, treated with nucleopolyhedroviruses alone or with one of these four phenolics, identified four genes (CYP340K4, CXE18, GSTe, and GSTe1) that were significantly downregulated by the phenolics. Functional characterization of these genes suggested that their downregulation significantly increased larval sensitivity to nucleopolyhedroviruses and altered aspects of the immune response. Our findings provide new insight into the role of plant defense metabolites in influencing the interactions between insect herbivores and entomopathogens and identify plant secondary metabolites as potential synergists of viral agents for the control of agricultural pests.

AB  - Lilies (Lilium spp.) are famous bulb flowers worldwide, with high ornamental value. Aphid damage has seriously constrained the development of the lily industry. In this study, the aphid resistance of 16 lily cultivars and 2 wild lily species was characterized in the field and greenhouse. Leaf color parameters, stomatal density and size, thickness of leaf layers, leaf waxy content, and leaf water content were determined to explore the constitutive resistance of lilies. The results show that there was a significant positive correlation between the number of aphids in the field and in the greenhouse (p <= 0.05, r = 0.47). This indicated that the level of aphid infestation in both the field and the greenhouse is generally consistent across different types of lily plants. Among these 18 lilies, 'Palazzo', 'Nymph', 'Cameleon' and L. lancifolium were resistant to A. gossypii, while 'Black Beauty' and 'Magnefique' had poor resistance. The correlation analysis results showed that the number of aphids was negatively correlated with leaf abaxial surface a*, stomatal size, water content, and thickness of leaf palisade tissue and positively correlated with leaf distal axial surface b*, C*, and waxy content. Among them, the correlation between the number of aphids and the thickness of leaf palisade tissue reached a significant level (p <= 0.05, r = -0.521). This indicated that the thickness of the palisade tissue of lily leaves might be an important factor influencing the proliferation of aphids. This study not only screened out aphid-resistant lilies but also established a crucial research foundation for the targeted breeding and molecular breeding of lilies with aphid resistance.

AB  - Here, we report the rediscovery of Coelops frithii in the pristine mangrove forest of Sundarbans Forest Reserve in Khulna division of Bangladesh. A dead individual of adult female was collected and identified to species based on morphological features and skull measurements (FA: 41.28 mm, GTL: 17.52 mm, CCL: 15.58 mm). This finding represents the first record from the type locality one and a half century after Blyth (1848) first described the species. C. frithii is considered near threaten in the IUCN Red List. The confirmed occurrence through this record calls for future systematic surveys of this species within the Sundarbans.

AB  - Simple Summary The early weaning of piglets is a key strategy for the modern pig industry. However, the digestive system of early-weaned piglets is not well developed, and weaned piglets suffering from psychological, nutritional and environmental stresses, cause significant losses to the pig industry. In order to mitigate the challenges of weaning, adding zinc oxide to the diet of weaned piglets has become standard in the industry. However, the excessive output of zinc from pigs' feces to the water and soil will produce toxicity to crops and threaten animal and human health. Mannan-rich fraction, derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can improve gut health and the immune system. In addition, protein-chelated zinc has stable chemical properties, a higher absorption rate and biological potency. Therefore, we speculate that the combination of protein-chelated zinc and mannan-rich fraction will be an alternative to high-dose zinc oxide to relieve weaning stress. Our study showed that the combined addition of protein-chelated zinc and mannan-rich fraction is an alternative for zinc oxide in beneficially supporting the growth performance and intestinal health of weaned piglets, as well as contributing to a lower diarrhea rate and environmental pollution from fecal zinc excretion. A total of 168 weaned piglets (average initial body weight of 7.70 +/- 0.75 kg) were used in a 4-week feeding trial to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with protein-chelated zinc (Zn-Pro) alone or combined with a mannan-rich fraction (MRF) to replace high-dose zinc oxide (ZnO) for weaned piglets. The dietary treatments included a basal diet as control (CON), a ZnO diet (basal diet + 1600 mg Zn/kg from ZnO), a Zn-Pro diet (basal diet + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro), and a MRF plus Zn-Pro diet (MRP, basal diet + 800 mg/kg MRF + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro). The average daily gain of piglets in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in CON and Zn-Pro groups during d 15-28 and d 1-28 of experiment. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in the CON group. The serum insulin-like growth factor-1 level in the MRP group was markedly higher (p <= 0.05) than that of piglets in the other three treatment groups. Piglets fed the Zn-Pro and ZnO diets had greater (p <= 0.05) acetic acid in cecal digesta than those fed the CON diet, while the MRP diet had higher (p <= 0.05) cecal propionate concentration than those that were fed the CON diet on d 28 of experiment. Moreover, the villus height of ileum in the MRP group tended to be greater than the CON group (p = 0.09). Compared with the CON and MRP groups, the relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae (p = 0.08) and Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.09) in the Zn-Pro group showed an increasing trend. The relative abundance of Prevotellaceae in the Zn-Pro group was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) than that in the MRP group. In conclusion, the combined addition of MRF and Zn-Pro acted as a suitable alternative to ZnO to beneficially support the growth performance and intestinal health of weaned piglets, as well as contribute to a lower diarrhea rate and environmental pollution from fecal zinc excretion.

AB  - Dietary supplementation with tea polyphenols (TPs) is associated with reduced diet-induced obesity and/or metabolic syndrome in mammal studies. However, TPs have rarely been related to fish metabolic syndrome caused by intensive aquaculture. In this study, TPs were supplemented to three diets with different protein to carbohydrate ratios (P38C30, P32C26, P26C42) to grass carp for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, contrast to the anti-obesity effect in mammals, TPs improved the growth performance and spared protein of grass carp in the case of high protein and low carbohydrate diet intake. Dietary TPs supplementation reduced hepatic g6pc and pck expressions to suppress gluconeogenesis without altered glycolysis (unchanged glk and pk expression), resulted in lower plasma glucose levels compared with no supplemented diets. The hepatic glycogen was induced by dietary TPs supplementation through increasing gys expression or decreasing pyg expression. In addition, dietary TPs supplementation provided health benefits in our fish through enhancing the activities of plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione content, meanwhile, reducing the content of malondialdehyde. Therefore, TPs could be used as a natural antihyperglycemic feed additive candidate for sparing dietary protein and improving feed efficiency in aquaculture.

AB  - 17 beta-estradiol (E2) is the most active metabolite of estrogen with a wide range of physiological action on cardiac muscle. Previous studies have reported E2 effects predominantly for the ventricles, while the E2 impact on the atria has been less examined. In this study, we focused on the direct E2 effects on atrial and ventricular contractility at the cellular and molecular levels. Single atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes (CM) from adult (24 weeks-old) female Wistar rats were incubated with 10 nM E2 for 15 min. Sarcomere length and cytosolic [Ca2+]i transients were measured in mechanically non-loaded CM, and the tension-length relationship was studied in CM mechanically loaded by carbon fibers. The actin-myosin interaction and sarcomeric protein phosphorylation were analyzed using an in vitro motility assay and gel electrophoresis with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain. E2 had chamber-specific effects on the contractile function of CM with a pronounced influence on ventricular CM. The characteristics of [Ca2+]i transients did not change in both atrial and ventricular CM. However, in ventricular CM, E2 reduced the amplitude and maximum velocity of sarcomere shortening and decreased the slope of the passive tension-length relationship that was associated with increased TnI and cMyBP-C phosphorylation. E2 treatment accelerated the cross-bridge cycle of both atrial and ventricular myosin that was associated with increased phosphorylation of the myosin essential light chain. This study shows that E2 impairs the mechanical function of the ventricular myocardium while atrial contractility remains mostly preserved. Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen is by far the most effective therapy for treating climacteric symptoms experienced during menopause. Here we found a chamber specificity of myocardial contractile function to E2 that should be taken into account for the potential side effects of HRT.

AB  - Behavioral and dietary flexibility allow primates to effectively exploit resources that fluctuate in time and space. Here we examined monthly variation in the diet and activity budget of a wild nonprovisioned group of Tibetan macaques inhabiting Mt. Huangshan, China. From October 2022 to September 2023, we recorded the behavior of a group of wild macaques and collected data on food availability, temperature, rainfall, and day length. We found that over a 12-month period, the Tibetan macaques fed on 109 plant species. The main food types consumed were fruits (54.5%), leaves (24.3%), seeds (7.7%), stems (6.5%), flowers (4.0%), and buds (2.5%). Tibetan macaques were found to target fruits as a main resource during months in which fruits were most abundant. During months when fruits were scarce, they increased their consumption of leaves, seeds, and stems. The top three plant species each month accounted for 70.7% of total feeding time indicating that their foraging effort focused on a small number of highly productive plant species each month. The Tibetan macaque daily activity budget was dominated by feeding (3.98 h or 33.7%) and resting (3.81 h or 32.8%), followed by traveling (2.40 h or 20.9%) and socializing (1.45 h or 12.6%). When time spent feeding on leaves increased, the Tibetan macaques experienced a significant increase in time spent resting and a significant decrease in time spent feeding. In addition, during the months of December and January, pine seeds were found to be an important food for Tibetan macaques. It is possible that increasing lipid consumption during the cold winter months serves to offset the additional costs of thermoregulation. Our results indicate that Tibetan macaques flexibly adjusted their diet and activity patterns in response to monthly variation in temperature, rainfall, and food availability across a range of forest types in east-central China.

AB  - An escapable (ES)/inescapable stress (IS) paradigm was used to study whether behavioral control and repeated footshock stressors may affect adult neurogenesis and related cognitive function. Male stressed mice having behavioral control (ES) had a short-term escalation in dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis, while similarly stressed mice having no such control had unaltered neurogenesis as compared to control mice receiving no stressors. Paradoxically, ES and IS mice had comparable stress-induced corticosterone elevations throughout the stress regimen. Appetitive operant conditioning and forced running procedures were used to model learning and exercise effects in this escapable/inescapable paradigm. Further, conditioning and running procedures did not seem to affect the mice's corticosterone or short-term neurogenesis. ES and IS mice did not show noticeable long-term changes in their dorsal DG neurogenesis, gliogenesis, local neuronal density, apoptosis, autophagic flux, or heterotypic stress responses. ES mice were found to have a greater number of previously labeled and functionally integrated DG neurons as compared to IS and control mice 6 weeks after the conclusion of the stressor regimen. Likewise, ES mice outperformed IS and non-stressed control mice for the first two, but not the remaining two, trials in the object location task. Compared to non-stressed controls, temozolomide-treated ES and IS mice having a lower number of dorsal DG 6-week-old neurons display poor performance in their object location working memory. These results, taken together, prompt us to conclude that repeated stressors, albeit their corticosterone secretion-stimulating effect, do not necessary affect adult dorsal DG neurogenesis. Moreover, stressed animals having behavioral control may display adult neurogenesis escalation in the dorsal DG. Furthermore, the number of 6-week-old and functionally-integrated neurons in the dorsal DG seems to confer the quality of spatial location working memory. Finally, these 6-week-old, adult-born neurons seem to contribute spatial location memory in a use-dependent manner.

AB  - Pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for determining nucleic acid (NA) structure and conformational dynamics. PELDOR with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations opens up unique possibilities for defining the conformational ensembles of flexible, three-dimensional, self-assembled complexes of NA. Understanding the diversity and structure of these complexes is vital for uncovering matrix and regulative biological processes in the human body and artificially influencing them for therapeutic purposes. To explore the reliability of PELDOR and MD simulations, we site-specifically attached nitroxide spin labels to oligonucleotides, which form self-assembled complexes between NA chains and exhibit significant conformational flexibility. The DNA complexes assembled from a pair of oligonucleotides with different linker sizes showed excellent agreement between the distance distributions obtained from PELDOR and calculated from MD simulations, both for the mean inter-spin distance and the distance distribution width. These results prove that PELDOR with MD simulations has significant potential for studying the structure and dynamics of conformational flexible complexes of NA.

AB  - Tannins are toxic polyphenols present in various plants, contributing to microbial attacks and plant protection due to their astringence and bitter taste. However, high tannin inclusion in poultry diets will result in dyspepsia, hampering nutrient absorption and digestion. Interestingly, several bacteria occupying the rumen and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of animals may tolerate tannins and degrade them by wielding tannase enzymes. The study aims to isolate and characterize potential tannin-degrading bacteria (TDB) from several ruminant specimens. The TDBs were isolated based on their tannin hydrolyzing ability on a minimal salt medium (MSM) agar complemented with 0.2% tannic acid as the sole source of carbon and energy. The maximum tannin tolerance of the isolates was characterized using increased tannin concentrations on the MSM agar plates. Furthermore, the tannase activity was also evaluated over a five-day incubation. A total of 42 tannin degraders were isolated, and 10 TDBs were chosen for further characterization based on the hydrolyzed zone produced. Molecular identification revealed the presence of Bacillus cereus (TDB536), Lysinibacillus macroides (TDB17), Acinetobacter nosocomialis (TDB18, 20, 23, 24, 30, 35), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (TDB40). TDB17, TDB18, and TDB24 showed the highest tannic acid tolerance at 1.0%, while TDB36 and TDB40 exhibited the lowest tolerance at 0.4%. Each TDB displayed varying tannase activities, ranging from 11.56 to 42.08 U/mL over a five-day incubation period. TDB5 and TDB35 demonstrated significantly higher tannase activity on day 2 (p<0.05). Meanwhile, TDB23 and TDB24 showed the highest tannase on day 4 (p<0.05). Among the isolates, A. nosocomialis strain AE6 (TDB24) from feces exhibited the highest tannase activity (42.08 U/mL) and represented the best TDB. The isolated strains demonstrate their capabilities in reducing tannin's antinutritional effects in poultry feed.

AB  - Maternal deprivation (MD) in early life severely disrupts hippocampal development, leading to persistent cognitive and behavior deficits. The current study uncovered that early MD (P1-P21) impaired spatial learning and memory capacity detected by Morris water maze (MWM) tests from juvenile (P31) to adult (P81) rats compared to age-matched controls. And the protein expression in hippocampus were detected by twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) before MWM, respectively. Protein changes in hippocampal were examined to identify the molecular pathways underlying MD-induced hippocampal dysfunction. There were 11 differentially expressed proteins analyzed between adult MD and control male rats, while the 8 proteins were then identified by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of the identified proteins were related to neuronal and glial cytoskeletal dynamics, membrane signaling, stress responses, biosynthesis, and metabolism. The different expression proteins spectrin alpha chain, non-erythrocytic 1 (Sptan1), ATP-citrate synthase (Acly), and heat shock protein 90-alpha (Hsp90aa1) have been verified by western blot analysis, and their expression levels showed consistent with 2-DE analysis. In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was also found reduced in adult hippocampus of MD rats. This study identifies candidate proteins encompassing a range of functional categories that may contribute to persistent learning and memory deficits due to early life MD.

AB  - Persistent contaminants are ubiquitous in our water and soil, and thus chronic exposure to environmentally relevant levels of these contaminants may pose a risk to humans and wildlife. Two species of small mammals (deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus and cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus) were collected from historically dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-contaminated and reference areas at the Redstone Arsenal (Huntsville, AL, USA), a US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-designated Superfund site. Soil samples taken concurrently with mammal collection from the DDT abatement site exhibited DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) levels >1 ppm (USEPA total threshold limit concentration for DDT and DDE <1 ppm), whereas soil samples from the reference area had undetectable levels. Liver samples from individuals of both species collected in the contaminated areas also had significantly elevated DDT/DDE levels, with P. maniculatus averaging an approximately 20x greater load than that documented for S. hispidus. Both rodent species collected from the contaminated site had significantly lower total leukocyte counts and total differential blood cell counts (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) than those collected from the nearby (similar to 7000-m) reference site. Cellular stress indices also trended higher in both species, suggesting a potential for chronic exposure to DDT to act as a mediator of oxidative damage. The present study provides support to the idea that environmental exposure to low levels of contaminants can cause physiological consequences that may influence immune responsiveness and initiate cellular stress in resident mammals.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION Does chemotherapy exposure prior to ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) impact the signaling pathways governing follicle activation and survival for prepubertal and postpubertal patients? SUMMARY ANSWER Chemotherapy exposure prior OTC increases follicle apoptosis rates but not follicular activation, although the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways were modified in the cortex. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY OTC is currently the only available fertility preservation procedure for children and for patients who have already started their treatment. While previous studies have not observed harmful impacts of first chemotherapy exposure on OTC outcomes, the consequences of treatment on follicle activation and survival need to be further investigated. To address this question, we evaluated signaling pathway modifications induced by chemotherapy exposure according to pubertal status. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Cryopreserved ovarian tissues from postpubertal (12-29 years old, n = 8) and prepubertal (3-10 years old, n = 8) cancer patients donated for research were thawed and cultured for 24 h. Analyses of the survival of the follicles and stroma, and of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways, were conducted at thawing and after culture. Ovarian fragments exposed to chemotherapy before collection were compared to non-exposed controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Histological investigations were performed to assess the distribution of the follicles, stroma fibrosis, vessel integrity, and apoptosis levels. It included follicular counting, collagen staining, immunostaining on CD31 and gH2AX, as well as TUNEL staining. To explore follicle activation in the different groups, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways were investigated by gene expression analyses of isolated follicles and protein analyses on whole fragments through western blots and immunostaining. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE We first assessed the impact of a first exposure to chemotherapy on the collagen density and vessels in ovarian tissues at thawing and after culture. While no differences in collagen density were observed according to age or previous treatment, the vascularization area (CD31+) was significantly lower in tissue from previously exposed patients compared to non-treated ones. Apoptosis analyses (TUNEL) revealed an acute deleterious impact on follicle survival after chemotherapy exposure without affecting the follicular density. Surprisingly, leukemic patients had a significantly higher percentage of gH2AX-positive follicles, indicating a DNA damage response, compared to the other patients. The proportion of activated follicles appeared to decrease following exposure to chemotherapy, suggesting that it at least did not increase activation process. Stable KIT LIGAND gene and protein expression and cKIT protein levels were observed among the groups, confirming the absence of activation. Analysis of the PI3K pathway did not reveal a difference in the AKT phosphorylation level between the groups, but pRPS6 was significantly higher in tissue from patients previously exposed to chemotherapy compared to that from non-exposed patients. Finally, protein and gene analyses on Hippo pathway signaling showed a higher LATS1 protein level in the cortex after chemotherapy exposure. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The heterogeneity of the human fragments, and the limited number of patients included in the cohort have to be considered as important study limitations.
   Moreover, this study did not explore the long-term consequences of chemotherapy on follicular development. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These results underscore the deleterious effect of previous chemotherapeutic treatment on follicle survival. Although follicular density was not reduced, these data suggested that exposure to chemotherapy impacts follicular apoptosis and the DNA damage response. Chemotherapy-induced activation was not observed despite the impact on mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways in the whole cortex.

AB  - The absorption of the minerals produced by the probiotics in ruminants is expected to improve the absorption of the required nutrients. The study used different dietary rations with different percentage of concentrates: forages, different selenium doses, different locations and different strains of lactic acid bacteria as probiotics. The trials were performed with three repetitions using a factorial block (2x2x3x4). Samples were incubated for 48 h using in vitro incubation system. The parameters were pH, the kinetics of gas production, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and NH3-N concentration. The data were analyzed using the ANOVA, followed by the Duncan test. The results showed altered fermentation characteristics, while BioNano-Se at 25 ppm has significantly increased the rumen pH, gas production rate, IVDMD, IVOMD and decreased the total gas production significantly, but did not affect the ammonia concentration. High concentrate rations (R1) produces significantly lower pH (P < 0.05), but higher gas production rate and digestibility (P < 0.05). Higher dose of BioNano-Se significantly decreased gas production rate and ammonia production (P < 0.05). In conclusion, BioNano-Se and probiotics can alter rumen fermentation process.

AB  - Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) can threaten human health, especially male fertility. However, most existing studies have focused on the adulthood stage of male reproduction toxicity caused by relatively short-term PS-MP exposure. This study aimed to investigate the toxic effect of PS-MPs on testicular development and reproductive function upon prenatal and postnatal exposure. Pregnant mice and their offspring were exposed to 0, 0.5 mg/L, 5 mg/L, and 50 mg/L PS-MPs through their daily drinking water from gestational day 1 to postnatal day (PND) 35 or PND70. We found that PS-MP exposure induced testis development disorder by PND35 and spermatogenesis dysfunction by PND70. By combining RNA sequencing results and bioinformatics analysis, the hormone -mediated signaling pathway, G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle, coregulation of androgen receptor ac-tivity, and Hippo signaling pathway were shown to be involved in testis development on PND35. The meiotic cell cycle, regulation of the immune effector process, neutrophil degranulation, and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways were associated with disturbed spermatogenesis on PND70. These findings show that prenatal and postnatal exposure to PS-MPs resulted in testis development disorder and male subfertility, which may be regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway and involve an immune reaction.

AB  - Timber trees are targets of herbivorous attacks. The identification of genes associated with pest resistance can be accomplished through differential expression analysis using transcriptomes. We reported the de novo assembly of cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) transcriptome and the differential expression of genes involved in herbivore resistance. The assembly and annotation of the transcriptome were obtained using RNAseq from healthy cedar plants and those infested with Chrysobothris yucatanensis. A total of 325.6 million reads were obtained, and 127,031 (97.47%) sequences were successfully assembled. A total of 220 herbivory-related genes were detected, of which 170 genes were annotated using GO terms, and 161 genes with 245 functions were identified-165, 75, and 5 were molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components, respectively. To protect against herbivorous infestation, trees produce toxins and volatile compounds which are modulated by signaling pathways and gene expression related to molecular functions and biological processes. The limited number of genes identified as cellular components suggests that there are minimal alterations in cellular structure in response to borer attack. The chitin recognition protein, jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) motifs, and response regulator receiver domain were found to be overexpressed, whereas the terpene synthase, cytochrome P450, and protein kinase domain gene families were underexpressed. This is the first report of a cedar transcriptome focusing on genes that are overexpressed in healthy plants and underexpressed in infested plants. This method may be a viable option for identifying genes associated with herbivore resistance.

AB  - Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) during gestation and lactation is considered to be a potential risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in both humans and animals. As a novel alternative to BPA, 4-hydroxy-4 '-isopropoxydiphenylsulfone (BPSIP) is frequently detected in breast milk and placental barrier systems, suggesting potential transmission from the mother to offspring and increased risk of exposure. Gestation and lactation are critical periods for central nervous system development, which are vulnerable to certain environmental pollutants. Herein, we investigated the behavioral impacts and neurobiological effects of early-life exposure to BPSIP (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) in mice offspring. Behavioral studies indicated that BPSIP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors, including elevated anxiety-related behavior and decreased spatial memory, in both male and female pups. A distinct pattern of reduced social novelty was observed only in female offspring, accompanied by significant alterations in antioxidant levels. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in pathways related to behaviors and neurodevelopment, which were consistent with the observed phenotype. Besides, a decrease in the protein levels of complex IV (COX IV) across all tested populations suggests a profound impact on mitochondrial function, potentially leading to abnormal energy metabolism in individuals with autism. Additionally, changes in synaptic proteins, evidenced by alterations in synapsin 1 (SYN1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus, support the notion of synaptic involvement. These findings suggest that BPSIP may induce sex-specific neurotoxic effects that involve oxidative stress, energy generation, and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) is a debilitating painful condition with unclear etiology. Prior researchers have indicated that compared to healthy controls, patients with UCPPS demonstrated altered brain activity. Researchers have also shown that in UCPPS, several blood inflammatory markers relate to clinical variables of pain, fatigue, and pain widespreadness. However, how altered brain function in patients with UCPPS relates to blood inflammation remains unknown. To extend and connect prior findings of altered brain function and inflammatory factors in UCPPS, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from a cohort of UCPPS patients (N = 29) and healthy controls (N = 31) who provided both neuroimaging and blood data (National Institute of Health MAPP Research Network publicly available dataset). In our present study, we aimed to evaluate relationships between a priori-defined brain neuroimaging markers and inflammatory factors of interest and their relationships to pain-psychological variables. We hypothesized that two brain alterations of interest (i.e., PCC - left hippocampus functional connectivity and PCC - bilateral amygdala functional connectivity) would be correlated with four cytokine markers of interest: interleukin (IL) - 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the UCPPS cohort, we identified a significant PCC - left hippocampus functional connectivity relationship with IL-6 (p = 0.0044). Additionally, in the UCPPS cohort, we identified a PCC - amygdala functional connectivity relationship with GM-CSF which did not meet our model's threshold for statistical significance (p = 0.0665). While these data are preliminary and crosssectional, our findings suggest connections between brain function and levels of low-grade systemic inflammation in UCPPS. Thus, while further study is needed, our data indicate the potential for advancing the understanding of how brain functional circuits may relate to clinical symptoms and systemic inflammation.

AB  - In the present work, 14 new diazepinobenzimidazole derivatives (DAB series) were screened for inhibitory activity against NMDA- and C-a2+-impermeable (CI) AMPA-receptors. Experiments were conducted on isolated Wistar rat neurons; pyramidal neurons of the CA1 zone of the hippocampus were used to study NMDA- and CI-AMPA-receptors. Cell isolation was performed by vibrodissociation; currents were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp method. All the studied compounds at a concentration of 100 mu M inhibited NMDA-receptors (>= 30%), while CI-AMPA receptors currents were inhibited by only four compounds: DAB-8, DAB-12, DAB-19, and DAB-32. DAB-8, DAB-12 and DAB-32 have a 4-substituted phenacyl group at the nitrogen atom N11 with an electronegative fluorine atom in the para position (DAB-8 and DAB-32) or without it (DAB-12), whereas the most active compound DAB-19 has a 4-tert-butyl-benzyl group at atom N11 with a bulky tert-butyl substituent in the para position. The most active of them were DAB-12, DAB-19, and DAB-32, which were studied further for their IC50 values. Compound DAB-19 demonstrated the most pronounced activity against both NMDA- and CI-AMPA-receptors: IC50 values were 11.0 +/- 1.6 mu M and 15.4 +/- 1.4 mu M, respectively. Such an ability to inhibit both NMDA- and CI-AMPA-receptors at such concentrations is quite remarkable. Based on previous data on the neuropsychotropic effects of DAB-19, we put forward hypothesis about its possible anticonvulsant activity, which was confirmed in the "Pentylenetetrazol Seizure" test. The identification of DAB-19 as a combined antagonist of NMDA- and CI-AMPA-receptors is an important achievement for the further development of effective anticonvulsants.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) yield loss from arthropod herbivory is substantial. While the basis of resistance to major insect herbivores has been comparatively well-studied in maize, less is known about resistance to spider mite herbivores, which are distantly related to insects and feed by a different mechanism. Two spider mites, the generalist Tetranychus urticae, and the grass-specialist Oligonychus pratensis, are notable pests of maize, especially during drought conditions. We assessed resistance (antibiosis) to both mites of 38 highly diverse maize lines, including several previously reported to be resistant to one or the other mite species. We found that line B96, as well as its derivatives B49 and B75, were highly resistant to T. urticae. In contrast, neither these three lines, nor any others included in our study, were notably resistant to the specialist O. pratensis. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with replicate populations from crosses of B49, B75, and B96 to susceptible B73 identified a QTL in the same genomic interval on chromosome 6 for T. urticae resistance in each of the three resistant lines, and an additional resistance QTL on chromosome 1 was unique to B96. Single-locus genotyping with a marker coincident with the chromosome 6 QTL in crosses of both B49 and B75 to B73 revealed that the respective QTL was large-effect; it explained similar to 70% of the variance in resistance, and resistance alleles from B49 and B75 acted recessively as compared to B73. Finally, a genome-wide haplotype analysis using genome sequence data generated for B49, B75, and B96 identified an identical haplotype, likely of initial origin from B96, as the source of T. urticae resistance on chromosome 6 in each of the B49, B75, and B96 lines. Our findings uncover the relationship between intraspecific variation in maize defenses and resistance to its major generalist and specialist spider mite herbivores, and we identified loci for use in breeding programs and for genetic studies of resistance to T. urticae, the most widespread spider mite pest of maize.

AB  - This systematic-review probes the deleterious outcome of Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on cognition/memory by scrutinizing the extant preclinical studies on this focus, to promote apprehension about this environmental toxin among the general population with a long-term goal to build a plastic (BPA)-free future. Bibliographic databases, including Scopus, ProQuest, PubMed, Google Scholar, DOAJ, and ScienceDirect were searched for preclinical reports assessing the impact of BPA exposure on memory/cognition. The review protocol has been published in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42022333965. The SYRCLE's RoB tool was implemented to assess the risk of bias in the retrieved reports. The review finally comprehended 22 reports. Results of 22 reports compositely suggest that maternal exposure to BPA raises the likelihood of the fetus enduring neuro-developmental dysfunction, which may manifest as memory/cognitive decline. BPA impairs memory and cognition by binding to estrogen receptors, inhibiting ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway, altering the expression of synaptic proteins, impairing the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, dysre-gulation of thyroid hormones, and altering the neurotransmitter levels.

AB  - The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is crucial for memory encoding and recognition. The time course of these processes is unknown. The present study juxtaposed encoding and recognition in a single paradigm. Twenty healthy subjects performed a continuous recognition task as brain activity was monitored with a high-density electroencephalography. The task presented New pictures thought to evoke encoding. The stimuli were then repeated up to 4 consecutive times to produce over-familiarity. These repeated stimuli served as "baseline" for comparison with the other stimuli. Stimuli later reappeared after 9-15 intervening items, presumably associated with new encoding and recognition. Encoding-related differences in evoked response potential amplitudes and in spatiotemporal analysis were observed at 145-300 ms, whereby source estimation indicated MTL and orbitofrontal activity from 145 to 205 ms. Recognition-related activity evoked by late repetitions occurred at 405-470 ms, implicating the MTL and neocortical structures. These findings indicate that encoding of information is initiated before it is recognized. The result helps to explain modifications of memories over time, including false memories, confabulation, and consolidation.

AB  - The development of trichomes, which protect plants against herbivores, is affected by various stresses. In tomato, previous studies showed that stress-triggered jasmonic acid (JA) signaling influences trichome formation, but the underlying mechanism is not fully resolved. Here, we found that two C2H2 zinc finger proteins synergistically regulate JA-induced trichome formation in tomato. The naturally occurring mutations in the H gene and its close homolog H-like in a spontaneous mutant, LA3172, cause severely affected trichome development. Compared with the respective single mutant, the h/hl double mutant displayed more severe trichome defects in all tissues. Despite their partially redundant function, the H and HL genes regulate trichome formation in a spatially distinct manner, with HL more involved in hypocotyls and leaves while H is more involved in stems and sepals. Furthermore, the activity of H/HL is essential for JA-triggered trichome formation. The JA signaling inhibitor SlJAZ2 represses the activity of H and HL via physical interaction, resulting in the activation of THM1, a negative regulator of trichome formation. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanism of trichome formation in response to stress-induced JA signaling in tomato.

AB  - Since glucose reuptake by neurons is mostly independent of insulin, it has been an intriguing question whether insulin has or not any roles in the brain. Consequently, the identification of insulin receptors in the central nervous system has fueled investigations of insulin functions in the brain. It is also already known that insulin can influence glucose reuptake by neurons, mostly during activities that have the highest energy demand. The identification of high density of insulin receptors in the hippocampus also suggests that insulin may present important roles related to memory. In this context, studies have reported worse performance in cognitive tests among diabetic patients. In addition, alterations in the regulation of central insulin pathways have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In fact, some authors have proposed AD as a third type of diabetes and recently, our group proposed insulin resistance as a common link between different AD hypotheses. Therefore, in the present narrative review, we intend to revise and gather the evidence of disturbed insulin signaling in experimental animal models of AD.

AB  - A growing body of evidence indicates that extracellular fragmented self-DNA (eDNA), by acting as a signaling molecule, triggers inhibitory effects on conspecific plants and functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). To evaluate early and late events in DAMP-dependent responses to eDNA, we extracted, fragmented, and applied the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) eDNA to tomato leaves. Non-sonicated, intact self-DNA (intact DNA) was used as control. Early event analyses included the evaluation of plasma transmembrane potentials (Vm), cytosolic calcium variations (Ca-cy(t)2+), the activity and subcellular localization of both voltage-gated and ligand-gated rectified K+ channels, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) subcellular localization and quantification. Late events included RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis and qPCR validation of gene expression of tomato leaves exposed to tomato eDNA. Application of eDNA induced a concentration-dependent Vm depolarization which was correlated to an increase in (Ca2+)(cyt); this event was associated to the opening of K+ channels, with particular action on ligand-gated rectified K+ channels. Both eDNA-dependent (Ca2+)(cyt) and K+ increases were correlated to ROS production. In contrast, application of intact DNA produced no effects. The plant response to eDNA was the modulation of the expression of genes involved in plant-biotic interactions including pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPK1), heat shock transcription factors (Hsf), heat shock proteins (Hsp), receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs). Several genes involved in calcium signaling, ROS scavenging and ion homeostasis were also modulated by application of eDNA. Shared elements among the transcriptional response to eDNA and to biotic stress indicate that eDNA might be a common DAMP that triggers plant responses to pathogens and herbivores, particularly to those that intensive plant cell disruption or cell death. Our results suggest the intriguing hypothesis that some of the plant reactions to pathogens and herbivores might be due to DNA degradation, especially when associated to the plant cell disruption. Fragmented DNA would then become an important and powerful elicitor able to trigger early and late responses to biotic stress.

AB  - In the course of the research carried out from 2019 to 2021 across the territory of Dagestan, new information about the distribution of six rare species of bats was obtained. Trapping confirmed the actual habitat of Myotis alcathoe in the northern part of the eastern Caucasus. New records of M. emarginatus, as well as the previous ones, were only made at the foothills of central Dagestan, being mostly represented by large maternal colonies. Wintering sites and the general distribution in Dagestan, which covers a vast territory from the southern borders of the republic to the latitude of Kizilyurt in the north, have been established for two species of Bar-bastella. There is a sharp decline in the numbers of Rhinolophus mehelyi in the famous Karabudakhkent Cave. New records of Tadarida teniotis confirm its wide distribution over the territory of the republic, with the highest record revealed at an altitude of 3763 m a.s.l. Characteristics of echolocation calls for the species M. emarginatus, B. barbastellus and T. teniotis are also presented.

AB  - BackgroundAnxiety affects 4.4-million children in the USA with an onset between childhood and adolescence, a period marked by neural changes that impact emotions and memory. Negative overgeneralization - or responding similarly to innocuous events that share features with past aversive experiences - is common in anxiety but remains mechanistically underspecified. The nucleus reuniens (RE) has been considered a crucial candidate in the modulation of memory specificity. Our study investigated its activation and functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) as neurobiological mechanisms of negative overgeneralization in anxious youth.MethodsAs part of a secondary data analysis, we examined data from 34 participants between 9 and 14 years of age (mean age +/- SD, 11.4 +/- 2.0 years; 16 females) with varying degrees of anxiety severity. During the Study session participants rated images as negative, neutral, and positive. After 12 h, participants returned for a Test session, where they performed a memory recognition test with repeated (targets) and similar (lures) images. Labeling negative relative to neutral lures as "old" (false alarms) was our operational definition of negative overgeneralization.ResultsNegative relative to neutral false alarmed stimuli displayed elevated RE activation (at Study and Test) and increased functional connectivity with the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1 (at Test). Elevated anxiety severity was associated with reductions in the RE-mPFC functional coupling for neutral relative to negative stimuli. Exploratory analyses revealed similar patterns in activation and functional connectivity with positive stimuli.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the importance of the RE in negative overgeneralization and anxiety.

AB  - Hibernation, a survival strategy in mammals for extreme climates, induces physiological phenomena such as ischemia-reperfusion and metabolic shifts that hold great potential for advancements in modern medicine. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underpinning hibernation remain largely unclear. This study used RNA-seq and Iso-seq techniques to investigate the changes in liver transcriptome expression of Rhinolophus pusillus during hibernation and active periods, as well as under different microhabitat temperatures. We identified 11 457 differentially expressed genes during hibernation and active periods, of which 395 showed significant differential expression. Genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were significantly upregulated during hibernation, whereas genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis were downregulated. Conversely, immune-related genes displayed differential expression patterns: genes tied to innate immunity were significantly upregulated, while those linked to adaptive immunity and inflammatory response were downregulated. The analysis of transcriptomic data obtained from different microhabitat temperatures revealed that R. pusillus exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in lower microhabitat temperature. This upregulation facilitated an enhanced utilization rate of triglyceride, ultimately resulting in increased energy provision for the organism. Additionally, R. pusillus upregulated gluconeogenesis-related genes regardless of the microhabitat temperature, demonstrating the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels during hibernation. Our transcriptomic data reveal that these changes in liver gene expression optimize energy allocation during hibernation, suggesting that liver tissue adaptively responds to the inherent stress of its function during hibernation. This study sheds light on the role of differential gene expression in promoting more efficient energy allocation during hibernation. It contributes to our understanding of how liver tissue adapts to the stressors associated with this state.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe restriction of the use of antibiotics in swine production worldwide has influenced pork production efficiency. New in-feed additives must be sustainable, prevent diarrhea in early weaning piglets, and promote growth performance. Novel in-feed additives, probiotics, prebiotics, organic compounds, mineral salts and vegetable extract have been extensively studied; most have shown some limitations that discourage extensive use. We investigated the plant extract MGM-P (a quebracho tannin product) as an alternative animal feed additive to antibiotics. We considered its unique structure, antibacterial, antioxidant, radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory activities, and sustainability. We began with a low-level addition trial; 0.3% MGM-P had a more robust effect than 0.2% MGM-P. The findings demonstrated that 0.3% MGM-P supplementation prevented diarrhea in 21-day-old weaned piglets, improving piglet health without adversely influencing growth performance. Practical studies of the mechanisms underlying the effects of MGM-P and the optimal amount for supplementation are needed to confirm our findings.This study assessed the feasibility of using a vegetable extract, MGM-P (quebracho tannin product), as an alternative to antibiotics for weaned piglets; it investigated MGM-P effects on growth performance, diarrhea, and overall health in early-weaned piglets. In total, 24 piglets were allocated to three treatment groups fed basal diets supplemented with 0, 0.2%, or 0.3% MGM-P for 20 days. The addition of 0.3% MGM-P to the diet of early-weaned piglets improved diarrhea incidence, hematological parameters, and intestinal mucosa structure. Furthermore, the addition of 0.2% or 0.3% MGM-P to the diet of early-weaned piglets did not affect their overall health. Importantly, MGM-P had no effects on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), or feed conversion ratio (FCR). Gut morphology analysis showed that treatment with 0.3% MGM-P enhanced the jejunal villus height (p < 0.05) while reducing the ileal crypt depth (p < 0.05) and colon mucosal thickness (p < 0.05). Collectively, the findings suggested that the use of MGM-P as an alternative to dietary antibiotics could improve diarrhea incidence in early-weaned piglets without negative effects on growth performance or overall health.

AB  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an essential role in brain development. Emerging data have suggested a possible link between an imbalance in PUFAs and cognitive behavioral deficits in offspring. A diet rich in high linoleic acid (HLA), typically from preconception to lactation, leads to an increase in the ratio of omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in the fetus. Arising research has suggested that a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids is a potential risk factor for inducing autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behavioral deficits. However, the impact of a high n-diet during preconception, pregnancy, lactation, and post-weaning on the brain development of adolescent offspring are yet to be determined. This study examined whether consumption of an HLA diet during pregnancy, lactation, and post-weaning induced social and cognitive impairments in female and male offspring rats that resemble autistic phenotypes in humans. Female Wistar Kyoto rats were fed with either HLA or low linoleic acid (LLA) control diet for 10 weeks before mating, then continued with the same diet throughout the pregnancy and lactation period. Female and male offspring at 5 weeks old were subjected to behavioral tests to assess social interaction behavior and depression-/anxiety-like behavior. Our result showed that chronic consumption of an HLA diet did not affect sociability and social recognition memory, but induced depression-like behavior in male but not in female offspring.

AB  - The genus Argathona Stebbing, 1905 from Singapore waters is reviewed. Four species are reported, namely Argathona rhinoceros (Bleeker, 1857), Argathona aff. macronema, Argathona lineata, new species, and Argathona trichota, new species. The identity and synonymy of Argathona macronema (Bleeker, 1857) is briefly reviewed. Argathona lineata, new species, and Argathona trichota, new species, are both described and figured. An annotated list of all species in the genus Argathona is provided. Argathona lineata, new species, can be recognised by the elongate pentagonal frontal lamina 3.8 times longer than wide, posterior margins of pleonites 3-5 with transverse row of nodules, a sub-truncate pleotelson posterior margin and the dorsal surface of the pleotelson with two dense sub-median fields of acute hyaline setae, and the antennal flagellum extending to pereonite 4; fresh specimens show five or six longitudinal stripes of brown (or dark orange) chromatophores. Argathona trichota, new species, may be identified by the short frontal lamina (shorter than the posterior width), ovigerous females with the dorsum covered by dense hyaline setae, and the relatively short antennal flagellum extending to mid-pereonite 4.

AB  - Candida albicans is ubiquitously present, and colonization in the nose and oral cavity is common. In healthy patients, it usually does not act as a pathogen, but in some cases can cause diseases. The influence of C. albicans as a trigger of T cell activation on the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is controversial, and its exact role is not clear to date. The aim of the present study was to detect and characterize C. albicans-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with CRS, with and without nasal polyps. Tissue and blood samples were collected from patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and from healthy controls. A peptide pool derived from C. albicans antigen was added to tissue and blood samples. After 6 days, lymphocytes were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Activation was assessed by the intracellular marker Ki-67, and the cytokine secretion was measured. Tissue CD8+ T cells of CRSsNP patients showed a significantly higher proportion of Ki-67+ cells after activation with C. albicans antigen compared to peripheral blood CD8+ T cells. Cytokine secretion in response to C. albicans antigen was similar for all study groups. In this study, C. albicans-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in peripheral blood and mucosal tissue in all study groups. In patients suffering from CRSsNP, C. albicans-specific CD8+ T cells were relatively enriched in the nasal mucosa, suggesting that they might play a role in the pathogenesis of CRSsNP.

AB  - Cognitive impairments appear at or before motor signs in about one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a cumulative prevalence of roughly 80% overall. These deficits exact an unrelenting toll on patients' quality and activities of daily life due in part to a lack of available treatments to ameliorate them. This study used three well-validated novel object recognition-based paradigms to explore the suitability of rats with knockout of the PTEN-induced putative kinase1 gene (Pink1) for investigating factors that induce cognitive decline in PD and for testing new ways to mitigate them. Longitudinal testing of rats from 3-9 months of age revealed significant impairments in male Pink1-/- rats compared to wild type controls in Novel Object Recognition, Novel Object Location and Object-in-Place tasks. Task-specific differences in the progression of object discrimination/memory deficits across age were also seen. Finally, testing using an elevated plus maze, a tapered balance beam and a grip strength gauge showed that in all cases recognition memory deficits preceded potentially confounding impacts of gene knockout on affect or motor function. Taken together, these findings suggest that knockout of the Pink1 gene negatively impacts the brain circuits and/or neurochemical systems that support performance in object recognition tasks. Further investigations using Pink1-/- rats and object recognition memory tasks should provide new insights into the neural underpinnings of the visual recognition memory and visuospatial information processing deficits that are often seen in PD patients and accelerate the pace of discovery of better ways to treat them.

TI  - RETRACTED: Research on Recognition Effect of DSCN Network Structure in Hand-Drawn Sketch (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - With the rapid development of image recognition technology, freehand sketch recognition has attracted more and more attention. How to achieve good recognition effect in the absence of color and texture information is the key to the development of freehand sketch recognition. Traditional nonlearning classical models are highly dependent on manual selection features. To solve this problem, a neural network sketch recognition method based on DSCN structure is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the stroke sequence of the sketch is drawn; then, the feature is extracted according to the stroke sequence combined with neural network, and the extracted image features are used as the input of the model to construct the time relationship between different image features.Through the control experiment on TU-Berlin dataset, the results show that, compared with the traditional nonlearning methods, HOG-SVM, SIFT-Fisher Vector, MKL-SVM, and FV-SP, the recognition accuracy of DSCN network is improved by 15.8%, 10.3%, 6.0%, and 2.9%, respectively. Compared with the classical deep learning model, Alex-Net, the recognition accuracy is improved by 5.6%. The above results show that the DSCN network proposed in this paper has strong ability of feature extraction and nonlinear expression and can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of hand-painted sketches after introducing the stroke order.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a medically, psychologically and socially disabling condition. A large body of our knowledge on the basic mechanisms of SCI has been gathered in rodents. For preclinical validation of promising therapies, the use of animal models that are closer to humans has several advantages. This has promoted the more-intensive development of large-animal models for SCI during the past decade. We recently developed a multimodal SCI apparatus for large animals that generated biomechanically reproducible impacts in vivo. It is composed of a spring-load impactor and support systems for the spinal cord and the vertebral column. We now present the functional outcome of farm pigs and minipigs injured with different lesion strengths. There was a correlation between the biomechanical characteristics of the impact, the functional outcome and the tissue damage observed several weeks after injury. We also provide a detailed description of the procedure to generate such a SCI in both farm pigs and minipigs, in the hope to ease the adoption of the swine model by other research groups.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine appropriate numbers and times of daily gas measurements to estimate total daily methane (CH4) emission of meat goats using a GreenFeed system (GFS). A replicated 4 (four measurement protocols) x 4 (four periods) Latin square design was employed with 16 Boer wethers in a confinement pen setting. Measurement protocols entailed three (G-3T; 0600-0700, 1400-1500, and 2200-2300 h), four (G-4T; 0700-0800, 1300-1400, 1900-2000, and 0100-0200 h), and six (G-6T; 0800-0900, 1200-1300, 1600-1700, 2000-2100, 0000-0100, and 0400-0500 h) times for daily measurement periods in GFS. The fourth protocol was continuous measurement over 24 h with animals in an open-circuit respiration calorimetry system (CS). Oat hay was given in individual feeders, and a small predetermined quantity of a pelleted concentrate supplement (bait) was dispensed by the GFS or manually offered for the CS. Overall, total dry matter (DM) intake (614, 625, 635, and 577 g/day for CS, G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 13.9) and digestible DM intake (359, 368, 374, and 320 CS, G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 15.9) were lower for CS than for G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T (p < 0.05), but these variables were not different among the GFS protocols. There was a significant (p < 0.001) effect of measurement protocol on CH4 emission in g/day (11.1, 25.6, 27.3, and 26.7 for CS, G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 1.11), g/kg DM intake (19.3, 46.4, 43.9, and 42.4 for CS, G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 2.03), and g/kg body weight (0.49, 1.11, 1.18, and 1.16 for CS, G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 0.052), with values being much lower for CS than for G-3T, G-4T and G-6T. Conversely, CH4 emission was similar among the GFS protocols despite differences in the time and number of daily visits (2.03, 2.76, and 3.75 visits for G-3T, G-4T, and G-6T, respectively; SEM = 0.114; p < 0.001). Pearson correlation (r) analysis indicated a moderate to high (p < 0.05) correlation between CS and G-3T (r = 0.62 for CH4 in g/day and r = 0.59 for CH4 in g/kg BW), CS and G-4T (r = 0.67 for CH4 in g/day and r = 0.76 for CH4 in g/kg BW), and CS and G-6T (r = 0.70 for CH4 in g/day and r = 0.75 for CH4 in g/kg BW). However, the correlation coefficient for CH4 in g/kg DM intake was low between CS and G-3T (r = 0.11) and CS and G-6T (r = 0.31) but slightly greater between CS and G-4T (r = 0.47). In conclusion, the results suggest that CH4 emissions using GFS in a confinement setting were greater compared with the CS in goats, but CH4-emission estimation using the GFS correlated with the CH4 emission in the CS system with a stronger relationship for the four times of daily measurements.

AB  - Tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is an important crop cultivated in all over the world. The main problem in tea cultivation is the attack by a bug called Helopeltis theivora. Many different strategies, such as the use of pesticides and insecticides, have been developed to prevent pest attacks on tea crops. However, most pesticides and insecticides are also hazardous to the environment. Therefore, biopesticides can be used as alternatives to chemical pesticides to prevent pest attacks on crops. Chitinase is an important biopesticide owing to its ability to prevent pest growth. Hence, this enzyme could be used to target H. theivora by attacking C. sinensis. The present study involved in silico docking and binding analysis of a chitinase from Pseudomonas fluorescens MP-13 with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from H. theivora. The secondary structures of chitinase and GAPDH were determined using SOPMA, and their three-dimensional structures were modeled using the Swiss model and validated using PROCHECK and Ramachandran plots. Chitinase and GAPDH were docked using HADDOCK docking software. Docking studies governed a HADDOCK docking score of -125.8, which showed good binding between the two proteins. The amino acid residues involved in binding were analyzed using PDBSum and the final docked structure was visualized using PyMol. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics studies, the binding region between chitinase and GAPDH residues was intact and stable, and did not detach throughout the simulation duration. It is clearly evidenced that chitinase from P. fluorescens and GAPDH from H. theivora interacted well with each other, thereby improves the chitinase's ability to target H. theivora and hence, chitinase can be used as a potent biopesticide. However, a detailed molecular functional and experimental studies are mandates to confirm the role of P. fluorescens in regulation of H. theivora.

AB  - It is well known that the body's metabolism and reproduction are closely related. Chemerin (CHEM) is one of many biologically active proteins secreted by the adipose tissue involved in the regulation of the energy homeostasis of the organism. In the present study, RNA-sequencing was performed to investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and alternatively spliced (AS) transcripts in the cultured porcine endometrium exposed to chemerin for 24 hours (CHEM; 400 ng/mL) collected during the implantation period (15-16 days of gestation). High-throughput sequencing of transcriptomes was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, USA). In the current study, among all 130 DEGs, 58 were upregulated and 72 were downregulated in the CHEM-treated group. DEGs were assigned to 73 functional annotations. Twelve identified lncRNAs indicated a difference in the expression profile after CHEM administration. Additionally, we detected 386 differentially AS events encompassed 274 protein-coding genes and 2 lncRNAs. All AS events were divided into five alternative splicing types: alternative 3 ' splice site (A3SS), 5 ' splice site (A5SS), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), retention intron (RI), and skipping exon (SE). Within all AS events, we identified 42 A3SS, 43 A5SS, 53 MXE, 9 RI, and 239 SE. In summary, CHEM affects the transcriptomic profile of the porcine endometrium, controlling the expression of numerous genes, including those involved in the cell migration and adhesion, angiogenesis, inflammation, and steroidogenesis. It can be assumed that CHEM may be an important factor for a proper course of gestation and embryo development.
   Chemerin takes part in the control of pig embryo implantation process via regulation of endometrial genes expression, including those involved in the cell migration and adhesion, angiogenesis, inflammation, and steroidogenesis.

AB  - It is necessary to detoxify municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWIFA) to facilitate resource utilization. The current research focused on the treatment of heavy metals in MSWIFA which is relatively well-developed, while dioxins (PCDD/Fs) need to be treated with more referable programs. Based on the excellent lipophilicities of dioxins, readily available, nontoxic, harmless, and easily treatable animal fats have been used to separate the dioxins from MSWIFA samples, thereby reducing the toxic equivalence of the MSWIFA. The experimental results indicated that animal fats significantly reduced the toxic equivalence of untreated, waterwashed, and acid-washed MSWIFA samples, with reductions in the dioxin toxicity equivalence of up to 70%. Furthermore, in studies of heavy metal leaching, water washing followed by pig fat (FP) separation was identified as the optimal approach for the separation of dioxins from MSWIFA. Under the optimal conditions, the toxicity due to dioxins was reduced by over 70% after separation from MSWIFA with recycled animal fats. The environmental and economic benefits of this treatment option were analyzed on this basis.

AB  - We investigated the contribution of visual imagination to the cognitive mapping of a building when initial exploration was simulated either visually by using a passive video walk-through, or mentally by using verbal guidance. Building layout had repeating elements with either rotational or mirror symmetry. Cognitive mapping of the virtual building, determined using questionnaires and map drawings, was present following verbal guidance but inferior to that following video guidance. Mapping was not affected by the building's structural symmetry. However, notably, it correlated with small-scale mental rotation scores for both video and verbal guidance conditions. There was no difference between males and females. A common factor that may have influenced cognitive mapping was the availability of visual information about the relationships of the building elements, either directly perceived (during the video walk-through) or imagined (during the verbal walk-through and/or during recall). Differences in visual imagination, particularly mental rotation, may thus account for some of the individual variance in cognitive mapping of complex built environments, which is relevant to how designers provide navigation-relevant information.

AB  - Farm procedures have an impact on animal welfare by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that induces a wide array of physiological responses. This adaptive system guarantees that the animal copes with environmental variations and it induces metabolic and molecular changes that can be quantified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in the regulation of homeostasis and emerging evidence has identified circulating miRNAs as promising biomarkers of stress-related disorders in animals. Based on a clustering analysis of salivary cortisol trends and levels, 20 ewes were classified into two different clusters. The introduction of a ram in the flock was identified as a common farm practice and reference time point to collect saliva samples. Sixteen miRNAs related to the adaptation response were selected. Among them, miR-16b, miR-21, miR-24, miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-99a, and miR-223 were amplified in saliva samples. Cluster 1 was characterized by a lower expression of miR-16b and miR-21 compared with Cluster 2 (p < 0.05). This study identified for the first time several miRNAs expressed in sheep saliva, pointing out significant differences in the expression patterns between the cortisol clusters. In addition, the trend analyses of these miRNAs resulted in clusters (p = 0.017), suggesting the possible cooperation of miR-16b and -21 in the integrated stress responses, as already demonstrated in other species as well. Other research to define the role of these miRNAs is needed, but the evaluation of the salivary miRNAs could support the selection of ewes for different profiles of response to sources of stressors common in the farm scenario.

AB  - During neuronal development, dynamic filopodia emerge from dendrites and mature into functional dendritic spines during synaptogenesis. Dendritic filopodia and spines respond to extracellular cues, influencing dendritic spine shape and size as well as synaptic function. Previously, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 was shown to regulate filopodia in early stages of neuronal development, including netrin-1-dependent axon guidance and branching. Here, we demonstrate that TRIM9 also localizes to dendritic filopodia and spines of murine cortical and hippocampal neurons during synaptogenesis and is required for synaptic responses to netrin. In particular, TRIM9 is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) within dendritic spines and loss of Trim9 alters the PSD proteome, including the actin cytoskeleton landscape. While netrin exposure induces accumulation of the Arp2/3 complex and filamentous actin in dendritic spine heads, this response is disrupted by genetic deletion of Trim9. In addition, we document changes in the synaptic receptors associated with loss of Trim9. These defects converge on a loss of netrin-dependent increases in neuronal firing rates, indicating TRIM9 is required downstream of synaptic netrin-1 signaling. We propose that TRIM9 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in dendritic spines and is required for the proper response to synaptic stimuli.

AB  - The tiger milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerus), a SoutheastAsian medicinal mushroom, has traditional uses for respiratory ailments, wound healing, and general health. This study evaluated the acute dermal toxicity of L. rhinocerus sclerotium (TM02 (R)) and cold-water extract (xLr (R)) for safe topical application. Healthy female Sprague Dawley rats were topically administered TM02 (R) or xLr (R) at 2000 mg/kg body weight, while physiological saline served as a control. Visual toxicity observations, body and organ weight measurements, food and water intake, hematological and serum biochemical analyses, and histological examinations were performed. Findings were contextualized with prior oral toxicity studies of L. rhinocerus. Both TM02 (R) and xLr (R) demonstrated excellent dermal safety with no observed mortality, behavioural abnormalities, or significant differences in food or water intake, body weight, or organ weights compared with controls. Hematological and biochemical parameters remained within normal ranges, and histopathology of the skin and major organs revealed no adverse effects. Consistent with earlier chronic oral toxicity studies, the preparations showed no evidence of systemic toxicity or organ damage. TM02 (R) and xLr (R) are classified as Category 5/Unclassified under the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) criteria, affirming their suitability for topical use. These findings, coupled with earlier oral toxicity studies, highlight the safety of L. rhinocerus as a versatile ingredient for therapeutic and cosmetic applications. Further research on chronic dermal exposure is recommended to reinforce its use in skincare.

AB  - The Levantine Middle Paleolithic period displays significant archaeological variability across a series of cave and open-air sites encompassing ca. 200,000 years. Faunal remains are an important source of knowledge regarding hunting and mobility patterns but have mostly been studied in the deep stratigraphic sequences of the Levantine caves. This research addresses questions of hunting, carcass transport, butchery patterns and use of space as they occurred at the Middle Paleolithic open-air site of Nesher Ramla in central Israel. The site is an 8-m-thick sequence within a karst sinkhole, dating to MIS6/5. We conducted the first detailed taphonomic and zooarchaeological study at the site, focusing on a sample from Unit III, which is a thin layer with dense lithics and faunal remains, combustion features, manuports, and ochre. Our results reveal an anthropogenic accumulation that is dominated by aurochs, equid, and tortoise remains. The large ungulates' (aurochs) skeletal-element representation is biased in favor of meat- and fat-rich body parts, coupled with abundant evidence of dismemberment, filleting and marrow extraction. These parts were imported to the sinkhole for processing and consumption. Tortoises are abundant. The lithic assemblages exhibit high frequency of retouched tools and low typological diversity and are characterized by high visibility of personal toolkit components. Coupled with use-wear analysis that suggests a low spectrum of activities and massive occurrence of hammerstones, anvils and manuports, these characteristics indicate that the Unit III occupation represents an intensive camp centering on aurochs processing and butchering.

AB  - Synthesis, characterization and assessment of therapeutic efficacy of chitosan-ricobendazole complex were carried out for the first time in this work. Study of physico-chemical properties revealed the optimal ratio of chitosan: ricobendazole (30:4). Quantum chemical modeling set the optimal parameters for the formation of the chitosan-ricobendazole molecular system (E = -3765.26 kcal/mol, eta = 0.127 eV), which was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy showed spherical particles of chitosan-ricobendazole complex ranging in size from 100 to 200 mu m. Study of therapeutic efficiency was conducted on sheep with dicroceliosis. Notably, the therapeutic efficiency of the chitosan-ricobendazole complex (4 mg/kg of ricobendazole) reached 89 %, while the therapeutic efficiency of the commercial preparation ricazole (8 mg/kg of ricobendazole) was 92 %. Biochemical blood test indicated equivalent normalization of hematological parameters in sheep after treatment with ricazole and the chitosan-ricobendazole complex. Histological examination of infected sheep liver revealed that treatment with the chitosan-ricobendazole complex leads to a decrease in the number of helminth eggs with subsequent therapeutic effect on the severity of the disease. This proves the enhanced solubility of ricobendazole at a dosage of 4 mg/kg, active interaction of the components and relatively high bioavailability without increasing the release rate of ricobendazole.

AB  - Nitrogen is the most essential nutrient for plant growth and serves as a key limiting factor in overall plant development. Photosynthesis is the primary process for energy capture in the biosphere, and its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the nitrogen content and distribution within leaves. In this experiment, the yellow tea variety "Jinfeng No. 2" (hereinafter referred to as JF) and the green tea variety "Fuding Da Bai Tea" (hereinafter referred to as FD) were utilized as experimental materials. Five nitrogen levels were established to investigate the effects of varying nitrogen levels on leaf characteristics, including photosynthetic physiology, leaf nitrogen allocation, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency in tea plants. The results demonstrated that the net photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency of both tea cultivars initially increased and then decreased with rising nitrogen levels. As nitrogen levels gradually increased, the nitrogen content in the carboxylation and electron transport systems for both tea varieties first rose and then declined. Specifically, nitrogen content in the light capture system of FD increased initially but then decreased, while in JF, it exhibited a steady increase. Additionally, nitrogen content in the structural system increased slowly, whereas that in the storage system rose significantly. With increasing nitrogen levels, the distribution ratio of leaf nitrogen in the carboxylation and electron transport systems initially increased and then decreased; in the structural system, it first decreased and subsequently stabilized, while in the storage system, it gradually increased. In the light capture system, the two varieties displayed different trends: FD's nitrogen distribution decreased, while JF's increased. Our results indicated that within a certain range, increasing nitrogen levels can significantly enhance the photosynthetic capacity of tea plants and improve photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. However, at high nitrogen levels, the reduction in nitrogen content and the proportion allocated to the photosynthetic system, along with the increase in nitrogen content and proportion allocated to non-photosynthetic systems, were the primary factors contributing to the decline in net photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. By increasing the nitrogen content in the carboxylation and electron transport systems, tea plants can achieve enhanced photosynthetic capacity.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is one of the main causes of sickness and depressive-like behavior. Rosmarinic acid (RA) has been shown to have a significant anti-neuroinflammatory effect. However, the protective effects and the underlying mechanism of RA on sickness and depressive-like behavior under conditions of neuroinflammation are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects and the underlying mechanism of RA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice with sickness behavior. The behavioral effects of LPS treatment and RA administration were assessed using behavioral tests including a sucrose preference test and an open field test. The neuroprotective effects of RA in conditions of neuroinflammatory injury were determined by HE staining, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescent staining. Moreover, its underlying mechanism was analyzed by using real-time PCR analysis, western blot, and immunofluorescent analysis. The results indicated that RA dramatically mitigated sickness behaviors and histologic brain damage in mice exposed to LPS. In addition, RA administration markedly promoted the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the key regulatory proteins for Nrf2 activation (p21 and p62), the downstream antioxidant enzymes (HO1, NQO1, GCLC), the autophagy-related proteins (LC3II and Beclin1), and mitochondrial respiratory enzyme genes (ME1, IDH1, 6-PGDH), while reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (CD44, iNOS, TNF alpha, IL10). Moreover, the double-label immunofluorescent analysis revealed that RA increased the fluorescence intensity of LC3 mostly co-localized with neurons and co-expressed with Nrf2. Taken together, our research found that RA could effectively alleviate sickness behaviors and nerve injury caused by neuroinflammation, and its protective effects were mediated by the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which reduced cellular oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial respiratory function damage, and autophagy imbalance. Therefore, RA has the potential to prevent or treat sickness and depressive-like behaviors under conditions of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Chick rearing is one of the most energy-expensive phases of the breeding cycle for adult birds. It has been suggested that the daily energy expenditure (DEE) that birds may sustain over extended time periods may be set at approximately 4x basal metabolic rate (BMR). Parent birds can be expected to face the upper limit of DEE during the chick-rearing period. To determine whether parents rearing chicks exceed the sustainable limits of DEE in the temperate regions, in this study we measured parental DEE of Rhinoceros Auklet Cerorhinca monocerata using the doubly- labeled water method in 2018 and 2019 on Teuri Island, Japan. We found that, with only on exception, all individuals had DEE below 4x BMR. Our findings suggest that Rhinoceros Auklets basically have DEEs within "the maximum sustained working level".

AB  - Gestational chronic hypoxia impacts prenatal development, leading to fetal growth restriction (FGR), defined as the fetus's failure to reach its genetic growth potential. Postnatal hypoxia in the cerebral tissue can induce a redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently increasing neuronal death. However, these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to prenatal hypoxia. In this regard, this study aims to describe the effect of gestational hypoxia on redox balance and apoptosis cell death mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex of guinea pigs. Ten Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) pregnant dams were utilized in this study; five gestated in normoxia (Nx; three newborn males, and two females) and five gestated under chronic hypobaric hypoxia (Hx; two newborn males, and three females). We monitored the pregnancies by ultrasound examinations from gestational days 20 to 65 (term similar to 70). At birth, pups were euthanized, and the fetal brain was collected for cellular redox measurement, mitochondrial enzyme expression, and apoptosis assay. Gestation under hypoxia induced an imbalance in the expression of anti- and pro-oxidant enzymes, resulting in increased oxidative stress. Additionally, a decrease in cytochrome I and III expression and neuronal density in the neonatal prefrontal cortex was observed. Finally, DNA fragmentation was increased by the TUNEL assay in the brain tissue of newborns gestated under chronic hypoxia. Our findings demonstrate the association of gestational hypoxia with oxidative stress and neuronal death in newborns, which may predispose to neuronal dysfunction in adulthood.

AB  - Dehorning is a conservation measure used to protect rhinoceroses ('rhinos') from being poached by removing most of the visible horn and thus reducing the monetary reward for the risk that a poacher takes. Rhinos use their horns in comfort and aggressive social behaviours. The loss of the horn might result in a decrease in aggressive and affiliative behaviours and an increase in avoidance behaviours after dehorning due to a reduced effectiveness and potential discomfort when using the nasal body part. The dehorning procedure, which includes chasing and immobilization, can lead to the separation of groups and might therefore result in fewer social interactions. To estimate whether the stress of the dehorning procedure and the loss of the horn affect the activity budget of the rhino, we compared general activities and horn-related behaviours before and after dehorning. We observed nine (six females and three males) wild white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) in Botswana for 1 month before and 1 month after dehorning. The proportions of feeding, resting, comfort, aggressive, avoidance and affiliative behaviours did not change significantly within 1 month after dehorning. We observed sex-specific changes in proportions of locomotion and in vocalization rates, which we linked to the chasing during the procedure and to the social events of two births in the study population. Effects of the dehorning itself seemed to be weak and short-lived. Our results suggest that dehorning has no major impact on rhino behaviour. However, there is a key need to investigate the effectiveness of dehorning in reducing poaching events.

AB  - Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is one of the main active metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In our previous works, by using rat and Drosophila models, we showed a disruption of neural function due to DEHP. However, the exact neural effects of MEHP are still unclear. To explore the effects of MEHP on the central nervous system, the electrophysiological properties of spontaneous action potential (sAP), mini-excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), ion channels, including Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels from rat CA3 hippocampal neurons area were assessed. Our data showed that MEHP (at the concentrations of 100 or 300 mu M) decreased the amplitude of sAP and the frequency of mEPSCs. Additionally, MEHP (100 or 300 mu M) significantly reduced the peak current density of Ca2+ channels, whereas only the concentration of 300 mu M decreased the peak current density of Na+ and K+ channels. Therefore, our results indicate that exposure to MEHP could affect the neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity of rat CA3 hippocampal neurons by inhibiting ion channels' activity, implying the distinct role of MEHP in neural transmission.

AB  - Psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) are herbivores that feed and reproduce on narrow subsets of hosts within a few related genera. During surveys of Solanum umbelliferum (Eschsch) (Solanaceae), we collected multiple life stages of Bactericera maculipennis (Crawford), a species exclusively associated with bindweeds (Convolvulaceae). We hypothesized that B. maculipennis has expanded its host range to include this solanaceous host. To test this, we quantified egg to adult development time on S. umbelliferum, 2 other solanaceous hosts, and Convolvulus arvensis L., the most suitable host for B. maculipennis in North America. B. maculipennis failed to develop on additional solanaceous hosts but developed significantly faster on S. umbelliferum than on C. arvensis. We also sampled for B. maculipennis at 27 S. umbelliferum populations and collected 24 individuals directly from S. umbelliferum plants. We confirmed all individuals are B. maculipennis and found that 10/24 were infected with the plant pathogen 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (CLso), which is transmitted by the potato psyllid, B. cockerelli (& Scaron;ulc). Half of infected individuals harbored CLso haplotype B, which is dominant in crops, but rare in S. umbelliferum. The other 50% harbored CLso haplotype Sumb2, previously documented in S. umbelliferum, but never in crops. Our results suggest that the host range of B. maculipennis has expanded to include a key wild host plant of B. cockerelli. This may create opportunities for exchange of multiple haplotypes of CLso between these 2 species, possibly facilitating the emergence of CLso variants as pathogens of plants in the Convolvulaceae.

AB  - Kunitz-like protease inhibitors (KTIs) have been identified to play critical roles in insect defense, but evidence for their involvement in drought stress is sparse. The aim of this study was to identify and functionally characterize a Kunitz-like protease inhibitor, GsKTI, from the wild soybean (Glycine soja) variety ED059. Expression patterns suggest that drought stress and insect herbivory may induce GsKTI transcript levels. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing GsKTI have been shown to exhibit enhanced drought tolerance by regulating the ABA signaling pathway and increasing xylem cell number. Transgenic Arabidopsis leaves overexpressing GsKTI interfered with insect digestion and thus had a negative effect on the growth of Helicoverpa armigera. It is concluded that GsKTI increases resistance to drought stress and insect attack in transgenic Arabidopsis lines.

AB  - Emotional and cognitive impairment has been recognized as a central feature of depression, which is closely related to hyperfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis caused by down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in patients. A decrease in GR expression can cause pathological changes and lead to the impairment of synaptic plasticity. Legumain, a lysosomal cysteine protease, plays an important role in neurological diseases. It is reported that legumain activates the MAPK signaling pathway, which modifies the GR. Therefore, we hypothesize that regulation of the GR by legumain plays a crucial role in the pathological process of depression. The relationships between legumain, GR, synaptic plasticity and emotional and cognitive deficits were explored in this study. The results demonstrated that repeated corticosterone (CORT) injections (3 weeks) induced emotional and cognitive deficits in mice, based on behavioral experiments and the detection of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, CORT injections decreased the expression of hippocampal synapse-related proteins, cell density and dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, accompanied by increased protein expression in the MAPK signaling pathway and decreased expression of the GR. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that legumain knockout up-regulated expression of the GR by reducing protein expression in the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby improving hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as the emotional and cognitive impairment of model mice. This suggests that legumain may be an effective therapeutic target for emotional and cognitive deficits.

AB  - The dorsal hippocampus is involved in behavioral avoidance regulation. It is unclear how experiences such as the neonatal stress of maternal deprivation (MD) and post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) affect avoidance behavior and the dorsal hippocampal parameters, including neuronal morphology, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling, and oxytocin receptor (OTR) level. In male BALB/c mice, we found that MD impaired avoidance behavior in the step-on test compared to non-MD and EE rearing conditions could alleviate that partially. MD increased neuronal branches in the CA1 but decreased synaptic connection levels in the CA2, CA3, and DG. Meanwhile, MD increased the CA1's OTR levels, which negatively correlated with nucleus densities. MD also increased the CA1's and CA2's CRH levels, which positively correlated with CRHR1 levels. However, MD statistically elevated the CA3's CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) levels, which negatively correlated with nucleus densities and, probably, synaptic connection levels in the CA3. The additive effects of MD and EE maintained similar CRH levels and CRHR1 levels as well as OTR levels in the hippocampal areas as the additive of non-MD and non-EE. However, the presence of MD and EE still decreased the CA1's neuronal branches and the CA2's and DG's synaptic connection levels. The study illustrates how MD and EE affect avoidance behaviors, hippocampal neuron morphology, and CRH and OTR levels. The results indicate that the late-life environmental improvement partially restores the alterations in dorsal hippocampal areas induced by early life stress.

AB  - Ongoing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the hippocampus results in a heterogenous pop-ulation of neurons. Immature adult-born neurons (ABNs) have physiological and anatomical properties that may give them a unique role in learning. For example, compared to older granule neurons, they have greater somatic excitability, which could facilitate their recruitment into memory traces. However, recruitment is also likely to depend on interactions with other DG neurons through processes such as lateral inhibition. Immature ABNs target inhibitory interneurons and, compared to older neurons, they receive less GABAergic inhibition. Thus, they may induce lateral inhibition of mature DG neurons while being less susceptible to inhibition themselves. To test this we used a chemogenetic approach to silence immature ABNs as rats learned a spatial water maze task, and measured activity (Fos expression) in ABNs and developmentally-born neurons (DBNs). A retrovirus expressing the inhibitory DREADD receptor, hM4Di, was injected into the dorsal DG of male rats at 6w to infect neurons born in adulthood. Animals were also injected with BrdU to label DBNs or ABNs. DBNs were significantly more active than immature 4-week-old ABNs. Silencing 4-week-old ABNs did not alter learning but it increased activity in DBNs. However, silencing ABNs did not affect activation in other ABNs within the DG. Silencing ABNs also did not alter Fos expression in parvalbumin-and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Collectively, these results suggest that ABNs may directly inhibit DBN activity during hippocampal-dependent learning, which may be relevant for maintaining sparse hippocampal representations of experienced events.

AB  - Based on the original data on the fractionation of stomach and excrements contents, the effectiveness of the masticatory apparatus and post-gastric transformation of food particles in representatives of small herbivorous mammals is considered. It was found out that in the group of small animals with a body mass from 20 to 200 g the effectiveness of chewing does not depend on the body size but is due to the specifics of the functioning of the chewing apparatus. Particle reduction in this group is masked by a rapid change in digestion regimes, the intensity of nonspecific or specialized coprophagy, and the development of the fiber separation mechanism in the large intestine, which leads to high variability of results. The influence of body size is realized when larger herbivores with a body mass of up to 3-5 kg (hares) and up to 20 kg (beavers) are introduced into the comparison. In this case the influence of body size on the effectiveness of chewing is clearly manifested. In this interaction between the groups of animals, effects similar to those previously established in a wide comparative series of large herbivores with a body mass of up to 3000 kg were revealed. Thus, chewing can be considered as a function of body size, when comparing animals that differ significantly in body mass. Special attention is paid to the fraction of the finest particles, as containing not only fragments of fibers, but also non-food inclusions.

AB  - Animal color pattern is a phenotypic trait that may mediate assortative mixing (also known as homophily), whereby similar looking individuals have stronger social associations. Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) coat spot patterns show high variation and some spot traits appear to be heritable. Giraffes also have high visual acuity, which may facilitate intraspecific communication and recognition based on spot patterns. Giraffe groupings are dynamic, merging and splitting throughout the day, but females form long-term associations. We predicted that adult female giraffes show stronger associations with other females that have similar spot pattern traits. We quantified the spot pattern characteristics of 399 adult female Masai giraffes and determined the pattern similarity among pairs (dyads) in their social network. We then tested for an association between coat pattern similarity (spot size, shape, and orientation) and dyadic association strength, and quantified assortative mixing. The strength of social associations was positively correlated with similarity in spot shape. Our results are compatible with assortativity by coat patterns that are similar between mother and offspring, potentially reflecting an effect of relatedness on both pattern similarity and female social associations. These results offer evidence that spot pattern could function as a visual cue for intraspecific communication and kin or individual recognition in a fission-fusion species.

AB  - The nucleus reuniens (RE) is situated in the midline thalamus and provides a key link between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This anatomical relationship positions the Re as an ideal candidate to facilitate memory consolidation. However, there is no evidence that this role extends beyond spatial memory and contextual fear memory, which are both strongly associated with hippocampal function. We, therefore, trained intact male Long-Evans rats on an odor-trace-object paired-associate task where the explicit 10-s delay between paired items renders the task sensitive to hippocampal function. Neurons in the RE showed significantly increased activation of the immediate early gene (Zif268) when rats were re-tested for previous non-spatial memory 25 days after acquisition training, compared to a group tested at 5-days post-acquisition, as well as a control group tested 25 days after acquisition but with a new pair of non-spatial stimuli, and home cage controls. The remote recall group also showed relatively augmented IEG expression in the superficial layers of the medial PFC (anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex). These findings support the conclusion that the RE is preferentially engaged during remote recall in this non-spatial task and thus has a role beyond spatial memory and contextual fear memory.

AB  - Stressful life events predict changes in brain structure and increases in psychopathology, but not everyone is equally affected by life stress. The learned helplessness theory posits that perceiving life stressors as uncontrollable leads to depression. Evidence supports this theory for youth, but the impact of perceived control diverges based on stressor type: perceived lack of control over dependent (self-generated) stressors is associated with greater depression symptoms when controlling for the frequency of stress exposure, but perceived control over independent (non-self-generated) stressors is not. However, it is unknown how perceived control over these stressor types is associated with brain structure. We tested whether perceived lack of control over dependent and independent life stressors, controlling for stressor exposure, is associated with gray matter (GM) in a priori regions of interest (ROIs; mPFC, hippocampus, amygdala) and across the cortex in a sample of 108 adolescents and emerging adults ages 14-22. There were no associations across the full sample between perceived control over either stressor type and GM in the ROIs. However, less perceived control over dependent stressors was associated with greater amygdala gray matter volume in female youth and greater medial prefrontal cortex thickness in male youth. Furthermore, whole-cortex analyses revealed less perceived control over dependent stressors was associated with greater GM thickness in cortical regions involved in cognitive and emotional regulation. Thus, appraisals of control have distinct associations with brain morphology while controlling for stressor frequency, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these aspects of the stress experience in future research.

AB  - Ecological niche differentiation among sympatric animal species is a primary mechanism maintaining a longterm and stable coexistence. Information on the pattern of coexistence among sympatric species is vital to provide specific conservation measures and management. This study focuses on the spatial -temporal niche differentiation strategy adopted by black -and -white snub-nosed monkeys ( Rhinopithecus bieti ) and rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) to support their coexistence along a large elevation gradient in the temperate montane forest of Xiangguqing, located in the southern section of Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve, China. Daily activities of the monkeys were recorded with infrared camera traps installed at elevation intervals of 200 m between 2,100 m and 3,500 m from January 2018 to May 2021. The time interval between the two species appearing at the same plots and the number of individuals were calculated for each site and differences were assessed according to seasons and elevation. No direct encounters between the two species were captured by camera traps, although they did appear up in the same camera traps at altitudes between 2,900 m - 3,500 m. M. mulatta was also observed at elevations below 2,500 m, near the farmland and villages. The two monkey species were mostly recorded at an altitudinal spectrum within 3,100 m - 3,500 m, but with significant differences in seasonal frequencies in the same elevational gradients. The two species avoided encountering each other to limit direct competition and conflicts. Moreover, differences in foraging strategy and dietary selection contributed to the coexistence of the two primate species in mountain habitats. Our findings suggest that, to support the coexistence and survival of these two primate species living in high altitude montane regions, the habitats along the overall elevational gradients should be included in wildlife conservation policies.

AB  - The "adaptive sterilization hypothesis" argues that the tendency of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to cause infertility likely reflects an evolutionary adaptation of these pathogens. For example, some STIs can lead to bilateral occlusions of the oviducts and sterile matings. Cycling females that do not spend time gestating and lactating are ready to mate sooner than fertile females, and therefore, likely to mate more frequently and possibly more promiscuously. These sexual activities are associated with enhanced transmissibility of STIs, and tubal occlusion is a proximate mechanism by which STIs can increase fitness. Our principal objectives were to determine whether female mice inoculated with Chlamydia muridarum mate more frequently than mice inoculated with sterile saline and to test the hypothesis that tubal occlusion following C. muridarum infection modulates mating behavior in a manner that might increase transmissibility of Chlamydia. Similar to C. trachomatis infections in human females, C. muridarum can ascend the reproductive tract of mice, damage and occlude the oviducts, and cause infertility. However, ovarian function and mating activity are maintained following tubal occlusion. A total of 20 C57Bl/6 mice with regular estrous cycles were given intravaginal inocula of C. muridarum and 32 days later paired with a male for 90 days. A total of nine saline-treated females served as controls. A total of three Chlamydia-inoculated females were rendered infertile due to bilateral oviductal damage and mated eight (+/- 0.0) times. Control females mated on average 4.6 (+/- 0.3) times, and 17 Chlamydia-inoculated fertile females, including six females with only a single oviduct occluded, mated on average 4.7 (+/- 0.2) times. Chlamydia-inoculated fertile females with unilateral oviductal damage had significantly smaller average litter sizes as compared to females inoculated with saline. Females with unilateral tubal occlusion also tended to wean fewer pups than saline controls over the course of 90 days. Female mice with Chlamydia-induced tubal infertility mated more frequently (approximately every 11 d) than did fertile females (approximately every 20 days), which is consistent with the adaptive sterilization hypothesis. To determine whether Chlamydia-induced sterilization is truly adaptive, future studies will need to demonstrate increased sexual transmissibility, and possibly increased promiscuity, within populations of freely breeding mice.

AB  - In vertebrate population estimation, converting faecal density into animal density requires information on the faecal production rate, decay rate and faecal density. Differences in the above factors for long-lived species across age classes were not evaluated. We have evaluated these factors associated with the dung count of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in the tropical forest of southern India. The defecation rate of elephants was determined in semi-wild elephants at the Mudumalai elephant camp. The relationship between dung bolus diameter and age was determined to estimate the age of the elephant. The total and age-specific elephant density based on dung bolus diameter was estimated. A total of 24 transect lines of 2-4 km (125 km) were sampled in the study area. An experiment was conducted to assess the detection probability across the age classes of dung piles. The dung decay rates across age classes and seasons were determined by marking fresh dung piles (n = 1551). The dung-based age structure assessment and its limitations were evaluated. The mean defecation rate was 13.51 +/- 0.51 per day. The defecation rate was significantly lower for the younger age class and increased with the age of elephants. Defecation rates were significantly lower in the wet season than in the dry. The dung bolus diameter positively increased with the age of elephants, and the growth curve can be used to predict the age and age structure of elephant populations. The disparity in the dung production rate results in the lower availability of younger age class (juvenile and calf) dung in the transect for counting, which results in lower dung abundance. The detection probability of dung piles of younger age classes was low (0.58). The survival rates of dung piles of younger age classes were lower and increased with the age of elephants in the wet season. Hence, the demographic assessment of the population based on dung needs to consider age-specific differences in dung production, decay and detection probability. Although the demographic assessment using dung provides insight into population age structure, it has limitations in predicting age structure for young elephants.

AB  - As animals age, they exhibit a suite of phenotypic changes, often including reductions in movement and social behaviour ('behavioural ageing'). By altering an individual's exposure to parasites, behavioural ageing may influence infection status trajectories over the lifespan. However, these processes could be confounded by age-related changes in other phenotypic traits, or by selective disappearance of certain individuals owing to parasite-induced mortality. Here, we uncover contrasting age-related patterns of infection across three helminth parasites in wild adult female red deer (Cervus elaphus). Counts of strongyle nematodes (order: Strongylida) increased with age, while counts of liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) and tissue worm (Elaphostrongylus cervi) decreased, and lungworm (Dictyocaulus) counts did not change. These relationships could not be explained by socio-spatial behaviours, spatial structuring, or selective disappearance, suggesting behavioural ageing is unlikely to be responsible for driving age trends. Instead, social connectedness and strongyle infection were positively correlated, such that direct age-infection trends were directly contrasted with the effects implied by previously documented behavioural ageing. This suggests that behavioural ageing may reduce parasite exposure, potentially countering other age-related changes. These findings demonstrate that different parasites can show contrasting age trajectories depending on diverse intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and that behaviour's role in these processes is likely to be complex and multidirectional.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Understanding age and society using natural populations'.

AB  - Surveillance of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in risk groups is an important strategy to monitor its circulation pattern and to timely detect changes thereof. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to estimate the prevalence of HEV infections in pigs and humans from different regions of the country, to identify risk factors for increasing anti-HEV IgG prevalence and to characterize HEV strains. The presence of anti-HEV antibodies was assessed by commercial ELISA in serum samples from the general population, farm and slaughterhouse employees, as well as pigs sampled in the three regions of Cuba from February to September 2016. Overall, individuals with occupational exposure to swine or swine products (70/248, 28.2%) were 4 times more likely to be seropositive compared to the general population (25/285, 8.7%; OR: 4.18; p < .001). Within the risk group, risk factors included age, number of years working in a professional activity with direct exposure to swine, geographic region and distance between residence and closest professional swine setting, while wearing gloves had a protective effect. Prevalence of total anti-HEV antibodies in swine was 88.2% (165/187) and HEV RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR in 9.2% (16/173) swine stools. All HEV strains sequenced clustered within genotype 3. Some strains clearly belonged to subtype 3a, while another group of strains was related with subtypes 3b and 3 k but partial HEV sequences did not allow unequivocal subtype assignment. These findings suggest that the high HEV exposure in Cuban individuals with swine-related occupations could be due to enzootic HEV in certain regions, direct contact with infectious animals or their products as well as environmental contamination.

AB  - Microglial cells have been demonstrated to be significant resident immune cells that maintain homeostasis under physiological conditions. However, prolonged or excessive microglial activation leads to disturbances in the resolution of inflammation (RoI). Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is a crucial player in the RoI, interacting with various ligands to induce distinct conformational changes and, consequently, diverse biological effects. Due to the poor pharmacokinetic properties of endogenous FPR2 ligands, the aim of our study was to evaluate the pro-resolving effects of a new ureidopropanamide agonist, compound AMS21, in hippocampal organotypic cultures (OHCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, to assess whether AMS21 exerts its action via FPR2 specifically located on microglial cells, we conducted a set of experiments in OHCs depleted of microglial cells using clodronate. We demonstrated that the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of AMS21 manifested as decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nitric oxide (NO), and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 release evoked by LPS in OHCs. Moreover, in LPS-stimulated OHCs, AMS21 treatment downregulated NLRP3 inflammasome-related factors (CASP1, NLRP3, PYCARD) and this effect was mediated through FPR2 because it was blocked by the FPR2 antagonist WRW4 pre-treatment. Importantly this beneficial effect of AMS21 was only observed in the presence of microglial FPR2, and absent in OHCs depleted with microglial cells using clodronate. Our results strongly suggest that the compound AMS21 exerts, at nanomolar doses, protective and anti-inflammatory properties and an FPR2 receptor located specifically on microglial cells mediates the anti-inflammatory response of AMS21. Therefore, microglial FPR2 represents a promising target for the enhancement of RoI.

AB  - Although the antidepressant effects of running exercise have been widely reported, further research is still needed to determine the structural bases for these effects. Astrocyte processes physically contact many synapses and directly regulate the numbers of synapses, but it remains unclear whether running exercise can modulate astrocyte morphological complexity and astrocyte-contacted synapses in the hippocampus of the mice with depressive -like behavior. Male C57BL/6 J mice underwent four weeks of running exercise after four weeks of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were used to assess anhedonia in mice. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of astrocyte- and synapse -related proteins. Immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction were used to quantify the density and morphology of astrocytes, and astrocyte-contacted synapses in each hippocampal subregion. Four weeks of running exercise alleviated depressive -like symptoms in mice. The expression of astrocyte- and synapserelated proteins in the hippocampus; astrocyte process lengths, process numbers, and dendritic arborization; and the number of astrocyte-contacted PSD95 positive synapses in the CA2 -3 and DG regions were significantly decreased in the mice with depressive -like behavior, and running exercise successfully reserved these changes. Running exercise improved the decreases in astrocyte morphological complexity and astrocyte-contacted PSD95 positive synapses in the CA2 -3 and DG regions of the mice with depressive -like behavior, suggesting that the physical interactions between astrocytes and synapses can be increased by running exercise, which might be an important structural basis for the antidepressant effects of running exercise.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) are small DNA viruses that are widespread in swine populations. Recently, a novel parvovirus, PPV8, was identified in China. This study aimed to detect the presence of PPV8 in Europe, specifically in Hungarian and Slovakian pig farms. A large number of samples, including blood serum, oral fluids, and processing fluids were analyzed, revealing the presence of the virus in 68% of the farms included in our study. The newly identified PPV8 strains were highly similar to the Chinese strain, but the amino acid differences might indicate local evolution of the virus.Abstract Porcine parvovirus 8 (PPV8), a novel virus in the Parvoviridae family, was first identified in 2022 in lung samples of domestic pigs from China. Retrospective analyses showed that it had been circulating in China since 1998, but no other countries had reported its presence so far. A recent study conducted in South America did not detect any PPV8-positive samples in that region. Here, we report the detection of PPV8 in Hungarian and Slovakian pig farms and the estimated prevalence of the virus in Hungary. Altogether, 2230 serum, 233 oral fluid, and 115 processing fluid samples were systematically collected from 23 Hungarian and 2 Slovakian pig farms between 2020 and 2023. A real-time quantitative PCR method was developed to detect the viral genome. Our results revealed the presence of PPV8 on 65% of the Hungarian farms and both Slovakian farms included in our study, marking its first detection in Europe. Oral fluid samples showed the highest positivity rates, reaching up to 100% in some herds. The viral genome was successfully detected in serum and processing fluid samples too, but with significantly lower prevalence rates of 4% and 5%, respectively. Genetic analysis of 11 partial VP2 sequences demonstrated high similarity to the original Chinese strain but with unique amino acid mutations, suggesting possible local evolution of the virus. Our study presents the first scientific evidence of PPV8 infection outside of China and offers a comprehensive assessment of its prevalence in the Hungarian pig population. Further research is required to understand its potential impact on swine health.

AB  - This study assessed groundwater quality and associated risks in a semi-arid region located in a city in the Northern zone of Mexico. To conduct this study, we collected 92 groundwater samples and analyzed 14 physicochemical parameters across 18 sectors. Only fluoride (F-) and nitrate (NO3-N) exceeded Mexican regulations and WHO guidelines for drinking water. Approximately 65 % of samples surpassed the 1.5 mg/L permissible limit for F-, with the highest recorded concentration reaching 3.60 mg/L in two sectors among the 18 studied, 34 % of samples exhibited NO3--N concentrations in the 10.64-17.27 mg/L range across three sectors, surpassing permissible levels. Pearson Correlation Analysis revealed strong positive correlations with HCO3-, EC, Mg2+, Ca2+, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, and Na+. Moderate correlations existed for the total hardness, alkalinity, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, Mg2+, and EC. K+ showed weak correlations. PIG values indicated significant pollution of F- in all of 18 sectors (PIG <1). HQ for F- exceeded tolerable levels in 14 adult and 16 child sectors, posing an intolerable risk. Nitrate's HQ was below <1 for all age groups, suggesting non-carcinogenic effects. THI indicated high F- and NO3--N exposure risks for children in the study area. It is recommended to implement effective water treatment technologies, such as reverse osmosis or adsorptive materials, in those sectors reported as a potential risk to human health to ensure access to safe drinking water.

AB  - Determining the source of fecal contamination in a water body is important for the application of appropriate remediation measures. However, it has been suggested in the extant literature that this can best be achieved using a 'toolbox' of molecular- and culture-based methods. In response, this study deployed three indicators (Escherichia coli (EC), intestinal enterococci (IE) and somatic coliphages (SC)), one culture-dependent human marker (Bacteroides (GB-124) bacteriophage) and five culture-independent markers (human adenovirus (HAdV), human (HMMit), cattle (CWMit), pig (PGMit) and poultry (PLMit) mitochondrial DNA markers (mtDNA)) within the River Tagus catchment (n = 105). Water samples were collected monthly over a 13-month sampling campaign at four sites (impacted by significant specific human and non-human inputs and influenced by differing degrees of marine and freshwater mixing) to determine the dominant fecal inputs and assess geographical, temporal, and meteorological (precipitation, UV, temperature) fluctuations. Our results revealed that all sampling sites were not only highly impacted by fecal contamination but that this contamination originated from human and from a range of agricultural animal sources. HMMit was present in a higher percentage (83%) and concentration (4.20 log GC/100 mL) than HAdV (32%, 2.23 log GC/100 mL) and GB-124 bacteriophage with the latter being detected once. Animal mtDNA markers were detected, with CWMit found in 73% of samples with mean concentration of 3.74 log GC/100 mL. Correlation was found between concentrations of fecal indicators (EC, IE and SC), CWMit and season. Levels of CWMit were found to be related to physico-chemical parameters, such as temperature and UV radiation, possibly as a result of the increasing presence of livestock outside in warmer months. This study provides the first evaluation of such a source-associated 'toolbox' for monitoring surface water in Portugal, and the conclusions may inform future implementation of surveillance and remediation strategies for improving water quality.

Among native species, Draba sarycheleki is newly recorded from Kazakhstan, Nasturtium microphyllum - from Turkmenistan, Nasturtium officinale and Neotorularia brevipes - from Kyrgyzstan (along with the second finding of the latter in Tajikistan), Smelowskia sisymbrioides - from Afghanistan and Strigosella latifolia - from Uzbekistan; occurrence of Barbarea plantaginea in Turkmenistan is confirmed after more than 120 years since the first and highly neglected record; finally, presence of Strigosella stenopetala in China (Xinjiang) is stressed with a special reference on its species rank and distinctness from S. africana. . Among alien species, Neslia paniculata is first reported for Tajikistan as ephemerophyte; in Uzbekistan, Sisymbrium officinale is found for the first time, presence of Camelina sativa is confirmed, and first reliable records of Cardamine occulta from this country and Middle Asia as a whole are presented. In contrast, occurrence of the following species in the countries given in parentheses after relevant names is not confirmed: Barbarea vulgaris and Isatis lusitanica (Turkmenistan), Braya humilis (Kazakhstan), Erysimum aksaricum (Kyrgyzstan), Matthiola flavida (Tajikistan), Parrya khorasanica (China and Kazakhstan) and Smelowskia annua (Uzbekistan), of which Isatis lusitanica and Matthiola flavida do not occur in Middle Asia in general.

AB  - About one million tons of tofu dreg or okara , a solid waste from tofu processing, is generated annually by 84,000 tofu industries in Indonesia. Tofu dreg contains considerable nutrients and bioactive components, suggesting its potential utilization for food and feed. Being high in protein, traditional fermented foods, such as tempe gembus and oncom , have long been known as tofu dreg products in some regions. Many developed food products with considerable protein from fresh tofu dreg, and its flour have also been studied to support local food diversification. Additionally, the economic value of tofu dreg is essential as it contributes significantly (10-65 %) to the tofu processor's income through selling this waste alone, particularly for goat or cow fodder. More added values can be obtained by processing tofu dreg into various food products ranging from 0.40 up to 582 times. It suggests that a more significant amount of tofu dreg used for food purposes is essential in the future by developing good quality, attractive, nutritious, safe, and affordable products in the market, followed by intensive promotion to the consumers. Selected products originating from other countries are likely promising to be developed as well. Therefore, tofu dreg, previously assumed to be a waste in the tofu industries, must be appropriately handled as a food material. Overall, this review covers the current and promising utilization of tofu dreg for food in Indonesia and its economic added value.

AB  - Tea is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, and trichome formation in tea plant leaves impairs their commercial value. In Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, trichome formation is negatively regulated by the CPC family genes, which encode R3-type MYB transcription factors. Here, we identified six CPC-like genes in a tea plant (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) for the first time. Simulated three-dimensional structure of the MYB domains of all the six CPC-like proteins exhibited negative charge on the surface, as observed on that of the Arabidopsis CPC protein that does not bind to DNA, indicating their similarity with regard to molecular interaction. We further found that the six CPC-like genes were differentially expressed in different developmental stages of tea leaves, and four out of the six genes were upregulated in the youngest 1st leaves, which formed more trichomes than other older leaves. Although it does not establish a causal link, the correlation between differential expression of CPC-like genes and variable trichome formation suggests that the R3-type MYB transcription factors are potential precipitating factors in affecting the value of tea leaf.

AB  - The study of virulence of Legionella pneumophila and its interactions with its hosts has been predominantly conducted in cellulo in the past decades. Although easy to implement and allowing the dissection of molecular pathways underlying host-pathogen interactions, these cellular models fail to provide conditions of the complex environments encountered by the bacteria during the infection of multicellular organisms. To improve our understanding of human infection, several animal models have been developed. This review provides an overview of the invertebrate and vertebrate models that have been established to study L. pneumophila infection and that are alternatives to the classical mouse model, which does not recall human infection with L. pneumophila well. Finally we provide insight in the main contributions made by these models along with their pros and cons.

AB  - The early warning and tracking of COVID-19 prevalence in the community provided by wastewater surveillance has highlighted its potential for much broader viral disease surveillance. In this proof-of-concept study, 46 wastewater samples from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Queensland, Australia, were analyzed for the presence and abundance of 13 respiratory viruses, and the results were compared with reported clinical cases. The viruses were concentrated using the adsorption-extraction (AE) method, and extracted nucleic acids were analyzed using qPCR and RT-qPCR. Among the viruses tested, bocavirus (BoV), parechovirus (PeV), rhinovirus A (RhV A) and rhino-virus B (RhV B) were detected in all wastewater samples. All the tested viruses except influenza B virus (IBV) were de-tected in wastewater sample from at least one WWTP. BoV was detected with the greatest concentration (4.96-7.22 log10 GC/L), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (4.08-6.46 log10 GC/L), RhV A (3.95-5.63 log10 GC/L), RhV B (3.74-5.61 log10 GC/L), and PeV (3.17-5.32 log10 GC/L). Influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are notifiable conditions in Queensland, allowing the gene copy (GC) concentrations to be compared with reported clinical cases. Significant correlations (rho = 0.60, p < 0.01 for IAV and rho = 0.53, p < 0.01 for RSV) were observed when pooled wastewater influenza A virus (IAV) and RSV log10 GC/L concentrations were compared to log10 clinical cases among the four WWTP catchments. The positive predictive value for the presence of IAV and RSV in wastewater was 97 a/o for both IAV and RSV clinical cases within the four WWTP catchments. The overall accuracy of wastewater analysis for predicting clinical cases of IAV and RSV was 97 and 90 a/o, respectively. This paper lends credibility to the application of wastewater surveillance to monitor respiratory viruses of various genomic characteristics, with potential uses for in-creased surveillance capabilities and as a tool in understanding the dynamics of disease circulation in the communities.

AB  - High-frequency stimulation (HFS) is a promising therapy for patients with depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the HFS-induced antidepressant-like effects on susceptibility and resilience to depressive-like behaviors remain obscure. Given that dopaminergic neurotransmission has been found to be disrupted in depression, we investigated the dopamine(DA)-dependent mechanism of the antidepressant-like effects of HFS of the prelimbic cortex (HFS PrL). We performed HFS PrL in a rat model of mild chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) together with 6-hydroxydopamine lesioning in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Animals were assessed for anxiety, anhedonia, and behavioral despair. We also examined levels of corticosterone, hippocampal neurotransmitters, neuroplasticity-related proteins, and morphological changes in dopaminergic neurons. We found 54.3% of CUS animals exhibited decreased sucrose consumption and were designated as CUS-susceptible, while the others were designated CUS-resilient. HFS PrL in both the CUS-susceptible and CUS-resilient animals significantly increased hedonia, reduced anxiety, decreased forced swim immobility, enhanced hippocampal DA and serotonin levels, and reduced corticosterone levels when compared with the respective sham groups. The hedonic-like effects were abolished in both DRN- and VTA-lesioned groups, suggesting the effects of HFS PrL are DA-dependent. Interestingly, VTA-lesioned sham animals had increased anxiety and forced swim immobility, which was reversed by HFS PrL. The VTA-lesioned HFS PrL animals also had elevated DA levels, and reduced p-p38 MAPK and NF-?B levels when compared to VTA-lesioned sham animals. These findings suggest that HFS PrL in stressed animals leads to profound antidepressant-like responses possibly through both DA-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

AB  - In order to find out the differences in tea quality characteristics from different regions and the reasons for their formation, 32 biochemical components, 22 mineral elements, and 3 stable isotope ratios were determined in 93 white leaf tea (WLT) samples. The findings revealed that significant differences in the content of free amino acids, catechins, caffeine, several mineral elements, and stable isotope ratios were observed among the WLT samples of different origins. Furthermore, a Pearson correlation analysis showed significant correlations of 15 chemical composition qualities and 14 mineral elements with soil factors. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values were significantly correlated with meteorological factors. Classification models based on multiple chemical signatures facilitated successful differentiation of WLT of different origins, achieving a high prediction accuracy of over 90%. This study comprehensively identified distinct quality characteristics of WLT from different regions in China and proved an effective method in classifying WLT samples from the main production areas.

AB  - Zinc oxide (ZnO) harms the environment and can potentially increase the number of drug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find safe and effective alternatives to improve gut health and reduce the incidence of diarrhea in weaned piglets. This study conducted an antibacterial test of ZnO, antibacterial peptides (AMPs), and tannic acid (TA) in vitro. Thirty piglets were randomly allotted to one of the following three dietary treatments: ZnO (2000 mg/kg ZnO diet), AMPs (700 mg/kg AMPs diet), and TA (1000 mg/kg TA diet). The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ZnO and TA against Escherichia coli and Salmonella were lower than those of AMPs, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ZnO, AMPs, and TA against Staphylococcus aureus were the same. Compared to ZnO, AMPs increased the digestibility of dry, organic matter and the crude fat. Additionally, TA significantly (p < 0.05) increased the digestibility of dry and organic matter. On experimental day 14, the plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) content of piglets supplemented with AMPs and TA was increased significantly (p < 0.05). On experimental day 28, alanine aminotransferase activity in the plasma of weaned piglets in the ZnO and TA groups was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in piglets in the AMPs group. The levels of plasma IL-6 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the ZnO and AMPs groups than in the TA group. On experimental days 14 and 28, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant capacity among the three experimental groups. Intestinal microbial diversity analysis showed that the Chao1 and ACE indices of piglets in the AMPs group were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the ZnO and TA groups. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Treponema_2 was higher in the feces of piglets fed a diet supplemented with TA than in those fed diet supplemented with ZnO (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae was higher in the feces of piglets fed a diet supplemented with AMPs than in those fed diet supplemented with ZnO or TA. Overall, AMPs and TA could be added to feed as substitutes for ZnO to reduce diarrhea, improve nutrient digestibility and immunity, and increase the abundance of beneficial intestinal bacteria in weaned piglets.

AB  - Background Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are common, multi-factorial and multi-symptomatic disorders. Ample evidence implicates oxidative stress, deficient repair of oxidative DNA lesions and DNA damage in the development of these disorders. However, it remains unclear whether insufficient DNA repair and resulting DNA damage are causally connected to their aetiopathology, or if increased levels of DNA damage observed in patient tissues merely accumulate as a consequence of cellular dysfunction. To assess a potential causal role for deficient DNA repair in the development of these disorders, we behaviourally characterized a mouse model in which CaMKIIa-Cre-driven postnatal conditional knockout (KO) of the core base-excision repair (BER) protein XRCC1 leads to accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage in the forebrain. Results CaMKIIa-Cre expression caused specific deletion of XRCC1 in the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and CA2 and the amygdala and led to increased DNA damage therein. While motor coordination, cognition and social behaviour remained unchanged, XRCC1 KO in the forebrain caused increased anxiety-like behaviour in males, but not females, as assessed by the light-dark box and open field tests. Conversely, in females but not males, XRCC1 KO caused an increase in learned fear-related behaviour in a cued (Pavlovian) fear conditioning test and a contextual fear extinction test. The relative density of the GABA(A) receptor alpha 5 subunit (GABRA5) was reduced in the amygdala and the dorsal CA1 in XRCC1 KO females, whereas male XRCC1 KO animals exhibited a significant reduction of GABRA5 density in the CA3. Finally, assessment of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) GABAergic interneurons revealed a significant increase in the density of PV+ cells in the DG of male XRCC1 KO mice, while females remained unchanged. Conclusions Our results suggest that accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage in the forebrain alters the GABAergic neurotransmitter system and causes behavioural deficits in relation to innate and learned anxiety in a sex-dependent manner. Moreover, the data uncover a previously unappreciated connection between BER deficiency, unrepaired DNA damage in the hippocampus and a sex-specific anxiety-like phenotype with implications for the aetiology and therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been reported to exert antidepressant effects, however, the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated that Forkhead box transcription factor G1 (FoxG1) regulates the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and exerts neuroprotective effects. In this study, we explored whether quercetin plays an anti-depressant role via regulation of FoxG1 signaling in mice and revealed the potential mechanisms. To explore the antidepressant effects of quercetin, mice were subjected to behavioral tests after a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) exposure. We found that chronic quercetin treatment (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg) obviously restored the weight loss of mice caused by CUMS and alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, such as increased sucrose consumption, improved locomotor activity and shorten immobility time. In addition, to clarify the relationship between quercetin and AHN, we detected neurogenesis markers in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Furthermore, FoxG1siRNA was employed and then stimulated with quercetin to further investigate the mechanism by which FoxG1 participates in the antidepressant effects of quercetin. Our results indicate that chronic quercetin treatment dramatically increased the number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive and BrdU/NeuN-double positive cells. Besides, the expression levels of FoxG1, p-CREB and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were also enhanced by quercetin in the DG. Strikingly, quercetin failed to reverse the levels of p-CREB and BDNF after FoxG1-siRNA was performed in SH-SY5Y cells and Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs). Our results thus far suggest that quercetin might exert antidepressant effects via promotion of AHN by FoxG1/CREB/ BDNF signaling pathway.

AB  - Niacin deficiency leads to inflammation of mucous membranes and diarrhoea. There are few reports on the effects of niacin on the intestinal health of weaned piglets. The present study was conducted to analyse the effects of niacin in weaned piglets along with its underlying mechanism. A total of 48 25-day-old weaned piglets (24 females and 24 males) were randomly allotted into four groups, each treatment were supplemented with 22.5, 30, 45, and 75 mg kg(-1) niacin for a period of 14 days, with 12 piglets per diet and 1 piglet per pen. Six piglets (3 males and 3 females) were randomly selected from each treatment group and euthanised for intestinal tissue sampling on days 7 and 14 after the weaning day (day 0), respectively. Dietary niacin did not affect the growth performance of weaned piglets but quadratically affected (P < 0.05) the diarrhoea rate from days 7 to 14. The duodenal villus height and width and crypt depth in the 30 mg kg(-1) niacin group were greater than those in the 45 mg kg(-1) niacin group on day 7, and the jejunal crypt depth, ileal crypt depth, villus height and villus width decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with the increase in dietary niacin. However, the dietary supplementation with niacin increased (linear, P < 0.001) the jejunal villus height, crypt depth and villus width on day 14. Dietary niacin increased (linear, P < 0.05) the alkaline phosphatase activity in the jejunal mucosa of weaned piglets on day 7 but decreased (linear, P < 0.05) its activity on day 14. The number of Ki67 positive cells per crypt was decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with the dietary niacin on day 7 but increased (linear, P < 0.05) with dietary niacin contents on day 14. Moreover, dietary niacin altered (P < 0.05) SLC5A1, SLC15A1, SLC6A19, TJP-1, occludin and claudin-1 mRNA expression in the small intestine. These results indicate that dietary niacin has different effects on intestinal morphology and functions in the first and second weeks postweaning and that the dietary supplementation with niacin may, by modulating intestinal cell proliferation, affect the intestinal health.

AB  - BackgroundThe intricate interplay of gene expression within ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the miRNA regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis during the process of follicle development in lamb GCs.MethodsEmploying transcriptome sequencing, we compared differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) and miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) in GCs from lambs treated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FL) to untreated controls (CL). We further screened differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes and identified potential miRNA regulatory factors. The expression patterns of HMOX1 and miRNAs in GCs were validated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally, we investigated the regulatory effect of oar-miR-134-3p on HMOX1 and its function in ferroptosis through cell transfection and erastin treatment.ResultsWe identified a total of 4,184 DE-mRNAs and 304 DE-miRNAs. The DE-mRNAs were mainly enriched in ferroptosis, insulin resistance, and the cell cycle. Specifically, we focused on the differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes. Notably, the ferroptosis-related genes HMOX1 and SLC3A2, modulated by DE-miRNAs, were markedly suppressed in FLs. Experimental validation revealed that HMOX1 was significantly downregulated in FL and large follicles, while oar-miR-134-3p was significantly upregulated compared to that in the CLs. HMOX1 expression was regulated by the targeting effect of oar-miR-134-3p. Functional assays further revealed that modulation of oar-miR-134-3p influenced HMOX1 expression and altered cellular responses to ferroptosis induction by erastin.ConclusionThis study suggested that oar-miR-134-3p and HMOX1 may be one of the pathways regulating ferroptosis in GCs. This finding provides new clues to understanding the development and regulatory process of follicles.

AB  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and their N-oxide (PANOs), as emerging environmental pollutants and chemical hazards in food, have become the focus of global attention. PAs/PANOs enter crops from soil and reach edible parts, but knowledge about their uptake and transport behavior in crops is currently limited. In this study, we chose tea ( Camellia sinensis L.) as a representative crop and Sp/SpNO as typical PAs/PANOs to analyze their root uptake and transport mechanism. Tea roots efficiently absorbed Sp/SpNO, utilizing both passive and active transmembrane pathways. Sp predominantly concentrated in roots and SpNO efficiently translocated to aboveground parts. The prevalence of SpNO in cell-soluble fractions facilitated its translocation from roots to stems and leaves. In soil experiment, tea plants exhibited weaker capabilities for the uptake and transport of Sp/SpNO compared to hydroponic conditions, likely due to the swift degradation of these compounds in the soil. Moreover, a noteworthy interconversion between Sp and SpNO in tea plants indicated a preference for reducing SpNO to Sp. These findings represent a significant stride in understanding the accumulation and movement mechanisms of Sp/SpNO in tea plants. The insights garnered from this study are pivotal for evaluating the associated risks of PAs/PANOs and formulating effective control strategies.

AB  - Tea is one of the most common beverages in the world. In order to reduce the cost of artificial tea picking and improve the competitiveness of tea production, this paper proposes a new model, termed the Mask R-CNN Positioning of Picking Point for Tea Shoots (MR3P-TS) model, for the identification of the contour of each tea shoot and the location of picking points. In this study, a dataset of tender tea shoot images taken in a real, complex scene was constructed. Subsequently, an improved Mask R-CNN model (the MR3P-TS model) was built that extended the mask branch in the network design. By calculating the area of multiple connected domains of the mask, the main part of the shoot was identified. Then, the minimum circumscribed rectangle of the main part is calculated to determine the tea shoot axis, and to finally obtain the position coordinates of the picking point. The MR3P-TS model proposed in this paper achieved an mAP of 0.449 and an F2 value of 0.313 in shoot identification, and achieved a precision of 0.949 and a recall of 0.910 in the localization of the picking points. Compared with the mainstream object detection algorithms YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN, the MR3P-TS algorithm had a good recognition effect on the overlapping shoots in an unstructured environment, which was stronger in both versatility and robustness. The proposed method can accurately detect and segment tea bud regions in real complex scenes at the pixel level, and provide precise location coordinates of suggested picking points, which should support the further development of automated tea picking machines.

AB  - Flavan-3-ols are prominent phenolic compounds found abundantly in the young leaves of tea plants. The enzymes involved in flavan-3-ol biosynthesis in tea plants have been extensively investigated. However, the localization and associations of these numerous functional enzymes within cells have been largely neglected. In this study, we aimed to investigate the synthesis of flavan-3-ols in tea plants, particularly focusing on epigallocatechin gallate. Our analysis involving the DESI-MSI method to reveal a distinct distribution pattern of B-ring trihydroxylated flavonoids, primarily concentrated in the outer layer of buds. Subcellular localization showed that CsC4H, CsF3 ' H, and CsF3 ' 5 ' H localizes endoplasmic reticulum. Protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated direct associations between CsC4H, CsF3 ' H, and cytoplasmic enzymes (CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, FLS, and ANR), highlighting their interactions within the biosynthetic pathway. Notably, CsF3 ' 5 ' H, the enzyme for B-ring trihydroxylation, did not directly interact with other enzymes. We identified cytochrome b5 isoform C serving as an essential redox partner, ensuring the proper functioning of CsF3 ' 5 ' H. Our findings suggest the existence of distinct modules governing the synthesis of different B-ring hydroxylation compounds. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying flavonoid diversity and efficient synthesis and enhances our understanding of the substantial accumulation of B-ring trihydroxylated flavan-3-ols in tea plants.

AB  - In this paper, four array patterns were first designed by observing the structural features of the surface microstructures of pig bones and tree frog paws on the titanium alloy surface bionically. Then, the optimal parameters for laser processing were determined experimentally, and the optimized processing parameters were used to prepare micron-scale bumps on the titanium alloy surface and to investigate the relationship between the weaving height and the processing times. Finally, multiple acid etching was used to prepare nanoscale holes on the surface of the titanium alloy. It was found that the multiple acid etching could not only prepare nanoscale holes on the surface of the titanium alloy, but could also well eliminate the slag left on the surface of titanium alloy by laser ablation. Based on the above study, this paper also analyzed the effect of micro-nano structure on the friction properties of the titanium alloy surface from three aspects-theory, hardness test and friction coefficient test-and experimentally analyzed the effect of single-factor and multi-factor coupling of structural features on the friction properties of the titanium alloy surface. It was found that the optimal mean friction coefficient was 0.0902, corresponding to the characteristic values of 0.66 for the shape, 200 mu m for the edge length and 60 mu m for the height.

AB  - Iron is an important trace element whose deficiency is associated with anemia, which is a common condition in South American camelids. However, there are only few data available on the physiologic relationships between serum iron and hematologic findings in alpacas. In 81 laboratory diagnostic datasets from 21 clinically healthy alpacas collected over a nine-year period, we recently reported significant positive correlations between iron and hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and eosinophils, and significant negative correlations between iron and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets, and neutrophils. For 11 of the animals, datasets were available both at the age of 1 year (young) and at an older age (4-7 years: mature). For young animals, significant positive correlations were found between iron and MCV, MCH, and eosinophils, and significant negative correlations between iron and white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), platelets, and neutrophils. In contrast, in mature animals, significant positive correlations were found between iron and monocytes as well as eosinophils. A two-way ANOVA of these 11 animals examining the effects of age, iron, and age*iron revealed significant effects of age on eosinophils, of iron on RBC and MCH, and of age*iron on WBC, RBC, HCT, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). Our data show that both age and serum iron have an effect on hematologic parameters in alpacas. Especially in young animals there is a close association between iron and MCH and MCV and neutrophils.

AB  - Eating patterns are associated with obesity and metabolic health. However, the regulating mechanism of different eating patterns on body metabolism are not fully cleare. In this study, a pig model was used to evaluate the effects of feeding frequency on glucose and lipid metabolism and reveal its regulating mechanism. Twenty-four growing barrows were randomly allocated to 1-meal (M1), 3-meal (M3), or 5-meal (M5) per day groups with the same amount of daily feed. GSEA was conducted on the liver to investigate the pathways of different feeding frequencies on the metabolism. The serum glucose, NEFA, VLDL-C levels were higher for M1 group than for M3 and M5 groups, however, the hepatic TRIG level was lower. Liver transcriptome showed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism pathways were suppressed with the increase of feeding frequency. The increase of gluconeogenic substrates (glycerol and lactate) and enzymes (PEPCKI and G6Pase) in liver indicated that hepatic gluconeogenesis was enhanced in the Ml group. AMPK/PPAR alpha signaling associated genes were positively correlated with NEFA and beta-HB levels in Ml group, which promoted fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in liver. Moreover, compared with M3 and M5 groups, the higher NAD(+)/NADH ratio in the liver of Ml group activated SIRT1, which stimulated the AMPK signaling associated pathways by up-regulating the LKB1 gene. These findings provide evidence for the regulating roles of feeding frequency on glucose and lipid metabolism through SIRT1/AMPK pathway, which greatly contributes to the regulation of energy metabolism through daily eating patterns in animals.

AB  - Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) can impair memory. The properties of IEDs most detrimental to memory, however, are undefined. We studied the impact of temporal and spatial characteristics of IEDs on list learning. Subjects completed a memory task during intracranial EEG recordings including hippocampal depth and temporal neocortical subdural electrodes. Subjects viewed a series of objects, and after a distracting task, recalled the objects from the list. The impacts of IED presence, duration, and propagation to neocortex during encoding of individual stimuli were assessed. The effects of IED total number and duration during maintenance and recall periods on delayed recall performance were also determined. The influence of IEDs during recall was further investigated by comparing the likelihood of IEDs preceding correctly recalled items vs. periods of no verbal response. Across 6 subjects, we analyzed 28 hippocampal and 139 lateral temporal contacts. Recall performance was poor, with a median of 17.2% correct responses (range 10.4-21.9%). Interictal epileptiform discharges during encoding, maintenance, and recall did not significantly impact task performance, and there was no significant difference between the likelihood of IEDs during correct recall vs. periods of no response. No significant effects of discharge duration during encoding, maintenance, or recall were observed. Interictal epileptiform discharges with spread to lateral temporal cortex during encoding did not adversely impact recall. A post hoc analysis refining model assumptions indicated a negative impact of IED count during the maintenance period, but otherwise confirmed the above results. Our findings suggest no major effect of hippocampal IEDs on list learning, but study limitations, such as baseline hippocampal dysfunction, should be considered. The impact of IEDs during the maintenance period may be a focus of future research. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Heat stress is one of the main environmental factors limiting the growth, yield and quality of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Trehalose involved in plant responses to multiple adverse environmental stresses, including heat stress. However, the roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and their involvement in the trehalose response to heat stress remain unknown.Methods In this study, circRNA-sequencing was performed to analyze the characteristics of circRNAs in trehalose-induced responses to heat stress in tea plants. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis was used to determine the potential function of circRNAs, and the expression of differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) and their host genes related to Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and Homologous recombination (HR) were analyzed. To further explore the effect of trehalose on DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), the reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, specially hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2-), in heat-stressed tea plants were investigated.Results A total of 11402 circRNAs were detected from CK, T (heat stress) and TT (heat stress + trehalose) samples. Among these circRNAs, 573, 620 and 550 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in the T vs. CK, TT vs. CK and TT vs. T comparison groups, respectively. The host genes of DECs were enriched in NHEJ and HR pathways, implying a critical role of circRNAs in DSBs repair. The expression level of circKu70-1 and circKu70-3 showed positive correlations with their host gene, ATP-dependent DNA helicase II 70 kDa subunit (CsKu70), while circKu70-2 exhibited an opposite expression trend. Similarly, circRad50 displayed a negative correlation with its host gene, DNA repair protein RAD50 (CsRad50). Notably, the expression of CsKu70 and CsRad50, which are crucial for initiating DSB repair, was decreased in the trehalose-treated (TT) samples. This finding suggests that trehalose may play a role in modulating the expression of circRNAs and their host genes involved in NHEJ and HR pathways, ultimately contributing to reduced DSB damage during heat stress. Moreover, exogenous trehalose significantly reduced H2O2 and O2- contents in tea plants under heat stress, suggesting that trehalose could mitigate heat-induced damage resulting from ROS overproduction.Conclusion Our results indicated that circRNAs play a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity. Specifically, they may function as molecular hubs that respond to changes of the levels of H2O2 and O2- induced by trehalose, and subsequently regulate the DSBs mediated by their host genes. This, in turn, further impacts genome stability, ultimately enhancing heat tolerance in tea plants. Our findings provided new insight into the potential applications of trehalose as an agrochemical in tea plants and revealed the potential role of circRNAs in tea plants heat tolerance.

AB  - The negative regulation on neurogenesis has been implicated in fluoride neurotoxicity, while the evidence is limited. To explore whether fluoride interferes with neurogenesis via the Notch1 signaling and the potential alleviation effects of carvacrol (CAR), we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments, as well as epidemiological analyses in this study. The results showed that urinary fluoride levels and circulating Notch1 levels were associated with IQ levels in boys. NaF-treated rats had fewer neurons, lower densities of dendritic spines, depressed neurogenesis, and impaired learning and memory abilities. In vitro experiments using undifferentiated PC12 cells mimicking neurogenesis revealed that NaF suppressed differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Besides, Notch1 signaling activation was detected in vivo and in vitro . The latter was confirmed using an in vitro model supplemented with DAPT, a potent Notch1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CAR supplementation negatively regulated NICD1 and Hes1 expressions and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, thereby improving neurological functions in NaF-treated rats. These findings indicated that the inhibition of neurogenesis in hippocampi induced by fluoride via Notch1 signaling activation may be one of the underlying mechanisms of its neurotoxicity, and that CAR significantly alleviated the neurotoxicity of NaF via the Notch1 signaling.

AB  - Understanding immunity in wildlife populations is important from both One Health and conservation perspectives. The constitutive innate immune system is the first line of defence against pathogens, and comparisons among taxa can test the impact of evolution and life history on immune function. We investigated serum bacterial killing ability (BKA) of five marsupial species that employ varying life history strategies, demonstrated to influence immunity in other vertebrates. The brushtail possum and eastern grey kangaroo had the greatest BKA, while ringtail possums and koalas had the least. These differences were independent of social structure, captivity status and phylogeny, but were associated with diet and body size. Sex and disease status had no effect on BKA in koalas, however potential for differences between wild and captive koalas warrants further investigation. The current study has provided a foundation for future investigations into how adaptive and innate immunity interact in marsupials from an eco-evolutionary perspective.

AB  - Anxiety disorder has a high prevalence, and the risk of anxiety increases with age. Prenatal inflammation during key developmental timepoints can result in long-term changes in anxiety phenotype, even over a lifetime and across generations. However, whether maternal inflammation exposure during late gestation has intergenerational transmission effects on age-related anxiety-like behaviors and the possible underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) is critical in hippocampal neurogenesis and is closely related to neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety disorder. The current study investigated the effects of maternal (F0 generation) lipopolysaccharide administration (50 mu g/kg, i.p.) during late gestation on anxiety-like behaviors and FABP7 expression in F1 and F2 offspring, as well as the potential sex-specificity of intergenerational effects. Anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated using open field (OF), elevated plus maze, and black-white alley (BWA) tests at 3 and 13 months of age. The protein and messenger RNA levels of FABP7 in the hippocampus were measured using Western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. Overall, gestational LPS exposure in the F0 generation increased anxiety levels and decreased FABP7 expression levels in the F1 generation, which carried over to the F2 generation, and the intergenerational effects were mainly transferred via the maternal lineage. Moreover, hippocampal FABP7 expression was significantly correlated with performance in the battery of anxiety tests. The present study suggested that prenatal inflammation could increase age-related anxiety-like behaviors both in F1 and F2 offspring, and these effects possibly link to the FABP7 expression.

AB  - In recent years, seismic sensors, traditionally used in geophysical studies, have been utilized to record seismic waves generated by wildlife locomotion, providing new ways to monitor wildlife non-invasively and continuously. Given the novelty of this approach, numerous research questions, unexplored potentials, and methodological challenges remain. In this study, we investigate the seismic signal properties of African savanna species during locomotion and employ machine learning techniques to classify wildlife based on these footfall signals. We utilize the SeisSavanna dataset, which contains over 70,000 three-component seismograms paired with labelled images from co-located camera traps. To create a graphical overview of the entire seismic dataset, we combine a scattering transform with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). While the different wildlife categories display different footfall patterns, local geological conditions known as site effects significantly alter the frequency content of those signals. To address the issue of the site effect, we trained machine learning models on data recorded on various sites. For a multi-class classification task involving signals from elephants, giraffes, hyenas, and zebras, the models achieved a balanced accuracy of 87% at a maximum animal-sensor distance of 50 m. The accuracy decreases to 77% when the maximum distance is extended to 150 m due to decreasing signal and label quality. We demonstrate that the models can generalize to new seismic stations if similar site conditions are present in the training data. Our results indicate the potential for using seismic signals in wildlife monitoring and conservation, complementing other existing passive monitoring sensors such as camera traps or acoustic loggers with new observables about silent species. However, further methodological advancements and larger datasets are essential for this approach to become a reliable tool in wildlife monitoring.

AB  - The factors affecting lipid and fatty acid composition of copepod Calanus sinicus in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the East China Sea (ECS) were examined in this study. In spring, there were significant differences between these two regions for both environmental conditions and food availability. Such regional difference significantly influenced the lipid and fatty acid profiles of C. sinicus. Our results show that C. sinicus has a higher lipids content in ECS, especially for wax ester and triglyceride lipids, indicating a more active and efficient predation. According to BIO-ENV analysis, the variation of lipids profiles may be influenced majorly by water temperature. Moreover, the fatty acids (FAs) profiles of C. sinicus were also different between YS and ECS, especially in the four major contributors, C22:1 omega 11, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexenoic acid (DHA), and C20:1 omega 9. The considerable amounts of self-biosynthesized FAs of herbivorous copepod (C22:1 omega 11 and C20:1 omega 9) and low DHA/EPA ratio may indicate that C. sinicus in ECS feed mainly on phytoplankton comparing to those in YS. The fatty acid profiles of C. sinicus were affected by the differences in food availability.

AB  - The prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety disorders, has increased in recent years. A better understanding of the mechanisms mediating symptoms in these disorders is essential for developing treatments. Although voluntary exercise can alleviate symptoms, its anxiolytic effect varies with the intensity of the activity. Therefore, to investigate the usefulness of voluntary exercise in alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, assessing its effect based on intensity is required. Hatano rats, consisting of high- and low-avoidance animals (HAA and LAA, respectively), differ in their propensity to voluntary exercise. These animals are useful for examining the effects of voluntary running activity differing in intensity on anxiety-like behavior. We housed Hatano rats in cages containing locked or unlocked running wheels starting at 4 weeks of age, conducted elevated plus maze test at 8 weeks of age, followed by plasma corticostemne measurement and DNA microarray analysis on hippocampal tissue at 9 weeks of age. Our results show that only LAA (mild-intensity running animals), but not HAA (high-intensity running animals), had reduced anxiety-like behavior without plasma corticostemne change. In addition, LAA had increased immunity-related gene expression, but decreased proteolysis-related gene expression. Our findings suggest that mild-intensity voluntary running mediates the anxiolytic effect of exercise and is regulated through increasing the expression of immunity-related genes or decreasing the expression of proteolysis-related genes in the hippocampus.

AB  - Introduction Chronic inflammation caused by Escherichia coli infections has a significant negative impact on the reproductive system and impairs fertility. The corpus luteum (CL) plays a central role not only in regulating the ovary cycle, but also in implantation of the embryo and maintenance of early pregnancy through the secretion of progesterone. Understanding the intricate interplay between inflammatory processes and reproductive organ's function is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate reproductive disorders and improve fertility.Methods The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the proteomic profile of the porcine CL in the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle using LC-MS/MS analysis. The CL slices were incubated in the presence of LPS for 24 h.Results We identified 12 differentially regulated proteins after treatment with LPS (7 of them were upregulated, while 5 were downregulated). The analysis showed that these proteins are involved in processes such as glucose metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), detoxification processes as well as steroid biosynthesis in the CL. Moreover, we demonstrated that LPS decreases glucose levels and increases progesterone levels in the CL.Conclusion These findings suggest that LPS modulates key metabolic pathways in the CL, potentially impacting its functional activity.

AB  - Simple Summary Worldwide, pest control involves extensive use of insecticides, which results in serious environmental pollution problems. On the other hand, insecticides can be recognized by proteins named CSPs in insects, which allow them to accurately respond to these environmental chemical signals for their survival, but the mechanism is poorly studied. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CSP8 protein from the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura, a major plant pest in Asia. We also studied its binding properties to compounds like rhodojaponin III, a non-volatile plant metabolite. Our studies showed that the protein binds to these molecules with different affinities and provided important insight into the molecular recognition mechanism of the sensory protein SlCSP8 and the CSP protein family in general. Spodoptera litura F. is a generalist herbivore and one of the most important economic pests feeding on about 300 host plants in many Asian countries. Specific insect behaviors can be stimulated after recognizing chemicals in the external environment through conserved chemosensory proteins (CSPs) in chemoreceptive organs, which are critical components of the olfactory systems. To explore its structural basis for ligand-recognizing capability, we solved the 2.3 angstrom crystal structure of the apoprotein of S. litura CSP8 (SlCSP8). The SlCSP8 protein displays a conserved spherical shape with a negatively charged surface. Our binding assays showed that SlCSP8 bound several candidate ligands with differential affinities, with rhodojaponin III being the most tightly bound ligand. Our crystallographic and biochemical studies provide important insight into the molecular recognition mechanism of the sensory protein SlCSP8 and the CSP family in general, and they suggest that CSP8 is critical for insects to identify rhodojaponin III, which may aid in the CSP-based rational drug design in the future.

AB  - Alcohol use during adolescence is a serious public health problem, with binge drinking and high-intensity drinking being particularly harmful to the developing adolescent brain. To investigate the adverse consequences of binge drinking and high-intensity adolescent drinking, adolescent rodents were intermittently exposed to ethanol through intragastric gavage, intraperitoneal injection, or vapor inhalation. These models revealed the long-lasting behavioral and neural consequences of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. The present study was designed to characterize a different AIE model, namely, intermittent exposure to a single bottle of 10% ethanol as the only source of fluids on a 2 days on/2 days off (water days) schedule, and to determine whether this AIE exposure model would produce changes in hormonal and neuroimmune responsiveness to challenges of differing modalities. Assessments of ethanol intake as well as blood and brain ethanol concentrations (BECs and BrECs, respectively) in adult male and female rats (Experiment 1) revealed that BECs and BrECs peaked following access to ethanol for a 2 h period when assessed 1 h into the dark cycle. Experiment 2 revealed age differences in ethanol intake, BECs, and BrECs following a 2 h access to ethanol (1 h into the dark cycle), with adolescents ingesting more ethanol and reaching higher BECs as well as BrECs than adults. In Experiment 3, intermittent exposure to a single bottle of 10% ethanol for 10 cycles of 2 days on/2 days off was initiated either in early or late adolescence, followed by an acute systemic immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adulthood. LPS increased corticosterone and progesterone levels regardless of sex and prior ethanol history, whereas an LPS-induced increase in cytokine gene expression in the hippocampus was evident only in ethanol-exposed males and females, with females who underwent early exposure to ethanol being more affected than their later-exposed counterparts. In Experiment 4, intermittent ethanol exposure in females was initiated either in adolescence or adulthood and lasted for 12 ethanol exposure cycles. Then, behavioral (freezing behavior), hormonal (corticosterone and progesterone levels), and neuroimmune (cytokine gene expression in the PVN, amygdala, and hippocampus) responses to novel environments (mild stressors) and shock (intense stressors) were assessed. More pronounced behavioral and hormonal changes, as well as changes in cytokine gene expression, were evident in the shock condition than following placement in the novel environment, with prior history of ethanol exposure not playing a substantial role. Interleukin (IL)-1 & beta; gene expression was enhanced by shock in the PVN, whereas shock-induced increases in IL-6 gene expression were evident in the hippocampus. Together, these findings demonstrate that our intermittent adolescent exposure model enhances responsiveness to immune but not stress challenges, with females being more vulnerable to this AIE effect than males.

AB  - This study investigates farmers' reports of lamb predation by badgers on Scottish sheep farms. Differentiating between predation and scavenging, and identifying the species responsible, is essential for livestock managers to effectively mitigate risk. Questionnaire-style interviews established farmer perceptions of lamb predation by badgers and incidents of suspected predation were investigated on farms in 2022 and 2023 using post-mortem examination and molecular tools. Farmers submitted 29 carcasses for post-mortem. Of these, evidence of predation was present on 14 lambs (48%) and predation could not be ruled out for six further lambs (21%). No evidence of predation, but wounds consistent with scavenging after death, were present on nine lambs (31%). Nine (64%) of the 14 predated lambs also showed evidence of scavenging after death. Swabs were taken from 39 dead or injured lambs for potential predator/scavenger DNA recovery, and from 20 live control lambs. Badger DNA was obtained from the partial remains of two (5%) lambs. Badger DNA was not present on any of the carcasses submitted for post-mortem or from any living, wounded lambs. Fox DNA was obtained from 34 (87%) dead or injured lambs, including all lambs that exhibited evidence consistent with predation at post-mortem. Dog DNA was present on 12 (31%) lambs. While the results of this study cannot fully rule out the occurrence of lamb predation by badgers, no direct evidence was found to suggest that it does occur. The overall contribution of wildlife predation to lamb losses is considered to be low, but the results strongly suggest that foxes are likely to be responsible for lamb predation where it does occur. For livestock managers, a review of predator management strategies should be a key response to prevent future predation incidents. Practical implications. This study highlights the value of using post-mortem examination and molecular evidence to accurately confirm predation events and to identify predator species, informing appropriate management interventions.
   DNA and post-mortem analysis were used to investigate claims that badgers kill lambs. The study found that foxes were responsible for all confirmed cases of predation. Badger DNA was recovered from the remains of two lambs for which cause of death could not be determined. This study highlights the importance of taking an evidence-based approach to investigating livestock predation, informing appropriate mitigation measures.image

AB  - Antidepressants in general, and fluoxetine in particular, increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in mice. Here we asked how the antidepressant fluoxetine affects behavior and AHN in a corticosterone model of depression. In three groups of adult male C57BL/6j mice we administered either vehicle (VEH), corticosterone (CORT) treatment to induce a depression-like state or corticosterone plus a standard dose of fluoxetine (CORT+FLX). Following treatment, mice performed the open field test, the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test and the splash test. Neurogenesis was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry using BrdU and neuronal maturation markers. Unexpectedly, 42% of the CORT+FLX-treated mice exhibited severe weight loss, seizures and sudden death. As expected, the CORT treated group had altered behaviors compared to the VEH group, but the CORT+FLX mice that survived did not show any behavioral improvement compared to the CORT group. Antidepressants generally increase neurogenesis and here we also found that compared to CORT mice, CORT+FLX mice that survived had a significantly greater density of BrdU+, BrdU+DCX+ and BrdU+NeuN+ cells, suggesting increased neurogenesis. Moreover, the density of BrdU+NeuN+ cells was increased in an aberrant location, the hilus, of CORT+FLX mice, similar to previous studies describing aberrant neurogenesis following seizures. In conclusion, fluoxetine could induce considerable adverse effects in wild type mice, including seizure-like activity. Fluoxetine-induced neurogenesis increases could be related to this activity, therefore proneurogenic effects of fluoxetine and other antidepressants, especially in the absence of any behavioral therapeutic effects, should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Depression is a psychiatric disorder with several comorbidities that has a complicated pathophysiology. Multiple mechanisms such as abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity, neurotransmission (namely serotonin), and immune-inflammatory responses are involved in the pathophysiology of disease. In this study, we hypothesized that applying exercise (running wheel (RW) and treadmill (TM)) or fluoxetine (FLX) during adolescence could protect adult rats against the negative impact of early-life stress. To do this, we applied maternal separation stress (MS) to neonatal rats from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 14 and at PND 28, rats were divided into 8 experimental groups and were subjected to TM or RW or FLX treatment. After four weeks of physical activity or FLX treatment, at PND 64, behaviors were assessed by applying forced swimming test, sucrose preference test, open-field test, and elevated plus maze test. Serum cortiscosterone (CORT) levels and expression of genes associated with inflammatory factors (Il1 beta, Hmgb1, and Il6) and serotonergic systems (5-ht2c and 5-ht3a) were studies in the hippocampus (HIPP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our results revealed that RW and FLX treatment during adolescence are capable of attenuating MS-induced depressive- and anxiety-like disorders in adult male rats. These effects were accompanied by the normalization of both serum CORT and the expression of genes in the HIPP and PFC. TM exercise in adolescence showed anxiolytic effects but failed to produce antidepressant-like effects. Results of this study suggest that voluntary physical activity during adolescence can reduce the negative effects of early-life stress through different mechanisms.

AB  - Simple Summary Biometric measurements have been used to estimate the composition and yield of sheep carcass cuts. However, for the most part, they are carried out with animals finished in feedlots and/or with released animals, which do not represent the reality of production systems located in tropical regions because tropical forage grasses are the food base of small and large ruminants and are responsible for most of the meat produced in the tropics. Therefore, the objective was to predict the weights of the primary carcass cuts of Santa Ines lambs finished in tropical pastures through biometric measurements. Adjustments of multiple linear equations and selection of variables to predict carcass characteristics were performed using the STEPWISE option and Mallow's Cp. The biometric measurements obtained at the time of slaughter can be used as predictive variables of carcass of Santa Ines sheep finished in tropical pastures. The prediction equations are precise and accurate.
   The aim of this study was to predict carcass traits of Santa Ines lambs finished in tropical pastures by using biometric measurements. Data originated from two experiments involving 56 lambs (32 in experiment I and 24 in experiment II). In both experiments, the sheep were finished in that were finished in pastures of Panicum maximum and Brachiaria brizantha, experiment I being conducted in the rainy season and experiment II in the dry season. The following biometric measurements were recorded before slaughter: body length (BL), withers height (WH), rump height (RH), thorax width (TW), rump width (RW), chest width (CW), heart girth (HG), thigh circumference (TC), rump circumference (RC) and leg length (LL), in addition to live weight at slaughter (SW). After slaughter, hot carcass weight (HCW), cold carcass weight (CCW) and the weights of primal cuts (shoulder, neck, loin, leg and rib) were recorded. In the equations generated to predict SW, HCW and CCW, R-2 ranged from 0.58 to 0.91 and the measurements of WH, TC, CW, HG and RW were the most relevant. In the equations developed to predict the weight of primal cuts, in turn, R-2 ranged from 0.26 to 0.99. In these models, SW, BL, CW, TC, LL and HG explained most of the variation in the weight of primal cuts. Biometric measurements can be used to accurately and precisely predict HCW, CCW and the weight of primal cuts from the carcass of Santa Ines sheep finished in tropical pastures, since the equations presented R-2 and correlation coefficient and agreement above 0.8.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L. [O.] Kuntze) is a highly cross-pollinated and self-incompatible plant. Seeds can be harvested from specific individual mother plants in polyclonal tea gardens. Whether the pollen donor plays an important role in seed formation remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the male parents of 72 natural hybridized progenies (F-1) from one female parent on the basis of a putative specific allele by using simplesequence repeat (SSR) markers and the exclusion-likelihood method with Cervus 3.0 software. The genetic material, which comprised seven accessions of C. sinensis L., was acquired from Assamica planted in the Kayulandak polyclonal seed garden of the Pagilaran tea plantation in Batang District, Central Java, Indonesia, and was studied during 2019 and 2020. The genotype PGL-15 was used as the female parent, whereas the six candidate genotypes PGL-10, GMB-9, GMB-7, TPS-93, GMB-11, and TRI-2025 were used as the male parents. In this study, 13 SSR loci were used to identify the male parents of the F-1 progenies obtained through natural hybridization between one female and six male tea accessions. Results indicated that the exclusion-likelihood method, which correctly predicted 100% of the male parents, was more effective than the putative specific allele approach, which correctly predicted only 34.72% of the male parents in the 72 hybridized F-1 progenies of tea plants.

AB  - The female specimen of Ascorhynchus hippos Turpaeva, 1994 was collected in 2015 during the Russian-German deep-sea expedition SokhoBio (Sea of Okhotsk Biodiversity Studies) at the abyssal western slope of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench at a depth of 4469 m using a camera-epibenthic sledge. It is the first record of this species since the discovery of one female holotype and one male para-type in 1990. Ascorhynchus hippos is easily distinguishable from its congeners by the two prominent tubercles above the chelifore insertions, the absence of the eye tubercle and eyes, and the tubercles on the mid-dorsal trunk segments and the lateral processes. Here we present the first photographic documentation of all three known specimens of A. hippos and the COI barcode of the new specimen is also provided.

AB  - In order to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation and chemical fertilizers on yield and some physiological traits of quinoa an experiment was conducted in 2019 as split plot based on a randomized complete block design in two locations (Mashhad and Neishabour). Irrigation included, I0: full irrigation, I1: no irrigation at emergence stage, I2: no irrigation at stem elongation stage, I3: no irrigation at flowering stage, I4: no irrigation at seed setting stage. Fertilizer treatments included control (no ferti-lizer application); chemical fertilizer application according to local practices; manure application of 10 tons; and manure application of 20 tons per hectare. In general, seed yield, percentage of protein and seed oil in Mashhad was higher than in Neishabour. I2 treatment had the least negative effect on relative leaf water content. Application of chemical fertilizers, 10 tons and 20 tons of animal manure increased the percent of seed protein by 1.43, 1.66 and 2.37 compared to the control, respectively. The highest percentage of seed oil (5.91%) was obtained for treatment I2 in Mashhad and the low-est percentage of seed oil (4.18%) was obtained for treatment I4 in Neishabour. The lowest seed yield due to I1 treatment was observed in Neishabour and the highest seed yield was related to I0 treatment with 20 tons of manure and was observed in Mash-had. The results showed that the yield and water stress tolerance potential of quinoa can be modified by irrigation, fertilizer source and location.

AB  - Background: Protein ubiquitination is a common post-translational modification involved in protein degradation and various life processes in cells. NEDL1 is a ubiquitin ligase that is highly expressed primarily in the brain. However, the functions of NEDL1 in social approach/novelty preference, anxiety, learning and memory remain poorly understood. Methods: Nedl1 knockout mice (Nedl1- /- ) and wild-type mice (Nedl1+/+) were tested using three-chamber test, elevated plus maze, and Barnes maze. Then, brain tissue was stained, and blood was collected for metabolic analysis. Results: Compared with Nedl1+/+ mice, Nedl1- /- mice showed no differences in social approach/novelty preference and anxiety behavior. Nedl1- /- mice displayed impaired learning and memory. Nedl1 knockout did not affect the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. Astrocytes proliferated in the hippocampus of Nedl1- /- mice. The amino acid metabolism of Nedl1+/+and Nedl1- /- mice is different, especially the increase in proline and tryptophan. Conclusion: This study showed that Nedl1 knockout impaired learning and memory, which may be related to astrocyte proliferation and amino acid metabolism change. Nedl1 knockout did not affect social style/novelty preference and anxiety behavior in mice. The preliminary study of NEDL1 in neurobehavioral function could help understand the role of NEDL1 in the nervous system.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an intradermal (ID) administration of a PRRSV-1 modified live virus (MLV) vaccine in comparison to an intramuscular (IM) administration on health and performance. A total of 187 suckling piglets of a PRRSV-positive commercial farrow-to-finish farm were assigned to four groups: group A-PRRSV ID, group B-PRRSV IM, group C-control ID, and group D-control IM. At 2 weeks of age, all of the study piglets were either vaccinated with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine or injected with the vaccine adjuvant (controls). The collected blood serum samples were tested by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The side effects, body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), mortality rate, and lung and pleurisy lesions scores (LLS, PLS) were also recorded. Our study demonstrated that the ID vaccination of suckling piglets with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine has a positive effect on the piglets' health and performance, including an improved BW and a lower LLS and PLS index at their slaughter, as well as a decreased mortality rate at the growing/finishing stage. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes respiratory disease in weaning and growing pigs. A vaccination against PRRSV is one of the most important control measures. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of the intradermal (ID) administration of a PRRSV-1 modified live virus (MLV) vaccine in comparison to the intramuscular (IM) administration on the piglets' health and performance. A total of 187 suckling piglets of a PRRSV-positive commercial farrow-to-finish farm were assigned to four groups: group A-PRRSV ID, group B-PRRSV IM, group C-control ID, and group D-control IM. At 2 weeks of age, all the study piglets were either vaccinated with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine or injected with the vaccine adjuvant (controls). The collected blood serum samples were tested by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The side effects, body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), mortality rate, and lung and pleurisy lesions scores (LLS, PLS) were also recorded. The ELISA results indicated that the vaccination induced an important seroconversion at 4 and 7 weeks. Significant differences in the qRT-PCR results were noticed only at 10 weeks in group A vs. group C (p < 0.01) and group B vs. group C (p < 0.05). High viral loads, as evidenced by the qRT-PCR Ct values, were noticed in animals of both non-vaccinated groups at 7, 10, and 13 weeks. An ID vaccination has a positive impact on the BW at the piglets' slaughter, while both an ID and IM vaccination had a positive impact on the ADG. The mortality rate was lower in vaccinated groups at the finishing stage. The LLS and PLS were significantly lower in the vaccinated groups. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the ID vaccination of suckling piglets with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine has a positive effect on the piglets' health and performance, including an improved BW and a lower LLS and PLS index at their slaughter, as well as a decreased mortality rate at the growing/finishing stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cryopreservation of oocytes through vitrification is quite successful but oocyte vitrification is still being standardized because of their structural and molecular sensitivity to the cooling and freezing processes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of different cryoprotectant concentrations on post-thaw morphology and viability of immature oocytes in sheep. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitrification was achieved in three vitrification solutions comprised of different concentrations of the cryoprotectants ethylene glycol + DMSO, viz., (G1) 20%, (G2) 30%, (G3) 40% ethylene glycol + DMSO in equal ratio. Cryopreservation was in open pulled straws. Post vitrification evaluation was done after 1 week's storage in liquid nitrogen based on morphological evaluation and viability using trypan blue dye. RESULTS: The present study revealed non-significantly higher morphologically normal oocytes in G3 (74.7%) followed by G2 (70.3%), and the lowest in G1 (66.6%). Morphological defects were observed in 33.3 %, 29.6% and 25.2% of oocytes after cryopreservation in 20% (G1), 30% (G2) and 40% (G3) vitrification solutions, respectively. The results were non-significantly different between vitrification solution groups. However, the viability of post thaw immature oocytes was 95.6%, 84.4% and 81.1% after vitrification in G1 (20%), G2 (30%) and G3 (40%), with viability being significantly highest (P<0.05) in G1 (20%) and lowest in G3 (40%). CONCLUSION: Cryoprotectant concentrations enable the maintenance of normal morphology and minimize cryoinjury during vitrification of immature oocytes.

AB  - GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and acts via metabotropic GABA(B) receptors. Neurodegenerative diseases are a major burden and affect an ever increasing number of humans. The actual therapeutic drugs available are partially effective to slow down the progression of the diseases, but there is a clear need to improve pharmacological treatment thus find alternative drug targets and develop newer pharmaco-treatments. This chapter is dedicated to reviewing the latest evidence about GABA(B) receptors and their inhibitory mechanisms and pathways involved in the neurodegenerative pathologies.

AB  - Inoculum is a crucial factor influencing the success of an anaerobic digester start-up. This study evaluated the efficacy of aerobic waste activated sludge (WAS) to start-up anaerobic hybrid reactors (AHR) treating cassava wastewater. The start-up performance and stability of five 6.2 L AHRs inoculated differently by WAS (AHR1) and WAS co-inoculated with pig manure (AHR2), cow dung (AHR3), chicken manure (AHR4), and anaerobic pond sludge (AHR5) were investigated. The results depicted the potential of WAS as starter seed for AHR's start-up. This sludge contained methanogenic populations, mainly Methanomicrobials, Methanosarcinales, and Thermoplasmatales, for 1.5 x 10(7) MPN/g VS compared to 4.0 x 10(3)-6.0 x 10(7) MPN/g VS in manures and anaerobic sludge. Co-inoculation of WAS with cow dung (AHR3) and anaerobic sludge (AHR5) promoted a rapid start-up, achieved 4.0 kg COD/m(3).d within 1.5-1.7 months, while about 2.5-3.3 months needed for the others. A satisfying performance, stability, microbial development and activity, depicted as high COD removal (CODrem) efficiency and methane productivity, were achieved in all digesters. About 0.32 and 0.21 m(3)/kg CODrem for biogas and methane yielded in AHR1, whereas 0.41-0.49 m(3)-biogas/kg CODrem and 0.25-0.32 m(3)-CH4/kg CODrem obtained in other reactors. This finding confirmed that inoculum's quality is critical for productive gas productivity and system stability maintenance.

AB  - Simple Summary The red spider mite, Tetranychus merganser is one of the most economically important pests in papaya and prickle pear cactus cultivars, causing major damage to fruit and defoliation. In recent years, T. merganser has increased the number of its host plants. The mechanisms of resistance of a plant to herbivorous arthropod include antixenosis and antibiosis. Antixenosis refers to the plant mechanism to affect feeding and oviposition of arthropods; antibiosis refers to the plant capacity to affect the biology of the arthropod. The aim of this research is to assess antibiosis and antixenosis as resistance mechanisms in seven host plants (Thevetia ahouai, Carica papaya, Phaseolus vulgaris, Moringa oleifera, Pittosporum tobira, Helietta parvifolia, Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum) to red spider mites. Oviposition and damage by feeding of T. merganser were greater on C. papaya than on the other host plants. The population growth of the spider mite was lower in P. tobira and T. ahouai than in the other host plants. Results based on the analysis of demographic parameters, food intake, survival and oviposition of T. merganser females suggest that P. tobira and T. ahouai were the most resistant to red spider mites, whereas C. papaya was the most susceptible of the seven host plants. The resistant plants can be studied as alternatives in the management of red spider mites. Red spider mites, Tetranychus merganser Boudreaux (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest that causes economic losses in papaya and nopal crops in Mexico. The aim of this research was to assess antibiosis and antixenosis as resistance mechanisms in seven host plants (Thevetia ahouai, Carica papaya, Phaseolus vulgaris, Moringa oleifera, Pittosporum tobira, Helietta parvifolia, Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum) to red spider mites. Antixenosis was evaluated by non-preference for oviposition and feeding, antibiosis by infinitesimal rate of increase, finite rate of increase and doubling time, and the percentage of spider mites mortality. Oviposition and damage by feeding of T. merganser were significantly greater on C. papaya than on the other host plants. The growth rate of the spider mite was significantly lower in P. tobira and T. ahouai than in the other host plants. The percentage of hatched eggs of T. merganser was significantly higher in P. vulgaris than in the other plant species. Based on the demographic parameters, survival, food intake, and oviposition, these results indicated that compared with C. papaya, P. tobira and T. ahouai were more resistant. These results may be due to the fact that they were plants species of different families. The resistant plants can be studied as alternatives in the management of T. merganser.

AB  - Simple Summary Maedi-visna is a globally distributed, viral, and incurable chronic disease of small ruminants, challenging the health and welfare of sheep and jeopardizing the sustainability of farms. Currently, the scarcity of representative, updated, and epidemiological data hinders the implementation of successful eradication programs. The objective of our study is to prospectively study the seroepidemiology of maedi-visna in intensively reared dairy sheep. For this reason, a total of 407 purebred Chios and Lacaune ewes from four farms were studied for two successive years, and blood samples were semiannually collected and tested using the ELISA test. Prevalence and incidence rates were found to have increased in all the studied farms, highlighting the importance of horizontal transmission of the virus within the farms. Various serological patterns were observed in the studied animals, namely, constantly seronegative, constantly seropositive, seroconverted, seroreverted, or animals with an intermittent presence of antibodies. The last two categories indicate a special immune response of infected animals which needs to be further investigated and considered for the diagnosis of MV and when designing eradication programs. The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the seroepidemiology of maedi-visna (MV) infections in intensively reared dairy sheep. A total of 407 purebred Chios and Lacaune ewes from four farms were surveyed for two consecutive years and were serologically tested semiannually with an indirect ELISA at pre-mating and pre-lambing. The farms' structure and management practices were similar and animal traits (age, breed, and production stage) were recorded. Based on the serological status, morbidity frequency measures were estimated, and ewes were categorized as constantly seronegative, constantly seropositive, seroconverted, seroreverted, or as animals with an intermittent presence of antibodies. During the study, period seroprevalence, incidence rate, and cumulative incidence were 84.8%, 33.6 new cases per 100 sheep-semesters, and 64.2%. Point-seroprevalence ranged from 48.5% to 96.0% among the studied farms and sampling occasions, and they increased by age. Increased morbidity frequency measures indicate the significance of horizontal transmission in intensive dairy sheep farms. A remarkable percentage of infected animals seroreverted (8.1%) or presented an intermittent presence of antibodies (10.3%) during the study, confirming the risk of misdiagnosis in cross-sectional studies and in the currently implemented testing and elimination programs. The serological patterns observed in our study need to be considered when studying MV epidemiology and for the designing of efficient MV elimination programs.

AB  - To identify the ecological features of the Megel Horseshoe Bat during its hibernation period in the northeastern periphery of its range (North Caucasus, Republic of Dagestan). The research was carried out in the Karabudakhkentskaya Cave (Republic of Dagestan) in 2019-2023. The cave was surveyed and the animals were counted 1-2 times a month. Microclimatic indicators were recorded by automatic loggers. During the research, it was found that the place of hibernation of R. mehelyi in the north-east of the area is the Karabudakhkentskaya Cave. The minimum, maximum and average temperatures in the cave during the wintering period of R. mehelyi are equal: 6.9 o C, 15.6 C-degrees and 12.4 C-degrees accordingly. The minimum humidity was 89.1 %, the maximum was 98.2 % and the average was 92.7 %. It was found that the temperature inside the shelter affects the number of individuals in the visible part of the cave and the formation of individual groupings. In addition, there is an increase in the number of individuals in April before the start of migration. It was found that humidity does not affect the movement of the species inside the cave, but temperature is a factor determining the movement of animals and their crowding. Thus, to accurately record the number of species, which is important for carrying out environmental measures, it is necessary to take into account both indicators - temperature and time of research.

AB  - Motivation: Tea is a cross-pollinated woody perennial plant, which is why, application of conventional breeding is limited for its genetic improvement. However, lack of the genome-wide high-density SNP markers and genome-wide haplotype information has greatly hampered the utilization of tea genetic resources toward fast-track tea breeding programs. To address this challenge, we have generated a first-generation haplotype map of tea (Tea HapMap-1). Out-crossing and highly heterozygous nature of tea plants, make them more complicated for DNA-level variant discovery.
   Results: In this study, whole genome re-sequencing data of 369 tea genotypes were used to generate 2,334,564 biallelic SNPs and 1,447,985 InDels. Around 2928.04 million paired-end reads were used with an average mapping depth of similar to 0.31x per accession. Identified polymorphic sites in this study will be useful in mapping the genomic regions responsible for important traits of tea. These resources lay the foundation for future research to understand the genetic diversity within tea germplasm and utilize genes that determine tea quality. This will further facilitate the understanding of tea genome evolution and tea metabolite pathways thus, offers an effective germplasm utilization for breeding the tea varieties.

AB  - Simple Summary Several pedigree-based analyses of dog breed populations have revealed increased levels of inbreeding worldwide. These inbreeding levels threaten dogs' fitness and adaptability, population development, and survival, as well as breeds' economic importance and breeding goals. Therefore, determining the population structure of the Boerboel dog breed is critical for monitoring and controlling the loss of genetic diversity through optimal breeding programs in order to preserve its unique genes. This study's findings revealed that the Boerboel dog breed has less genetic diversity, implying increased homogeneity, and there is unequal founder contribution to the current population's genetic variation. Future breeding strategies would need to avoid the mating of closely related animals and the use of popular males.Abstract The Boerboel dog breed (BBD) is indigenous to South Africa (SA) and plays an important role in safeguarding homes and farms. The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development (DALRRD) classifies the BBD as a protected species, and it is valued for its intelligence, boldness, and strength, as well as for continually ensuring the safety of its owners. The aim of this study was to investigate genetic diversity within the BBD population using pedigree information. The original BBD data, which contained 87,808 records, were obtained from the Integrated Registration and Genetic Information System (INTERGIS). After editing, the pedigree data included 87,755 records of animals born between 1971 and 2019. Pedigree analyses were performed using PEDIG (Fortran 77 software) to determine the completeness, inbreeding coefficients, and genetic diversity as defined by the genetic contributions of the most important ancestors of the current animals. This study identified 91.2% inbred animals in the BBD population, with an average and maximum inbreeding of 7.5% and 50% of inbred animals, respectively. The estimated inbreeding rate per year was 0.20% with an effective population size of 83.1. The most influential ancestors explained 82.63% and 80.92% of the total genetic variation for males and females in the studied populations, respectively. Only 10 important ancestors explained more than 50% of the entire population's genetic diversity. The numbers of founders (f) were 348 and 356, and the effective numbers of founders (fe) were 57.4 and 60.1, respectively, for males and females. The numbers of founders were higher than the effective numbers of founders, implying a loss of genetic diversity due to unequal founder contributions. The BBD population was not critically endangered based on the inbreeding rates and effective population size; however, the population experienced a significant loss of genetic variability, unequal genetic contributions by founders, and a genetic bottleneck. Future breeding strategies could benefit from using equal proportions of parent stock and including new genetically distant breeds.

AB  - To understand the mineral element distribution of the soil and tea plants, we determined and analyzed the content of 16 mineral elements in the soil profile and various tea plant organs at the Yangai tea farm in Huzxi District, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, China. The results show that the soil of the Yangai tea farm is mainly an acidic and mineral soil, which is suitable for tea plant growth. The mineral elements (i.e., Fe, S, Mo, V, and Zn) are mainly from natural sources and human activities, Se may be affected by human activities, and other mineral elements are mainly from natural sources. The tea plant has a strong ability to absorb Ca and S (especially Ca). The content of low reabsorption proficiency mineral elements (i.e., Al, Ca, Mn) in vegetative storage organs (e.g., old leaf) of the tea plant is higher than in organs with active growth and exuberant metabolism (i.e., leaf buds and flower buds). And the content of high reabsorption proficiency mineral elements (i.e., K, Mg, P, S, Mo, Cu, Ni, and Zn) in organs of the tea plant is just the opposite. In addition, the soil could provide abundant mineral elements (i.e., Mo, Se, V, Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn) for the tea plant growth, and act as the primary source of mineral elements in the tea plant. Finally, the soil within a depth of 130 cm is the mineral elements' absorption range of the tea plants in the study area. Therefore, supplies of the mineral elements from the deep soil layer should be a vital source of the mineral element absorption for tea plants, and considered when a fertilizer management plan for the tea garden is implemented, especially for tea plantations that are several decades old.

AB  - Chick rearing is one of the most energy-expensive phases of the breeding cycle for adult birds. It has been suggested that the daily energy expenditure (DEE) that birds may sustain over extended time periods may be set at approximately 4x basal metabolic rate (BMR). Parent birds can be expected to face the upper limit of DEE during the chick-rearing period. To determine whether parents rearing chicks exceed the sustainable limits of DEE in the temperate regions, in this study we measured parental DEE of Rhinoceros Auklet Cerorhinca monocerata using the doubly- labeled water method in 2018 and 2019 on Teuri Island, Japan. We found that, with only on exception, all individuals had DEE below 4x BMR. Our findings suggest that Rhinoceros Auklets basically have DEEs within "the maximum sustained working level".

AB  - Alcohol use disorder needs more effective treatments because relapse rates remain high. Psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, have been used to treat substance use disorders. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of ayahuasca on ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization (EIBS). Swiss mice received 2.2 g/kg ethanol or saline IP injections every other day across nine days (D1, D3, D5, D7, and D9), and locomotor activity was evaluated 10 min after each injection. Then, animals were treated daily with ayahuasca (corresponding to 1.76 mg/kg of N,N-dimethyltryptamine, DMT) or water by oral gavage for eight consecutive days. On the seventh day, mice were evaluated in the elevated plus maze. Then, mice were challenged with a single dose of ethanol to measure their locomotor activity. Dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, dynorphin, and prodynorphin levels were quantified in the striatum and hippocampus by blot analysis. Repeated ethanol administration resulted in EIBS. However, those animals treated with ayahuasca had an attenuated EIBS. Moreover, ayahuasca reduced the anxiogenic response to ethanol withdrawal and prevented the ethanol-induced changes on 5-HT1 a receptor and pmdynorphin levels in the hippocampus and reduced ethanol effects in the dynorphin/prodynorphin ratio levels in the striatum. These results suggest a potential application of ayahuasca to modulate the neuroplastic changes induced by ethanol.

AB  - Pb is a prevalent heavy metal contaminant in the habitats of herbivorous insects. This study investigated the tolerance level of Lymantria dispar larvae to Pb and its corresponding mechanism focusing on the role of ZIP genes. The detrimental impacts of Pb on larval growth and survival exhibited a dose-dependent relationship, with a survival rate of 48% even at the extreme concentration of 3424 mg/kg. Among the 11 ZIP family genes analyzed, only LdZIP8 showed a significant up-regulation in response to Pb treatment. Localization studies revealed that LdZIP8 was situated on the cell membrane in Sf 9 cells. Under Pb stress, silencing LdZIP8 led to a marked reduction in larval body weight and extended developmental duration. This gene silencing exacerbated Pb-induced activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways, evidenced by elevated expression of apoptotic genes and increased disorder of mitochondrial pathway compared to non-silenced controls. At the cellular level, LdZIP8 overexpression in Sf 9 cells mitigated the adverse effects of Pb on cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, reactive oxygen species levels, and calcium ion homeostasis. Taken together, L. dispar larvae exhibit considerable Pb tolerance, with LdZIP8 identified as a critical regulator of this resilience.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a natural polyphenol compound abundant in green plants with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we explore its protective effects and potential mechanisms of action on intestinal epithelium exposure to oxidative stress (OS). We show that CGA attenuated OS-induced intestinal inflammation and injury in weaned pigs, which is associated with elevated antioxidant capacity and decreases in inflammatory cytokine secretion and cell apoptosis. In vitro study showed that CGA elevated phosphorylation of two critical signaling proteins of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, Akt and nuclear factor erythroid-derived-related factor 2, leading to the elevated expression of intracellular antioxidant enzymes and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Specific inhibition of HO-1 partially abolished its anti-inflammatory effect in IPEC-J2 cells exposure to OS. Interestingly, CGA suppressed the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced inflammatory responses in IPEC-J2 cells by decreasing phosphorylation of two critical inflammatory signaling proteins, NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (I kappa B alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Specific inhibition of HO-1 cannot fully abolish its anti-inflammatory effect on the TNF-alpha-challenged cells. These results strongly suggested that CGA is a natural anti-inflammatory agent that can attenuate OS-induced inflammation and injury of intestinal epithelium via co-regulating the PI3K/Akt and I kappa B alpha/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Hyperandrogenic disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, are often associated with metabolic disruptions such as insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Studies in sheep, a precocial model of translational relevance, provide evidence that in utero exposure to excess testosterone during days 30-90 of gestation (the sexually dimorphic window where males naturally experience elevated androgens) programs insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in female offspring. Extending earlier findings that adverse effects of testosterone excess are evident in fetal day 90 pancreas, the end of testosterone treatment, the present study provides evidence that transcriptomic and phenotypic effects of in utero testosterone excess on female pancreas persist after cessation of treatment, suggesting lasting organizational changes, and induce a male-like phenotype in female pancreas. These findings demonstrate that the female pancreas is susceptible to programmed masculinization during the sexually dimorphic window of fetal development and shed light on underlying connections between hyperandrogenism and metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - In early pregnancy, as the embryo arrives in the uterus, intensive communication between the embryo and uterus begins. Hundreds of molecules are known to be involved, but despite numerous findings, full understanding of the complexity of the embryo-maternal dialog remains elusive. Recently, extracellular vesicles, nanoparticles able to transfer functionally active cargo between cells, have emerged as important players in cell-cell communication, and as such, they have gained great attention over the past decade also in reproductive biology. Here, we use a domestic animal model (Sus scrofa) with an epitheliochorial, superficial type of placentation because of its advantage in studding uterine luminal fluid extracellular vesicles. We show that during early pregnancy, the uterine lumen is abundant with extracellular vesicles that carry a plethora of miRNAs able to target genes involved in embryonic and organismal development. These extracellular vesicles, upon the delivery to primary trophoblast cells, affect genes governing development as well as cell-to-cell signaling and interactions, consequently having an impact on trophoblast cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We conclude that the exchange of a unique population of extracellular vesicles and their molecular cargo at the maternal-embryo interface is the key to the success of embryo implantation and pregnancy.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a key demethylase in the process of bacterial diarrhea in piglets. However, the involvement of FTO in infectious diarrhea caused by Clostridium perfringens type C is not known. This study demonstrated that FTO plays an indispensable role in this type of diarrhea; and that the absence of FTO promotes apoptosis and inflammation in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line-J2 (IPEC-J2). FTO targets Caspase 3 to affect the apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification can accommodate mRNA processing, stability, and translation in mammals, and fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a vital demethylase in the m6A modification pathway. Clostridium perfringens type C (C. perfringens type C) causes diarrhea in piglets and has a serious impact on the pig industry. However, our understanding of the effect of m6A in the process of C. perfringens type C infectious piglet diarrhea (CPTCIPD) is limited. Here, an in vitro model of CPTCIPD was constructed by treating the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line-J2 (IPEC-J2) with Clostridium perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin, and the role of FTO was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. The results revealed that the overall RNA m6A contents at the tissue and cell levels were significantly up-regulated after C. perfringens infection (p < 0.05). FTO expression was significantly reduced in CPB2-treated IPEC-J2 cells. Functionally, FTO knockdown in the treated cells inhibited their proliferation and promoted apoptosis and the inflammation phenotype, whereas FTO overexpression had the opposite effects. Inhibiting FTO prolonged the half-life and up-regulated the expression of Caspase 3, leading to apoptosis. Therefore, this work explored the regulation of FTO in IPEC-J2 cells after CPB2 treatment and enhanced our understanding of the effect of the m6A modification in CPTCIPD.

AB  - Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIPs) are key immunomodulatory molecules. Endogenous IAIPs are present in human, rodent, and sheep brains, and are variably localized to the cytoplasm and nuclei at multiple developmental stages. We have previously reported that ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) reduces IAIP concentrations in the fetal sheep brain. In this study, we examined the effect of I/R on total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear expression of IAIPs in neurons (NeuN(+)), microglia (Iba1(+)), oligodendrocytes (Olig2(+)) and proliferating cells (Ki67(+)), and their co-localization with histones and the endoplasmic reticulum in fetal brain cells. At 128 days of gestation, fetal sheep were exposed to Sham (n = 6) or I/R induced by cerebral ischemia for 30 min with reperfusion for 7 days (n = 5). Although I/R did not change the total number of IAIP(+) cells in the cerebral cortex or white matter, cells with IAIP(+) cytoplasm decreased, whereas cells with IAIP(+) nuclei increased in the cortex. I/R reduced total neuronal number but did not change the IAIP(+) neuronal number. The proportion of cytoplasmic IAIP(+) neurons was reduced, but there was no change in the number of nuclear IAIP(+) neurons. I/R increased the number of microglia and decreased the total numbers of IAIP(+) microglia and nuclear IAIP(+) microglia, but not the number of cytoplasmic IAIP(+) microglia. I/R was associated with reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes and increased proliferating cells, without changes in the subcellular IAIP localization. IAIPs co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum and histones. In conclusion, I/R alters the subcellular localization of IAIPs in cortical neurons and microglia but not in oligodendrocytes or proliferating cells. Taken together with the known neuroprotective effects of exogenous IAIPs, we speculate that endogenous IAIPs may play a role during recovery from I/R.</p>

AB  - Certain plant species within the Apiales order accumulate triterpenoid saponins that feature a distinctive glucose-glucose-rhamnose (G-G-R) sugar chain attached at the C-28 position of the pentacyclic triterpene skeleton. Until recently, the genomic basis underlying the biosynthesis and evolution of this sugar chain has remained elusive. In this study, we identified two novel glycoside glycosyltransferases (GGTs) that can sequentially install the sugar chain's second D-glucose and third L-rhamnose during the biosynthesis of asiaticoside and madecassoside, two representative G-G-R sugar chain-containing triterpenoid saponins produced by Centella asiatica. Enzymatic assays revealed the remarkable substrate promiscuity of the two GGTs and the key residues crucial for sugar-donor selectivity of the glucosyltransferase and rhamnosyltransferase. We further identified syntenic tandem gene duplicates of the two GGTs in the Apiaceae and Araliaceae families, suggesting a well-conserved genomic basis underlying sugar chain assembly that likely has evolved in the early ancestors of the Apiales order. Moreover, expression patterns of the two GGTs in pierced leaves of C. asiatica were found to be correlated with the production of asiaticoside and madecassoside, implying their involvement in host defense against herbivores and pathogens. Our work sheds light on the biosynthesis and evolution of complex saponin sugars, paving the way for future engineering of diverse bioactive triterpenoids with unique glycoforms.

AB  - Synonymous codon usage (SCU) bias in oil-tea camellia cpDNAs was determined by examining 13 South Chinese oil-tea camellia samples and performing bioinformatics analysis using GenBank sequence information, revealing conserved bias among the samples. GC content at the third position (GC3) was the lowest, with a preference for A or T, suggesting weak SCU bias. The GC contents at the first two codon positions (GC1 and GC2) were extremely significantly correlated with one another but not with the expected number of codons (ENC). GC3 was not correlated with GC1 and GC2 but was extremely significantly correlated with ENC. Of the 30 high-frequency codons, 15, 14, 1 and 0 codons had U, A, G and C at the third position, respectively. The points for most genes were distributed above the neutrality plot diagonal. The points for 20 genes, accounting for 37.74% of all coding sequences (CDSs), were distributed on or near the ENC plot standard curve, and the ENC ratio ranged from -0.05-0.05. However, those of the other genes were under the standard curve, with higher ENC ratios. The points for most genes were distributed in the lower part of the PR2 plot, especially the bottom right corner. Twenty-eight highly expressed codons were screened and 11, 9, 7 and 1 codons had U, A, C and G as the third base, respectively. Twenty optimal codons were screened by comparing high-frequency codons and 11, 8, 0 and 1 codons had U, A, C and G as the third base, respectively. All samples were divided into six clades (r(2) = 0.9190, d = 0.5395) according to a relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based phylogenetic tree. Camellia gauchowensis, C. vietnamensis, an undetermined oil-tea camellia species from Hainan province, and C. osmantha belonged to the same clade; the genetic relationships between C. gauchowensis, C. vietnamensis and the undetermined species were the closest. In summary, SCU bias is influenced by selection, while the influence of mutation cannot be ignored. As the SCU bias differed between species, this feature can be used to identify plant species and infer their genetic relationships. For example, C. vietnamensis and C. gauchowensis can be merged into one species, and the undetermined species can be considered C. vietnamensis. The results described here provide a basis for studying cpDNA gene expression and the development of cpDNA genetic engineering.

AB  - Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants made of cobalt chromium (CoCr) alloy have shown early failure compared with other bearing materials. A consequence of the abnormal wear produced by these prostheses is elevated levels of cobalt in the blood of patients, which can lead to systemic conditions involving cardiac and neurological symptoms. In order to better understand the implications for patients with these implants, we carried out metal content and RNA-Seq analysis of excised tissue from rats treated intraperitonially for 28 days with low concentrations of cobalt. Cobalt blood levels in dosed rats were found to be similar to those seen in some patients with MoM implants (range: 4-38 mu g/L Co in blood). Significant accumulation of cobalt was measured in a range of tissues including kidney, liver, and heart, but also in brain tissue. RNA-Seq analysis of neural tissue revealed that exposure to cobalt induces a transcriptional response in the prefrontal cortex (pref. cortex), cerebellum, and hippocampus. Many of the most up- and downregulated genes appear to correspond to choroid plexus transcripts. These results indicate that the choroid plexus could be the brain tissue most affected by cobalt. More specifically, the differentially expressed genes show a disruption of steroidogenesis and lipid metabolism. Several other transcripts also demonstrate that cobalt induces an immune response. In summary, cobalt exposure induces alterations in the brain transcriptome, more specifically, the choroid plexus, which is in direct contact with neurotoxicants at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Modified Dingchuan Decoction (MDD) is a Chinese medicine formula containing 11 materials with cough suppression, asthma relief, and anti-inflammatory effects. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MDD on cough-variant asthma (CVA) and to investigate its mechanism of action. Materials and methods: The chemical constituents of MDD were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/electrostatic field orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). A guinea pig CVA model was established using an intramuscular injection of ovalbumin (OVA), combined with an intraperitoneal injection of aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and nebulized OVA. At the beginning of day 18, the low, medium, and high MDD groups were gavaged with 7.23 g/kg, 14.46 g/kg, and 28.92 g/kg of MDD, respectively, and the positive group was gavaged with 5 mg/kg of prednisone acetate combined with 1 mg/kg of montelukast sodium; the normal and model groups were given an equal volume of distilled water, once a day for 21 days. The cough was induced by 10-3 mol/L capsaicin solution 1 h after the last administration, and the number of coughs and the latency of coughs were evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) was used to observe pathological changes in the lungs and airways. The concentration of inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We analyzed the lung microbiota using 16 S ribosomal DNA (16 S rDNA) high-throughput sequencing. Results: The 38 chemical components were found in MDD, and MDD reduced the number of coughs in guinea pigs with CVA, prolonged cough latency, improved pathological damage to the lungs and airways, regulated inflammatory factor levels in BALF, and modulated the lung microbiota. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that treating CVA with MDD may be related to inhibiting lung inflammation and regulating lung microbiota.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia triggers vascular dementia (VD), which is characterized by memory loss, cognitive deficits, and vascular injury in the brain. Puerarin (Pur) represents the major isoflavone glycoside of Radix Puerariae, with verified neuroprotective activity and cardiovascular protective effects. However, whether Pur ameliorates cognitive impairment and vascular injury in rats with permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) remains unknown. This work aimed to assess Pur's effects on BCCAO-induced VD and to dissect the underlying mechanisms, especially examining the function of transient receptor potential melastatin-related 2 (TRPM2) in alleviating cognitive deficits and vascular injuries. Rats with BCCAO developed VD. Pur (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the pathological changes, increased synaptic structural plasticity in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region and decreased oxidative stress, which eventually reduced cognitive impairment and vascular injury in BCCAO rats. Notably, Pur-improved neuronal cell loss, synaptic structural plasticity, and endothelial vasorelaxation function might be mediated by the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent TRPM2/NMDAR pathway, evidenced by decreased levels of ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), Bax, Bax/Bcl2, and TRPM2, and increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), Bcl2, and NR2A. In conclusion, Pur has therapeutic potential for VD, alleviating neuronal cell apoptosis and vascular injury, which may be related to the ROS-dependent TRPM2/NMDAR pathway.</p>

AB  - Phenolic compounds are components with proven beneficial effects on the human body, primarily due to their antioxidant activity. In view of the high consumption of tea and the numerous factors that affect the nutritional value of its infusions, the aim of this study was to identify the effects of tea type and duration of leaf extraction with water on the levels of phenolic compounds and other components that determine biological activity (oxalates, Ca, Na, Cu, and Mn). Based on assays, infusions of red tea prepared for 20 min were found to be the best source of phenolics (202.9 mg/100 mL), whereas the lowest level of these compounds was determined in infusions of black tea extracted from leaves for 30 min (46.9 mg/100 mL). The highest degree of increase in polyphenol content (by approx. 50%) was noted in red and green tea infused for between 10 and 20 min, whereas for black tea, polyphenol levels decreased with time. The biological activity of tea infusions appears to be determined to the greatest extent by the interactions between phenolic compounds and oxalates (r = 0.6209), calcium (r = 0.8516), and sodium (0.8045). A daily intake of three to four mugs (1 L) of tea infusions provides the human body the entire amount of phenolics recommended for health reasons (as regards red tea, this is possible at 1/3 of the volume) and covers the daily requirement for manganese, as well as (partially) copper.

AB  - The Late Pleistocene (similar to 125-12 thousand years ago) record of eastern Africa is critical for assessing the origin, evolution and history of human behavior. Faunal remains are a resource for understanding changes in paleoenvironments and the foodways of ancient people in eastern Africa, yet zooarchaeological information for this timeframe has been constrained by few and frequently biased samples, leading to interpretations that emphasize the hunting of large ungulates. New research in a mesic peri-coastal area of Kenya reveals a distinct food acquisition strategy at Panga ya Saidi, a cave that foragers intermittently occupied over the past 78,000 years. Zooarchaeological data from Panga ya Saidi, together with published ethnographic, animal behavioral, and zooarchaeological data, are used to argue that archaeologically invisible tools such as snares, traps, and/or nets were regularly used by Middle and Later Stone Age foragers to remotely capture small game in the site's forested environs, while encounter hunting was occasionally used to target larger game in nearby grasslands.

AB  - The stinging hairs of plants from the family Urticaceae inject compounds that inflict pain to deter herbivores. The sting of the New Zealand tree nettle (Urtica ferox) is among the most painful of these and can cause systemic symptoms that can even be life-threatening; however, the molecular species effecting this response have not been elucidated. Here we reveal that two classes of peptide toxin are responsible for the symptoms of U. ferox stings: Delta-Uf1a is a cytotoxic thionin that causes pain via disruption of cell membranes, while beta/delta-Uf2a defines a new class of neurotoxin that causes pain and systemic symptoms via modulation of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels. We demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments that beta/delta-Uf2a is a potent modulator of human NaV1.5 (EC50: 55 nM), NaV1.6 (EC50: 0.86 nM), and Na(V)1.7 (EC50: 208 nM), where it shifts the activation threshold to more negative potentials and slows fast inactivation. We further found that both toxin classes are widespread among members of the Urticeae tribe within Urticaceae, suggesting that they are likely to be pain-causing agents underlying the stings of other Urtica species. Comparative analysis of nettles of Urtica, and the recently described pain-causing peptides from nettles of another genus, Dendrocnide, indicates that members of tribe Urticeae have developed a diverse arsenal of pain-causing peptides.

AB  - The paper presents an experimental investigation on the nonlinear bending moments of an ultra large container ship over 300 m long in rough waves. The design and calibration procedure of the scaled segmented ship model with variable cross-section backbone beam is introduced. Transfer functions of vertical bending moments at different Froude numbers, wave headings and wave heights are analyzed. Ship responses in harsh waves are analyzed and the largest wave height to wavelength ratio exceeds 1/10. It is interesting and significant to analyze the strongly nonlinear behaviors of the ship in such high waves. The resonance frequencies, proportion of highorder harmonic components, asymmetry of hogging and sagging moments as well as the phase differences between wave-frequency and high-order harmonics in extreme waves are investigated systematically.

AB  - Simple Summary The need to establish a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress for sows when they are introduced into new groups because of the associated aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of providing access to straw in racks and manila ropes (IMPROVED) on aggressive behavior after mixing, compared to a typical minimal enrichment gestation system (CONTROL), and to understand the effect of parity order and backfat on the level of the aggression. The overall average number of fights and the initiated aggressive behavior in the three observation days were greater in the CONTROL pens, although within time, we found a significant effect of treatment only on the number of fights performed 3 weeks post-mixing. The effect of backfat thickness revealed an effect only on the observations of initiated aggressive behavior, which was most frequently performed by sow with a low backfat thickness. Parity order did not have a significant effect on the display of any of the aggressive behaviors. These results suggest that aggression at mixing is unavoidable and, indeed, is essential to ensuring the establishment of the dominance hierarchy and thereby achieving group stability. Nevertheless, optimal enrichment materials could have a beneficial effect on at least reducing its frequency. For sows introduced into new groups, the aggressive behavior associated with establishing a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of providing sows with an improved pen environment (straw in racks and ropes) on aggressive behavior after mixing and to understand the role played by sow back fat thickness and parity order. At 29 d post-service, sows were mixed into IMPROVED or CONTROL pens with individual feeding stalls (6 groups/treatment, 20 sows/group). Aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 h at mixing (T0) and 24 h (T1) and 3 weeks post-mixing (T21). Overall, the sows in the CONTROL pens performed more fighting behavior compared to the IMPROVED sows (p < 0.001). This difference was significant only at T21 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the sows in the CONTROL pens generally initiated more aggressive behaviors than the sows in the IMPROVED pens (p = 0.02). The sows with a low back fat thickness initiated more aggressive behaviors, but parity had no significant effect on any of the aggressive behaviors. These results indicate a beneficial effect of improvements to the pen environment on the aggression performed by group-housed sows between the time of mixing and three weeks later. The effect was reduced on the day of mixing, which is in accordance with the necessity for sows to employ aggression to establish the dominance hierarchy.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the impact of genomic imprinting on the genetic variance of composite reproductive traits across three parities in Baluchi sheep. The traits analyzed included litter mean weight per lamb born (LMWLB), litter mean weight per lamb weaned (LMWLW), total litter weight at birth (TLWB), and total litter weight at weaning (TLWW). We employed a univariate linear animal model for each trait, treating performance across parities as separate traits. Twentyfour animal models were assessed, incorporating direct additive genetic effects, maternal genetic effects, maternal permanent environmental effects, direct and maternal genetic covariances, as well as maternal and paternal imprinting. Model selection was based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Direct heritability estimates for the traits were generally low, ranging from 0.039 f 0.017 for LMWLW to 0.085 f 0.028 for TLWW. TLWB and TLWW exhibited higher heritability than LMWLB and LMWLW in their respective parities. In the best model (model 24), maternal imprinting heritability estimates from the first to third parity were 0.059 f 0.016, 0.060 f 0.013, and 0.085 f 0.021 for TLWB, 0.075 f 0.021, 0.068 f 0.025, and 0.048 f 0.016 for LMWLB, 0.051 f 0.013, 0.065 f 0.019, and 0.068 f 0.020 for TLWW, and, 0.072 f 0.012, 0.057 f 0.018 and 0.054 f 0.011 for LMWLW, respectively. Paternal imprinting heritability estimates were consistently lower than maternal imprinting estimates, with values across parities ranging from 0.001 f 0.024 to 0.019 f 0.032 for TLWB, 0.005 f 0.022-0.010 f 0.019 for LMWLB, 0.012 f 0.05-0.017 f 0.05 for TLWW and, 0.013 f 0.01-0.016 f 0.01 for LMWLW. In conclusion, imprinting effects should be included in breeding programs to increase the accuracy of genetic evaluation.

AB  - An aerobic bacterium, designated as strain KD337-16(T), was isolated from the fecal samples of a black pig. It exhibited spherical, non-motile and non-spore-forming, Gram-positive cells. KD337-16(T) was identified as a member of the genus Micrococcus through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and its closest relatives were found to be Micrococcus endophyticus YIM 56238(T) (99.5% similarity), Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665(T) (99.1%), Micrococcus yunnanensis YIM 65004(T) (99.1%), Micrococcus aloeverae AE-6(T) (99.1%), Micrococcus antarcticus T2(T) (98.9%), and Micrococcus flavus LW4(T) (98.7%). Phylogenomic trees were constructed, and strain KD337-16(T) was found to form its own cluster as an independent lineage of M. flavus LW4(T). Between KD337-16(T) and its close relatives, the average nucleotide identity, average amino acid identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization were below the respective species delineation thresholds at 82.1-86.6%, 78.1-86.1%, and 24.4-34.9%. The major cellular fatty acids and polar lipids were anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-15:0, and DPG and PG, respectively. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-2). Taken together, the results indicate that strain KD337-16(T) is a novel species of the genus Micrococcus, for which the name Micrococcus porci sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KD337-16(T) (=BCRC 81318(T) = NBRC 115578(T)).

AB  - Simple Summary The study of transposable elements, which are repeated DNA sequences that can insert into new locations in genomes, is of particular interest to genome evolution, as they are sources of mutations but also of new regulatory and coding sequences. Teleost fish are a species-rich clade presenting a high diversity of transposable elements, both quantitatively and qualitatively, making them a very attractive group to investigate the evolution of mobile sequences. We studied Harbinger-like DNA transposons, which are widespread from plants to vertebrates but absent from mammalian genomes. These elements code for both a transposase and a Myb-like protein. We observed high variability in the genomic composition of Harbinger-like sequences in teleost fish. While Harbinger transposons might have been present in a common ancestor of all the fish species studied, ISL2EU elements were possibly gained by horizontal transfer at the base of teleost fish. Transposase and Myb-like protein phylogenies of Harbinger transposons indicated unique origins of the association between both genes and suggests recombination was rare between transposon sublineages. Finally, we report one case of Harbinger horizontal transfer between divergent fish species and the transcriptional activity of both Harbinger and ISL2EU transposons in teleost fish. There was male-biased expression in the gonads of the medaka fish. Harbinger elements are DNA transposons that are widespread from plants to vertebrates but absent from mammalian genomes. Among vertebrates, teleost fish are the clade presenting not only the largest number of species but also the highest diversity of transposable elements, both quantitatively and qualitatively, making them a very attractive group to investigate the evolution of mobile sequences. We studied Harbinger DNA transposons and the distantly related ISL2EU elements in fish, focusing on representative teleost species compared to the spotted gar, the coelacanth, the elephant shark and the amphioxus. We observed high variability in the genomic composition of Harbinger-like sequences in teleost fish, as they covered 0.002-0.14% of the genome, when present. While Harbinger transposons might have been present in a common ancestor of all the fish species studied here, with secondary loss in elephant shark, our results suggests that ISL2EU elements were gained by horizontal transfer at the base of teleost fish 200-300 million years ago, and that there was secondary loss in a common ancestor of pufferfishes and stickleback. Harbinger transposons code for a transposase and a Myb-like protein. We reconstructed and compared molecular phylogenies of both proteins to get insights into the evolution of Harbinger transposons in fish. Transposase and Myb-like protein phylogenies showed global congruent evolution, indicating unique origin of the association between both genes and suggesting rare recombination between transposon sublineages. Finally, we report one case of Harbinger horizontal transfer between divergent fish species and the transcriptional activity of both Harbinger and ISL2EU transposons in teleost fish. There was male-biased expression in the gonads of the medaka fish.

AB  - High-fat diet (HFD) consumption has been related to metabolic alterations, such as obesity and cardiovascular problems, and has pronounced effects on brain plasticity and memor y impairment. HFD exposure has a pro-inflammatory effect associated with microglial cel l modifications in the hippocampus, a region involved in the working memory process. Immune tolerance can protect from inflammation in peripher y induced by HFD consumption, when the immune response is desensitized in development period with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, maybe this previously state can change the course of the diseases associated to HFDs but is not known i f can protect the hippocampus's inflammatory response. In the present study, male mice were injected with LPS (100 mu g.kg-1 body weight ) on postnatal day 3 and fed with HFD for 16 weeks after weaning. Ours results indicated that postnatal exposure to LPS in the early postnatal developmental stage combined with H F D con-sumption prevented glycemia, insulin, HOMA-IR, microglial process, and increased pro-inflammator y cytokines mRNA expression, without changes in body weight gain and spatial working memor y with respect vehicle + HFD group.

AB  - Soil acidification in tea plantations leads to an excessive heavy metal content in tea, decreasing its yield and quality. How to apply shellfish and organic fertilizers to improve soil and ensure the safe production of tea is still not clear. A two-year field experiment was conducted in tea plantations in which the soil was characterized by a pH of 4.16 and concentrations of lead (Pb) (85.28 mg/kg) and cadmium (Cd) (0.43 mg/kg) exceeding the standard. We used shellfish amendments (750, 1500, 2250 kg/ha) and organic fertilizers (3750, 7500 kg/ha) to amend the soils. The experimental results showed that compared with the treatment without any amendment (CK), the soil pH increased by 0.46 on average; the soil available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents increased by 21.68%, 19.01%, and 17.51% respectively; and the soil available Pb, Cd, Cr, and As contents decreased by 24.64%, 24.36%, 20.83%, and 26.39%, respectively. In comparison to CK, the average yield of tea also increased by 90.94 kg/ha; tea polyphenols, free amino acids, caffeine, and water extract increased by 9.17%, 15.71%, 7.54%, and 5.27%, respectively; and the contents of Pb, Cd, As, and Cr in the tea decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 29.44-61.38%, 21.43-61.38%, 10.43-25.22%, and 10.00-33.33%, respectively. The greatest effects on all parameters occurred with the largest amendment of both shellfish (2250 kg/ha) and organic fertilizer (7500 kg/ha) combined. This finding suggests that the optimized amendment of shellfish could be used as a technical measure to improve the health quality of both soil and tea in acidified tea plantations in the future.

AB  - Sulla is a tanniferous legume species largely used as fresh or preserved forage in the ruminants' diets. Due to its content in polyphenols with antioxidant activity, especially condensed tannins (CT), fresh sulla forage (FSF), when eaten by ruminants, is able to enrich animal products with antioxidant molecules and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that are beneficial for consumers' health. Dehydration represents a valid alternative to haymaking to preserve these properties also in periods when FSF is unavailable. In this research, the effects of ewes' diets based on sulla hay (SH), pelleted dehydrated sulla forage (DSF) or FSF were evaluated on cheese physico-chemical traits, including fatty acid (FA) profile, vitamins A and E, polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability. The individual daily milk from 10 first lambing (FL) and 10 third lambing (TL) Valle del Belice ewes at about 60 days in milk, divided homogeneously into 5 groups fed different diets in a partial 5 x 2 Latin square design with 2 phases, and the bulk milk of farming ewes fed only on natural pasture, were used in 2 sessions of micro cheese-making to manufacture cheeses, sampled at 48 h of ripening. The experimental diets were: SHL = SH ad libitum; DSF2 = 2 kg/day DSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF2 = 2 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF4 = 4 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSFL = FSF ad libitum. Concentrate was supplied at the amount of 0.8 or 1.2 kg/day per head for FL and TL, respectively. Cheese health properties greatly improved with FSFL diet, based on the exclusive use of fresh forage, that induced the increase in the content of molecules with antioxidant activity, as vitamin A, vitamin E and polyphenols, enhancing the oxidative stability, and the level of PUFA as rumenic acid (C18:2 c9t11) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3). Cheeses from the DSF2 group showed levels of vitamin A, vitamin E and PUFA higher than SHL cheeses and comparable to those of FSF4 cheeses, whereas their ALA content was not different from that of FSFL cheeses. Evaluating those molecules affected by the level of fresh forage in the diet for their ability to trace the animals' feeding regime, ALA and its ratio with linoleic acid (LA, C18:2n-6) (LA/ALA) exhibited an effective role as biomarker in discriminating cheese from animals fed fresh forage-based diets. The results showed how dehydrated sulla pellets, as an alternative to hay in periods of limited availability of fresh forage, can preserve the nutritional and health properties of dairy products with regards to their antioxidant capacity and FA profile.

AB  - Despite the international ban on the trade of rhino horn that has been in place since 1977, persistent demand for horn in Asia has driven a spike in poaching over the past decade. This has embroiled the conservation community in a debate over the efficacy of banning trade relative to other solutions. Proposals for trade to be legalized and supplied through the dehorning of live rhinos or the production of synthetic horn are contentious. The need for empirical research into the potential impacts of legalization on demand was made more urgent in 2018 when China publicized its intentions to reopen its domestic trade and permit the use of rhino horn in medical treatment. In this study, we interviewed 84 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the Chinese province of Guangdong. While 58 (69.05%, n = 84) of our interviewees were in favor of trade legalization, only 32 (38.10%, n = 84) thought it likely that trade legalization would cause them to increase their prescription of rhino horn over current levels. This is probably because clinical cases in which rhino horn is medically appropriate are uncommon. We also found that 33 (39.29%, n = 84) practitioners were open to using synthetic horn for patient treatment, which has implications for the viability of synthetic horn as a conservation tool. This research contributes empirical insight to advance the discourse on rhino horn trade policy.

AB  - BackgroundPostoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a severe postoperative neurological sequela in elderly patients, and there is currently no standard treatment for POCD. In this study, whether recombinant human heat shock protein 70 (rHsp70) could alleviate sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in aged mice is investigated. MethodsTo determine the prophylactic effect of rHsp70 in sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction, aged mice were pretreated with different concentrations of rHsp70 (29.4, 58.8, and 117.6 mu g/kg; intranasal injected; N = 12) every day for 1 week; then, 3% sevoflurane was utilized to anesthetize the aged mice. Cognitive function, neurotoxicity, and serum and hippocampal Hsp70 levels in aged mice undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia were assessed by the Morris water maze test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of rHsp70 on inflammatory response were assessed by proinflammatory cytokine production and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation assays. ResultsWe found that aged mice exposed to sevoflurane showed reduced learning and memory ability and reduced Hsp70 expression, which were both restored by rHsp70 pretreatment. RHsp70 also reversed sevoflurane-induced up-regulated Bax and Bcl-2 expression and interleukin-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 overproduction. Finally, rHsp70 pretreatment suppressed sevoflurane-induced NF-kappa B activation. Our study indicated that rHsp70 was sufficient to suppress sevoflurane-induced cognitive decline and neurotoxicity. ConclusionOur important finding warrants further study on the clinical application of rHsp70 in elderly patients undergoing anesthesia.

AB  - Gray blight disease stands as one of the most destructive ailments affecting tea plants, causing significant damage and productivity losses. However, the dynamic roles of defense genes during the infection of gray blight disease remain largely unclear, particularly concerning their distinct responses in resistant and susceptible cultivars. In the pursuit of understanding the molecular interactions associated with gray blight disease in tea plants, a transcriptome analysis unveiled that 10,524, 17,863, and 15,178 genes exhibited differential expression in the resistant tea cultivar (Yingshuang), while 14,891, 14,733, and 12,184 genes showed differential expression in the susceptible tea cultivar (Longjing 43) at 8, 24, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi), respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighted that the most up-regulated genes were mainly involved in secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome pathways. Furthermore, plant hormone signal transduction and flavonoid biosynthesis were specifically expressed in resistant and susceptible tea cultivars, respectively. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tea plant immunity against gray blight disease.

AB  - IntroductionDepression is a prevalent and significant psychological consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, exacerbates the neurological damage associated with TBI. This study investigates whether nicorandil, a potassium channel opener with nitrate-like properties known for its antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, can mitigate depression-like behaviors following TBI by modulating ferroptosis.MethodsA controlled cortical impact (CCI) device was used to establish the TBI model. Depression-like behaviors in rats were assessed using the sucrose preference test (SPT), the tail suspension test (TST), and the forced swimming test (FST). The antioxidant system, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis levels were evaluated. The SLC7A11/GPX4 axis was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.ResultsNicorandil administration significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors in rats with TBI. Nicorandil administration also effectively restored the antioxidant system, substantially reduced lipid peroxidation, and attenuated ferroptosis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI. Mechanistically, nicorandil administration promoted the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI. Crucially, knockdown of hippocampal SLC7A11 abrogated the protective effects of nicorandil on depression-like behaviors, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI.ConclusionThese findings indicate that nicorandil ameliorates depression-like behaviors following TBI by inhibiting hippocampal ferroptosis through the activation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.

AB  - Simple Summary Large litters have resulted in a surplus of piglets, and there is therefore a need for alternative management tools. Currently, nurse sows (i.e., sows rearing surplus piglets) are the primary solution; however, this means that the sows are contained for a longer period. In addition, a larger proportion of small piglets are born with special needs i.e., extra warmth, energy, etc. This makes it important to investigate alternatives to normal rearing practices in order to ensure piglet welfare to decrease mortality and morbidity in the farrowing unit, as well as in the weaner unit to assure the optimal welfare in pig production. The study showed that piglets could be artificially reared without detrimental effects on the immune system and growth; however, there is a need for further research on optimizing the nutrient composition for artificially reared piglets and the subsequent consequences at weaning. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in growth, hematology, metabolism, small intestine (SI) morphology, and enzyme activity of sow-reared piglets (SOW) compared to artificially reared piglets (MILK) given milk replacers in two different environments. Thirty-six piglets were selected at birth based on their birth weight; eighteen were kept on a commercial farm, another eighteen transferred to an animal research facility for artificial rearing. Differences were observed in enzymatic activity, with a larger amount of sucrase in the SOW compared with MILK group across the SI. SOW piglets also had a body composition with a larger amount of fat, muscle, and bone mass content. Differences in hematology were observed, suggesting environmental influences, biochemistry differences reflective of the diets given, and finally, an increased dry matter (DM) intake in SOW piglets was estimated. No differences were observed in immune function and only small differences in the gut integrity were found between the two groups. It can be concluded that body composition and enzyme activity can be manipulated through dietary intervention and that an increase in DM during lactation is beneficial for gut function. The study warrants further investigation into what this means for the subsequent weaning period.

AB  - Protease inhibitors promote herbivore resistance in diverse plant species. Although many inducible protease inhibitors have been identified, there are limited reports available on the biological relevance and molecular basis of constitutive protease inhibitors in herbivore resistance. Here, we identified a serine protease inhibitor, CsSERPIN1, from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Expression of CsSERPIN1 was not strongly affected by the assessed biotic and abiotic stresses. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that CsSERPIN1 strongly inhibited the activities of digestive protease activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Transient or heterologous expression of CsSERPIN1 significantly reduced herbivory by two destructive herbivores, the tea geometrid and fall armyworm, in tea and Arabidopsis plants, respectively. The expression of CsSERPIN1 in Arabidopsis did not negatively influence the growth of the plants under the measured parameters. Our findings suggest that CsSERPIN1 can inactivate gut digestive proteases and suppress the growth and development of herbivores, making it a promising candidate for pest prevention in agriculture.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate whether there were differences in viability of cryopreserved semen when using two different freezing (Minitube Cryoguard - F1 or Androstar (R) CryoPlus - F2) and thawing (Minitube Cryoguard Thawing solution - T1 or Androstar (R) Plus - T2) extenders. Ejaculates were collected, diluted (1:1), and cooled before shipping at 17 degrees C overnight. Samples were aliquoted in cryopreservation extender F1 or F2. Four straws from each treatment sample were thawed and diluted in T1 or T2, resulting in four treatments (F1-T1, F1-T2, F2-T1, and F2T2). The sperm in diluted semen were evaluated for motility kinetics at 30, 180, and 360 min after thawing. The integrity assessments of the plasma and acrosomal membranes were performed at 30 and 360 min after thawing. There was no interaction between F x T x Time (P > 0.05), and no interaction between F x T (P > 0.05). The sperm progressive motility (PMOT) as time postthawing increased was greater (P = 0.015) when dilutions occurred using F1 compared with F2 extender. Sperm thawed in T1 had a greater TMOT (P = 0.008) and PMOT (P = 0.033) at all times evaluated. The sperm plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity (AIMI) were greater (P = 0.009) when samples were preserved in F1 compared to F2 extender. The use of T2, as compared with T1 thawing extender, resulted in an enhanced integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes (P = 0.008). It is concluded different combinations of commercial freezing extenders and thawing solutions have effects on the quality of cryopreserved boar semen in vitro.

AB  - The proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs) affect follicle development and reproductive disorders, with microRNAs playing a crucial regulatory role. Previous studies have shown the differential expression of miR-128-3p at different stages of goat follicle development, which suggests its potential regulatory role in follicle development. In this study, through the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, the EDU assay, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and the dual-luciferase reporter assay, we used immortal human ovarian granulosa tumor cell line (KGN) cells as materials to investigate the effects of miR-128-3p and its predicted target gene growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) on GC proliferation and apoptosis. The results show that overexpression of miR-128-3p inhibited the proliferation of KGN cells, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) while promoting that of Bcl-2 associated X protein (BAX). The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-128-3p bound to the 3 ' untranslated region sequence of GHSR, which resulted in the inhibited expression of GHSR protein. Investigation of the effects of GHSR on GC proliferation and apoptosis revealed that GHSR overexpression promoted the expression of PCNA and BCL2, enhanced GC proliferation, and inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas the opposite effects were observed when GHSR expression was inhibited. In addition, miR-128-3p and GHSR can influence the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein. In conclusion, miR-128-3p inhibits KGN cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of the GHSR gene.

AB  - Surveys show public misperceptions and confusion about brain damage and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Fictional movies have misrepresented ECT to suggest brain damage and to ridicule mental illness and psychiatric patients. "Brain damage" has become a colloquial expression without consistent meaning. In contrast, brain injury is the medical term for destruction of brain cells, such as from kinetic impact (concussion), hypoxia, or infection. Studies of both high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and enzyme assays find that causes of brain injury are accompanied by observable structural changes on MRI and elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of brain enzymes that leak from injured brain cells. Concussion is also followed by intracerebral bleeding, progressive brain atrophy, diffuse axonal injury, cranial nerve injury, and 2-4 fold increased risk for dementia. In contrast, there is no evidence that ECT produces any of these. Studies of ECT patients find no brain edema, structural change persisting 6 months, or elevated levels of leaked brain enzymes. Statistical comparisons between brain injury and ECT effects indicate no similarity (P < 0.00000001). Moreover, the kinetic, thermal, and electrical effects of ECT are far below levels that could possibly cause harm. This robust evidence shows that there is no basis to claim that ECT causes brain injury.

AB  - Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) is one of the drugs commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, its neurological side effects, particularly on cognition, are not fully understood. The present study focused on memory in rats treated with four weeks of LDX injection. We compared LDX-treated rats with control ones, using several methods to evaluate the behavioral responses and electrophysiological, molecular, and histological properties in the hippocampus. Our findings demonstrated that subchronic administration of LDX impaired behavioral performance in all memory assessment tests (Y maze, Morris Water Maze, and Shuttle box). Although LDX did not alter population spike (PS) amplitude, it increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope of evoked potentials of LTP components. Also, in addition to an increase in expression of caspase-3 in the hippocampus, which indicates the susceptibility to apoptosis in LDX-treated rats, the number of microglia and astrocytes went up significantly in the LDX group. Moreover, Sholl ' s analysis showed an increase in the soma size and total process length in both hippocampal astrocytes and microglia. Overall, because of these destructive effects of LDX on the hippocampus, which is one of the critical memory -related areas of the brain, the findings of this investigation provide evidence to show the disruption of memory -related variables following the LDX. However, more research is needed to clarify it.

AB  - Astrocytes' organisation affects the functioning and the fine morphology of the brain, both in physiological and pathological contexts. Although many aspects of their role have been characterised, their complex functions remain, to a certain extent, unclear with respect to their contribution to brain cell communication. Here, we studied the effects of nanotopography and microconfinement on primary hippocampal rat astrocytes. For this purpose, we fabricated nanostructured zirconia surfaces as homogenous substrates and as micrometric patterns, the latter produced by a combination of an additive nanofabrication and micropatterning technique. These engineered substrates reproduce both nanotopographical features and microscale geometries that astrocytes encounter in their natural environment, such as basement membrane topography, as well as blood vessels and axonal fibre topology. The impact of restrictive adhesion manifests in the modulation of several cellular properties of single cells (morphological and actin cytoskeletal changes) and the network organisation and functioning. Calcium wave signalling was observed only in astrocytes grown in confined geometries, with an activity enhancement in cells forming elongated agglomerates with dimensions typical of blood vessels or axon fibres. Our results suggest that calcium oscillation and wave propagation are closely related to astrocytic morphology and actin cytoskeleton organisation.

AB  - Uterine homeostasis is maintained after mating by eliminating pathogens, foreign cells, and proteins by a transient inflammation of the uterus. Such inflammation does not occur in the oviductal sperm reservoir (utero-tubal junction, UTJ), colonized by a population of potentially fertile spermatozoa before the inflammatory changes are triggered. Semen entry (spermatozoa and/or seminal plasma) modifies the expression of regulatory genes, including cell proliferation and differentiation-related transcripts. Considering pigs display a fractionated ejaculation, this study aims to determine whether different ejaculate fractions differentially modulate cell proliferation and differentiation-related transcripts in the sow reproductive tract during the peri-ovulatory stage. Using species-specific microarray analyses, the differential expression of 144 cell proliferation and differentiation-related transcripts was studied in specific segments: cervix (Cvx), distal and proximal uterus (DistUt, ProxUt), UTJ, isthmus (Isth), ampulla (Amp), and infundibulum (Inf) of the peri-ovulatory sow reproductive tract in response to semen and/or seminal plasma cervical deposition. Most mRNA expression changes were induced by mating. In addition, while mating upregulates the fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1, p-value DistUt = 0.0007; ProxUt = 0.0253) transcript in the endometrium, both its receptor, the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1, p-value DistUt = 2.14 e(-06); ProxUt = 0.0027; UTJ = 0.0458) transcript, and a potentiator of its biological effect, the fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP1), were downregulated in the endometrium (p-value DistUt = 0.0068; ProxUt = 0.0011) and the UTJ (p-value UTJ = 0.0191). The FGFBP1 was downregulated in the whole oviduct after seminal depositions (p-value Isth = 0.0007; Amp = 0.0007; Inf = 6.87 e(-05)) and, interestingly, FGFR1 was downregulated in the endometrium in the absence of semen (p-value DistUt = 0.0097; ProxUt = 0.0456). In conclusion, the findings suggest that spermatozoa, seminal components, and the act of mating trigger, besides inflammation, differential mechanisms in the peri-ovulatory female reproductive tract, relevant for tissue repair.

AB  - Acupuncture has a good effect on improving neurological function after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, but there are few studies on the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture from the perspective of ion channel cellular electrophysiology. Studies have shown that the over activation of large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel (BKCa? after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion can reduce the excitability of neurons and induce apoptosis. This study intends to establish middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model, with acupuncture at GV26 as the intervention measure, using patch-clamp technique to record the electrophysiological changes of BKCa channel. The results showed that the neurological function score of MCAO/R rats was significantly decreased, and the conductance, open dwell time and open probability of BKCa channel in hippocampal CA1 neurons of MCAO/R rats were significantly increased. Acupuncture at GV26 could significantly improve the neurological function scores of MCAO/R rats, and reduce the conductance, open dwell time, and open probability of BKCa channel. The effect of acupuncture at GV26 was significantly better than acupuncture at non-acupuncture point. The neuroprotective effect of acupuncture at GV26 after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion may be related to regulating the electrophysiological characteristics of BKCa channel opening.

AB  - This study bridges the knowledge gap pertaining to the pathways of heavy metal accumulation and migration within the industrial chain of large-scale cattle farms. Two such farms in Shaanxi serve as a basis for our exploration into Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, As, and Cd dynamics. Employing material flow analysis complemented by predictive models, we evaluate the potential ecological risks of arable soil from heavy metal influx via manure application. Our findings indicate that Zn and Cu predominate the heavy metal export from these operations, composing up to 60.00%-95.67% of their total content. Predictive models based on 2021 data reveal a potential increase in Cd soil concentration by 0.08 mg/kg by 2035, insinuating a reduced safe usage period for cattle manure at less than 50 years. Conversely, projections from 2022 data point towards a gradual Cu rise in soil, reaching risk threshold levels after 126 years. These outcomes inform limitations in cattle manure utilisation strategies, underscoring Cu and Cd content as key barriers. The study underscores the criticality of continuous heavy metal surveillance within farm by products to ensure environmental protection and sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Simple Summary Our results suggest that increased methionine consumption by growing- finishing pigs leads to improvement of performance and carcass quality. Moreover, supplementation with OH-methionine improved the loin depth. Taken together, our findings indicate that it might be necessary to update the recommendations for methionine for growing-finishing pigs raised under tropical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of DL-Methionine (DL-Met) or OH-Methionine (OH-Met) when supplemented beyond the usually accepted requirements in sulfur amino acids (SAA) on the performance and carcass traits of growing-finishing pigs. Two hundred mixed sex pigs were distributed in a randomized block (body weight and sex), under a 2 x 2 factorial design with two methionine sources, DL-methionine, or OH-Methionine and two methionine doses (100% SAA or 120% of the SAA level present in the control). Diets were formulated to meet amino acids recommendations of the Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine (2017), except for SAA, which varied with the methionine doses. Daily feed intake, daily weight gain, and feed conversion were evaluated. Moreover, the carcasses were measured electronically for fat thickness (FT), longissimus dorsi muscle depth (LD), and lean meat (%). During the growing phase II (92 till 122 days of age), daily feed intake (p < 0.001) and daily weight gain (p < 0.05) increased with the high SAA levels. High SAA levels also provided greater daily weight gain during the entire period of the trial (0.90 versus 0.86 kg; p < 0.05) No significant interaction was observed between the methionine source and the SAA level for any carcass traits. However, animals that received OH-Met had greater (p < 0.05) loin depth (58.37 versus 55.21 mm) and those that received higher doses of methionine presented heavier (p < 0.05) carcass weight (78.16 versus 74.70 kg), and more (p < 0.05) lean meat weight (43.69 versus 41.90 kg). Taken together, these results demonstrated that supplementation of high sulfur amino acids levels under hot conditions provided heavier carcasses and more lean meat.

AB  - Simple Summary The main aim of the present study was to assess the effects of acidification (pH 6.5 vs. pH 8.0) under two salinity conditions (brackish water-BW vs. seawater-SW) on the development and fitness (oxidative stress) of early developing seahorses (Hippocampus reidi). The growth of juveniles reared in BW was impaired at pH 6.5, and the levels of superoxide dismutase and DT-diaphorase, as well as the oxidative stress index, increased compared to SW juveniles. However, survival and growth at pH 6.5 decreased in the former. These results suggest higher overall performance and optimal fitness in juveniles reared in seawater under acidic conditions (pH = 6.5). Water acidification affects aquatic species, both in natural environmental conditions and in ex situ rearing production systems. The chronic effects of acidic conditions (pH 6.5 vs. pH 8.0) in seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are not well known, especially when coupled with salinity interaction. This study investigated the implications of pH on the growth and oxidative stress in the seahorse Hippocampus reidi (Ginsburg, 1933), one of the most important seahorse species in the ornamental trade. Two trials were carried out in juveniles (0-21 and 21-50 DAR-days after the male's pouch release) reared under acid (6.5) and control (8.0) pH, both in brackish water (BW-salinity 11) and seawater (SW-salinity 33). In the first trial (0-21 DAR), there was no effect of pH on the growth of seahorses reared in SW, but the survival rate was higher for juveniles raised in SW at pH 6.5. However, the growth and survival of juveniles reared in BW were impaired at pH 6.5. Compared to SW conditions, the levels of superoxide dismutase and DT-diaphorase, as well as the oxidative stress index, increased for juveniles reared in BW. In the second trial, seahorse juveniles were reared in SW at pH 8.0, and subsequently kept for four weeks (from 21 to 50 DAR) at pH 6.5 and 8.0. The final survival rates and condition index were similar in both treatments. However, the growth under acidic conditions was higher than at pH 8.0. In conclusion, this study highlights that survival, growth, and oxidative status condition was enhanced in seahorse juveniles reared in SW under acidic conditions (pH = 6.5). The concurrent conditions of acidic pH (6.5) and BW should be avoided due to harmful effects on the fitness and development of seahorse juveniles.

AB  - Degeneration of cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) leads to irreversible sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), as SGNs lack regenerative capacity. Although cochlear glial cells (GCs) have some neuronal differentiation potential, their specific identities remain unclear. This study identifies a distinct subpopulation, Frizzled10 positive (FZD10+) cells, as an important type of GC responsible for neuronal differentiation in mouse cochlea. FZD10 + cells can differentiate into various SGN subtypes in vivo, adhering to natural proportions. Wnt signaling enhances the ability of FZD10 + cells to function as neural progenitors and increases the neuronal excitability of the FZD10-derived neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis characterizes FZD10-derived differentiating cell populations, while crosstalk network analysis identifies multiple signaling pathways and target genes influenced by Wnt signaling that contribute to the function of FZD10 + cells as neural progenitors. Pseudotime analysis maps the differentiation trajectory from proliferated GCs to differentiating neurons. Further experiments indicate that glypican 6 (GPC6) may regulate this neuronal lineage, while GPC6 deficiency diminishes the effects of Wnt signaling on FZD10-derived neuronal differentiation and synapse formation. These findings suggest the critical role of Wnt signaling in the neuronal differentiation derived from cochlear FZD10 + cells and provide insights into the mechanisms potentially involved in this process.

AB  - Conifers have evolved sophisticated terpenoid defenses for protection against herbivores and pathogens. Pinus massoniana Lamb. is the most widely distributed pioneer afforestation and resin tree species in China, but is seriously harmed by pine wilt disease. Monochamus alternatus is the main vector of pine wilt disease in China. Monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, the main secondary defensive compounds of P. massoniana, are catalyzed by different terpene synthases (TPSs), which participate in the important defense pathways against external biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we aimed to identify the terpene synthases (TPSs) in P. massoniana, responding to the feeding of M. alternatus, and to characterize the functions and products of the mono-TPSs. We identified six differentially expressed TPS genes in the P. massoniana fed upon by M. alternatus, including four mono-TPS and two sesqui-TPS genes. The functions of the four mono-TPSs were verified by analysis of the main product and by-products of these mono-TPSs. (+)-alpha-Pinene, (-)-alpha-pinene, and limonene were the major products of TPS (+)-alpha-pinene, TPS (-)-alpha-pinene, and TPS limonene, respectively, but TPS (-)-beta-pinene only catalyzed a trace amount of (-)-beta-pinene in the products. Our findings shed light on the potential relationships between the structure of terpene synthases and their corresponding products.

AB  - Before the start of vermicomposting, the large quantity of organic waste generated in the zoo was sold to the public at the rate of Rs. 500 per truck amount Rs. 9500 annually. However, the large profusion of waste was frequently left within the zoo premises imparting an ugly and unhygienic environment for the zoo. To make the park more attractive, self-sustained (sold high-quality vermicompost) and keep premises clean, a vermicomposting process was set up on a pilot basis. Vermicomposting of organic waste could have dual beneficial effects by generating an economically viable animal feed protein in the form of worm biomass while alleviating the negative effects of poor organic waste management. The aim of the study was the management of different organic wastes generated in the zoo by using exotic worms and makes the premises financially-self dependent. The most dung-producing animals in the zoo are herbivores and droppings of exotic birds are also included, on average below 200 kg or more waste is collected every week in the zoo. Analysis of different physico-chemical properties of zoo vermicompost showed vermidegraded organic waste is a nutrient rich and eco-friendly approach. Data were analyzed by using mean +/- error.

AB  - The aim of this study was to exploit detailed analyses of GPS-recorded tracks to better characterise the impact of hippocampal (HF) lesion on spatial memory and perception in the context of homing pigeon navigation when reliant on familiar landscape features near the home loft following repeated releases from the same three locations. As reported previously, following HF lesion, a low spatio-temporal resolution analysis revealed that homing pigeons fly less direct paths home once near the loft. We now further show that 1) HF-lesioned pigeons are less likely to display fidelity to a particular flight path home when released from the same locations multiple times, 2) intact pigeons are more likely to exploit leading-line landscape features, e.g., a road or the border of a woodlot, in developing flight-path fidelity and 3) even when flying a straight path HF-lesioned homing pigeons are more likely to display relatively rapid, oscillatory heading changes as if casting about for sensory, presumably visual information. The flight behaviour differences between the intact and HF-lesioned pigeons persisted across the four releases from the three locations, although the differences became smaller with increasing experience. Taken together, the GPS-track data offer a detailed characterisation of the effects of HF lesion on landscapebased, homing pigeon navigation, offering new insight into the role of the hippocampal formation in supporting memory-related, e.g., fidelity to a familiar route home, and perhaps perceptual-related, e.g., oscillating headings, navigational processes.

AB  - Tacrine, the first approved drug against Alzheimer's disease (AD), was withdrawn from clinical use due to serious adverse effects. The main concern was the human hepatotoxicity, stemming probably from the liver biotransformation and clinically manifested as hepatocellular necrosis, and lobular hepatitis. Concerning the biotransformation, 7-OH-tacrine metabolite is generally suspected of being a precursor of toxic quinone methide, which binds to intracellular -SH proteins and/or depletes intracellular glutathione, and by that probably causes the hepatotoxicity. However, to study these toxic effects, proper animal model is needed to monitor the interspecies differences of metabolism. To fully describe in vivo ADMET parameters of tacrine, five experimental pigs (Sus scrofa f. domestica), as the most physiologically human-like in vivo model showing similar tacrine biotransformation, were used. We studied tacrine and its metabolites ADMET characteristics after both acute i.g. single dose and chronic 42 days p.o daily dose administration of 200 mg of tacrine. Tacrine and its two major metabolites show Tmax in plasma of 360 min, so the absorption is much slower than in human (Tmax =120 min) and are primarily distributed to the gastro-intestinal tract and CNS. Furthermore, due to the lower activity of CYP1A2 in pigs, tacrine is biotransformed much less efficiently than in humans. This study showed that tacrine accumulates only in adipose tissue, and organ histology and plasma biochemistry assessment revealed no signs of hepatotoxicity even after chronic tacrine administration. Pigs are therefore an unsuitable human-like animal model for evaluating tacrine toxicity.

AB  - Stimulating skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) with amino acids improves their proliferation and differentiation, enhancing skeletal muscle mass, thereby increasing lean meat rate. This study explored lysine (Lys)'s effects on SMSCs and their protein profiles in Sunit sheep. SMSCs were successfully isolated, assessing their survival and proliferation after Lys stimulation at varying concentrations using the CCK-8 assay. Western blotting revealed Lys-induced changes in myogenic differentiation protein expression, while immunocytochemistry detected alpha-Actinin and Myostatin within the SMSCs. TMT proteomics identified differentially expressed proteins, which underwent functional and interaction analyses, with RT-qPCR validating the corresponding gene expression. This study revealed that 4 mmol/L of Lys significantly boosted SMSC proliferation. A 24 h stimulation with this concentration reduced Myostatin expression, and increased MYOD1 and alpha-Actinin levels in the SMSCs. A proteomic analysis identified 577 differentially expressed proteins, primarily associated with lipoblast differentiation and muscle development, as highlighted by the GO enrichment analysis. A pathway analysis further demonstrated these proteins' involvement in the autophagy-lysosome and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Lys enhances SMSC proliferation, differentiation, and adipogenesis in Sunit sheep, exhibiting antioxidant properties and supporting muscle stability and amino acid metabolism. It may also have anti-inflammatory, anti-pyroptotic, and proteolysis-inhibitory effects, offering insights into muscle growth mechanisms through amino acid supplementation in ruminants.

AB  - Extinction learning is central to behavioral therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but relapse poses a major challenge to this approach. Recent work has revealed a critical role for the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in the suppression of extinguished fear memories. Silencing the RE yields a relapse of extinguished fear (i.e., "circuit-induced relapse"). Considerable work suggests that RE may contribute to extinction by inhibiting the retrieval of hippocampal (HPC)-dependent fear memories. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether undermining the formation of contextual fear memories in the HPC would prevent circuit-induced relapse. Intra-hippocampal infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, prior to auditory fear conditioning eliminated contextual fear memory and prevented the subsequent relapse of extinguished fear to the auditory conditioned stimulus (CS). In a second experiment, we used an activity-dependent labeling system (AAV-cFos-tTA; AAV-TRE-hM3Dq-mCherry) to express excitatory DREADDs in HPC neurons during fear conditioning. Chemogenetic reactivation of these ensembles after extinction was sufficient to drive relapse of fear to the extinguished CS. Lastly, in a third experiment, we expressed excitatory DREADDs in HPC ensembles captured during extinction learning and found that chemogenetic reactivation of this ensemble was sufficient to inhibit circuit-induced relapse. These results reveal that HPC-dependent ensembles play a critical role in regulating the expression and relapse of extinguished fear.

AB  - Memories link elements across event boundaries, integrating overlapping content experienced at different times and places. Such memory representations are thought to rely on memory integration mechanisms. The present study used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalographic (EEG) data to elucidate the temporal dynamics of integrative encoding memory processes. Memory integration was investigated with the associative inference task. Participants learned overlapping paired associates, AB and BC pairs, comprising a word and a picture (a face or a bird) and were later tested on the AC inferred associations. MVPA was used to measure the online reactivation of previously learned AB memories while encoding overlapping but new BC events. Reliable AB reactivation was observed approximately 1500 ms after the onset of the BC event. Participants (n = 29) were divided into two groups according to their AC performance: high and low memory integration. Interestingly, while both groups showed comparable levels of AB reactivation, the reactivation effects were associated with different behavioral consequences. For participants in the high memory-integration group, reactivation was predictive of later AC performance, suggesting that an integrated ABC representation was formed during BC learning. Conversely, for participants in the low memory-integration group, the reactivation of AB was negatively correlated with BC performance, indicating that reactivation of overlapping memories impaired new learning. The present study extends previous literature by revealing the temporal dynamics of the integrative encoding mechanisms and by providing an account of inter-individual differences in the capacity to integrate memories across distinct episodes.

AB  - Background In 2009, Spanish farmers reported a novel weed, now identified as a relative of maize's ancestor, teosinte, in their maize fields. Introgression of the insect resistance transgene cry1Ab from genetically modified (GM) maize into populations of this weedy Spanish teosinte could endow it with additional defense mechanisms. The aims of this study were: (1) to test if hybridization between GM maize and weedy plants from Spain is possible; (2) to understand the relationship between transgene transcription activity, concentrations of the expected transgene product (Cry1Ab protein) and the bioactivity of the latter on target insect pests following transgene flow from GM maize into Spanish teosinte plants. Results We demonstrated that hybridization between GM maize and the weedy Spanish teosinte is possible, with no observable barrier to the formation of crop/weed hybrids when teosinte served as pollen donor. When GM maize plants were used as pollen donors, significant crossing incompatibility was observed: hybrid plants produced only few "normal" seeds. Nevertheless, viable F1 seeds from GM pollen crossed onto teosinte were indeed obtained. The cry1Ab transgene was stably expressed as mRNA in all crossings and backgrounds. Similarly, toxicity on neonate Ostrinia nubilalis, presumably due to Cry1Ab protein, was consistently expressed in teosinte hybrids, with mortality rates 95% or higher after only 4 days exposure, similar to rates on parental GM maize plants. Nevertheless, no strong correlations were observed between transgene transcription levels and Cry1Ab concentrations, nor between Cry1Ab concentrations and insect mortality rates across all of the different genetic backgrounds. Conclusions Our results establish fundamental parameters for environmental risk assessments in the European context: first, we show that crop/weed hybridization in fields where maize and teosinte exist sympatrically can lead to potentially catastrophic transfer of resistance traits into an already noxious weed; second, our results question the viability of using gene dosage to model and predict ecological performance in either the intended crop plant or the undesired teosinte weed. Significant questions remain that should be addressed in order to provide a scientific, sound approach to the management of this novel weed.

AB  - In this study, molecular analysis was used to show the possibility of transovarial and transstadial transmission of Borrelia valaisiana in Ixodes ricinus ticks in the natural biotopes of North-Western Russia. Female ticks collected in nature were fed on rabbits; larvae obtained from these females were fed on white mice. Eggs, female ticks after the egg deposition, larvae and nymphs of ticks after overwintering were studied for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. within the natural inserts. The identification of Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks was carried out using the PCR method with real-time hybridization-fluorescence detection. The genotyping was performed by sequencing fragments of the intergenic region rrf-rrl. Spirochetes of only one genospecies B. valaisiana, previously not detected in North-Western Russia, were identified in ticks I. ricinus. The isolates of B. burgdorferi were obtained by inoculation of the gut contents of ticks into a prepared nutrient medium BSK-H with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma, USA). The positive reaction for B. valaisiana was observed in six out of 13 I. ricinus females (46.2%), which were successfully fed and laid eggs. Of the six infected female ticks, four (66.7%) (30.8% of the total four out of 13) were able to transmit B. valaisiana to eggs and then to larvae. 50.0% of the infected female ticks (23.1% of the total number) could transmit B. valaisiana to nymphs. In addition, the overwintered larvae and nymphs did not retain B. valaisiana. The subsequent transmission can occur as a result of feeding the overwintered larvae and nymphs on the infected overwintered hosts.

AB  - The current context provides, worldwide, the need to identify solutions for the thermal efficiency of constructions, through sustainable and innovative methods and products. A viable solution is to produce thermal insulating products by carding-folding technology, using natural fibres and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) and polyester (rPES) waste, converted to fibres. This paper presents experimental results obtained after testing several thermal insulation composite products produced using a mix of sheep wool, cellulose, rPET and rPES fibres. The results of the research demonstrate the thermal insulation properties but, at the same time, identify the benefits of using such materials on the quality of the air in the interior space (the ability to adjust humidity and reduce the concentration of harmful substances). At the same time, the advantages of using sheep wool composite mattresses concerning their resistance to insect attack is demonstrated when compared with ordinary thermal insulation materials. Finally, sensitivity elements of these composites are observed in terms of sensitivity to mould, and to contact with water or soil, drawing future research directions in the development of this type of materials.

AB  - The lateral hypothalamus (LH) orexinergic neurons project to numerous brain regions implicated in pain perception, including the CA1 part of the hippocampal formation. Moreover, the roles of orexin receptors (OXRs) in the CA1 in anti-analgesic consequences of the LH chemical stimulation by carbachol, muscarinic receptor agonist, in acute pain have not been clarified. The current research showed OXRs antagonist administration's effect in the CA1 on analgesia elicited by the LH chemical stimulation in a tail-flick test as an acute model of pain. The control groups, including vehicle-control groups, were given intra-LH administration of saline (0.5 ILL), following intra-CA1 infusion of DMSO (12 %; 0.5 ILL), and carbachol-control groups were treated with carbachol (250 nM/0.5 ILL saline) into the LH following DMSO in the CA1. Treated groups received SB334867 (1, 3, 10, and 30 nM/0.5 ILL DMSO) or TCS OX2 29 (0.1, 1, 10, and 20 nM/0.5 ILL DMSO) as OX1R or OX2R antagonist, respectively, in the CA1 prior intra-LH administration of carbachol. After all injections, all rats underwent the tail-flick test over a 60-min time. Infusion of SB334867 or TCS OX2 29 in the CA1 impaired the analgesic consequences following chemical stimulation of the LH in acute pain. Meanwhile suppressive impact of the OX1R or OX2R antagonist on the analgesic impact of LH chemical stimulation was approximately identical. The current investigation provided a new document about the critical involvement of hippocampal orexinergic system in the modulatory role of the LH-CA1 path in pain perception.

AB  - The installation of green infrastructure (GI) is an effective approach to manage urban stormwater and combined sewer overflow (CSO) by restoring pre-development conditions in urban areas. Research on simulationoptimization techniques to aid with GI planning decision-making is expanding. However, due to high computational expense, the simulation-optimization methods are often based on design storm events, and it is unclear how much different rainfall scenarios (i.e., design storm events vs. long-term historical rainfall data) impact the optimal siting of GI. The Parallel Pareto Archived Dynamically Dimensioned Search (ParaPADDS) algorithm in a novel simulation-optimization tool OSTRICH-SWMM was used to leverage distributed computing resources. A case study was conducted to optimally site rainwater harvesting cisterns within 897 potential subcatchments throughout the City of Buffalo, New York. Seven design storm events with different return periods and rainfall durations and a one-month historical rainfall time series were considered. The results showed that the optimal solutions of siting cisterns using event-based scenarios, though less computationally expensive, may not perform well under continuous rainfall scenarios, suggesting design rainfall scenarios should be carefully considered for optimizing GI planning. The impact of rainfall scenarios was particularly significant in the middle region of the Pareto front of multi-objective optimization. Utilizing high-performance parallel computing, OSTRICH-SWMM is a promising tool to optimize GI at large spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Simple Summary Coronaviruses are serious pathogens for both humans and animals. The name corona was designated because of the crown-like spikes on their surface. Currently, seven coronaviruses have been identified, such as 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Sometimes, animal coronaviruses infect humans and evolve due to genetic mutations, interspecies transmission, host adaptations, and favorable conditions. The main objective of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity and predict the emergence of new variants with novel properties. It has been reported that the spike protein gene plays an important role in host cell attachment and entry into host cells. The S gene has the highest mutation/deletion and is the most utilized target for vaccine/antiviral development. In this work, we discussed the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, and recombination patterns of selected HCoVs with an emphasis on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. The findings of this study showed that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have significant sequence identities with the selected HCoVs. The phylogenetic and recombination results concluded that new variants may emerge in the future with novel properties that infect both humans and animals. This information will be helpful for global society to design and develop an effective vaccine and disease management strategy.Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are seriously associated with respiratory diseases in humans and animals. The first human pathogenic SARS-CoV emerged in 2002-2003. The second was MERS-CoV, reported from Jeddah, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in 2012, and the third one was SARS-CoV-2, identified from Wuhan City, China, in late December 2019. The HCoV-Spike (S) gene has the highest mutation/insertion/deletion rate and has been the most utilized target for vaccine/antiviral development. In this manuscript, we discuss the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and recombination patterns of selected HCoVs with emphasis on the S protein gene of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to elucidate the possible emergence of new variants/strains of coronavirus in the near future. The findings showed that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have significant sequence identity with the selected HCoVs. The phylogenetic tree analysis formed a separate cluster for each HCoV. The recombination pattern analysis showed that the HCoV-NL63-Japan was a probable recombinant. The HCoV-NL63-USA was identified as a major parent while the HCoV-NL63-Netherland was identified as a minor parent. The recombination breakpoints start in the viral genome at the 142 nucleotide position and end at the 1082 nucleotide position with a 99% CI and Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.05. The findings of this study provide insightful information about HCoV-S gene diversity, recombination, and evolutionary patterns. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the possible emergence of new strains/variants of HCoV is imminent.

AB  - The American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) is a small raptor that may be attracted to agroecosystems during both breeding and wintering seasons. In North America, American Kestrels from northern areas may migrate southward and overwinter in southern territories, co-occurring with resident kestrels in agroecosystems of Baja California, Mexico. We captured 56 adults during autumn and winter (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) in the southern part of the peninsula, and we evaluated the prevalence of ectoparasites on these kestrels. We found ectoparasites on 23.2% of individuals: 14.2% had lice, 1.7% cimicid bugs, and 7.1% hippoboscids flies. Lice included Degeeriella carruthi, Colpocephalum subzerafae, and Laemobothrion sp. Cimicid bugs found on one male were identified as Hesperocimex sp., a cimicid often recorded on birds that nest in cavities of the giant card & oacute;n cactus (Pachycereus pringlei). The prevalent louse fly was identified as the potentially pathogenic Icosta americana. All the parasites we recorded were the first records on American Kestrels in Mexico.

AB  - Molecular dynamics simulations are an attractive tool for understanding lipid/peptide self-assembly but can be plagued by inaccuracies when the system sizes are too small. The general guidance from self-assembly simulations of homogeneous micelles is that the total number of surfactants should be three to five times greater than the equilibrium aggregate number of surfactants per micelle. Herein, the heuristic is tested on the more complicated self-assembly of lipids and amphipathic peptides using the Cooke and Martini 3 coarse-grained models. Cooke model simulations with 50 to 1000 lipids and no peptide are dominated by finite-size effects, with usually one aggregate (micelle or nanodisc) containing most of the lipids forming at each system size. Approximately 200 systems of different peptide/lipid (P/L) ratios and sizes of up to 1000 lipids yield a "finite-size phase diagram" for peptide driven self-assembly, including a coexistence region of micelles and discs. Insights from the Cooke model are applied to the assembly of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and the ELK-neutral peptide using the Martini 3 model. Systems of 150, 450, and 900 lipids with P/L = 1/6.25 form mixtures of lipid-rich discs that agree in size with experiment and peptide-rich micelles. Only the 150-lipid system shows finite-size effects, which arise from the long-tailed distribution of aggregate sizes. The general rule of three to five times the equilibrium aggregate size remains a practical heuristic for the Cooke and Martini 3 systems investigated here.

AB  - The responsiveness of the basilar artery to intrinsic vasoactive substances is species-specific and can be a unique characteristic. We investigated the responsiveness of the bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) basilar artery to noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), angiotensin (Ang) II, bradykinin (BK), histamine (His), and acetylcholine (ACh). NA, 5-HT, Ang II, and BK induced contraction, whereas His and ACh induced relaxation, in a concentration-dependent manner. The NA cumulative concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in parallel with phentolamine (an alpha-antagonist). However, propranolol, a beta-antagonist, had no significant effect. The 5-HT curve was shifted to the right in parallel by ketanserin (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and methiothepin (a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist). Losartan (an AT(1) antagonist) shifted the Ang II curve to the right, whereas PD123319 (an AT(2) antagonist) had no significant effect. L-NA, indomethacin, and des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK (a B-1 antagonist) did not significantly affect BK-induced contractions. HOE140 (a B-2 antagonist) shifted the BK concentration-response curve to the right. The His curve was shifted to the right weakly by diphenhydramine (an H-1 antagonist) and strongly by cimetidine (a H-2 antagonist). ACh-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by L-NA, atropine, and pFHHSiD (a muscarinic M-3 antagonist), whereas pirenzepine and methoctramine (muscarinic M-1 and M-2 antagonists, respectively) showed no significant effects. At a resting vascular tone, L-NA-induced contraction and indomethacin induced relaxation. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic, 5-HT1, 5-HT2, AT(1), and B-2 receptors might be important in arterial contraction, whereas M-3 and H-2 (>H-1) receptors might modify these contractions, inducing relaxation.

AB  - Optimum trace mineral (TM) status in ruminants is essential for fertility and the survival of the offspring by preventing oxidative stress and improving immunity. The benefits of injectable TM (ITM) supplementation in the lead-up to high-demand periods, such as pregnancy and calving, have been demonstrated in cattle. However, scientific evidence of its benefits for sheep fertility and health is scarce. The objective of this field study was to evaluate the effect of an ITM supplement containing Cu, Se, Zn and Mn pre-joining and pre-lambing to ewes on conception rates, ewe and lamb survival and farm profitability. This study demonstrated that supplementing ewes using ITM before joining and lambing can improve lamb survival, weight at weaning and farm profitability. These results help to understand TM supplementation for animal health, performance and farm profitability beyond the treatment of clinical deficiencies.
   This study was conducted on five commercial farms across Victoria, Australia, between September 2018 and November 2019, where the TM status of ewes was within normal ranges before joining. Mix breed ewes (n = 1484) were randomly allocated to receive either nil treatment (Control) or two injections of an ITM product containing zinc (40 mg/mL), manganese (10 mg/mL), selenium (3 mg/mL), and copper (10 mg/mL); 0.2 mL per 10 kg BW (Multimin((R)) plus Copper for Sheep, Virbac (Australia) Pty Ltd., Milperra, NSW, Australia) 30 days before the start of joining and 30 days before the start of lambing. Approximately 90 days after joining, pregnancy status and conception rate were determined by ultrasound. The marking rate was determined approximately four weeks after the end of lambing, and lamb weights were determined at weaning (12 weeks after the end of lambing). In all farms, ITM treatment did not affect the conception rate. The average conception rate was 156 +/- 11.0% (p > 0.05). The marking rate of ITM ewes was 9% higher than control ewes (95% Confidence Interval 3-21%). Lambs born to ITM ewes were 2.31 kg heavier at weaning than lambs born to control ewes (p < 0.001). Although not significant, ewe mortality across farms was 1.3% lower in the ITM group than in the control group. On average, ewes treated with ITM pre-joining and pre-lambing produced more and heavier lambs that represent an extra AU$ 2338 per 100 ewes net benefit for the producer. These results help to understand strategic TM supplementation for animal health, performance and farm profitability beyond the treatment of clinical deficiencies.

AB  - Oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) FeCrAl alloys are an advanced cladding material that combines the hightemperature steam oxidation resistance of conventional wrought FeCrAl with the irradiation resistance and hightemperature strength of nanostructured ferritic alloys. In the present study, the effect of microstructure on the performance of the ODS FeCrAl alloy system in light-water reactor-accident scenarios is evaluated using a combination of experimentation and modeling. ODS FeCrAl alloy with nominal composition Fe-12Cr-6Al-0.3Zr0.3Y2O3 was produced into a thin-walled tube via high-precision tube rolling. A portion of the as-received (AR) tube was subjected to a full recrystallization heat treatment. Both variants were subjected to burst testing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Severe Accident Test Station. The recrystallized tube exhibited burst temperature margins 200 degrees C higher than that of C26M, whereas the AR tube only achieved burst properties comparable to the wrought FeCrAl alloy. The burst experiments were simulated in the BISON finite element code through the development of new viscoplastic material databases for each heat treatment condition, informed by high temperature tensile tests of tube specimens and existing literature data on creep mechanisms. Finally, an ODS FeCrAl burst criterion was obtained using simulated burst experiments across the entire range of test conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary The involvement of the oviductal epithelial cells and progesterone hormone on the sperm fertilizing ability was investigated here by using an in vitro fertilization (IVF) swine model. By using different techniques, we demonstrated that oviductal epithelial cells (OECs) pre-treated with progesterone (P4) at 100 ng/mL represent the ideal environment for sperm capacitation, inducing a positive effect on the sperm acquisition of the fertilizing ability. Moreover, treatment of OECs with P4 modifies OVGP1, SPP1 and DMBT1 gene transcription but does not interfere with important cytoskeleton structures or cell doubling time, thereby allowing the correct development and progression of important biochemical pathways and signal transduction processes. Mammalian spermatozoa are infertile immediately after ejaculation and need to undergo a functional modification, called capacitation, in order to acquire their fertilizing ability. Since oviductal epithelial cells (SOECs) and progesterone (P4) are two major modulators of capacitation, here we investigated their impact on sperm functionality by using an IVF swine model. To that, we treated SOECs with P4 at 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL before the coincubation with spermatozoa, thus finding that P4 at 100 ng/mL does not interfere with the cytoskeleton dynamics nor the cells' doubling time, but it promotes the sperm capacitation by increasing the number of spermatozoa per polyspermic oocyte (p < 0.05). Moreover, we found that SOECs pre-treatment with P4 100 ng/mL is able to promote an increase in the sperm fertilizing ability, without needing the hormone addition at the time of fertilization. Our results are probably due to the downregulation in the expression of OVGP1, SPP1 and DMBT1 genes, confirming an increase in the dynamism of our system compared to the classic IVF protocols. The results obtained are intended to contribute to the development of more physiological and efficient IVF systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, has developed resistance to almost all insecticides used for its control. The 'push-pull' method has been shown as an effective control strategy to address this resistance challenge of P. xylostella. The key focus of the strategy is the identification of attractive or repellent volatile components. The aim of this study was to identify attractive volatile compounds released from host plants. Identified compounds were applied in the biological control of this pest. RESULTS: Nine active compounds released into the headspace of seven cruciferous plant species were identified using gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Electroantennographic detection-active compounds included five green leaf volatiles (hexanal, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, and 1-penten-3-ol), three isothiocyanates (isopropyl isothiocyanate, allyl isothiocyanate, and butyl isothiocyanate), and nonanal. Except for nonanal, all the identified green leaf volatiles and isothiocyanates elicited strong electrophysiological and behavioral responses in P. xylostella. The strongest attractive compounds, trans-2-hexen-1-ol and isopropyl isothiocyanate, were further evaluated in oviposition and field-trapping assays. Results showed that they both lured female moths to lay eggs, and were highly attractive to P. xylostella adults in field, especially when used in combination with yellow and green sticky boards. However, a blend of the two compounds showed no synergistic effect, but rather an antagonistic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Green leaf volatiles and isothiocyanates were identified as key olfactory cues for host selection of P. xylostella. Trans-2- hexen-1-ol and isopropyl isothiocyanate were identified as candidate attractive compounds to serve in a 'push-pull' strategy for P. xylostella control. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary The successful introduction of gilts into breeding groups is a key component of overall productivity. Therefore, the development of estrus synchronization protocols that optimize labor and time would benefit pig production. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the estrus synchronization protocol using a single administration of estradiol cypionate on day 12 of the estrus cycle to mimic the maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs and thus prolong luteal function. Subsequently we treated gilts which displayed prolonged luteal function with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) to induce luteolysis and synchronize estrus. We also evaluated the effect of this protocol on fertility and ovarian function. We observed that a single administration of estradiol cypionate at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy was effective to induce prolonged luteal function, and treatment of these gilts with PGF2 alpha resulted in fertile estrus within a short period of time. Furthermore, no deleterious effects were observed on fertility, follicular development, uterine histoarchitecture, and ovarian function. Based in our results, a single administration of estradiol cypionate followed by PGF2 alpha injection was effective to synchronize estrus in gilts without deleterious effects of reproductive function. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using estrogen-induced prolonged luteal function followed by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) treatment to synchronize estrus in gilts. On day12 of the estrus cycle (D0 = first day of standing estrus), 52 gilts were assigned at random to two experimental groups: non-treated gilts (CON, n = 22), serving as controls, and prolonged luteal function group (CYP, n = 30), receiving a single treatment with 10 mg of estradiol cypionate intramuscularly Starting on day 12, blood samples were collected for estradiol and progesterone assays. Estrus detection started on day 17. Gilts from the CON group were inseminated at the onset of natural estrus. On day 28 CYP gilts were treated with PGF2 alpha to induce luteolysis and inseminated at the onset of estrus. Gilts were slaughtered 5 d after the last insemination. A single treatment with estradiol cypionate prolonged luteal function in 90% of treated gilts. The duration of the estrous cycle was longer (p < 0.0001) for CYP gilts compared to CON gilts. CYP gilts showed synchronized estrus 3.96 +/- 0.19 d after induction of luteolysis. The conception rate was similar (p = 0.10) for CON and CYP gilts. No difference was observed in the embryo recovery rate (p = 0.18) and total number of embryos per female (p = 0.06). The percentage of unfertilized oocytes, fragmented embryos and viable embryos was similar among females from CON and CYP groups (p > 0.05). The treatment of gilts with a single application of 10 mg of estradiol cypionate on day 12 of the estrous cycle was effective in prolonging luteal function and treatment with PGF2 alpha resulted in synchronized estrus. Additionally, the synchronization protocol had no deleterious effect on fertility and embryonic development.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors play important roles in embryonic stem cell (ESC) renewal and differentiation. Four TEAD transcription factors (Tead1, Tead2, Tead3 and Tead4) and their various splice variants have been discovered in mice, but the expression pattern of them during pluripo-tency state transition is unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of TEADs and their splice variants in mouse ESCs at different pluripotent/differentiating states and adult mouse tissues. Our results preliminarily revealed the diversity and heterogeneity of TEAD family, which is helpful for understanding their overlapping and distinctive functions. Furthermore, a novel splice variant of Tead1 was identified and named Tead1 isoform 4.

AB  - New, well-known and predicted life cycles for trematodes of the Haploporoidea (Haploporidae and Emprostiotrematidae) and three families of the Lepocreadioidea (Enenteridae, Gorgocephalidae, Gyliauchenidae) involve encystment of the metacercaria in the open (usually on vegetation) followed by ingestion by a range of herbivorous or detritivorous fishes. These life cycles appear among relatively highly derived plagiorchiidan trematodes in which three-host life cycles incorporating an animal second intermediate host are dominant. We hypothesise that the two-host life cycles in the Haploporoidea and Lepocreadioidea arose by secondary truncation of a three-host cycle; the second intermediate host was lost in favour of encystment in the open. Modification of a three-host life cycle effective for the infection of carnivores is consistent with the understanding that fishes arose as carnivores and that multiple lineages have secondarily become detritivores and herbivores. Four of the five trematode families involved infect fishes relating to multiple orders, suggesting a complex history of host-switching. In contrast, the Gorgocephalidae, the smallest of the families, has been found only in a single family, Kyphosidae. The timing of the evolutionary events leading to this putative life cycle truncation is yet to be deduced, but the rich developing understanding of the history of the fishes creates a strong template for future analysis.

AB  - PAHs and heavy metals are characteristic pollutants in urbanized coastal areas, especially those with industrial activity. Given this context and the ability of Macrocystis pyrifera to drift when detached and provide trophic subsidy in coastal systems, we analyzed the potential transfer of pollutants to the herbivore Tetrapygus niger, through diet, in an industrialized coastal zone in Central Chile (Caleta Horcon) and characterized the impacted zone using diverse polluted ecotoxicological indices. For this purpose, a culture experiment was conducted where M. pyrifera individuals from Algarrobo (control site) were cultivated in Caleta Horcon and then used as food for T. niger. The contents of both PAHs and heavy metal contents were subsequently determined in algal tissue and sea urchin gonads as well as in the seawater. The results show that algae cultivated in Caleta Horcon had higher concentrations of naphthalene (NAF) compared to those from a low industrial impact zone (Algarrobo) (2.5 and 1.8 mg kg(-1), respectively). The concentrations of Cu, As, and Cd were higher in Caleta Horcon than in Algarrobo in both M. pyrifera and T. niger. For all metals, including Pb, higher concentrations were present in T. niger than in M. pyrifera (between 5 and 798 times higher). Additionally, as indicated by the toxicological indices MPI (0.00804) and PLI (10.89), Caleta Horcon is highly contaminated with metals compared to Algarrobo (0.0006 and 0.015, respectively). Finally, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and trophic transfer factor (TTF) values were greater than one in most cases, with values in Caleta Horcon exceeding those in Algarrobo by one or two orders of magnitude. This study provides evidence that Caleta Horcon is a highly impacted zone (HIZ) compared to Algarrobo, in addition to evidence that the biomagnification of certain pollutants, including the possible responses to contaminants, are apparently not exclusively transferred to T. niger through diet.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hyperlipidemia as a major health issue has attracted much public attention. As a geographical indication product of China, Liupao tea (LPT) is a typical representative of traditional Chinese dark tea that has shown good potential in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. LPT has important medicinal value in hyperlipidemia prevention. However, the active ingredients and metabolic mechanisms by which LPT alleviates hyperlipidemia remain unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to systematically investigate the metabolic mechanisms and active ingredients of LPT extract in alleviating hyperlipidemia. Materials and methods: Firstly, we developed a mouse model of hyperlipidemia to study the pharmacodynamics of LPT. Subsequently, network pharmacology and molecular docking were performed to predict the potential key active ingredients and core targets of LPT against hyperlipidemia. LC-MS/MS was used to validate the identity of key active ingredients in LPT with chemical standards. Finally, the effect and metabolic mechanisms of LPT extract in alleviating hyperlipidemia were investigated by integrating metabolomic, lipidomic, and gut microbiome analyses. Results: Results showed that LPT extract effectively improved hyperlipidemia by suppressing weight gain, remedying dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, and reducing hepatic damage. Network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking suggested that four potential active ingredients and seven potential core targets were closely associated with roles for hyperlipidemia treatment. Ellagic acid, catechin, and naringenin were considered to be the key active ingredients of LPT alleviating hyperlipidemia. Additionally, LPT extract modulated the mRNA expression levels of Fxr , Cyp7a1 , Cyp8b1 , and Cyp27a1 associated with bile acid (BA) metabolism, mitigated the disturbances of BA and glycerophospholipid (GP) metabolism in hyperlipidemia mice. Combining fecal microbiota transplantation and correlation analysis, LPT extract effectively improved species diversity and abundance of gut microbiota, particularly the BA and GP metabolism -related gut microbiota, in the hyperlipidemia mice. Conclusions: LPT extract ameliorated hyperlipidemia by modulating GP and BA metabolism by regulating Lactobacillus and Dubosiella , thereby alleviating hyperlipidemia. Three active ingredients of LPT served as the key factors in exerting an improvement on hyperlipidemia. These findings provide new insights into the active ingredients and metabolic mechanisms of LPT in improving hyperlipidemia, suggesting that LPT can be used to prevent and therapeutic hyperlipidemia.

AB  - When feeding pregnant sows, optimal body condition at birth is sought to avoid the effects of a deviant nutritional condition on health and performance. Various feeding concepts exist but mainly have a restriction in quantity and renunciation of farm-grown forage in common. An ad libitum liquid feeding system based on farm-grown forage in combination with a sow sorting gate (according to body weight-using mechanical scales) was realized on a commercial swine farm. The sorting gate coordinated access to two feeding areas with rations based on whole plant wheat-silage (WPWS) differing in energy content. In this study with a total of 183 pregnant sows, effects of restrictive dry feeding (System I) were compared with ad libitum liquid feeding based on farm-grown forage (System II). Sows were monitored regarding body condition development during pregnancy by measuring body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), and back fat thickness (BFT) on different time points. Sow and piglet health (vaginal injuries of sows, rectal temperature during the peripartal period, vitality of newborn piglets) and performance data regarding litter characteristics were also recorded. Body condition development of the sows was absolutely comparable. Performance indicators and the course of birth were also similar but with significantly higher scores for piglet vitality in System II (p < 0.05). The tested concept offers opportunities for more animal welfare and sustainability but remains to be further investigated regarding the repertoire of possibly applied farm-grown forage and the effects of the concept in the transit phase of sows.

AB  - Simple Summary Drug delivery systems depending on nanotechnology have been recently created to improve biological activity of drugs including hormones. Nanoformulated drugs have different pharmacokinetic properties in biological systems compared to their conventional forms due to the acquired new physicochemical properties such as lesser size, high size-to-weight ratio, and different surface charges and shapes. These properties enable them to efficiently deliver into target sites coping with existing biological barriers. Ovsynch protocol, GPG, is one of the most important estrous synchronization protocols due to the possibility of applying timed insemination with this protocol. This protocol is commonly used in many farm animals, as it aids in herd management and eliminates the need for the detection of estrus. However, there are still some shortcomings that restrict the outcomes of this protocol, such as scattering ovulation time, short luteal phase and inadequate luteal function, and low conception rates. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate ovarian response, blood flow of the ovarian and luteal arteries, and hormonal profile of goats receiving either a standard Ovsynch protocol or an Ovsynch protocol delivered via a nanodelivery system with different dosages of hormones. The present study is the first one that poses the idea that the nanodelivery system for the Ovsynch protocol enables lower hormone dose administration and improves the results of the protocol by inducing tighter synchrony of ovulation and better luteal function of synchronized goats. Fifteen cyclic, multiparous goats were equally stratified and received the common Ovsynch protocol (GPG: intramuscular, IM, injection of 50 mg gonadorelin, followed by an IM injection of 125 mu g cloprostenol 7 days later, and a further IM injection of 50 mg gonadorelin 2 days later) or the Ovsynch protocol using nanofabricated hormones with the same dosages (NGPG) or half dosages (HNGPG) of each hormone. The ovarian structures and ovarian and luteal artery hemodynamic indices after each injection of the Ovsynch protocol using B-mode, color, and spectral Doppler scanning were monitored. Levels of blood serum progesterone (P-4), estradiol (E-2), and nitric oxide (NO) were determined. After the first gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) injection, the number of large follicles decreased (p = 0.02) in NGPG and HNGPG, compared with GPG. HNGPG resulted in larger corpus luteum (CL) diameters (p = 0.001), and improved ovarian and luteal blood flow, compared with GPG and NGPG. Both NGPG and HNGPG significantly increased E-2 and NO levels compared with GPG. HNGPG increased (p < 0.001) P-4 levels compared with GPG, whereas NGPG resulted in an intermediate value. After prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) injection, HNGPG had the largest diameter of CLs (p = 0.001) and significantly improved ovarian blood flow compared with GPG and NGPG. Both NGPG and HNGPG increased (p = 0.007) NO levels, compared with GPG. E-2 level was increased (p = 0.028) in HNGPG, compared with GPG, whereas NGPG resulted in an intermediate value. During the follicular phase, HNGPG increased (p = 0.043) the number of medium follicles, shortened (p = 0.04) the interval to ovulation, and increased (p < 0.001) ovarian artery blood flow and levels (p < 0.001) of blood serum P-4, E-2, and NO, compared with GPG and NGPG.
   During the luteal phase, the numbers of CLs were similar among different experimental groups, whereas the diameter of CLs, luteal blood flow, and levels of blood serum P-4 and NO increased (p < 0.001) in HNGPG, compared with GPG and NGPG. Conclusively, the nanodelivery system for the Ovsynch protocol could be recommended as a new strategy for improving estrous synchronization outcomes of goats while enabling lower hormone dose administration.

AB  - Simple Summary: Proper development of the fetal lung is vital to the survival and healthy growth of pigs after birth, but many factors can disturb the normal growth of the fetal pig lung. In the previous study, we found that the Hoxa1 mutation of g.50111251 G > TC resulted in the congestion and edema of fetal lungs, and all neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) piglets died of respiratory failure during the suckling period. The results of this study showed that supplementing all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to pregnant sows alleviated the dyspnea of neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) piglets by increasing the IFN-gamma concentration (p < 0.05), airspace area (p < 0.01) and pulmonary microvessel density (p < 0.01); increasing the expression of VEGFD (p < 0.01), PDGFD (p < 0.01), KDR (p < 0.01), ID1 (p < 0.01), and NEDD4 (p < 0.01); and decreasing the septal wall thickness (p < 0.01) and the expression of SFTPC (p < 0.01) and FOXO3 (p < 0.01). Neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) piglets were characterized by dyspnea owing to the Hoxa1 mutation, and maternal administration with ATRA alleviated the dyspnea of neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) piglets. The purpose of this experiment was to explore how maternal ATRA administration rescued the abnormal fetal lungs of Hoxa1(-/-) piglets. Samples of the lungs were collected from neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) and non-Hoxa1(-/-) piglets delivered by sows in the control group, and from neonatal Hoxa1(-/-) piglets born by sows administered with ATRA at 4 mg/kg body weight on dpc 12, 13, or 14, respectively. These were used for the analysis of ELISA, histological morphology, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry staining, and quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicate that the Hoxa1 mutation had adverse impacts on the development of the alveoli and pulmonary microvessels of Hoxa1(-/-) piglets. Maternal administration with ATRA at 4 mg/kg body weight on dpc 14 rescued the abnormal lung development of Hoxa1-/- piglets by increasing the IFN-gamma concentration (p < 0.05), airspace area (p < 0.01) and pulmonary microvessel density (p < 0.01); increasing the expression of VEGFD (p < 0.01), PDGFD (p < 0.01), KDR (p < 0.01), ID1 (p < 0.01), and NEDD4 (p < 0.01); and decreasing the septal wall thickness (p < 0.01) and the expression of SFTPC (p < 0.01) and FOXO3 (p < 0.01). Maternal administration with ATRA plays a vital role in rescuing the abnormal development of lung of Hoxa1(-/-) fetal piglets.

AB  - The methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) encodes an epigenetic transcriptional regulator implicated in neuronal plasticity. Loss-of-function mutations in this gene are the primary cause of Rett syndrome and, to a lesser degree, of other neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently, we demonstrated that both Mecp2 haploinsuficiency and mild early life stress decrease anxiety-like behaviours and neuronal activation in brain areas controlling these responses in adolescent female mice. Here, we extend this work to males by using Mecp2-null and wild type adolescent mice subjected to maternal separation and their non-stressed controls. We assessed their behavioural responses in a battery of anxiety-provoking tests. Upon exposure to an elevated plus maze in aversive conditions, we evaluated changes in c-FOS expression in stress- and anxiety-related brain regions. In addition, we assessed the impact of maternal separation in neuronal maturation using doublecortin and reelin as surrogate markers. Mutant males showed reduced motor abilities, increased activation of the olfactory bulbs, probably due to breathing abnormalities, and decreased activation of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, when compared to wild type mice. In addition, maternal separation increased the number of immature doublecortin-like neurons found in Mecp2-null animals. Moreover, this work shows for the first time that reelin is decreased in the mutant animals at the olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus, an effect also associated to maternal separation. Taken together, our results suggest that maternal separation exacerbates some phenotypical alterations associated with lack of MeCP2 in adolescent males.

AB  - Sex and age have distinct influences and roles in behavior and immune reactivity; yet, most studies use adult male rodents with little attention to middle age, a time associated with key physiological transitions in both sexes. Thus, this study investigated sex differences during middle age in behavior, immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and glucose regulation in C57BL/6 mice with GFP-tagged monocytes/microglia. Behaviorally, males performed better in tests of motor function (Open Field [OF], Grip Strength, Sticker Removal, Gait, and Pole tests) and displayed less depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors across multiple mood tests (OF, Elevated Zero Maze, Sucrose Preference, and Swim test). However, females performed better in tests of cognition (Barnes Maze and Novel Object Recognition). Following behavioral assessment, mice were given LPS to characterize sexdependent inflammagen responses. Females displayed greater sickness behavior in the OF, higher levels of peripheral cytokines, and subtle neuroinflammation in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. A separate middleaged cohort was used for glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity testing. Both sexes had excessive blood glucose rebound after insulin challenge, but displayed differences following glucose administration, where males had higher baseline glucose and females remained hyperglycemic. This study suggests that during middle-age male mice have better emotional regulation and motor function, but not cognitive ability than females. Further, males are less sensitive than females to the acute effects of LPS peripherally and centrally, but both sexes showed sexspecific impairments in blood glucose regulation. Overall, it appears that middle age is an important transition point with multiple sex differences, some of which are unique to this stage of life.

AB  - Simple Summary Flavours improve the sensory characteristics of the feed to increase voluntary intake of novel by-products and monotonous feeds, and improve feed efficiency, resulting in improved body weight gain. However, there is a scarcity of studies on the effect of flavour on the preference and feed efficiency in sheep raised in intensive farming systems post-weaning. Therefore, this study investigated the flavour preference in lambs and the effect of flavours on feed efficiency, sweet taste receptors and sodium-glucose linked transporter 1 gene expression in the small intestines. Eight lambs were offered 16 different commercial flavours in a grain mixture of rolled barley and ground corn to examine the preference. In the metabolic study, the lambs were randomly assigned to four treatments (sucram, capsicum, a mix containing sucram and capsicum at 1:1 ratio and no flavour for control) in a 4 x 2 cross-over design. The lambs showed a preference for capsicum, sucram and milky flavours, and disliked the liquid orange flavour. Flavours did not improve feed intake in the metabolic study, but capsicum increased the average daily weight gain per metabolic body weight. These findings indicate that flavours can be used to motivate feed acceptance and improve the weight gain in lambs. This study investigated the effect of dietary flavour supplements on the preference, feed efficiency and expression of the sweet taste receptor family 1 members 2 and 3 (T1R2 + T1R3), and sodium-glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT1) genes in the lambs' small intestines. Eight, five-month-old, Israeli crossbred Assaf lambs were offered 16 different non-nutritive commercial flavours in rolled barley and ground corn. Capsicum and sucram were the most preferred non-aroma flavours (p = 0.020), while milky (p < 0.001) was the most preferred powder-aroma flavour. For the metabolic and relative gene expression study, eight lambs were randomly assigned to either sucram, capsicum, a mix containing sucram and capsicum at 1:1 ratio or no flavour for control in a 4 x 2 cross-over design. The total collection of urine (females only), faeces and refusals was carried out, and T1R2, T1R3 and SGLT1 relative gene expression evaluated from the proximal jejunum biopsies. Flavour had no significant effect on the feed intake (p = 0.934), but capsicum increased the average daily weight gain per metabolic body weight (p = 0.049). The T1R3 gene was expressed highest in the mix treatment (1.7; p = 0.005). Collectively, our findings indicate that flavours can be used to motivate feed acceptance and improve the weight gain in lambs.

AB  - The nitrogen-stable isotopes of plants can be used to verify the source of fertilizers, but the fertilizer uptake patterns in tea (Camellia sinensis) plants are unclear. In this study, potted tea plants were treated with three types of organic fertilizers (OFs), urea, and a control. The tea leaves were sampled over seven months from the top, middle, and base of the plants and analyzed for the delta N-15 and nitrogen content, along with the corresponding soil samples. The top tea leaves treated with the rapeseed cake OF had the highest delta N-15 values (up to 6.6 parts per thousand), followed by the chicken manure, the cow manure, the control, and the urea fertilizer (6.5 parts per thousand, 4.1 parts per thousand, 2.2 parts per thousand, and 0.6 parts per thousand, respectively). The soil treated with cow manure had the highest delta N-15 values (6.0 parts per thousand), followed by the chicken manure, rapeseed cake, control, and urea fertilizer (4.8 parts per thousand, 4.0 parts per thousand, 2.5 parts per thousand, and 1.9 parts per thousand, respectively). The tea leaves fertilized with rapeseed cake showed only slight delta N-15 value changes in autumn but increased significantly in early spring and then decreased in late spring, consistent with the delivery of a slow-release fertilizer. Meanwhile, the delta N-15 values of the top, middle, and basal leaves from the tea plants treated with the rapeseed cake treatment were consistently higher in early spring and lower in autumn and late spring, respectively. The urea and control samples had lower tea leaf delta N-15 values than the rapeseed cake-treated tea and showed a generalized decrease in the tea leaf delta N-15 values over time. The results clarify the temporal nitrogen patterns and isotope compositions of tea leaves treated with different fertilizer types and ensure that the delta N-15 tea leaf values can be used to authenticate the organic fertilizer methods across different harvest periods and leaf locations. The present results based on a pot experiment require further exploration in open agricultural soils in terms of the various potential fertilizer effects on the different variations of nitrogen isotope ratios in tea plants.

AB  - Crude solvent extracts of traditional medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years in different region of the globe for the treatment of various diseases. In developing countries, traditional medicines are used as source of primary health care. Keeping in view the importance of Camellia sinensis L., present investigation was aimed to evaluate the phytochemical and pharmacological potential of different morphological parts of C. sinensis L. Successive extractions of all plant parts was performed with different solvents like, petroleum ether, acetone, ethanol and water. Phytochemical analysis of all extracts showed the presence of polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides and carbohydrates in all plant parts with varied strength. Phytochemical analysis showed comparatively high percentage yield of ethanolic extract of all plant parts, hence was employed for evaluating the antimicrobial potential against 11 Gram positive bacteria, 9 Gram negative bacteria, 2 yeasts, 2 dermatophytes and 7 saprophytes. The petroleum ether seed extract and methanolic leaf extract was evaluated for the comparative anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential using different parameters like licking -biting response, inflammation of hind paw and writhing effect. The results showed that different pharmacological activities were due to the presences of various phytochemicals like tannins, resin and flavonoids, observed maximally in ethanolic extract with minor quantity of alkaloids and glycosides. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of dried roots, stems, leaves and seeds provided a conclusive support to the above results. Anti-inflammatory effect was less significant (p < 0.05) in seed extract, while leaf extract displayed highly significant results both at low and high doses. Likewise, both seed and leaf showed significant analgesic effects. However, compared to seed extract which showed highly significant (p < 0.001) increase in concentration dependent manner, leaf extract displayed highly significant results even at low dose with better results at high dose compared with standard.

AB  - Objective: The causes and triggering factors of epilepsy are still unknown. The results of genome-wide association studies can be utilized for a phenome-wide association study using Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potential risk factors for epilepsy. Methods: This study utilizes two-sample MR analysis to investigate whether 316 phenotypes, including lifestyle, environmental factors, blood biomarker, and more, are causally associated with the occurrence of epilepsy. The primary analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) model, while complementary MR analysis methods (MR Egger, Wald ratio) were also employed. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results: There was no evidence of a statistically significant causal association between the examined phenotypes and epilepsy following Bonferroni correction (p < 1.58 x 10(-4)) or false discovery rate correction. The results of the MR analysis indicate that the frequency of tiredness or lethargy in the last 2 weeks (p = 0.042), blood uridine (p = 0.003), blood propionylcarnitine (p = 0.041), and free cholesterol (p = 0.044) are suggestive causal risks for epilepsy. Lifestyle choices, such as sleep duration and alcohol consumption, as well as biomarkers including steroid hormone levels, hippocampal volume, and amygdala volume were not identified as causal factors for developing epilepsy (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our study provides additional insights into the underlying causes of epilepsy, which will serve as evidence for the prevention and control of epilepsy. The associations observed in epidemiological studies may be partially attributed to shared biological factors or lifestyle confounders.

AB  - Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) that are enriched in adipose tissue with multilineage differentiation potential have become an important tool in therapeutic research and tissue engineering. Certain breeds of sheep exhibit a unique fat tail trait such that tail tissue accounts for approximately 10 % of body weight and can provide an excellent source of ADSCs. Here, we describe isolation of primary ADSCs from ovine embryonic fat tail tissues that displayed high self-renewal capacity, multilineage differentiation and excellent adipogenic ability. Through transcriptome analysis covering ADSCs differentiating into adipocytes, 37 transcription factors were involved in early transcriptional events that initiate a regulatory cascade of adipogenesis; the entire adipogenic activity consists of a reduction in proliferation ability and upregulation of genes related to lipid generation and energy metabolism, as well as several genes associated with myogenesis. Furthermore, Comparative transcriptome analysis across species (sheep, human, and mouse) revealed enhanced basal metabolic ability in differentiating ovine ADSCs, which may relate to the excellent adipogenic capability of these cells. We also identified a small evolutionarily conserved gene set, consisting of 21 and 22 genes exhibiting increased and decreased expression, respectively. Almost half (20) of these genes have not previously been reported to regulate adipogenesis in mammals. In this study, we identified important regulators that trigger ovine adipocyte differentiation, main biological pathways involved in adipogenesis as well as the evolutionarily conserved genes governing adipogenic process across species. Our study provides a novel excellent biomaterial and novel genes regulating adipogenesis for cellular transplantation therapy and investigations of fat metabolism.

AB  - Simple Summary Neonatal piglet viability is decreasing as a consequence of the selection for increasing numbers of piglets born per sow per year. Several strategies have been proposed to reduce neonatal mortality, which involve all aspects of swine production. Early management intervention has proven effective to reduce piglet mortality particularly in low-birth-weight piglets, although this practice, in some cases, increases production costs. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of body weight at birth and individual neonatal care provided to piglets on preweaning mortality, and the long-term effects on growth and carcass and meat characteristics. The results of this research showed that early neonatal care may be a useful practice to reduce mortality, especially in low-birth-weight piglets. Moreover, neonatal care could affect meat quality, fat content, and fatty acid profile, thus suggesting long-term effects on metabolism. Swine industries worldwide face a loss in profit due to high piglet mortality, particularly as a consequence of the marked increase in prolificity and low birth weight (BW) of piglets. This research studied the effect of BW and individual neonatal care provided to piglets on preweaning mortality, and the long-term effects on growth and carcass and meat characteristics. Litters from seventy-one crossbred sows (PIC 34) were included in the trial. Half of each litter did not receive any further management, and the remaining half received the pre-established management protocol of early assistance of neonatal care (NC). Along lactation, the low-BW piglets (weight equal to or less than 1.1 kg) showed a threefold higher mortality rate than piglets of higher weights (32 vs. 10%; p = 0.001), with mortality particularly concentrated within the first week after birth. No effect of NC treatment was observed on mortality ratio caused by crushing, but a significant effect was observed in low-BW piglets who died of starvation (p < 0.01). The effect of NC on growth is dependent on BW, and heavier piglets at birth benefit from NC treatment to a higher extent than low-BW piglets. Low-BW piglets showed a higher fatness (p = 0.003), lower lean cut yield (p = 0.002) in carcasses, and higher intramuscular fat (IMF) content (2.29% vs. 1.91%; p = 0.01) in meat. NC treatment increased the lean content in carcasses from low-BW piglets (p < 0.01). The monounsaturated fatty acids concentration was higher in lower-than-normal-BW piglets (48.1% vs. 47.1%; p = 0.002) and the opposite effect was observed for polyunsaturated fatty acids (13.6% vs. 15.7%; p = 0.002). NC treatment induced a higher concentration of n-7 fatty acids. In conclusion, NC treatment may be a useful practice to reduce mortality in low-BW piglets. Moreover, NC could affect carcass fatness and meat quality, thus suggesting a long-term effect on metabolism.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the outcomes of mutualistic interactions between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are context-dependent. In particular, the total number, density, and size of EFNs, as well as the abundance and identity of ants attending host plants, are considered as key factors determining the nature and strength of ant-EFN-bearing plant interaction. Although many previous studies have investigated context-dependency in ant-plant protection mutualisms mediated by EFNs, few have tested whether the protective behavior of ants varies among sympatric plant species. In this study, we performed a field experiment to investigate the predatory behavior of a dominant ant species (Camponotus crassus, Formicinae) among five EFN-bearing plant species growing in the Brazilian savanna. In particular, we studied the variation in the ant abundance, termite predation, and time spent to find termites of C. crassus among the plant species, and further analyzed whether this variation could be related to the extrafloral nectar volume and sugar concentration of each plant species. We found that abundance and termite predation of C. crassus markedly varied among plant species. Specifically, C. crassus ants were significantly more abundant, active, and protective in Qualea multiflora, the plant species that produced significantly higher volumes and sugar concentrations of nectar. Overall, our results suggest that variation in extrafloral nectar volume and sugar concentration can result in plant species specificity of defensive behavior of a dominant foliage-dwelling ant in the Brazilian savanna.

AB  - Given the need to boost food production while guaranteeing environmental sustainability, the black soldier fly (BSF) (Hermetia illucens (L.), Diptera: Stratiomyidae) is gaining traction worldwide as an alternative protein source. In Kenya, BSF production and its use as a feed component is an emerging business, but farmer awareness of the potential use of BSF in animal feed has received limited attention. This study examined the factors influencing farmer awareness of insect farming and its usefulness as ingredient in livestock feed from a gender perspective. The analysis employed a mixed-methods approach by combining binary logistic regression analysis using cross-sectional survey data from a sub-sample of 235 pig and poultry farmers and content analysis from in-depth phone interviews. The study was implemented in Kiambu County, Kenya. About 44% of the farmers were aware of the use of black soldier fly in the animal feed industry, of which 46.72% were female, and 41.59% were male. From the results, years of education, the number of chickens owned, and membership in agricultural groups significantly influenced male and female farmers' awareness. In addition, age and the number of pigs owned significantly influenced female farmers' awareness. The results suggest that these factors are important to consider when strategies are developed to create awareness of BSF farming. Lessons learned from this study will inform BSF dissemination strategies to better target potential men and women BSF producers, influence their decision-making ability and improve information flows between scientists and producers.

AB  - Simple Summary Toxocara vitulorum is a common parasitic nematode of cattle and buffalos, and represents a severe health threat and economic burden on both populations. Poor understanding the epidemiology, population genetics, and molecular ecology of this nematode negative affects the prevention and control of T. vitulorum, and the mitogenome can yield a foundation for studying these areas. Herein, the first whole mitogenome of T. vitulorum was sequenced and characterized with bioinformatic pipeline analyses. Comparative mitogenomics and phylogenies defined a novel sister-species relationship of T. vitulorum with the congeneric species in the Toxocaridae, and supported nad4 and nad6 genes as new genetic markers for phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of the Ascaridida species. These results should contribute to a better understanding of phylogenetic relationships of Toxocaridae species, and also provide the resource of markers for population genetics, systematics, and epidemiology of this bovine nematode. Toxocara vitulorum (Ascaridida: Nematoda) is one of the most common intestinal nematodes of cattle and buffalos and, therefore, represents a serious threat to their populations worldwide. Despite its significance in veterinary health the epidemiology, population genetics, and molecular ecology of this nematode remain poorly understood. The mitogenome can yield a foundation for studying these areas and assist in the surveillance and control of T. vitulorum. Herein, the first whole mitogenome of T. vitulorum was sequenced utilizing Illumina technology and characterized with bioinformatic pipeline analyses. The entire genome of T. vitulorum was 15,045 bp in length and contained 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). The gene arrangement (GA) of T. vitulorum was similar to those of other Toxocara species under GA3. The whole genome showed significant levels of AT and GC skew. Comparative mitogenomics including sequence identities, Ka/Ks, and sliding window analysis, indicated a purifying selection of 12 PCGs with cox1 and nad6 having the lowest and highest evolutionary rate, respectively. Whole amino acid sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supported a novel sister-species relationship of T. vitulorum with the congeneric species Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, and Toxocara malaysiensis in the family Toxocaridae. Further, 12 (PCGs) single gene-based phylogenies suggested that nad4 and nad6 genes shared same topological trees with that of the whole genome, suggesting that these genes were suitable as novel genetic markers for phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of Ascaridida species. This complete mitogenome of T. vitulorum refined phylogenetic relationships in Toxocaridae and provided the resource of markers for population genetics, systematics, and epidemiology of this bovine nematode.

AB  - Local government debt is the biggest "gray rhino" of China's economy and one of the most significant factors affecting the sustainability of economic growth. We use the macroeconomic data of China's real economy development level and local government debt from 2000 to 2020 to investigate the impact of local government debt on the real economy using the spatial Durbin model, focusing on the impact of the local government debt scale on the development of the real economy in jurisdictions and non-jurisdictions and the intermediation effect of finance under the geospatial correlation characteristics of economic development. The results show that the spatial correlation of the real economy between jurisdictions prevails and the correlation deepens over time. The scale of local government debt in China has exceeded a reasonable threshold, and the crowding-out effect of debt expansion on the real economy is obvious and not limited by jurisdictions, with significant spatial spillover effects. Financial marketization can effectively mitigate the crowding-out effect of local government debt on the real economy. These findings provide useful references for mapping the correlated development characteristics of local government debt and the real economy in China, effectively preventing local government debt risks and high leverage of the real economy and financial systemic risks, and providing effective insights for other countries to resolve government debt problems, prevent crises, and promote local economic development.

AB  - Microplastics (MP) are pervasive environmental pollutants with potential adverse effects on human health, particularly concerning neurotoxicity. This study investigates the accumulation and neurotoxic effects of MP in cerebral organoids and mouse brains. Utilizing in vitro cerebral organoids and in vivo mouse models, we examined the penetration of MP, revealing that smaller MP (50 nm) infiltrated deeper into the organoids compared to larger ones (100 nm). Exposure to 50 nm MP resulted in a significant reduction in organoid viability. Furthermore, total RNA sequencing indicated substantial alterations in neurotoxicity-related gene expression. In vivo, MP-treated mice exhibited notable DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus and cortex, alongside elevated levels of inflammatory markers and neurotoxic metabolites, such as kynurenine (KYN) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK). Our findings suggest that MP may promote neurotoxicity through the kynurenine pathway, leading to heightened levels of neurotoxic compounds like quinolinic acid. This research highlights the potential for MP to induce neuroinflammatory responses and disrupt normal brain function, underscoring the need for further investigation into the long-term effects of MP exposure on neurological health.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular beverage crops worldwide. As tea production is labor-intensive, riding-type tea plucking machines have been employed to improve harvest efficiency. High level of operating skills are essential to maneuver these machines. Improper operation may cause damage to tea plants and reduce the quality of harvested tea leaves. Besides harvest, monitoring the growth status of tea canopies is another essential task of tea plantation management. Monitoring conducted through conventional manual observation is time consuming. Therefore, this study attempted to solve these two issues by developing a system that guided an operator to steer a riding-type tea plucking machine in real-time and provided growth status of tea plants after each scouting trip. Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and image processing techniques were applied to develop the guiding subsystem. This study compared two FCNs, namely FCN-8 s and ENet. The results showed that ENet outperformed FCN-8 s in generating a guiding line for the operator. Statistical analysis indicated that, with the guiding subsystem, the deviation between the driving direction and tea row center was significantly reduced. The guiding subsystem also could detect obstacles on the tea row where it was operated on. When in operation, the riding-type tea plucking machine was used as a platform to collect images of tea canopies for tea plantation management. The monitoring subsystem provided a graphical user interface consisting of a route recording, a growth status map, a canopy image of tea plants, and growth status ratings of the tea plants. FCN-8 s performed better than ENet in quantifying the growth status of tea plants, with a mean IU of 0.964 and a mean accuracy of 0.989.

AB  - The current study investigated the positive effects of blueberry anthocyanin-rich extracts (BAE) on either peripheral or hippocampal antioxidant defensiveness and established the connection of the improved antioxidant status with the altered fatty acid species and gut microbiota profile. High-fat diet-induced oxidative stress in CS7BL/6 mice was attenuated by BAE administration, which was reflected by strengthened antioxidant enzymes, alleviated hepatic steatosis, and improved hippocampal neuronal status. Serum lipidomics analysis indicated that the fatty acid species were altered toward the elevated unsaturated/saturated ratio, along with phospholipid species toward enriched n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions. The modulated antioxidant pattern could be attributed to the increased bacteria diversity, stimulated probiotics (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers (Roseburia, Faecalibaculum, and Parabacteroides) improved by anthocyanins and their metabolites, which improved the colon environment, characterized by promoted SCFAs, restored colonic mucosa, and reorganized microbial structure. Thus, anthocyanin-rich dietary intervention is a promising approach for the defensiveness in human oxidative damage and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Signs and symptoms attributed to adverse reactions to foodstuffs (ARFS) need tools for research and evaluation in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate the most frequent self-reported signs and symptoms attributed to ARFS in Spanish adults, (b) to determine the prevalence of food-specific IgG(4) antibody reactions (AbRs), and (c) to investigate the association between self-reported ARFS symptomatology and food-specific IgG(4) AbRs. Food-specific IgG(4) AbRs against 57 common food and beverages (AESKUCARE-T2FA (R) in vitro point-of-care test kit, Aesku.Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) were determined in capillary blood samples of 205 volunteers living in the Region of Madrid (Spain). The most frequent self-reported signs and symptoms were related to skin (43%), digestive (41%), and nervous system (NS, 33%) problems. The prevalence of food-specific IgG(4) AbRs was cow's milk (73%), sheep's milk (70%), casein (66%), and goat's milk (56.10%). Positive IgG(4) AbRs against tomato had a profile consisting of 3/4 of skin problems, more than half of digestive, and 2/5 of NS self-reported signs and symptoms. In conclusion, at least 1/3 of the studied sample reported skin, digestive, and NS signs and symptoms. The most frequent food-specific IgG(4) AbRs were related to dairy. Skin problems were more frequent in positive tomato IgG(4) AbRs.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to prevent lamb distress during weaning and avoid the occurrence of oxidative stress leading to diminished production performance, health status, or product quality, feeds rich in polyphenols (anthocyanins) are increasingly used in ruminant feeding. In the present study, lambs were allocated into three groups, with 10 lambs per group. The feed mixture for the control group (C) contained yellow corn. Lambs in experimental group I were fed feed mixtures containing yellow corn replaced by red corn at 50% (RC50). In experimental group II, red corn fully replaced (100%) yellow corn (RC100) in the lambs' feed. The results of the present study indicate a positive effect of red corn rich in anthocyanins on the metabolic profile without any changes in the productive traits of lambs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of different proportions of red corn rich in anthocyanins on the diet of fattening lambs considering their productive traits, blood metabolic profile, and antioxidative status. The research was carried out with 30 Merinolandschaf lambs, 90 days old and weaned. The feed mixture for lambs (n = 10) of the control group contained yellow corn, while in the feed mixture of experimental group I (n = 10), yellow corn was replaced with red corn at 50% (RC50), and in experimental group II (n = 10), yellow corn was 100% replaced with red corn (RC100). An automatic three-part differential haematology analyser was used to determine haematological parameters in whole blood, and biochemical parameters were determined in blood serum using a biochemical analyser. A diet containing red corn did not affect productive traits or the majority of the examined parameters. However, higher blood haemoglobin content, increased aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase activity, and decreased glucose and non-esterified fatty acids concentrations were found in the serum of RC100 lambs. These results indicate a positive effect of red corn rich in anthocyanins on the metabolic profile without any changes in the productive traits of lambs.

AB  - The structure-function and materials paradigms drive research on the understanding of structures and structural heterogeneity of molecules and solids from materials science to structural biology. Functional insights into complex architectures are often gained from a suite of complementary physicochemical methods. In the context of biomacromolecular structures, the use of pulse dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) has become increasingly popular. The main interest in PDS is providing long-range nanometre distance distributions that allow for identifying macromolecular topologies, validating structural models and conformational transitions as well as docking of quaternary complexes. Most commonly, cysteines are introduced into protein structures by site-directed mutagenesis and modified site-specifically to a spin-labelled side-chain such as a stable nitroxide radical. In this contribution, we investigate labelling by four different commercial labelling agents that react through different sulfur-specific reactions. Further, the distance distributions obtained are between spin-bearing moieties and need to be related to the protein structure via modelling approaches. Here, we compare two different approaches to modelling these distributions for all four side-chains. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the optimum labelling procedure. All four spin-labels show differences in the ease of labelling and purification. Further challenges arise from the different tether lengths and rotamers of spin-labelled side-chains; both influence the modelling and translation into structures. Our comparison indicates that the spin-label with the shortest tether in the spin-labelled side-group, (bis-(2,2,5,5-Tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-1-oxyl-4-yl) disulfide, may be underappreciated and could increase the resolution of structural studies by PDS if labelling conditions are optimised accordingly.

AB  - This Statement on improving kangaroo management originates from the shared experience of many peak bodies and stakeholders that existing policy and practices related to kangaroo management cause perverse outcomes for animal welfare, conservation, productivity, waste, drought resilience, climate, and the health, culture and wellbeing of Australians. The Statement was developed in consultation with delegates from two kangaroo symposia in 2019, and broadened through contributions from other ecological, Aboriginal, animal welfare and conservation stakeholders who believe reform is necessary. Positive change across all these domains requires an empathetic, science-based collaborative and coordinated approach to improve management of kangaroos in Australia, which in turn requires building a broad social mandate for reform. This manuscript presents the drivers and definitions for the Statement and key references documenting the causes and recommended solutions for improving kangaroo management, including many of the papers in this volume. An extensive inventory of conservation, agricultural, animal welfare, indigenous and scientific organisations that have endorsed the Statement is provided. We aim to inform public opinions and drive necessary change to policy, attitude and actions to appropriately value, conserve and utilise kangaroos where there is a tendency for overpopulation. Recommendations include development of a National Kangaroo Strategy that includes discussion on whether overabundant kangaroos are a legitimate sustainable resource that should be managed as such rather than being largely wasted as the by-product of pest control to protect other industries or conservation landuses.

AB  - Zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly reported interrestrial and aquatic environments, but their inputs to agriculturallands are not fully understood. Here, we characterized PFAS in 47organic waste products (OWP) applied in agriculturalfields ofFrance, including historical and recent materials. Overall, 160 PFASfrom 42 classes were detected from target screening andhomologue-based nontarget screening. Target PFAS were low inagriculture-derived wastes such as pig slurry, poultry manure, ordairy cattle manure (median n-ary sumation 46PFAS: 0.66 mu g/kg dry matter).Higher PFAS levels were reported in urban and industrial wastes,paper mill sludge, sewage sludge, or residual household wastecomposts (median n-ary sumation 46PFAS: 220 mu g/kg). Historical municipal biosolids and composts (1976-1998) were dominated byperfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS),N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamido acetic acid (EtFOSAA), and cationic and zwitterionicelectrochemicalfluorination precursors to PFOS. Contemporaneous urban OWP (2009-2017) were rather dominated byzwitterionicfluorotelomers, which represented on average 55% of n-ary sumation 160PFAS (max: 97%). Thefluorotelomer sulfonamidopropylbetaines (X:2 FTSA-PrB, median: 110 mu g/kg, max: 1300 mu g/kg) were the emerging class with the highest occurrence and prevalencein contemporary urban OWP. They were also detected as early as 1985. The study informs for thefirst time that urban sludges andcomposts can be a significant repository of zwitterionic and cationic PFAS.

AB  - Endophytic fungi are generally found in plants as beneficial microbial flora, establishing a symbiotic relationship with them and enhancing their resistance and promoting growth. To study the effect of endophytic fungi on Camellia oleifera C. Abel. growth, four endophytic fungi strains were isolated from rhizomes of C. oleifera and co-cultured with C. oleifera seedlings individually in sterile soil for 49 days: Didymella sp. (DS), Fusarium sp. (FS), Penicillium sp. (PS), and Clonostachys rosea (CR). The experimental results showed that bioactivities of four fungal stains differed, but all exhibited the promotion of quercetin accumulation and reduction of quercetin glycosides after co-culture with C. oleifera seedlings. DS, FS and PS significantly increased the leaf area of C. oleifera, and all of the experimental groups were more than 50% heavier than the Control (CON). Our results demonstrate the prospective utility of endophytic fungi in C. oleifera production with the capacities to enhance productivity and accumulation of plant metabolism products.

AB  - Pigs are becoming more common research models due to their utility in studying neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's Disease. However, behavioral tasks often require a large apparatus and are not automated, which may disinterest researchers in using important functional measures. To address this, we developed a touchscreen that pigs could be trained on for behavioral testing. A rack-mounted touchscreen monitor was placed in an enclosed, weighted audio rack. A pellet dispenser was operated by a radio frequency transceiver to deliver fruit-flavored sugar pellets from across the testing room. Programs were custom written in Python and executed on a microcomputer. A behavioral shaping program was designed to train pigs to interact with the screen and setup responses for future tasks. Pigs rapidly learned to interact with the screen. To demonstrate efficacy in more complex behavior, two pigs were trained on a delay discounting tasks and two pigs on a color discrimination task. The device held up to repeated testing of large pigs and could be adjusted to the height of minipigs. The device can be easily recreated and constructed at a relatively low cost. Research topics ranging from brain injury to pharmacology to vision could benefit from behavioral tasks designed to specifically interrogate relevant function. More work will be needed to develop tests which are of specific relevance to these disciplines.

AB  - The perirhinal cortex (PER) receives multimodal and unimodal sensory information from all modalities. In addition, the PER is anatomically connected with several brain regions that support fear learning. Several studies suggest that the PER is involved in fear conditioning to discontinuous auditory cues but not to continuous auditory cues. To date, studies examining the role of the PER in fear conditioning has largely focused on auditory and contextual stimuli. The present study assessed whether the role of the PER in fear conditioning would extend to visual modalities. Rodents were randomly assigned to one of four conditioned stimuli, which consisted of either a tone or a light stimulus that was either continuous or discontinuous. Pre-training excitotoxic lesions to the PER significantly reduced freezing to auditory and visual cues during the acquisition phase regardless of stimulus continuity. During subsequent testing, perirhinal lesions produced significant decreases in freezing levels to both continuous and discontinuous tones but not to either of the light CS groups. These results suggest that the PER is involved in the acquisition of fear across multiple cue modalities. However, the PER may have a more limited role in the retrieval of the fear memory dependent upon the cue modality.

AB  - Plants possess a sophisticated hormone-signaling system, which includes salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to defend themselves from herbivores. In addition, this immune system is modulated by nonpathogenic microbes that live asymptomatically within intercellular spaces of host grasses. We investigated the resistance triggered by defense hormones, and that provided by endophyte Epichloe gansuensis against aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, and how the endophyte regulates this tripartite interaction. We detected that endophyte-induced plant tolerance to the aphid feeding and exogenous SA increased plant shoot biomass, root biomass, plant length, and chlorophyll content. Endophyte colonization induces the WRKY54 factor that overrides negative effects on plant growth and possibly suppresses SA accumulation. In addition, the endophyte promotes a level of JA that is antagonistic to the SA pathway. By disabling the SA mechanism for herbivore-mediated plant growth inhibition, the endophyte induces plant tolerance to herbivory.

AB  - The development of adolescent humans through child-pet interaction and attachment is the focus of the current study. The context is the Omani Bedouin culture, which is inseparably linked to camel culture. This culture promotes the importance of nurturing relationships between camels and their cameleers. We suggest that proximity to and contact with camels from an early age helps camel-owning Bedouin children to navigate their journey more smoothly from childhood to adulthood. The study is based on informal conversations, collected over 1 year, with Bedouin children and their parents who have all grown up with camels in Al Wahiba, a Bedouin people of the Sharqiyah, Oman. By analyzing such narratives, we aimed to demonstrate the depth of impact that this contact with camels has on the cognitive, emotional, and social development of Bedouin children. The data suggest that child cameleers experience emotional, social, and cognitive benefits from contact with and attachment to camels. The findings from the parents of these adolescents also suggest that the children demonstrate higher levels of cognitive and emotional maturity and seem to socialize and become integrated into the community more easily compared with their siblings who do not own camels. The novelty of the current study is that it sheds light on how the socio-cultural context embedded in the Bedouin culture affects the degree and nature of a child's attachment to a pet camel and how that affects development in adolescence. The research took an inclusive approach by including both human and nonhuman agents (camels) in the analysis, and we discuss the findings in a post-colonial context.

AB  - In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), repeated cycles of infection and inflammation eventually lead to fatal lung damage. Although diminished mucus clearance can be restored by highly effective CFTR modulator therapy, inflammation and infection often persist. To elucidate the role of the innate immune system in CF etiology, we investigated a CF pig model and compared these results with those for preschool children with CF. In newborn CF pigs, we observed changes in lung immune cell composition before the onset of infection that were dominated by increased monocyte infiltration, whereas neutrophil numbers remained constant. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic profiling revealed that the infiltrating myeloid cells displayed a more immature status. Cells with comparably immature transcriptomic profiles were enriched in the blood of CF pigs at birth as well as in preschool children with CF. This pattern coincided with decreased CD16 expression in the myeloid cells of both pigs and humans, which translated into lower phagocytic activity and reduced production of reactive oxygen species in both species. These results were indicative of a congenital, translationally conserved, and functionally relevant aberration of the immune system in CF. In newborn wild-type pigs, CFTR transcription in immune cells, including lung-derived and circulating monocytes, isolated from the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and blood was below the detection limits of highly sensitive assays, suggesting an indirect etiology of the observed effects. Our findings highlight the need for additional immunological treatments to target innate immune deficits in patients with CF.

AB  - In premature infants receiving parenteral nutrition, oxidative stress is a trigger for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is an important factor in the development of adult lung diseases. Neonatal vitamin C and glutathione deficiency is suspected to induce permanent modification of redox metabolism favoring the development of neonatal and adult lung diseases. A total of 64 3-day-old guinea pigs were fed an oral diet that was either complete or deficient in vitamin C (VCD), cysteine (CD) (glutathione-limiting substrate) or both (DD) for 4 days. At 1 week of age, half of the animals were sacrificed while the other started a complete diet until 12 weeks of age. At 1 week, the decrease in lung GSH in all deficient groups was partially explained by the oxidation of liver methionine-adenosyltransferase. mRNA levels of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), glutathione-reductase (Gsr) and glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) were significantly lower only in CD but not in DD. At 12 weeks, glutathione levels were increased in VCD and CD. Keap1, Gsr and Glrx mRNA were increased, while glutathione-reductase and glutaredoxin proteins were lower in CD, favoring a higher glutathionylation status. Both neonatal deficiencies result in a long-term change in glutathione metabolism that could contribute to lung diseases' development.

AB  - BackgroundSarcopenia and osteoporosis are common diseases that predominantly affect older individuals. The interaction between muscle and skeleton exerts pivotal roles in bone remodeling. This study aimed to explore the function of myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 in osteogenic differentiation and its potential mechanisms.MethodsExosomes were isolated from myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine target molecule expression. Osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alizarin red staining, ALP activity and levels of OCN, OPN, RUNX2, and BMP2. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP, and ChIP assays were performed to verify the interaction between molecules. The nuclear translocation of YAP1 was observed by immunofluorescence staining. In vivo osteoporotic model was established by ovariectomy in mice. Bone loss was examined using HE staining.ResultsPrrx2 expression was elevated in myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells and their exosomes. Myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Delivering exosomal Prrx2 directly bond to MIR22HG promoter and promoted its transcription and expression. MIR22HG enhanced expression and nuclear translocation of YAP via sponging miR-128, thus facilitating BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Knockdown of exosomal Prrx2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation, which could be abolished by MIR22HG overexpression. Similarly, miR-128 inhibitor or YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of MIR22HG depletion or miR-128 mimics on osteogenic differentiation. Finally, myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 alleviated osteoporosis in mice via up-regulating MIR22HG and activating the Hippo pathway.ConclusionMyoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 contributes to transcriptional activation of MIR22HG to activate YAP pathway via sponging miR-128, thereby facilitating osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

AB  - Variations in postmortem metabolism in muscle impact pork quality development. Curiously, some genetic lines are more refractile to adverse pork quality development than others and may regulate energy metabolism differently. The aim of this study was to challenge pork carcasses from different genetic populations with electrical stimulation (ES) to determine how postmortem metabolism varies with genetic line and explore control points that reside in glycolysis in dying muscle. Three genetic populations (GP) were subjected to ES (100 V or 200 V, 13 pulses, 2 s on/2 s off) at 15- or 25-min post-exsanguination, or no stimulation (NS). Genetic population affected relative muscle relative abundance of different myosin heavy chains, glycogen, G6P, and lactate concentrations. Genetic lines responded similarly to ES, but a comparison of ES treatment groups revealed a trend for an interaction between voltage, time of ES, and time postmortem. Higher voltage accelerated pH decline at 20 min up to 60 min postmortem. Trends in color and firmness scores and L* values were consistent with pH and metabolite data. These data show that genetic populations respond differently to postmortem perturbation by altering glycolytic flux and suggest differences in postmortem glycolysis may be partially responsible for differences in meat quality between genetic populations, though not entirely.

AB  - Tannins and essential oils are well recognised as antiherbivore compounds. We investigated the relative effectiveness of the polyphenol, tannin, and the essential oils, 1,8-cineole and pine oil, as feeding deterrents against western grey kangaroos. Both groups of secondary metabolites are naturally abundant in many Australian plants. These three metabolite groups were incorporated separately or together into standard pellets for presentation to kangaroos, and their behaviour (sequence of food choice and feeding time) and amounts consumed were observed. The control (with no secondary metabolites) was much preferred. There was a sharp reduction in the ingestion of pellets containing tannins, 1,8-cineole or pine oil. Combinations of the metabolites resulted in almost no consumption. In association with tannin, pellets containing either 1,8-cineole or pine oil were as effective deterrents as both combined. There was a strong correlation between time spent feeding on the different diets and the amount of food consumed, although the rate of intake was markedly slower when secondary metabolites were present. Behavioural observations showed that the amount of food ingested is initially guided by the presence/absence of essential oils, apparently detected by smell, and later by the presence/absence of tannins, by taste. Both groups of secondary metabolites work in concert by stimulating different senses that minimise herbivory by marsupials, such as the western grey kangaroo, and help to explain their abundance in the Australian flora.

AB  - All-female giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii has a significant growth limitation due to its early sexual maturity. A 60-day trial was carried out to determine the effect of beta-agonist, ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC), on the growth performance, body composition, and gonadal maturation of all-female prawns. Prawn juveniles (4.39 +/- 0.40 g initial weight) were stocked at 10 prawns/m(2) in 15 plastic tanks (1000 liters each) in a completely randomized design with four treatments and a control (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg) in triplicate. The significantly (p < 0.05) highest values of final weight, weight gain, daily weight gain, and specific growth rate (SGR) were observed in the female prawns fed with the diet containing 10 mg/kg RAC, while the lowest values were found in the control tank. Similarly, survival rate, feed conversion rate (FCR), and condition factors were observed among all treatments, which were significantly better than the control (0 mg/kg). Significantly greater yield and lower gonadosomatic index (GSI) values were obtained in prawns fed with a 10 mg/kg RAC-containing diet than in all other treatments, except for the diet containing 15 mg/kg RAC, while the lowest yield was produced by the control tank. A diet containing 10 mg/kg RAC had significantly improved the whole-body protein content in prawns, while diets containing 10 and 15 mg/kg RAC exhibited lower lipid content in prawns than in the other treatments. A significant increase in the number of Stage 1 (virgin) females (up to 54% at 10 mg/kg RAC diet) was found in all RAC treatments, while the control had a significantly higher number of females at various maturity stages, indicating that RAC administration effectively suppresses gonadal maturity. Residue analysis of whole prawn samples at the end of the trial indicated no trace of ractopamine. The quadratic regression analysis of weight gain, SGR, FCR, and yield revealed that the optimum dietary ractopamine level for all-female prawn culture should be between 10 and 15 mg/kg.

AB  - Featured Application The proposed automatic emotion recognition system has been deployed in the classroom environment (education) but it can be used anywhere to monitor the emotions of humans, i.e., health, banking, industries, social welfare etc. Emotions play a vital role in education. Technological advancement in computer vision using deep learning models has improved automatic emotion recognition. In this study, a real-time automatic emotion recognition system is developed incorporating novel salient facial features for classroom assessment using a deep learning model. The proposed novel facial features for each emotion are initially detected using HOG for face recognition, and automatic emotion recognition is then performed by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes real-time input from a camera deployed in the classroom. The proposed emotion recognition system will analyze the facial expressions of each student during learning. The selected emotional states are happiness, sadness, and fear along with the cognitive-emotional states of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and concentration. The selected emotional states are tested against selected variables gender, department, lecture time, seating positions, and the difficulty of a subject. The proposed system contributes to improve classroom learning.

AB  - Plants possess myriad defenses against their herbivores, including constitutive and inducible chemical compounds and regrowth strategies known as tolerance. Recent studies have shown that plant tolerance and resistance are positively associated given they are co-localized in the same molecular pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. However, given that both defensive strategies utilize carbon skeletons from a shared resource pool in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway there are likely costs in maintaining both resistance-tolerance strategies. Here we investigate fitness costs in maintaining both strategies by utilizing a double knockout of cyp79B2 and cyp79B3, key enzymes in the biosynthetic process of indole glucosinolates, which convert tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) and is further used to produce indole glucosinolates. These mutant plants are devoid of any indole glucosinolates thus reducing plant resistance. Results show that knocking out indole glucosinolate production and thus one of the resistance pathways leads to an approximate 94% increase in fitness compensation shifting the undercompensating wild-type Columbia-0 to an overcompensating genotype following damage. We discuss the potential mechanistic basis for the observed patterns.

AB  - Cognitive impairment resulting from insufficient sleep poses a significant public health concern, particularly in children. The effects and mechanisms of choline on cognitive impairment caused by sleep deprivation are unknown. Chronic sleep deprivation is induced in young mice in this study, followed by feeding diet containing 11.36 g/kg choline bitartrate. Choline supplementation significantly improves spatial learning ability. Functional MRI results reveal the hippocampus as a key region affected by sleep deprivation, where choline supplementation notably preserves hippocampal structural integrity and enhanced connectivity. Additionally, choline ameliorates hippocampal pathological injury, reduces blood-brain barrier permeability and serum brain injury biomarkers. Choline also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers, and mitigates microglial activation in the hippocampus, which preserves synaptic plasticity. A key finding is the changes of hippocampal phospholipidomic profile along with cognitive function, and a total of 313 phospholipid molecules are identified. Choline increases the levels of total phospholipid and sub-classes (particularly PC), which are strongly correlated with reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as improved cognitive outcomes. Furthermore, there are similar findings in some phospholipid molecules such as PC 36:1, PC O-33:0, PC p-38:3, PE 36:3, PE p-42:4 and PS 44:12. These findings highlight that choline alleviates cognitive impairment in sleep deprivation via reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as well as altering phospholipidomic profile.

AB  - Although mammoth ivory was claimed as a substitute to elephant ivory, there are several issues with the current methods to differentiate the two ivory, which provided a loophole to laundering and illegal trade. To contribute to developing efficient tools to distinguish ivory samples, we applied a relatively cheap and fast protocol using stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), hydrogen (delta H-2), nitrogen (delta N-15), oxygen (delta O-18), and sulfur (delta S-34). We compared the isotope ratios of the two ivory types and found statistically significant (p-value<0.01) differences in the Wilcoxon tests for delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 and delta S-34, but no significant difference for delta N-15. There was no overlap between delta H-2 and a small overlap for delta O-18, while delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 of most mammoth samples were within the larger isotopic range values of the elephant samples. The PCA also pointed to a higher contribution of delta H-2 (96.9%) followed by delta O-18 (2.7%) to differentiate the ivory types. Our results showed SIA as an efficient tool to distinguish elephant and mammoth ivory, and we recommend using a multi-elements SIA approach focusing on delta H-2 and delta O-18. While it is essential to address the social issues related to the ivory trade, including reducing human-elephant conflict and increasing financial support to Siberian carver communities, alternatives for natural ivory should also be sought, combined with strict policy changes to combat illegal trade and protect the African and Asian elephant populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The interest in amino acids comes from their involvement in research on alternative strategies for the utilization of antibiotics on farms. Among several substances used to replace antibiotics, there is arginine, an essential amino acid in newborns and piglets. This amino acid has a protective role in intestinal immune cells and improves intestinal immunity. The purpose of this research was to define a co-culture model, in which intestinal epithelial cells can communicate with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to deepen the effects of arginine deprivation on intestinal epithelial cells over time. The main finding was that the lack of arginine highly impacts on intestinal and immune cells by way of immuno-regulation mediated by the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The use of this experimental model could allow us to investigate the impact of and interactions between specific nutrients and the complex intestinal environment and, in addition, to assess feed additives to improve health and animal production. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid, supplementation with which induces a reduction of intestinal damage and an improvement of intestinal immunity in weaned piglets, but the mechanism is not yet entirely clear. The aim of this study was to characterise a co-culture model by measuring changes in gene expression over time (24 and 48 h) in intestinal IPEC-J2 cells in the presence of immune cells activated with phytohemagglutinin and, consequently, to assess the effectiveness of arginine deprivation or supplementation in modulating the expression of certain cytokines related to the regulation of intestinal cells' function. The main results show the crucial role of arginine in the viability/proliferation of intestinal cells evaluated by an MTT assay, and in the positive regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-8) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta) cytokines. This experimental model could be important for analysing and clarifying the role of nutritional conditions in intestinal immune cells' functionality and reactivity in pigs as well as the mechanisms of the intestinal defence system. Among the potential applications of our in vitro model of interaction between IEC and the immune system there is the possibility of studying the effect of feed additives to improve animal health and production.

AB  - Plants influence each other chemically by releasing leaf volatiles and root exudates, but whether and how these two phenomena interact remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that volatiles that are released by herbivore-attacked leaves trigger plant-soil feedbacks, resulting in increased performance of different plant species. We show that this phenomenon is due to green leaf volatiles that induce jasmonate-dependent systemic defence signalling in receiver plants, which results in the accumulation of beneficial soil bacteria in the rhizosphere. These soil bacteria then increase plant growth and enhance plant defences. In maize, a cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase, ZmCRK25, is required for this effect. In four successive year-field experiments, we demonstrate that this phenomenon can suppress leaf herbivore abundance and enhance maize growth and yield. Thus, volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions trigger plant-soil feedbacks that shape plant performance across different plant species through broadly conserved defence signalling mechanisms and changes in soil microbiota. This phenomenon expands the repertoire of biologically relevant plant-plant interactions in space and time and holds promise for the sustainable intensification of agriculture.

AB  - In the healthcare system, lower leg fractures remain relevant, incurring costs related to surgical treatment, hospitalization, and rehabilitation. The duration of treatment may vary depending on the individual case and its severity. Casting as a post-surgical fracture treatment is a common method in human and experimental veterinary medicine. Despite the high importance of sheep in preclinical testing materials for osteosynthesis, there is no standardised cast system ensuring proper stabilisation and functionality of hind limbs during the healing of tibia fractures or defects. Existing treatment approaches for tibial osteosynthesis in laboratory animal science include sling hanging, external fixators, or former Achilles tendon incision. These methods restrict animal movement for 4-6 weeks, limit species-typical behaviour, and impact social interactions. Our pilot study introduces a Standardised Walking Cast (SWC) for sheep, enabling immediate physiological movement post surgery. Seven Rhone sheep (female, 63.5 kg +/- 6.45 kg) each with a single tibia defect (6 mm mechanical drilled defect) underwent SWC application for 4 weeks after plate osteosynthesis. The animals bore weight on their operated leg from day one, exhibiting slight lameness (grade 1-2 out of 5). Individual step lengths showed good uniformity (average deviation: 0.89 cm). Group housing successfully started on day three after surgery. Weekly X-rays and cast changes ensured proper placement, depicting the healing process. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an SWC for up to 72 kg of body weight without sling hanging via ceiling mounting or external fixation techniques. Allowing species-typical movement and social behaviour can significantly improve the physiological behaviour of sheep in experiments, contributing to refinement.

TI  - Evaluation of Neurotoxicity in BALB/c Mice following Chronic Exposure to Polystyrene Microplastics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA  - English
KW  - HIPPOCAMPUS
AB  - BACKGROUND: The toxicity of microplastics (MPs) has attracted wide attention from researchers. Previous studies have indicated that MPs produce toxic effects on a variety of organs in aquatic organisms and mammals. However, the exact neurotoxicity of MPs in mammals is still unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to confirm the neurotoxicity of chronic exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) at environmental pollution concentrations. METHODS: In the present study, mice were provided drinking water containing 100 mu g/L and 1,000 mu g/L PS-MPs with diameters of 0.5, 4, and 10 mu m for 180 consecutive days. After the exposure period, the mice were anesthetized to gain brain tissues. The accumulation of PS-MPs in brain tissues, integrity of the blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and spine density were detected. We evaluated learning and memory ability by the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests.
   RESULTS: We observed the accumulation of PS-MPs with various particle diameters (0.5, 4, and 10 mu m) in the brains of exposed mice. Meanwhile. exposed mice also exhibited disruption of the blood-brain barrier, lower level of dendritic spine density, and an inflammatory response in the hippo- campus. In addition, exposed mice exhibited cognitive and memory deficits compared with control mice as determined using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests, respectively. There was a concentration-dependent trend, but no particle size-dependent differences were seen in the neurotoxicity of MPs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results suggested that PS-MPs exposure can lead to learning and memory dysfunctions and induce neurotoxic effects in mice, findings which have wide-ranging implications for the public regarding the potential risks of MPs.

AB  - Simple Summary Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on ancient Chinese medical principles. In China, these medicines have played a marked role in treating various diseases and maintaining human health for thousands of years. TCM is also increasingly considered a potential alternative to the use of antibiotics in pig production and has attracted a great deal of research interest because it is simple, convenient, cheap, and effective. However, there are few studies on the effects of dietary TCM supplementation on the gut microbiota and the apparent nutrient digestibility of weaned piglets. In our study, dietary Fructus mume and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi improved growth performance and increased the apparent ether extract (EE) digestibility by modulating gut microbial composition and structure, favoring the health of weaned piglets. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been demonstrated to exert a therapeutic effect on various diseases and has been used as a substitute for antibiotics in pig production. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and apparent nutrient digestibility when weaned piglet diets are supplemented with TCM. One hundred and sixty-two 25-day-old weaning piglets were housed in an environmentally controlled nursery facility and fed a basal diet (control group, n = 54) or a TCM complex (Fructus mume 1%, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi 3%) (TCM group, n = 54), or a fermented diet with a complex of these two TCMs (F-TCM group, n = 54). Compared with the control group, in the TCM and F-TCM groups, the average daily gain (ADG) increased (p < 0.05), the F:G ratio and diarrhea rate decreased (p < 0.05), and the apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM) and ether extract (EE) of weaned piglets increased (p < 0.05). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla, representing approximately 95% of all sequences. The abundance of four genera and 10 OTUs (belonging to Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Lachnoclostridium, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31 group, Prevotella_1) were negatively correlated with apparent EE digestibility (p < 0.05). The results suggest that weaned piglets fed with antibiotic-free diets supplemented with Fructus mume and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi gained more weight and were healthier. When added to the diet, the complex of these two TCMs may have a direct impact on apparent EE digestibility by modifying the gut microbial composition, which favors the health of weaned piglets.

AB  - BACKGROUND Essential oils (EOs) are extensively used in swine production because of their bioactive action in gut health. In addition, some EOs have the potential to reduce waste emission. The present study aimed to find an optimal combination of carvacrol, thymol and cinnamaldehyde to promote nitrogen utilization and reduce waste emission by a model in vitro and an animal study. RESULTS In the study in vitro, various dosages of essential oils (EOs) were used to evaluate the effect on nitrogen metabolism through a three-step model. Compared with other EO combinations, 2EO (10 ppm cinnamaldehyde and 20 ppm thymol), and 3EO (10 ppm cinnamaldehyde, 20 ppm thymol and 200 ppm carvacrol) displayed greater nitrogen digestibility, lesser ammonia production and lower activity of microbial enzymes. In the animal study, growing male Landrace x Yorkshire pigs (initial body weight: 31.8 +/- 3.3 kg, n = 18) were randomly divided into three groups and fed the control, 2EO or 3EO diet for 4 weeks. Pigs fed 3EO exhibited the greatest nitrogen digestibility (85.4%, P < 0.05). EO supplementation decreased the emission of ammonia (130-140 vs. 223 mg g(-1)) and total fecal nitrogen (8.0-9.9 vs. 12.4 g d(-1)) (P < 0.05). Microbial protease and urease activities were inhibited by EO treatments (P < 0.01). Both 2EO and 3EO reduced the content of indole and 3-methylindole (P < 0.01), whereas only 2EO caused a decrease in p-cresol (P < 0.1). CONCLUSION 2EO was suitable for reducing waste emission and odorous compounds in growing pigs, whereas 3EO was optimal for increasing nitrogen utilization and partially reducing waste odorous compounds.

AB  - Reproductive performance is a key factor in swine farming, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying critical reproductive traits remain poorly understood. This study utilized mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze protein expression profiles in pig placenta, categorizing samples by sow age, parity, and stillbirth incidence. A total of 8261 proteins were identified, with gene ontology analysis highlighting roles in proteolysis, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. Comparative analysis revealed 87 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between young and old sows, 115 DEPs between low and high parity sows, and 103 DEPs linked to stillbirth incidence. Notable proteins, such as laminin G2, methionine sulfoxide reductase B3, and FERM domain-containing 7, were significantly correlated with reproductive traits. Integrative analysis identified YEATS domain-containing 4 as a consistently downregulated protein across all traits, while nephrocystin 1 was linked to low birth weight and stillbirth incidence. Functional enrichment analysis underscored the role of cytoskeletal proteins and transporters in placental nutrient exchange and fetal development. This study expands the understanding of pig placental proteomics and identifies potential biomarkers for improving sow reproductive performance. Future studies will focus on validating these findings and translating them into practical applications for breeding selection and reproductive management in swine production.

AB  - alpha(S1)-Casein (encoded by the CSN1S1 gene) is associated with higher rates of allergy than other milk protein components for humans. microRNAs (miRNAs) as small noncoding RNA molecules regulate gene expression and influence diverse biological processes. However, little is known about the regulation of milk protein synthesis by miRNAs in ruminants. In this study, we aim to investigate the regulatory roles of miR-204 family members (miR-204-5p and miR-211) on alpha(S1)-casein in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). Here, we observed that the CSN1S1 mRNA level is upregulated, while miR-204-5p and miR-211 (miR-204-5p/-211) abundance is downregulated during peak lactation compared with middle lactation of dairy goats. We found that miR-204-5p/-211 synergistically inhibit alpha(S1)-casein expression via directly binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of CSN1S1 in GMEC. miR-204-5p/-211 increase beta-casein mRNA (CSN2) and protein abundance, as well as the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (STAT5a) activity. Further, miR-204-5p/-211 enhance beta-casein expression via the CSN1S1-STAT5a signaling axis and promote beta-casein transcription by activating the STAT5 response element located in the CSN2 promoter. In conclusion, miR-204-5p/-211 regulate alpha(S1) casein and beta-casein synthesis via targeting CSN1S1 in GMEC, which provide the strategy for manipulating miR-204 family members to reduce milk allergy potential and improve ruminant milk quality for human consumption.

AB  - Background Decades after their first commercial release, many theoretical assumptions are still taken for granted in the deployment of genetically modified (GM) crops. Theoretically, in the case of maize, active transcription of the cry1Ab transgene would result in dose-dependent production of the insecticidal Cry1Ab protein, which would in turn induce dose-dependent mortality on lepidopteran pests. We produced data to realistically approach this question by using a model that includes two genetic background contexts from two geographical provenances in Brazil and South Africa, and two lepidopteran pests (Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis). However, in this study, the effect of insect herbivory was superimposed to investigate possible stress-induced effects in transgene expression at three levels: mRNA, protein and bioactivity.Results Overall, we found that herbivore damage by H. armigera was reflected only at the translational level, with a higher level of Cry1Ab protein measured in the Brazilian crosses under herbivore stress. On the other hand, compared to non-stress growing conditions, the herbivore damage by S. littoralis was not directly reflected in mRNA, protein or bioactivity in the South African crosses.Conclusions The differences between South African and Brazilian genetic backgrounds, and between the stressor effect of the two herbivores used, highlight the complexity of transgene expression at the agroecological level.

AB  - Simple Summary Exhausted olive cake, tomato pomace and wine lees are agroindustrial by-products extensively produced in the Mediterranean area that could be used in ruminant feeding, but the information on their optimal inclusion level in ruminant diets is scarce. Exhausted olive cake and tomato pomace are fibrous by-products and therefore are more adequate for ruminant feeding, whereas wine lees can have high protein content. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of including increasing amounts of these by-products in diets for fattening ruminants on in vitro ruminal fermentation and methane production. We analysed the in vitro fermentation of diets including 0, 6, 12 and 18% of these by-products. Including up to 18% of a 1:1 mixture of exhausted olive cake and tomato pomace had no negative effect on in vitro ruminal fermentation, but decreased ammonia concentrations, probably due to the low crude protein digestibility of both by-products. In contrast, high amounts of wine lees (12 and 18%) had negative effects on in vitro ruminal fermentation, and consequently they could only be included up to 6% to avoid negative effects. The absence of effects of any tested by-product on methane production indicates that they lack antimethanogenic compounds. The effects of including wine lees (WL), exhausted olive cake (EOC) and a 1:1 mixture of EOC and tomato pomace (EOCTP) in diets for fattening ruminants on in vitro fermentation parameters and CH4 production were analysed. Ten diets were studied, containing either none of the tested by-products (control), or 6.0, 12.0 or 18.0% of WL, EOC and ECOTP formulated to have similar protein and fiber content. Diets were incubated in vitro with sheep ruminal fluid to measure gas production kinetics and fermentation parameters. Increasing the level of WL, EOC and EOCTP decreased linearly (p <= 0.009) the potential gas production, but other gas production parameters were unaffected (p > 0.05), excepting that EOCTP increased the gas production rate. No differences (p >= 0.0.05) among diets were observed in total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production at 24 h of incubation for EOC and EOCTP, but NH3-N concentration decreased (p <= 0.003). In contrast, WL at 12.0 and 18.0% decreased (p < 0.05) total VFA production and increased the acetate/propionate ratio (p < 0.05). None of the by-products had an effect on CH4 production (p >= 0.0.05). Results indicate that EOC and EOCTP could be included up to 18.0% in fattening diets, but lower levels of WL are recommended.

AB  - Anthracnose is a common disease found in Camellia oleifera producing areas across China, whose primary pathogen is Colletotrichum fructicola. We previously revealed that autophagy is essential for the pathogenicity of C. fructicola. However, the function of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is a parallel protein degradation pathway to autophagy, remains elusive. Here, we report that CfRad6, an E2 conjugating enzyme in UPS, interacts with three putative E3 ubiquitin ligases, namely CfRad18, CfUbr1, and CfBre1. Importantly, we presented evidence showing that CfRad6 negatively regulates autophagy, revealing the first link between UPS and autophagy in pathogenic fungi. Targeted gene deletion showed that CfRad6 is involved in growth and conidiation. We further found that the Delta Cfrad6 mutant is defective in appressoria formation and responses to environmental stresses. These combined effects, along with the abnormal autophagy level, lead to the pathogenicity defects of the Delta Cfrad6 mutant. Taken together, our study indicates the pleiotropic functions of CfRad6 in the development and pathogenicity of C. fructicola.

AB  - At weaning, piglets deal with numerous changes and stressors, which can lead to reduced feed intake, digestive disturbances, and gut inflammation. In this context, there is a compelling need to develop new and innovative nutritional strategies aimed at restoring intestinal balance in piglets after weaning and controlling the weaning-associated intestinal inflammation. This study investigated the effect of a diet, including a synbiotic additive (a mix of grape seed and camelina meals as the prebiotic and a lactobacilli mixture as the probiotic) on intestinal inflammation in piglets after weaning. An acute inflammation was induced by the intraperitoneally challenge with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The experimental groups were as follows: Control group (piglets fed a conventional corn-soybean meal-based diet), LPS group (piglets fed the Control diet and challenged with 80 mu g/b.w. of LPS), SYN group (piglets fed a basal diet, including 5% prebiotic mix and 0.1% probiotic mix, SYN diet), and SYN+LPS group (piglets fed the SYN diet and challenged with 80 mu g/b.w. of LPS). Using genomic and proteomic techniques, genes and proteins related to intestinal inflammation were measured in both the jejunum and colon. The results showed that the LPS challenge induced an exacerbated inflammatory response in the jejunum and colon of piglets, inducing an overexpression of a large palette of inflammation-related mediators, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNF-alpha), and chemokines (e.g., monokine induced by interferon-gamma-MIG, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted-RANTES). All these effects are prevented by the SYN diet, which controls the amplitude of intestinal inflammation induced by the LPS challenge in piglets. Overall, these results suggested that piglets, after weaning, fed the synbiotic diet are less susceptible to the LPS challenge. This diet might be used as a nutritional strategy to alleviate intestinal inflammation in piglets after weaning.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) is a non-invasive and economic approach known to increase healthspan and life expectancy, through a decrease in oxidative stress, an increase in neurotrophins, among other benefits. However, it is not clear whether its benefit could be noted earlier, as at the beginning of middle -age. Hence, we aimed to determine whether six months of long-term CR, from early adulthood to the beginning of middle age (10 months of age) could positively affect cognitive, neurochemical, and behavioral parameters. Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly distributed into Young Control (YC, ad libitum food), Old Control (OC, ad libitum food), and Old Restricted (OR, 30 % of caloric restriction) groups. To analyze the cognitive and behavioral aspects, the novel object recognition task (NOR), open field, and elevated plus maze tests were performed. In addition, immunohistochemistry targeting Delta FosB (neuronal activity), brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the DNA oxidative damage (8OHdG) in hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG), and in basolateral amygdala and striatum were performed. Our results showed that long-term CR prevented short-term memory impairment related to aging and increased 8OHdG in hippocampal DG. BDNF was not involved in the effects of either age or CR on memory at middle -age, as it increased in CA3 of the OC group but was not altered in OR. Regarding anxiety -type behavior, no parameter showed differences between the groups. In conclusion, while the effects of long-term CR on anxiety -type behavior were inconclusive, it mitigated the memory deficit related to aging, which was accompanied by an increase in hippocampal 8OHdG in DG. Future studies should investigate whether the benefits of CR would remain if the restriction were interrupted after this long-term protocol.

AB  - L-Asparaginases have remained an intriguing research topic since their discovery similar to 120 years ago, especially after their introduction in the 1960s as very efficient antileukemic drugs. In addition to bacterial asparaginases, which are still used to treat childhood leukemia, enzymes of plant and mammalian origin are now also known. They have all been structurally characterized by crystallography, in some cases at outstanding resolution. The structural data have also shed light on the mechanistic details of these deceptively simple enzymes. Yet, despite all this progress, no better therapeutic agents have been found to beat bacterial asparaginases. However, a new option might arise with the discovery of yet another type of asparaginase, those from symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia, and with progress in the protein engineering of enzymes with desired properties. This review surveys the field of structural biology of L-asparaginases, focusing on the mechanistic aspects of the well established types and speculating about the potential of the new members of this amazingly diversified family.

AB  - The European wisent (Bison bonasus), an iconic yet genetically vulnerable species, faces ongoing conservation challenges due to a restricted gene pool. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offer promising prospects for preserving and restoring genetic diversity in endangered species. In this study, we sought to reprogram wisent somatic cells into iPSCs using the PiggyBac transposon system, a non-viral method known for being successfully applied in bovine species. We applied a six-factor reprogramming cocktail (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, c-MYC, NANOG) alongside small-molecule enhancers to fibroblasts isolated from adult wisent tissue. While initial colony formation was observed, the reprogrammed cells exhibited limited proliferation and failed to maintain stable pluripotency, suggesting intrinsic barriers to complete reprogramming. Despite optimizing culture conditions, including hypoxia and extracellular matrix modifications, the reprogramming efficiency remained low. Our findings indicate that wisent somatic cells may require alternative reprogramming strategies, such as new-generation delivery systems and epigenetic modulators, to achieve stable iPSC lines. This study underscores the need for species-specific optimization of reprogramming protocols and highlights the potential of emerging cellular technologies for conservation efforts. Future research integrating advanced reprogramming tools may pave the way for genetic rescue strategies in wisent and other endangered species.

AB  - In this study, the phytochemicals and antimicrobial activities of ethanolic extracts of Thai edible plants, green tea, red cotton tree flower, fingerroot and ginger were evaluated. The plant extracts were taken for evaluation of antimicrobial activities against Cutibacterium acnes DMST 14916, Staphylococcus epidermidis TISTR 518, and Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 746. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of green tea, fingerroot, and ginger extracts against C. acnes DMST 14916 were 3.92, 0.49, and 7.85 mg cm-3, respectively and the minimum bacteriostatic concentrations (MBCs) were 3.92, 0.49, and 7.85 mg cm-3, respectively. The MICs and MBCs of fingerroot extract against S. epidermidis TISTR 518 were 0.12 and 0.49 mg cm-3, respectively, while those against S. aureus TISTR 746 were 0.12 and 0.98 mg cm-3, respectively. Red cotton tree flower extract showed no antimicrobial activity against the acne-causing bacteria. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation, the bacterial cells treated with the plant extracts revealed visible shrinkages compared to the smooth cell surfaces of the controls. The phytochemicals in the plant extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Well-known antimicrobial compounds like azelaic acid, embelin and kaempferol 3-rutinoside-4 '-glucoside were identified in all extracts. The cytotoxic effects of the plant extracts on human cell lines were further investigated. The green tea extract was slightly toxic to HaCaT cells found at the initial concentration of 62.5 mg cm-3, but not toxic to MRC-5 cells. The fingerroot and ginger extracts had no cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells, but promoted the MRC-5 cell proliferation. The combination effects of the plant extracts were prebiotic-like and indifferent effects. Regarding all results, the ethanolic extracts of green tea, fingerroot, and ginger could be used individually as natural anti-acne ingredients capable of further product development to improve human skin health.

AB  - Understanding how physiological processes align with specific behaviors provides valuable insight into the evolutionary adaptations of primates. Thermoregulatory and sensory adaptations are critical for survival in nocturnal primates, shaping their ability to forage efficiently under low-light conditions. Infrared thermography (IRT) offers a noninvasive approach to exploring these dynamics, particularly where traditional observational methods may fall short. The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a nocturnal primate native to Madagascar, exemplifies such challenges. Known for its unique "percussive foraging" or "tap-scanning" behavior, the aye-aye uses its large, mobile ears to detect acoustic cues and its elongated middle finger to tap on wood surfaces and extract hidden insects. The role of olfactory cues in this foraging strategy, however, remains debated, as some evidence suggests they may complement acoustic sensing in certain contexts. We used IRT to investigate how the surface temperature in the eye, as an indicator of body temperature, the nose, and the pinna, a critical component of the auditory system involved in tap-scanning changes during foraging in aye-ayes. We conducted tests on two healthy captive aye-ayes in a controlled environment at Duke Lemur Center. We found a significant increase (2-3 degrees C) in ocular temperature during tapping and foraging activities. Nasal temperatures remained 10-13 degrees C lower than other facial regions, with a positive correlation between ocular and nasal temperatures. Pinna temperature varied, showing distinct thermal patterns in the inner and outer pinnae. The temperature of the pinna region and ear canal entry was higher than that of other parts of the head. The elevated eye temperature suggests a potential rise in body temperature linked to metabolic and physiological activity during foraging. The increase in nasal temperature or contact with wood surfaces during active foraging suggests enhanced olfactory sensitivity as the aye-aye searches for prey. Variation in ear temperature and thermal patterns imply physiological or sensory adaptations, potentially driven by increased blood flow and metabolic activity associated with auditory sensing or chewing muscles to optimize foraging efficiency. These findings reveal distinct thermal patterns in the eye, nose, and pinna, linked to metabolic, potential olfactory, and auditory activity during foraging. This highlights the aye-aye's specific sensory and thermoregulatory adaptations and underscores the broader use of IRT for studying similar mechanisms in other nocturnal species.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is an important medicinal plant of Southeast-Asia, enriched with various antioxidant components like beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, catechin and folacin. Carotenoids are the bioactive substances abundantly present in sea buckthorn berries providing it an enticing yellowish, or orange red color. We performed the phylogenetic analysis, and conserved domain analysis to observe the evolutionary history and functional cites of carotenoids biosynthesis genes respectively. Further relative expression of two carotenoids biosynthesis genes Lycopene beta-cyclase (Hr-Lcyb) and phytoene synthase (Hr-Psy) in was conducted in various tissues of sea buckthorn plants. Our results revealed that both the carotenoid synthesis genes Hr-Lcyb and Hr-Psy showed homology with already reported Arabidopsis thaliana genes (AT3G10230 and AT5G17230). Relative expression analysis indicated that expression of Hr-Lcyb and Hr-Psy genes in leaves and floral organs of sea buckthorn was one-fold higher than other tissues. This study will open the door for plant biologists for further characterization of carotenoids synthesis genes and their regulatory processes in specific tissues of carotenoid rich fruit plants.

AB  - We report on the 3D ultrastructure of the mineralized petrous bone of mature pig using focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). We divide the petrous bone into two zones based on the degree of mineralization; one zone close to the otic chamber has higher mineral density than the second zone further away from the otic chamber. The hypermineralization of the petrous bone results in the collagen D-banding being poorly revealed in the lower mineral density zone (LMD), and absent in the high mineral density zone (HMD). We therefore could not use D-banding to decipher the 3D structure of the collagen assembly. Instead we exploited the anisotropy option in the Dragonfly image processing software to visualize the less mineralized collagen fibrils and/or nanopores that surround the more mineralized zones known as tesselles. This approach therefore indirectly tracks the orientations of the collagen fibrils in the matrix itself. We show that the HMD bone has a structure similar to that of woven bone, and the LMD is composed of lamellar bone with a plywood-like structural motif. This agrees with the fact that the bone close to the otic chamber is fetal bone and is not remodeled. The lamellar structure of the bone further away from the otic chamber is consistent with modeling/remodeling. The absence of the less mineralized collagen fibrils and nanopores resulting from the confluence of the mineral tesselles may contribute to shielding DNA during diagenesis. We show that anisotropy evaluation of the less mineralized collagen fibrils could be a useful tool to analyze bone ultrastructures and in particular the directionality of collagen fibril bundles that make up the bone matrix.

AB  - ObjectiveIn this work, a propranolol hydrochloride (PRH) transfersomes loaded cutaneous hydrogel patch was developed for topical drug delivery in the affected area of infantile haemangioma.MethodsSodium cholate was used as the edge activator to prepare the transfersomes. Based on the central composite design, transfersomes hydrogel patch formulation was optimised with 48 h cumulative penetration and time lag as response values. Particle sizes and morphology of the prepared transfersomes were assessed. They were loaded in a cutaneous hydrogel patch, after which their skin permeation abilities were evaluated, and histopathological effects were investigated using guinea pigs. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetics studies were performed in rats.ResultsThe transfersomes system had a encapsulation efficiency of 81.84 +/- 0.53%, particle size of 186.8 +/- 3.38 nm, polydispersity index of 0.186 +/- 0.002, and a zeta potential of -28.6 +/- 2.39 mV. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed sphericity of the particles. The ex vivo drug's penetration of the optimised transfersomes hydrogel patch was 111.05 +/- 11.97 mu g/cm(2) through rat skin within 48 h. Assessment of skin tissue did not reveal any histopathological alterations in epidermal and dermal cells. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that skin C-max (68.22 mu g/cm(2)) and AUC(0-24) (1007.33 mu g/cm(2) x h) for PRH transfersomes hydrogel patch were significantly higher than those of commercially available oral dosage form and hydrogel patch without transfersomes. These findings imply that the transfersomes hydrogel patch can prolong drug accumulation in the affected skin area, and reduce systemic drug distribution via the blood stream.ConclusionsThe hydrogel patch-loaded PRH transfersomes is a potentially useful drug formulation for infantile haemangioma.

AB  - Type-2 diabetes not only causes gray matter injury but also induces widespread white matter damages, which may contribute the cognitive impairments. This study aimed to assess the structural alterations of the gray and white matter in 20-week-old diabetic db/db mice using magnetic resonance imaging including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and to correlate them with the cognitive performance detected by Morris water maze (MWM). The results revealed impaired spatial learning and memory in db/db mice. T2WI detected severe brain atrophy involving the hippocampus and cortex after diabetes. DTI showed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum/external capsule, and increased radial diffusivity in the corpus callosum/external capsule of the db/db mice. The immunostaining confirmed the MRI findings showing decreased cell density in the cortex, hippocampus, and reduced integrated optical density of Luxol fast blue staining in the corpus callosum/external capsule. The correlational analysis revealed that the T2WI-derived tissue atrophy and DTI-derived FA in the relevant gray matter and white matter significantly correlated with the behavior performance in the MWM test. Collectively, the present in vivo MRI detected varying degrees of structural abnormalities in the gray and white matter of db/db mice, which might be favorable predictors of diabetic cognitive dysfunction. Our findings might provide new clues for identifying gray and white matter damages associated with cognitive decline, which is imperative for the evaluation of potential pharma-cological therapies in preclinical phase.

AB  - Camelina sativa is an oil crop with low input costs and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The presence of glucosinolates, plant metabolites with adverse health effects, restricts the use of camelina for human and animal nutrition. Cas9 endonuclease-based targeted mutagenesis of the three homeologs of each of the glucosinolate transporters CsGTR1 and CsGTR2 caused a strong decrease in glucosinolate amounts, highlighting the power of this approach for inactivating multiple genes in a hexaploid crop. Mutagenesis of the three homeologs of each of the transcription factors CsMYB28 and CsMYB29 resulted in the complete loss of glucosinolates, representing the first glucosinolate-free Brassicaceae crop. The oil and protein contents and the fatty acid composition of the csgtr1csgtr2 and csmyb28csmyb29 mutant seeds were not affected. The decrease and elimination of glucosinolates improves the quality of the oil and press cake of camelina, which thus complies with international standards regulating glucosinolate levels for human consumption and animal feeding.

AB  - Background: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP1) is upregulated in the hippocampus of patients with depression, while pharmacological inhibition of hippocampal MKP1 can mitigate depression-like behaviors in rodents. In addition, MAPK signaling regulates autophagy, and antidepressants were recently shown to target autophagic signaling pathways. We speculated that MKP1 contributes to depression by enhancing hippocampal autophagy through dephosphorylation of the MAPK isoform ERK1/2. Methods: We established a rat depression model by exposure to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and then examined depression-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) as well as expression changes in hippocampal MKP1, ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and autophagy-related proteins LC3II by Western blotting and immunostaining. These same measurements were repeated in rats exposed to CUMS following hippocampal infusion of a MKP1-targeted shRNA. Finally, the effects of MKP1 expression level on autophagy we examined in rat GMI-R1 microglia. Results: CUMS-exposed rats demonstrated anhedonia in the SPT and helplessness in the FST, two core depressionlike behaviors. Expression levels of MKP1 and LC3II were upregulated in the hippocampus of CUMS rats, suggesting enhanced autophagy, while pERK/ERK was downregulated. Knockdown of hippocampal MKP1 mitigated depression-like behaviors, downregulated hippocampal LC3II expression, and upregulated hippocampal pERK/ ERK. Similarly, MKP1 knockdown in GMI-R1 cells upregulated pERK/ERK and reduced the number of LC3II autophagosomes, while MKP1 overexpression had the opposite effects. Conclusion: Enhanced hippocampal autophagy via MKP1-mediated ERK dephosphorylation may contribute to the development of depression.

AB  - gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a signal molecule, is regarded as the intersection node of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and its contributions to flavonoid metabolism in tea plant growth and development remain unclear. The correlation between the GABA shunt and flavonoid metabolism in tea plants is worth to explore. Secondary metabolites and their correlations with the taste of tea soup made from tea plants (Camellia sinensis) during different seasons were investigated. Related secondary metabolites and transcript profiles of genes encoding enzymes in the GABA shunt, flavonoid pathway and polyamine biosynthesis were measured throughout the tea plant growth seasons and after exogenous GABA applications. In addition, the abundance of differentially expressed proteins was quantified after treatments with or without exogenous GABA. The tea leaves showed the highest metabolite concentrations in spring season. CsGAD, CsGABAT, CsSPMS, CsODC, CsF3H and CsCHS were found to be important genes in the GABA and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways. GABA and anthocyanin concentrations showed a positive correlation, to some extent, CsF3H and CsCHS played important roles in the GABA and anthocyanin biosynthesis.

AB  - The study of animal space use is fundamental to effective conservation and management of wildlife populations and habitats in a rapidly changing world, yet many species remain poorly described. Such is the case for the spatial ecology of the Vicuna-a medium-sized wild camelid that plays a critical role, both as a consumer and as prey, in the high Andean food web. We studied patterns of space use of 24 adult female vicunas from April 2014 to February 2017 at the southern edge of its range. Vicunas showed strong fidelity to their home range locations across the study period and shared large portions of their home ranges with vicunas from other family groups. Vicuna home ranges in our study were considerably larger than previous estimates across the range of the species. Variation in environmental and terrain factors and the associated risk of predation affected vicuna diel migration distance but not home range size or overlap. Our study offers new ecological insights into vicuna space use that can inform conservation and management efforts of vicunas and other social ungulates.

AB  - Most phytophagous insect species are specialized to feed on a narrow range of host plants, typically within the same genus or family, and sometimes even on a single plant species. However, some insect taxa are able to feed on plants from different families and are therefore considered to be generalists. Nevertheless, these generalist species can sometimes form cryptic species complexes or differentiate into host-based populations or races. Moreover, the host breadth of generalists is often measured under laboratory conditions, which may not accurately reflect the more challenging natural environments they encounter, and thus may lead to an overestimation of generalism. In this study, we used a population genetics approach to test whether Myzus persicae, a highly polyphagous aphid, is composed of host-specialized populations or clones, or whether generalism is an intrinsic characteristic of the species as a whole. We sampled M. persicae over four consecutive years in northern France from a variety of host plants belonging to different botanical families. We found that populations of M. persicae in northern France were predominantly composed of superclones, namely multilocus genotypes identified in many copies. In particular, four superclones dominated M. persicae populations, occurring in high proportions on a broad range of unrelated host plants in each year of the study. Moreover, the array of characterized genotypes of M. persicae formed distinct genetic clusters, but with no clear association to specific host plants. This study shows that under natural conditions and at the very fine genetic level of a single clone, the generalist characteristic of M. persicae holds. Thus, M. persicae remains an exceptional example of a true generalist species.

AB  - Dynamic epigenetic changes during hibernation occur in some hibernating rodents, but these changes are poorly understood in hibernating bats. Populations of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in north China hibernate and provide an opportunity to study how epigenetic markers and modifiers differ in the active and torpid states of a chiropteran. We used fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) and qRT-PCR techniques to determine changes in the global DNA methylation levels and mRNA expression levels of methylation-related proteins. These included DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs), methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs, including MBDs, UHRFs, and zinc-finger protein family) in active and torpid R. ferrumequinum. In the torpid state, both the relative global methylation and the relative mRNA expression levels of some DNMTs and MBPs, including dnmt3b and zbtb4, increased significantly compared to the expression levels of these in the active state. These changes may involve methylation or assist in regulation of a particular subset of genes according to hibernation status. This indicates that epigenetic mechanisms may exist and facilitate the hibernation process of R. ferrumequinum.

AB  - Key Message Methyl jasmonate treatment and aphid resistance assays reveal different roles in herbivore defensive responses between tobacco glandular and non-glandular trichomes. These roles correlate with trichome gene expression patterns. In plants, trichomes greatly contribute to biotic stress resistance. To better understand the different defensive functions between glandular and non-glandular trichomes, we used Nicotiana tabacum as a model. This species bears three types of trichomes: long and short stalk glandular trichomes (LGT and SGT, respectively), and non-glandular trichomes (NGT). Tobacco accession T.I.1068 (lacking NGT) and T.I.1112 (lacking LGT) were used for the experiment. After methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, LGT formation was promoted not only in T.I.1068, but also in T.I.1112, whereas NGT remained absent in T.I.1068, and was slightly reduced in T.I.1112. Diterpenoids, which play important roles in herbivore resistance, accumulated abundantly in T.I.1068 and were elevated by MeJA; however, they were not found in T.I.1112 but became detectable after MeJA treatment. The aphid resistance of T.I.1068 was higher than that of T.I.1112, and both were enhanced by MeJA, which was closely correlated with LGT density. Trichomes detached from T.I.1068 and T.I.1112 were used for RNA-Seq analysis, the results showed that pentose phosphate, photosynthesis, and diterpenoid biosynthesis genes were much more expressed in T.I.1068 than in T.I.1112, which was consistent with the vigorous diterpenoid biosynthesis in T.I.1068. In T.I.1112, citrate cycle, propanoate, and glyoxylate metabolism processes were enriched, and some defensive protein genes were expressed at higher levels than those in T.I.1068.These results suggested that LGT plays a predominant role in aphid resistance, whereas NGT could strengthen herbivore resistance by accumulating defensive proteins, and the roles of LGT and NGT are associated with their gene expression patterns.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of ethanol-extracted green lettuce leaf (GLE) on sleep behavior in physical stress-induced invertebrate and vertebrate models. In Drosophila melanogaster, the group that experienced vibration stress showed decreased sleep time compared to the no-vibration-stress control group, but the GLE treatment group recovered this lost sleep time. The GLE group also recovered the gene expression of downregulated superoxide dismutase induced by vibration stress conditions. According to electroencephalography analysis of rats, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep significantly decreased with a decrease in sleep time for the group in which immobilization stress was induced. In the GLE group (120 mg/kg), the change in sleep pattern caused by stress was restored, and NREM sleep increased by 68.8%, improving overall sleep quality. In addition, GLE upregulated the expression levels of oxidation-related factors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor. Quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3G) was evaluated as a sleep-promoting active substance contained in GLE using the pentobarbital-induced sleep test and showed the effect of prolonged sleep time. Q3G inhibited [H-3]-flumazenil binding in a concentration-dependent manner with GLE. Taken together, the results indicate that GLE effectively binds to the GABA(A) receptor to promote sleep, demonstrating the potential of Q3G as an active substance.

AB  - Recent clinical studies have highlighted mutations in the voltage -gated potassium channel Kv10.2 encoded by the KCNH5 gene among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our preliminary study found that Kv10.2 was decreased in the hippocampus of valproic acid (VPA) - induced ASD rats. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear how KCNH5 regulates autism -like features, or becomes a new target for autism treatment. We employed KCNH5 knockout ( KCNH5 -/- ) rats and VPA - induced ASD rats in this study. Then, we used behavioral assessments, combined with electrophysiological recordings and hippocampal brain slice, to elucidate the impact of KCNH5 deletion and environmental factors on neural development and function in rats. We found that KCNH5 -/- rats showed early developmental delay, neuronal overdevelopment, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but did not exhibit autism -like behavior. KCNH5 -/- rats exposed to VPA ( KCNH5 -/- -VPA) exhibit even more severe autism -like behaviors and abnormal neuronal development. The absence of KCNH5 excessively enhances the activity of the Protein Kinase B (Akt)/Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of rats after exposure to VPA. Overall, our findings underscore the deficiency of KCNH5 increases the susceptibility to autism under environmental exposures, suggesting its potential utility as a target for screening and diagnosis in ASD.

AB  - The aim of this study is to obtain the translocation factor by application of landfill leachate (LL) diluted in public irrigation water (IW). Pennisetum purpureum Schum (elephant grass) was cultivated for 83 days in an experimental water reuse unit. The present work was developed at the Experimental Water Reuse Unit (UERA), on the UFERSA campus in Mossoro, RN, Brazil. Plot irrigation was based on water balance and crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The concentration in the plant tissue (root and leaf) of the following heavy metals was measured to determine the respective translocation factors: manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb). The experiment was set up in a randomized block design with five treatments (T1, plots irrigated only with IW; T2, 50% of LL dose plus IW; T3, 100% of LL dose plus IW; T4, 150% of LL dose plus IW; and T5, 200% of LL dose plus IW) and five replications. All treatments received LL plus IW depth of 491.02 mm for 83 days of P. purpureum cultivation. The data obtained were submitted to multivariate analysis plus the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the means. Pennisetum purpureum showed a potential to accumulate metals in its tissues, mainly Mn, Zn, and Cu. The treatments that most favored the extraction of these metals were T2 and T5; in this sense, P. purpureum was not efficient in translocating heavy metals, since the translocation factor observed in all treatments was below 1.0, indicating that the species used extract heavy metals from soil solution and keeps in yours roots. This suggests planting P. purpureum may not be a viable option to remediate environments highly contaminated with heavy metals.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a close association between alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-pro-pionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and depressive disorders, and activation of AMPARs may represent a promising way to treat depression. However, the effects of AMPAR potentiators on depression and the underlying mechanism have not been comprehensively clarified. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a depressive mouse model and an in vitro damage model of SH-SY5Y cells, and the AMPAR potentiator LY450108 was introduced to the study. We found that LY450108 alleviated LPS-induced depressive behavior and abnormal phosphorylation of hippocampal AMPARs in mice. LY450108 also alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and decreased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, LY450108 protected SH-SY5Y cells from LPS-induced abnormal phosphorylation of AMPARs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that LY450108 has antidepressant effects against LPS-induced neuronal damage and depression.

AB  - Purpose: We studied changes in the choroid, particularly variation in blood flow, during the development of myopia. The hemodynamic mechanism in play remains unclear. We evaluated blood flow by quantitating indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in a guinea pig model of form-deprivation myopia. Methods: Guinea pigs were divided into form-deprivation myopia (FDM) and normal control (NC) groups. Ocular biometric and choroidal hemodynamics parameters were quantitatively derived via ICG imaging, and included the maximal ICG fluorescence intensity (Imax), rising time (Trising), blood flow index (BFI), and mean transit time (MTT). Results: Form deprivation was associated with significant interocular differences in terms of both refractive error and axial length. ICG fluorescence hemodynamic maps of fundal blood flow and vasculature density were evident. In deprived eyes, the fluorescence signals exhibited significantly longer Trising and MTT but lower Imax and BFI than fellow eyes and NC group. The interocular differences in terms of the ocular biometric and hemodynamic parameters were significantly correlated. Hemodynamic analysis of choriocapillaris lobules revealed weakened fluorescence intensity and prolonged arrival and filling times in deprived eyes. Form deprivation reduced the number of lobulated choriocapillaris structures. Conclusion: Form-deprivation myopia triggered changes in the hemodynamic and vascular network structures of the choroid and choriocapillaris. The ICG fluorescence imaging/analysis method provides a unique tool for further myopia research.

AB  - The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self-stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of similar to 2900 sites in 74 structures of 4 sensorimotor pathways and 4 modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense versus sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA-pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA-pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures' sensorimotor function than to density of DA-innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA-innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA-density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA-sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward-associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.

AB  - Triatomines are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), the agent of Chagas disease. Stercorarian transmission occurs when infectious parasites are passed in insect feces to vertebrates through the biting wound or mucosa. Defecating on hosts during or shortly after blood feeding is, therefore, critical for transmission, and delayed triatomine defecation behavior has been posited to contribute to a low incidence of human Chagas disease in the U.S. We allowed nymphal T. cruzi-infected and uninfected Triatoma gerstaeckeri (St & aring;l, 1859) and Triatoma sanguisuga (LeConte, 1855) to interact with restrained guinea pigs and measured insect feeding and defecation events; South American Rhodnius prolixus (St & aring;l, 1859; Latin America) served as a comparison group. In 148 trials, 40.0% of insects fed, of which 71.2% defecated. Compared to R. prolixus, T. gerstaeckeri had >9 times higher odds of feeding, and T. sanguisuga fed longer. Observations of defecation while feeding occurred across all three species. The post-feeding defecation interval (PFDI) of R. prolixus was significantly shorter (4.54 +/- 2.46 min) than that of T. gerstaeckeri (9.75 +/- 2.52 min) and T. sanguisuga (20.69 +/- 8.98 min). Furthermore, the PFDI was shorter for TcI-infected insects compared to uninfected insects. Triatoma gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga are capable of stercorarian transmission, although the calculated metrics suggest they are less efficient vectors than R. prolixus.

AB  - Risk for psychosis begins to accumulate as early as the fetal period through exposure to obstetric complications like fetal hypoxia, maternal stress, and prenatal infection. Stressors in the postnatal period, such as childhood trauma, peer victimization, and neighborhood-level adversity, further increase susceptibility for psychosis. Cognitive difficulties are among the first symptoms to emerge in individuals who go on to develop a psychotic disorder. We review the relationship between pre-, perinatal, and early childhood adversities and cognitive outcomes in individuals with psychosis. Current evidence shows that the aforementioned environmental risk factors may be linked to lower overall intelligence and executive dysfunction, beginning in the premorbid period and persisting into adulthood in individuals with psychosis. It is likely that early life stress contributes to cognitive difficulties in psychosis through dysregulation of the body's response to stress, causing changes such as increased cortisol levels and chronic immune activation, which can negatively impact neurodevelopment. Intersectional aspects of identity (e.g., sex/gender, race/ethnicity), as well as gene-environment interactions, likely inform the developmental cascade to cognitive difficulties throughout the course of psychotic disorders and are reviewed below. Prospective studies of birth cohorts will serve to further clarify the relationship between early-life environmental risk factors and cognitive outcomes in the developmental course of psychotic disorders. Specific methodological recommendations are provided for future research.

AB  - Gestational hypoxia inhibits mitochondrial function in the fetal heart and placenta contributing to fetal growth restriction and organ dysfunction. NAD + deficiency may contribute to a metabolic deficit by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. We tested the effects of nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD + precursor, as a treatment for reversing known mitochondrial dysfunction in hypoxic fetal hearts. Pregnant guinea pigs were housed in room air (normoxia) or placed in a hypoxic chamber (10.5%O2) for the last 14 days of gestation (term = 65 days) and administered either water or NR (1.6 mg/ml) in the drinking bottle. Fetuses were excised at term, and NAD + levels of maternal liver, placenta, and fetal heart ventricles were measured. Indices of mitochondrial function (complex IV activity, sirtuin 3 activity, protein acetylation) and ATP synthesis were measured in fetal heart ventricles of NR-treated/untreated normoxic and hypoxic animals. Hypoxia reduced fetal body weight in both sexes (p = 0.01), which was prevented by NR. Hypoxia had no effect on maternal liver NAD + levels but decreased (p = 0.04) placenta NAD + levels, the latter normalized with NR treatment. Hypoxia had no effect on fetal heart NAD + but decreased (p < 0.05) mitochondrial complex IV and sirtuin 3 activities, ATP content, and increased mitochondrial acetylation, which were all normalized with maternal NR. Hypoxia increased (p < 0.05) mitochondrial acetylation in female fetal hearts but had no effect on other mitochondrial indices. We conclude that maternal NR is an effective treatment for normalizing mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP synthesis in the hypoxic fetal heart.

AB  - The present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of water deficiency on seed qualitative traits of C. sativa genotypes in terms of oil and protein fiber content, total soluble carbohydrate content, fatty acids composition, and some phytochemical constituents including total phenol, flavonoid, and glucosinolate content. The investigations were conducted in a factorial manner through a completely randomized design with two factors genotype (five camelina genotypes) and water supply (100, 75 and 50% field capacity) under greenhouse condition. The results showed that water-deficient- responsive approaches varied in camelina genotypes. Water deficiency decreased oil content and increased protein and total carbohydrate content and both studied antioxidant compounds, containing total phenolic and flavonoid content. The fiber content was also influenced by the genotype greater than water-deficient stress. Among the studied genotypes, only one genotype showed a reducing trend of total glucosinolate under water-deficient stress. Various fatty acids contents were observed within and between the genotypes under the different levels of irrigation. DH68 genotype with the greatest oil content, unsaturated fatty acids and standard glucosinolate content had the best performance under water-deficient stress and can be a favorite outcome for dry climates. Overall, findings indicated a strong effect of genetic backgrounds and waterdeficient stress especially during the reproductive stage on seed compositions of camelina plant.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) is one of the most common forms of dementia worldwide, characterized by problems with reasoning, planning, judgment, and memory. This study investigated the effect of a histone methyltransferase inhibitor on cognition and mitochondrial function in a rat model of VD, as well as its impact on H2O2induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neuronal cultures. In the in vivo experiments, VD was induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) for one month. The histone methyltransferase inhibitor, BIX01294, was administered intracerebroventricularly for one month (22.5 mu g.kg- 1 three times/week). On day 30, behavioral tests, including the novel object recognition test and elevated plus maze test, were conducted. Mitochondrial enzyme activities, including aconitase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KG), complex I, and complex IV, were evaluated in the hippocampus of rats following CCA ligation. In the in vitro experiments, the effect of BIX01294 (50-600 mu M) on H2O2 (400 mu M)-induced cytotoxicity in hippocampal neuronal cells was assessed using the MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate apoptosis. Our findings revealed that BIX01294 effectively improved memory function, Krebs cycle enzyme activity, and mitochondrial function in the rat model of VD. Moreover, in vitro results showed that BIX01294 at a concentration of 100 mu M significantly reversed the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by H2O2 in neuronal cells. These findings suggest that BIX01294 may have the potential to improve VD complications by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting histone methylation.

AB  - The adult stage of a new flower fly species, Copestylum enriquei sp. nov. (Diptera: Syrphidae) is described based on a single male collected in pristine rainforest in the Amazonian region of Colombia (type-locality: Florencia, Caqueta) and two females from a conserved forest in Suriname (Para and Brokopondo). Copestylum enriquei sp. nov. belongs to the C. vagum species group and is similar in appearance to Copestylum vagum (Wiedemann), C. musicanum (Curran), C. tenorium Ricarte & Rotheray, and C. chapadensis (Curran) from which it differs by the gena and face separated by a very broad brown vitta; scutum orange except for the wide medial vitta, which is dark and metallic, ending before the prescutellar region, with the apical margin M-shaped; tibiae dark-brown, except yellow on basal 1/4. The male genitalia of C. enriquei sp. nov. are unique and striking among the C. vagum species group, characterized by the epandrium and cercus black, contrasting with the colour of hypandrium and surstylus, which are orange; epandrium with a dorsal extension, a novel character among this species group, in addition to the L-shaped surstylus, with two pairs of rounded ridges in the dorsal edge, similar to a small deer antler in velvet. Images of type material, including photographs of male genitalia are provided. A comparison of the diagnostic characters is provided as well as modifications to the previous keys to distinguish C. enriquei sp. nov. from the other species of the C. vagum group. The species Copestylum araceorum Ricarte & Rotheray and C. tenorium Ricarte & Rotheray are recorded for the first time in the Amazonian rainforest in Colombia.

AB  - Context. SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes are composed of multiple protein subunits and can be categorised into three sub-families, including the BAF, PBAF, and GBAF complexes. We hypothesised that depletion of SMARCB1 and BRD7, two subunits unique to different SWI/SNF sub-families, would differentially impact porcine embryo development. Aim. The aim of these experiments was to determine the developmental requirements of two SWI/SNF subunits, SMARCB1 and BRD7. Methods, RNA interference assays were used to determine the developmental requirements of SMARCB1 and BRD7 in porcine embryos. Key results, Our findings indicate that knockdown of SMARCB1 dramatically reduces embryo developmental potential, with few embryos developing beyond the pronuclear stage. The knockdown of BRD7 had a less severe impact on developmental potential. Conclusions. Our findings also demonstrate that knockdown of SMARCB1 alters the expression of NANOG and POU5F1 (also referred to as OCT4). Implications. These findings highlight the unique developmental requirements for sub-families of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes. This new knowledge will enable us to determine how discrete genomic loci are differentially remodelled during key points in embryo development.

AB  - In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light-controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single-wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light-stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, "deer" picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5 mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device-level.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution in freshwater environments has drawn considerable attention over the decades due to the risk posed by MPs to the aquatic fauna and human health. In this study, the occurrence of MPs was assessed from the gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of indigenous fishes from Bhogdoi River, a tributary of River Brahmaputra, northeast hill region, Assam, India. All the fish species (n = 180) analysed showed 100% occurrence of MPs sampled from three stations of River Bhogdoi. A total of 488 microplastic particles were recorded from GIT of fishes collected. The mean abundance of MPs was highest in Station-II (7.64 +/- 2.77 numbers individual-1) with lowest in S-I (3.17 +/- 0.99 numbers individual-1). The MP size of 100-500 mu m, MP shape of fibre (43.33%) and fragments (35.33%), blue colour MPs (26-37%) and polymer type PA (23-30%) were most prevalent in fishes analysed from River Bhogdoi. The mean abundance of MPs was higher in herbivore fishes (8.52 +/- 1.22 numbers individual-1) as compared to carnivorous and omnivorous fish species with highest abundance in Labeo rohita (12.11 +/- 2.13 numbers individual-1). Fibre and fragments with size range of 100-500 mu m were dominant among all the feeding habits. Blue and black colour MPs were abundant among herbivore and carnivore fishes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results confirmed that polyamide and polypropylene were the most abundant MP polymer in the fishes analysed. The present study provides baseline information of MPs in River Bhogdoi, Assam, for its future monitoring and assessment of contaminants.

AB  - Crops grown in areas contaminated by industrial and agricultural fluorine (F) have gained increasing attention, however F levels in different vegetables and lettuce cultivars are rarely reported. In situ-field experiment was designed to investigate the concentration, translocation, and health risks of F in 20 vegetable species and 25 lettuce cultivars. After the growth of 150 d for vegetables and 60 d for lettuce, F concentration (12.83-138.07 mg kg(-1)), translocation factor (0.16-6.32), and bio-concentration factor (1.90-13.73) varied significantly between vegetable species and lettuce cultivars. According to the hazard quotient values (based on the reference dose of F), all the vegetable species appears to pose no risk to human health, while 60% of the lettuce cultivars present potential health risks to children. Therefore, the limit value of F in vegetables for adults and children should be enacted in the future. Moreover, cabbage, green radish, spinach, leaf mustard, and Frisee lettuce (Huayu) were considered as a safe dietary product. These findings contributed to the safe cultivation of vegetables and the control of fluorosis in the areas contaminated by industrial and agricultural activities.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in pigs is closely associated with excessive obesity and lipid metabolic abnormalities during postnatal catch-up growth. Nano zinc oxide (Nano-ZnO) is a novel nanomaterial that has antioxidant properties and can improve abnormal lipid metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the weight-reducing effects and mechanisms of Nano-ZnO in IUGR pigs. Six normal birth weight (NBW) and twelve IUGR male piglets were divided into three groups post-weaning (day 22): NBW and IUGR groups received a basal diet, while the IUGR + Zn group was fed a Nano-ZnO-supplemented diet (600 mg/kg). Nano-ZnO significantly reduced backfat thickness and improved fatty acid composition in IUGR pigs. Mechanistically, Nano-ZnO activated the NRF2 signaling pathway, enhancing antioxidant capacity in adipose tissue by elevating T-SOD and T-AOC activities, upregulating SOD/GCLC/GCLM expression, and suppressing KEAP1 and MDA levels. Concurrently, it promoted lipolysis via the adiponectin/AMPK/SREBP1C/PPAR gamma axis, increasing ACC/CPT-1/HSL activity and mRNA expression while inhibiting FAS. Furthermore, Nano-ZnO modulated gut microbiota composition (e.g., increasing cecal UCG-005, Rikenellaceae RC9, and fecal Phascolarctobacterium) and serum metabolites (e.g., reducing phenylpyruvic acid and 9(10)-EpOME, elevating docosahexaenoic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid). These findings demonstrate that Nano-ZnO ameliorates abnormal fat deposition in IUGR pigs through coordinated antioxidant, lipolytic, gut microbial, and metabolic reprogramming.

AB  - The North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) has continuously lowered their advice regarding the Total Allowed Catch (TAC) for the coastal Greenland halibut fisheries in Western Greenland. This is due to concerns of overexploitation of the fishery. This paper investigates how the fishing intensity in the fishery for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the Disko Bay, Greenland, affects the current and future income opportunities of coastal fishers. Through bio-economic modelling, I find presence of economic overexploitation of the Greenland halibut fish stock in the Disko Bay. Specifically, the actual Greenland halibut stock in 2019 is found to constitute only 56 pct. of the economic optimal stock size in the baseline scenario. The actual profit is almost 40 million DKK lower than the optimal profit due to higher costs of harvesting, which arise because the actual stock size is lower than the optimal and because of a suboptimal split of the TAC between vessels (above 6 m in length) and boats (6 m or below in length) in the fishery. The results presented in this article show that there is significant scope for economic optimization of the coastal Greenland halibut fishery through a temporary reduction in harvest of Greenland halibut to regenerate the stock to its optimal size and a transfer of TAC from the boat segment to the vessel segment. Notably, this article does not find that the stock of Greenland halibut in the Disko Bay is further decreasing at current (2019) harvest levels, however, this finding is contingent on the length of the data series used for the estimation of the growth model.

AB  - Light intensity influences energy production by increasing photosynthetic carbon, while phosphorus plays an important role in forming the complex nucleic acid structure for the regulation of protein synthesis. These two factors contribute to gene expression, metabolism, and plant growth regulation. In particular, shading is an effective agronomic practice and is widely used to improve the quality of green tea. Genotypic differences between tea cultivars have been observed as a metabolic response to phosphorus deficiency. However, little is known about how the phosphorus supply mediates the effect of shading on metabolites and how plant cultivar gene expression affects green tea quality. We elucidated the responses of the green tea cultivar Longjing43 under three light intensity levels and two levels of phosphorus supply based on a metabolomic analysis by GCxGC-TOF/MS (Two-dimensional Gas Chromatography coupled to Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry) and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS (Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry), a targeted analysis by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography), and a gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR. In young shoots, the phosphorus concentration increased in line with the phosphate supply, and elevated light intensities were positively correlated with catechins, especially with epigallocatechin of Longjing43. Moreover, when the phosphorus concentration was sufficient, total amino acids in young shoots were enhanced by moderate shading which did not occur under phosphorus deprivation. By metabolomic analysis, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (PTT) were enriched due to light and phosphorus effects. Under shaded conditions, SPX2 (Pi transport, stress, sensing, and signaling), SWEET3 (bidirectional sugar transporter), AAP (amino acid permeases), and GSTb (glutathione S-transferase b) shared the same analogous correlations with primary and secondary metabolite pathways. Taken together, phosphorus status is a crucial factor when shading is applied to increase green tea quality.

AB  - Compelling data support altered dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) signaling in anorexia nervosa (AN). However, their exact role in the etiopathogenesis of AN has yet to be elucidated. Here, we evaluated the cor-ticolimbic brain levels of DA and 5-HT in the induction and recovery phases of the activity-based anorexia (ABA) model of AN. We exposed female rats to the ABA paradigm and measured the levels of DA, 5-HT, the metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and the dopaminergic type 2 (D2) receptors density in feeding-and reward-implicated brain regions (i.e., cerebral cortex, Cx; prefrontal cortex, PFC; caudate putamen, CPu; nucleus accumbens, NAcc; amygdala, Amy; hypo-thalamus, Hyp; hippocampus, Hipp). DA levels were significantly increased in the Cx, PFC and NAcc, while 5-HT was significantly enhanced in the NAcc and Hipp of ABA rats. Following recovery, DA was still elevated in the NAcc, while 5-HT was increased in the Hyp of recovered ABA rats. DA and 5-HT turnover were impaired at both ABA induction and recovery. D2 receptors density was increased in the NAcc shell. These results provide further proof of the impairment of the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems in the brain of ABA rats and support the knowledge of the involvement of these two important neurotransmitter systems in the development and pro-gression of AN. Thus, providing new insights on the corticolimbic regions involved in the monoamine dysre-gulations in the ABA model of AN.

AB  - Substance use disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and available pharmacological treatments are of modest efficacy. Histamine is a biogenic amine with four types of receptors. The histamine H-3 receptor (H3R) is an autoreceptor and also an heteroreceptor. H(3)Rs are highly expressed in the basal ganglia, hippocampus and cortex, and regulate a number of neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, GABA and dopamine. Its function and localization suggest that the H3R may be relevant to a number of psychiatric disorders and could represent a potential therapeutic target for substance use disorders. The purpose of the present review is to summarize preclinical studies investigating the effects of H3R agonists and antagonists on animal models of alcohol, nicotine and psychostimulant use. At present, the effects of H3R antagonists such as thioperamide, pitolisant or ciproxifan have been investigated in drug-induced locomotion, conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, reinstatement, sensitization and drug discrimination. For alcohol and nicotine, the effects of H3R ligands on two-bottle choice and memory tasks, respectively, have also been investigated. The results of these studies are inconsistent. For alcohol, H3R antagonists generally decreased the reward-related properties of ethanol, which suggests that H3R antagonists may be effective as a treatment option for alcohol use disorder. However, the effects of H3R antagonists on nicotine and psychostimulant motivation and reward are less clear. H3R antagonists potentiated the abuse-related properties of nicotine, but only a handful of studies have been conducted. For psychostimulants, evidence is mixed and suggests that more research is needed to establish whether H3R antagonists are a viable therapeutic option. The fact that different drugs of abuse have different brain targets may explain the differential effects of H3R ligands.

AB  - In plants, homospermidine synthase (HSS) is a pathway-specific enzyme initiating the biosynthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which function as a chemical defense against herbivores. In PA-producing Convolvulaceae ("morning glories"), HSS originated from deoxyhypusine synthase at least >50 to 75 million years ago via a gene duplication event and subsequent functional diversification. To study the recruitment of this ancient gene duplicate to PA biosynthesis, the presence of putative hss gene copies in 11 Convolvulaceae species was analyzed. Additionally, various plant parts from seven of these species were screened for the presence of PAs. Although all of these species possess a putative hss copy, PAs could only be detected in roots of Ipomoea neei (Spreng.) O'Donell and Distimake quinquefolius (L.) A.R.Simoes & Staples in this study. A precursor of PAs was detected in roots of Ipomoea alba L. Thus, despite sharing high sequence identities, the presence of an hss gene copy does not correlate with PA accumulation in particular species of Convolvulaceae. In vitro activity assays of the encoded enzymes revealed a broad spectrum of enzyme activity, further emphasizing a functional diversity of the hss gene copies. A recently identified HSS specific amino acid motif seems to be important for the loss of the ancestral protein function-the activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Thus, the motif might be indicative for a change of function but allows not to predict the new function. This emphasizes the challenges in annotating functions for duplicates, even for duplicates from closely related species.

AB  - Background: Exercise is acknowledged for its beneficial effects on brain health; however, the intricate underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Aims: This study aimed to explore aerobic exercise-induced metabolic alterations in the brain. Methods: We conducted an eight-week treadmill running exercise program in two-month-old male C57/BL6J mice. Body weight, serum lipid, glucose levels, and spatial cognition were measured. Spatial metabolomic analysis was performed to compare the metabolomic profiles across different brain regions. Immunohistochemical methods were used to compare the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1c (CPT1c). Results: Exercise induced significant changes in the analysed metabolomic profiles. There were 904 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) detected in the whole brain section. Notable alterations in lipid profiles were observed, and among the 292 lipids detected, there were 74 (25.34 %), 85 (29.11 %), and 78 (26.71 %) lipids differentially expressed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus of the Exe group, respectively. Lipid metabolism related pathways and enzymes were also altered, with L-carnitine and CPT1c upregulated in the three regions (p<0.05), and epinephrine levels decreased in the hippocampus (p<0.05). Furthermore, the vitamin B6 metabolism pathway was altered in the hypothalamus. Conclusions: This study highlighted the significant changes in lipid metabolism induced by involuntary exercise in the brains of young male mice. Exercise also altered epinephrine levels and the vitamin B12 metabolic pathway in specific brain regions, which indicated the multifaceted effects of exercise on the brain.

AB  - Waterlettuce, Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae: Pistieae) is an invasive free-floating aquatic weed found throughout the world that has been targeted for control using various methods including classical and conservation bio-logical control and, herbicides. In Florida, herbicides are the primary strategy employed by land managers, often without regard to the impact of herbivorous arthropods including Samea multiplicalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Elophila [=Synclita] obliteralis Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Argyractis [=Petrophila] dru-malis (Dyer) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Draeculacephala inscripta VanDuzee (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), Rho-palosiphum nymphaeae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Orthogalumna terebrantis Wallwork (Acarina: Galumnidae), and Neohydronomus affinis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea). A series of field experiments from 2009 to 2012 were conducted at three sites in Florida to quantify the levels of suppression by these species, using an insecticide-check approach to produce restricted and unrestricted herbivory conditions. Four of the species (E. obliteralis, S. multiplicalis, O. terebrantis, and N. affinis) were found at every field site. At the end of the experiment, plots exposed to unrestricted herbivory contained 63.1 % less biomass and covered 32.0 % less surface area compared to plots with restricted herbivory. These results indicate that naturally occurring and introduced species are suppressing the growth of waterlettuce populations in the field in Florida. Future research will examine the synergistic potential of actively managing herbicides and herbivorous arthropods to suppress waterlettuce.

AB  - Stylotermitidae appear peculiar among all termites, feeding in trunks of living trees in South Asia only. The difficulty to collect them limits the ability to study them, and they thus still belong to critically unknown groups in respect to their biology. We used a combination of microscopic observations, chemical analysis and behavioural tests, to determine the source and chemical nature of the trail-following pheromone of Stylotermes faveolus from India and S. halumicus from Taiwan. The sternal gland located at the 5th abdominal segment was the exclusive source of the trail-following pheromone in both S. faveolus and S. halumicus, and it is made up of class I, II and III secretory cells. Using gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry, (3Z)-dodec-3-en-1-ol (DOE) was identified as the trail-following pheromone which elicits strong behavioural responses in workers at a threshold around 10(- 4) ng/cm and 0.1 ng/gland. Our results confirm the switch from complex aldehyde trail-following pheromones occurring in the basal groups to simpler linear alcohols in the ancestor of Kalotermitidae and Neoisoptera.

AB  - The fires that occur in Southwestern Turkey in July and August 2021 were recorded as the biggest fires in the history of the Republic for the region. The burned forest area is more than 66 000 hectares. This study aims to evaluate the situation of wildlife after catastrophic wildfires in terms of unique felids of the region: caracal (Caracal caracal) and wildcat (Felis silvestris). Study was conducted using empirical techniques at fire sites in Mugla province of Turkey during eighteen days in August 2021. Two transects were identified for each four fire effected zone as "burned" and "unburned" site. Total distance covered by vehicle transect was 2000 km with four repeated interval during the survey. It has been figured out that wildfires effecting large mammals and felids in two ways as direct (deaths caused by fire) and indirect effect (habitat loss, fire migration and releated deaths). 194 individual recorded as indirectly effected and 11 individual (9 wildboar, 2 Southwest Asian badger) recorded as directly effected by the wildfires. 5 caracal were recorded during fire migration. A caracal carcass was found on highway. The caracal population in the region survived the fires with the least damage. On the other hand, wildcat habitats were completly burned during the fires. Although recolonization after massive wildfires is a natural succession process for many large herbivores and carnivores, Mediterrenaen wildcats of Anatolia could be an exception. They have very isolated and fragile population in Mugla. Wildlife corridors sould be planned to support post-fire succession and wildcat colonisation of burned site. In order to investigate this situation, temporal and spatial habitat use and diet analyzes are planned for caracal and wild cat for the next step.

AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies suggest the possible effect of risperidone on brain reward system and D1 and D2 dopamine receptors' involvement in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP).AimsThe present study was designed to investigate the effect of risperidone as an atypical antipsychotic drug on morphine-induced CPP and D2-like dopamine receptor gene expression in rat.Materials and MethodsAn unbiased CPP paradigm was used to study the effect of risperidone. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of risperidone (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) was performed 30 min before the morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) injection and just after the rat was placed in the CPP box. The open field test was used to assay the locomotor activity of animal. The gene expression of D2 dopamine receptor in hippocampus was measured by real-time PCR technique. The hippocampi of rats were also used for histology evaluation.ResultsMorphine-produced (10 mg/kg) CPP and morphine-induced CPP were reversed only by the administration of a low dose of risperidone (1 mg/kg). Low dose of risperidone (1 mg/kg) showed no effect on locomotor activity but a higher dose of risperidone (2 and 4 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity. Real-time PCR data analysis revealed that the gene expression of D2 dopamine receptor had significant difference between morphine and a 1 mg/kg dose of risperidone. Moreover, in histological evaluation, apoptosis was observed in the morphine group, whereas there was no evidence of apoptosis in the risperidone-treated groups.ConclusionOur results suggest that risperidone (1 mg/kg) reverses the morphine-induced CPP and may reduce the rewarding properties of morphine. It is also demonstrated that risperidone decreases the expression of D2 receptor in rat hippocampus. Therefore, risperidone can be considered potential adjunct therapy in morphine dependence.

AB  - The amygdala has been implicated in a variety of functions linked to emotions. One popular view is that the amygdala modulates consolidation in other brain systems thought to be mainly involved in learning and memory processes. This series of experiments represents a further exploration into the role of the amygdala in memory modulation and consolidation. One interesting line of research has shown that drugs of abuse, like amphetamine, produce dendritic changes in select brain regions and these changes are thought to be equivalent to a usurping of normal plasticity processes. We were interested in the possibility that this modulation of plasticity processes would be dependent on interactions with the amygdala. According to the modulation view of amygdala function, amphetamine would activate modulation mechanisms in the amygdala that would alter plasticity processes in other brain regions. If the amygdala was rendered dysfunctional, these effects should not occur. Accordingly, this series of experiments evaluated the effects of extensive neurotoxic amygdala damage on amphetamine-induced dendritic changes in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. The results showed that rats with large lesions of the amygdala showed the normal pattern of dendritic changes in these brain regions. This pattern of results suggests that the action of not all memory modulators, activated during emotional events, require the amygdala to impact memory.

AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is emerging as a crucial sphingolipid modulating neuroinflammation and cognition. S1P levels in the brain have been found to be decreased in cognitive impairment. S1P lyase (S1PL) is the key enzyme in metabolizing S1P and has been implicated in neuroinflammation. This study evaluated the effect of S1PL inhibition on cognition in type 2 diabetic mice. Fingolimod (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) rescued cognition in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, as evident in the Y maze and passive avoidance test. We further evaluated the effect of fingolimod on the activation of microglia in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of diabetic mice. Our study revealed that fingolimod inhibited S1PL and pro-moted anti-inflammatory microglia in both PFC and hippocampus of diabetic mice as it increased Ym-1 and arginase-1. The levels of p53 and apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3) were elevated in the PFC and hippo-campus of type 2 diabetic mice which fingolimod reversed. The underlying mechanism promoting anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype was also explored in this study. TIGAR, TP53-associated glycolysis and apoptosis regulator, is known to foster anti-inflammatory microglia and was found to be downregulated in the brain of type 2 diabetic mice. S1PL inhibition decreased the levels of p53 and promoted TIGAR, thereby increasing anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype and inhibiting apoptosis in the brain of diabetic mice. Our study reveals that S1PL inhibition could be beneficial in mitigating cognitive deficits in diabetic mice.

AB  - This article seeks to identify at what point in hominid evolution language would have become adaptive. It starts by recalling the distinction between kin-selected altruism and reciprocal altruism, noting that the former is characteristic of social insects while the latter is found among some species of social mammal. Reciprocal altruism depends on the exchange of information assuring partners of the other's continued friendly intent, as in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The article focuses on species that practice "fission-fusion": social behaviour, where the alternation between larger and smaller parties creates greater uncertainty as to individuals' continued commitment to reciprocity. The greatest uncertainty arises in "atomistic" fission-fusion, where individuals leave and join foraging groups independently. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and human hunter-gatherers practice this type of social behaviour. There is less uncertainty where the smaller social unit is an extended family, as among vampire bats, chacma baboons, and savanna elephants. A comparison of the repertoire of calls and gestures among these species indicates that chimpanzees and bonobos have the largest repertoires. I then point out that, thanks to the higher proportion of meat in the diet, hunter-gatherers must live in far more dispersed communities than chimpanzees or bonobos, yet they practice more complex patterns of cooperation and reciprocity. This, I argue, created a social environment in which language became particularly adaptive. Homo heidelbergensis is identified as the key species in which language could have originated, during the transition between the Lower and Middle Paleolithic.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistances (AMR) present a particularly challenging cross-sectoral policy problem, affecting human and animal health as well as the environment. Compared to the actual problem pressure, the public awareness for AMR is comparatively low and the issue has not been high on the political agenda in most. Given the rising problem pressure, we aim to find out as to what degree and under which conditions political parties bring AMR on the political agenda. By means of multilevel logit regressions based on 173 electoral manifestos in 30 European countries from 2015 to 2020, we explore the conditions that explain whether AMR are taken up in manifestos. The empirical findings indicate firstly that AMR are only addressed by political parties in Northern and Western Europe, in no case in Eastern, and only in one case in Southern Europe, though resistant bacteria are more widely spread in the latter. Secondly, Green parties are those who are most likely to address the AMR challenge. Thirdly, vote share is positively associated with AMR agenda-setting, while EU membership is insignificant and the national average on antibiotics consumption is negatively related to AMR agenda-setting. Finally, AMR are surprisingly mainly perceived as a problem of the agricultural policy subsystem despite its cross-sectoral policy character. The study makes theoretical and empirical contributions: regarding theory, the article shows that typical variables that are used for agenda-setting are less explanatory for complex intersectoral policies. This is also accompanied by the empirical contribution: since problem awareness and complexity of policy problems are correlated, AMR are reduced to an agricultural issue and as such, it is taken over by political parties that have expertise on agricultural-environmental topics.

AB  - Objective: Whilst the dominant temporal lobe has a well-established role in memory, the functions of its nondominant counterpart remain enigmatic. We compared the lateralizing ability of a promising spatial memory task (Brown Location Test, BLT) to other commonly used verbal and visual memory tasks in a sample of patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: Neuropsychological data from 48 TLE patients (right n = 28 and left n = 20) were compared on several verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between test scores and the odds of being categorised as right or left TLE, while multivariable logistic regression and decision tree analyses were used to establish the optimal combination of cognitive measures for lateralizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Results: Relative to normative expectations, the right TLE group was specifically impaired on BLT measures, whereas the left TLE group was impaired on verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. The combination of BLT Delayed Recall and Delayed Recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT) was identified as optimal for correctly predicting EZ laterality (AUC = 0.79). These two variables were also optimal predictors in the decision tree analysis, correctly predicting 79% of the overall sample (AUC = 0.83). Conclusions: Our findings support the BLT as a measure of right temporal lobe function. They demonstrate its superior sensitivity compared to another commonly used nonverbal memory test (i.e., Visual Reproduction; VR) and highlight the added lateralizing value of combining both verbal and nonverbal memory measures in the neuropsychological evaluation of epilepsy surgery candidates.

AB  - Foraging in leafcutter ants alternates between periods of inactivity and activity that extend over several days or weeks. Many factors could influence this alternation, with a preponderance of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and rain. Moreover, ant colony size and the management practices used for their control could also modify the cycles of activity/inactivity. We surveyed the foraging activity of the nests of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens (Linnaeus) in Eucalyptus plantations and evaluated the relative importance on foraging activity of temperature, past possible immediate experience in foraging, and use of machinery. Twenty transects with an average of 6 colonies in each were selected. Each nest was checked for foraging activity once in different months of the year and we investigated whether foraging inactivity was influenced by nest size, temperature, number of favourable hours for foraging on the day preceding the evaluation, and the use of agricultural machinery. The management practices of A. sexdens nests in Eucalyptus plantations had no influence on the occurrence of foraging inactivity, contrary to nest size and possible past immediate experience in foraging. The probability of foraging inactivity decreased by about 23% for each 10 m2 increment in the nest size. A nest was also more likely to be active on a certain day if the conditions for foraging activity had been favourable on the preceding day. Leaf-cutting ants are one of the main herbivores in Brazil, often reaching pest status in several crops. Our results indicate that the efficiency of their control in Eucalyptus plantations could be increased by implementing control strategies several times a year and by increasing the number of bait applications in areas with a high density of small nests (less than 20 m2), as these areas are more prone to inactivity and thus may lead to increased control failures.

AB  - Domestic animals use a varied set of strategies (behavioural- and physiological-type) to cope with aversive situations at rearing systems. Camels, although widely used as an animal model for the study of strategies to cope with heat stress and dehydration in desert-type natural habitats, remain disregarded for their coping styles in response to social stressors at man -made environments, in which they are progressively gaining presence for their sustainability traits. In this scenario, the present paper has explored the concept of coping with social stressors from a behavioral perspective in leisure dromedary camels kept at human -driven settings. By means of a multivariate statistical analysis, those animal -dependent factors that exert significant influence (p<0.05) on the type of behavioural-type coping styles (proactivity and reactivity) displayed by leisure dromedaries in response to social stressors at man -made environments have been identified. Negative reinforcement strategies, together with the use of a combination of visual and auditory stimuli, favor the proactivity in leisure dromedaries. On behalf of their condition as social species, the presence of congeners also promotes proactive coping behaviour. Sexual hormones and selection make male dromedaries more proactive as age increases, whereas this condition enhances reactivity coping responses in females. Hence, training protocols are recommended to be initiated at the earliest ages possible to reduce the probability of undesired reactivity as the animal grows and to encourage proactive attitudes as quickly as possible in females and males, respectively. However, the castration of the animals once sexual maturity is reached and domestication protocols for their functional aptitude are initiated, will stimulate not only general organic development but also proactive behaviour. With reference to body language signals, the more backward the ears are, the greater the proactivity of the camel is expected. The present results will make possible the tailoring of training protocols for leisure camels to improve the safety of humancamel interaction, valorize camels for new potential niches (i.e., assisted therapy), and enhance the list of breeding criteria for behavioral traits in these animals.

AB  - To investigate the efficiency of policy schemes to attract renewable energy investments, it is essential to analyze the impacts on returns and risks with consideration of the circumstances that affect the projects. The present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of net metering, tax incentives, and subsidized loans on the return and risk of the distributed generation (DG) of electricity from swine farm biogas in three different locations in Brazil. In the academic literature, studies exist that focus on the economic feasibility of different biogas substrates and their economic and operational aspects, but these studies do not include an integrated approach with a stochastic analysis of the modeling of the uncertainties along with an investigation of the impacts of the regulatory context. The main study contribution is to present a holistic approach that allows for the comparison of risks and returns under the following uncertainties and conditions: the uncertainty present in each stage of the swine cycle that directly impacts biogas production; the uncertainty in modeling of energy tariffs, which have different behaviors in each location analyzed, the assessment of the impact of the different tax incentive levels offered in each location, and the identification of the effect of the subsidized loan offer on the return and risk results of these investments. To compare these, the project was dimensioned, and the specific uncertainties and tax incentive conditions for each analyzed scenario were modeled in the posterior. Through Monte Carlo simulation, the stochastic net present values of the scenarios for each location was estimated, and statistical tests compared the returns and risk between the scenarios. The results showed that a greater probability of high energy tariffs along with greater tax incentives result in high returns and low risk for investments in swine biogas DG. However, when tax incentives are low, risks increase, and the relevance of subsidized loans becomes more significant, indicating that there is a complementarity between incentives and subsidies to the net metering scheme.

AB  - IntroductionSelf-incompatibility (SI) is an important strategy for plants to maintain abundant variation to enhance their adaptability to the environment. Camellia oleifera is one of the most important woody oil plants and is widely cultivated in China. Late acting self-incompatibility (LSI) in C. oleifera results in a relatively poor fruit yield in the natural state, and understanding of the LSI mechanism remains limited. MethodsTo better understand the molecular expression and gene coexpression network in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera, we conducted self- and cross-pollination experiments at two different flower bud developmental stages (3-4 d before flowering and 1 d before flowering), and cytological observation, fruit setting rate (FSR) investigation and RNA-Seq analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism of the male -female interaction and identify hub genes responsible for the LSI in C. oleifera. ResultsBased on the 21 ovary transcriptomes, a total of 7669 DEGs were identified after filtering out low-expression genes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) divided the DEGs into 15 modules. Genes in the blue module (1163 genes) were positively correlated with FSR, and genes in the pink module (339 genes) were negatively correlated with FSR. KEGG analysis indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis, plant MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and plant-pathogen interaction were the crucial pathways for the LSI reaction. Fifty four transcription factors (TFs) were obtained in the two key modules, and WRKY and MYB were potentially involved in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera. Network establishment indicated that genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine (lecRLK), isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase-like (CYP81Q32), cytochrome P450 87A3-like (CYP87A3), and probable calcium-binding protein (CML41) were the hub genes that positively responded to the LSI reaction. The other DEGs inside the two modules, including protein RALF-like 10 (RALF), F-box and pectin acetylesterase (MTERF5), might also play vital roles in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera. DiscussionOverall, our study provides a meaningful resource for gene network studies of the LSI reaction process and subsequent analyses of pollen-pistil interactions and TF roles in the LSI reaction, and it also provides new insights for exploring the mechanisms of the LSI response.

AB  - Predator colour preference enables the recognition of prey items, and can be useful when designing potential feed. However, the preferred food colour varies depending on the surrounding background colour and light intensity. This study aimed to determine whether the food colour can increase the preference for non-live food, as seahorses prefer live food. Food colour preferences were determined by observing the first response (approach and ingestion) of a sub-adult Hippocampus barbouri, using different background colours. Seahorses (SL: 7.56 +/- 0.35 cm and WW: 0.58 +/- 0.10 g) were reared in tanks with red, blue and green backgrounds. Sergestid shrimp Acetes sibogae (TL: 1.00 +/- 0.05 cm), were used as the tested food, dyed blue, green, red or yellow, while non-dyed shrimp were used as a control. During the trial, shrimp of two different colours were presented against three different backgrounds within the seahorse's visual field. The frequency of the first response was recorded, and a quantitative analysis was made using a chi-square of independence test and Thurstone's law of comparative judgment. Against all backgrounds, the first response was significantly biased toward non- dyed shrimp. Yellow- and greendyed shrimp were also significantly preferred against green and red backgrounds, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrated that sub-adult H. barbouri has colour preferences. However, further study is required to confirm colour vision in H. barbouri.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSheep whey protein (SWP), Fu brick tea polysaccharides (FBTP) and stachyose (STA) have been shown to improve immunity, but little is known about the regulatory effect of SWP, FBTP, STA and their combined formula (CF) on immune function and intestinal metabolism of immunosuppressed mice induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX). RESULTSAdministration of SWP, FBTP, STA or CF restored the levels of body weight, immune organ index, immune organ morphology, cytokines and immunoglobulins in CTX immunosuppressed mice. Interestingly, CF improved all the mentioned parameters more effective than administration of SWP, FBTP or STA alone. In addition, CF was more effective to increase the levels of intestinal immune-related gene expression than FBTP, SWP or STA alone in immunosuppressed mice, suggesting that CF exhibited excellent intestinal immune regulation function. CF also significantly improved cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids of CTX-treated mice. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis demonstrated that CF recovered the levels of 28 metabolites associated with the CTX treatment to the levels of normal mice. CONCLUSIONConclusively, these findings suggested that CF as a functional food combination of SWP, FBTP and STA could promote the immune function against human diseases, which providing theoretical support for the co-ingestion of SWP and functional sugars as a feasible strategy for improving the body immunity in the future.

AB  - The central route of streptozotocin (STZ) administration has been introduced as a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease (AD). Curcumin was suggested to possess possible neuroprotective effects, which may be profitable in AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin hinders its beneficial effects in clinical studies. Earlier studies suggested that a bovine serum albumin-based nanocurcumin, produces superior neuroprotective effects compared to natural curcumin. In the present study, the protective effect of nanocurcumin in rat model of central STZ induced memory impairment was assessed. In addition, due to the importance of the hippocampus in memory, the amounts of hippocampal active caspase-3, Akt, and CaMKII- alpha were evaluated. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 250 -300 g were used. STZ (icv) was injected during days 1 and 3 (3 mg/kg in divided), and nanocurcumin or curcumin 50 mg/kg/oral gavage was administered daily during days 4 -14. Morris water maze training was performed on days 15 -17, and the retention memory test was achieved on the 18th day. Following memory assessment, the rats were sacrificed and the hippocampi were used to assess caspase-3 cleavage, Akt, and CaMKII- alpha signaling. The findings revealed that nanocurcumin ingestion (but not natural curcumin) in the dose of 50 mg/kg was capable to prevent the impairment of water maze learning and memory induced by central STZ. Molecular assessments indicated that STZ treatment increased the caspase-3 cleavage in the hippocampus while deactivating Akt and CaMKII- alpha. Nanocurcumin reduced caspase-3 cleavage to a non-significant level compared to control group and restored Akt and CaMKII- alpha within the hippocampus while natural curcumin exerted no significant effect. These findings might suggest that nanocurcumin can restore memory deficit, hippocampal apoptosis as well as Akt and CaMKII- alpha signaling disruption associated with brain insulin resistance.

AB  - XBP1 is a transcription factor that plays a central role in controlling cellular responses to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Under stress conditions, the transcriptionally active form of XBP1 is generated by splicing of XBP1 mRNA by the ER-resident protein inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha (IRE1 alpha). This study aimed to investigate the role of XBP1 in male reproductive disorders. XBP1s-overexpressing goat spermatogonial stem cells (gSSCs) showed higher proliferative ability in vitro and in vivo. These cells also showed higher antioxidant capacity. In comparison, XBP1 knockdown significantly suppressed proliferation. Further analysis showed that XBP1 could stimulate the secretion of IL-6 from macrophages. Overall, the results indicate that XBP1s functions to enhance the proliferation ability and antioxidant capacity of gSSCs, potentially through a mechanism involving the regulation of gSSCs by macrophages.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, interest in improving the welfare of wild species in captivity has grown. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of different social environments and management systems on the cortisol secretion of fourteen white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) living under different conditions by using use noninvasive methods. The fecal glucocorticoid metabolite secretion was found to be affected by both management systems and social interactions. Additionally, sex is another factor that seems to influence. This research provides a deeper understanding of glucocorticoid production in white rhinoceroses, but more studies are needed to fully understand its influence on reproductive biology. White rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) are the most social and gregarious species of all rhinoceroses known worldwide. One of the most critical effects of elevated glucocorticoid concentrations, especially in threatened species, is its relation to chronic stress, which could potentially lead to immunosuppression and reduced reproductive activity. Our aim is to determine how different social environments and management systems might be influencing the secretion of fecal glucocorticoids in white rhinoceroses. We have analyzed the concentration of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in 658 fecal samples from 14 white rhinoceroses, seven free-ranging rhinos, and seven rhinos from two different managed captive populations. HPLC techniques were used to determine the main glucocorticoid metabolite found in this species, and a competitive EIA was used to establish fecal 5 alpha-pregnan-3 3 beta, 11 beta, 21-triol-20-oneglucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels. Our results reveal that management systems and social interactions had an influence on fGCM levels, suggesting that the more restrictive the management and social conditions are, the higher the glucocorticoid concentrations that are found. Additionally, sex was also found to influence fGCM levels, as in females, fGCM concentrations were higher than in males. We conclude that the analysis of glucocorticoids in relation to other factors is a powerful tool to assess adrenocortical response in white rhinoceros in order to broaden the knowledge of their reproductive biology and improve the management of the species.

AB  - Mirtazapine (MIRT) is a multi-target antidepressant used in treatment of severe depression with promising efficacy, but also with important side effects, mainly sedation and weight gain. Thus, the present study aimed to test the effects of the neuroprotective antioxidant lipoic acid (ALA) in the reversal of weight and metabolic changes induced by MIRT in corticosterone-induced depression model in mice, as well as proposed mechanisms for their association antidepressant and pro-cognitive effects. To do these male Swiss mice received Tween 80 (control), corticosterone (CORT 20 mg / kg), MIRT (3 mg / kg) and ALA (100 or 200 mg / kg), alone or associated for 21 days. After this, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests for affective and cognitive domains. Daily weight changes, blood cholesterol fractions and corticosterone were measured. Also, hippocampus (HC) protein expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT), synaptophysin, protein kinase B-Akt (total and phosphorylated) and the cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 were investigated. CORT induced a marked depression-like behavior, memory deficits, metabolic changes (total cholesterol and LDL) and increased serum corticosterone. Also, CORT increased SERT expression in the HC. MIRT alone or combined with ALA sustained its antidepressant-like effect, as well as reversed CORT-induced impairment in spatial recognition memory. Additionally, the association MIRT+ALA200 reversed the weight gain induced by the former antidepressant, as well as reduced serum corticosterone levels and SERT expression in the HC. ALA alone induced significant weight loss and reduced total cholesterol and HDL fraction. Our findings provide promising evidence about the ALA potential to prevent metabolic and weight changes associated to MIRT, without impair its antidepressant and pro-cognition actions. Therefore, ALA+MIRT combination could represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating depression with less side effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic bacterium known as a nosocomial pathogen, but it is able to colonize a multitude of ecological niches, both free-living and host-associated. For this reason, the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in wildlife is an indicator that resistant bacteria of human- or livestock-origin are widespread in the environment. Wild animals can act as efficient reservoirs and epidemiological links between humans, livestock, and natural environments. Despite the renewal of interest in epidemiology, there is a critical lack of an unbiased ecological approaches to defining reservoirs and sources of infections. The aims of the present study were to investigate the occurrence of K. pneumoniae in wildlife, to characterize antimicrobial features through phenotypic and whole genome sequencing approaches, and to identify similar available sequences that could suggest a transmission event. Despite Klebsiella pneumoniae being widely recognized as a nosocomial pathogen, there is a critical lack in defining its reservoirs and sources of infections. Most studies on risk factors have focused on multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates and clinically-oriented questions. Over a two-year period, we sampled 131 wild animals including mammal and bird species from three regions of Central Italy. All typical colonies isolated from the analytical portions were confirmed by real-time PCR and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). All confirmed K. pneumoniae isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to 29 antimicrobials and subjected to whole genome sequencing. Typical colonies were detected in 17 samples (13%), which were identified as K. pneumoniae (n = 16) and as K. quasipneumoniae (n = 1) by MALDI-TOF MS. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile showed that all the isolates were resistant to beta-lactams (ceftobiprole, cloxacillin, cefazolin) and tetracycline; resistance to ertapenem and trimethoprim was observed and nine out of 16 K. pneumoniae isolates (56.2%) were classified as MDR. Genomic characterization allowed the detection of fluoroquinolone resistance-associated efflux pumps, fosfomycin and beta-lactamase resistance genes, and virulence genes in the overall dataset. The cluster analysis of two isolates detected from wild boar with available clinical genomes showed the closest similarity. This study highlights the link between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, showing that the current knowledge on this ecological context is lacking and that the potential health risks are underestimated.

AB  - Ghrelin (Ghrl) is an orexigenic peptide with potential roles in the modulation of anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OB) in rodents. In the present work, we assessed whether intrahippocampal Ghrl could reverse OB-induced depressive-like and amnesic effects by regulating molecular mechanisms related to neuroplasticity. Adult female albino Swiss mice were divided into sham and OB groups, and infused with saline (S) or Ghrl 0.03 nmol/& micro;l, 0.3 nmol/& micro;l, or 3 nmol/& micro;l into the hippocampus before exposition to open-field test (OFT) and tail suspension test (TST) or immediately after training in the object recognition test (ORT). After test phase in ORT, animals were euthanized and their hippocampi were dissected to study the expression of genes related to memory. The OB-S animals presented hyperlocomotion in OFT, increased immobility in TST and memory impairment compared to sham-S (p < 0.05), but acute intrahippocampal infusion of Ghrl 0.3 nmol/& micro;l produced an improvement on these parameters in OB animals (p < 0.05). In addition, this dose of Ghrl reversed OB-induced low expression of NMDA1 and MAPK1 iso1 and up-regulated the expression of CaMKIIa iso1 and iso2, and MAPK1 iso2 (p < 0.05). These results extend the existing literature regarding OBinduced behavioral and neurochemical changes, and provide mechanisms that could underlie the antidepressant effect of Ghrl in this model.

AB  - Ketamine is noted for its rapid onset antidepressant response and effectiveness in patients with treatment resistant depression. While most research has focused on glutamatergic mechanisms, recent studies show that antidepressant-like effects in rodents are dependent upon the serotonergic (5-HT) system and suggest a potential contribution of the 5-HT1B receptor. In this study we utilized CP-94253 to examine whether 5-HT1B receptor agonism produces rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects, focusing on rodent models and treatment approaches commonly used to demonstrate the differentiated response to ketamine. We first confirmed that CP94253 is a potent 5-HT1B agonist in vitro and that CP-94253 occupies brain 5-HT1B receptors at the doses tested. CP-94253 reduced immobility in the mouse forced swim test (FST) and exhibited a prominent antidepressant signature in the mouse-behavior phenotyping platform SmartCube (R). When examined 24 h after acute treatment, CP-94253 reduced FST immobility in both na & iuml;ve rats and in rats receiving chronic interferon alpha treatment. Ex vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation was also enhanced in na & iuml;ve rats receiving acute CP-94253 treatment, 24 h prior to the recordings. In mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress, antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension and sucrose preference tests were seen 1 h and 24 h after acute treatment, respectively. Finally, whole brain c-fos imaging in mice showed that CP-94253 modulates neuronal activity in discrete brain regions including the lateral habenula circuit implicated in depression and the ketamine treatment response. Collectively these results support the further investigation of 5-HT1B agonism as a novel treatment approach for major depressive disorder.

AB  - The unique mammalian appendage antler is a good model for studying tissue regeneration and its related mechanism. This study explored the mechanism of the rapid growth of regenerated antlers after top pruning damage using transcriptome sequencing technology. A damage repair model was constructed by top pruning treatment on the left antlers of three 10 -month -old Tarim red deer, and RNA-seq analysis was performed on the Illumina platform to compare the transcriptome sequencing results of the left regenerated antlers with the right healthy antlers. Among a total of 56 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were screened, 37 were up -regulated and 19 were down -regulated; the most significant changes were seen for the BVES gene (up -regulated gene); thus, this gene was further explored. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry further indicated a higher expression of BVES in the mesenchymal tissues of regenerated antlers than in the antler skin, cartilage, and bone tissues after top pruning treatment (P < 0.05); the brown immunohistochemical reaction products were concentrated in the mesenchymal cell membranes and intercellular matrix of healthy and regenerated antlers. Our results suggested that the repair process of antler damage after top pruning treatment mainly promotes the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and T lymphocytes through biological signals such as WNT, IHH, and IL2RA to ensure the development of antler tissue again after top pruning. To sum up, our data implied that BVES gene regulated mesenchymal stem cells' proliferation and differentiation activities in response to ischemic stimuli to promote the healing and rapid growth of wounded antlers.

AB  - Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis captured in directed commercial longline fisheries in Canada and the USA that are below the legal minimum size for retention must be returned to the sea without incurring additional injury. Estimates of mortality caused by discarding sublegal-sized fish are included in annual estimates of total mortality from all sources and affect the results of stock assessment and the yield available to fisheries. Currently, an average discard mortality rate (DMR) of 16% is applied to all sublegal-sized longline discards. These discards consist of fish that suffer injuries ranging from minor to severe. The 16% DMR that is currently applied was derived by averaging injury-specific DMRs that in turn assume 3.5% mortality of Pacific Halibut that are released to the sea with only minor injuries. The latter has been derived experimentally but only in captivity. Here, we used acceleration-logging pop-up archival transmitting tags to infer individual survival outcomes for Pacific Halibut that were released in situ following capture on longline gear. Postrelease behavioral data were evaluated for 75 fish that were at liberty for 2-96 d. Three fish were confidently inferred to have died after periods at liberty of 41-80 d, and another three fish may have died 96 d after release, resulting in minimum and maximum estimated 96-d postrelease DMRs of 4.2% (range = 0.0-8.7%) and 8.4% (range = 1.7-14.6%), respectively. These ranges are consistent with the currently applied value of 3.5%. However, the observation that no mortalities occurred until after 40 d postrelease departs from the findings of captive studies, in which the majority of capture-induced mortality occurred within 20 d of release.

AB  - Growing evidence shows that the lung is an organ prone to injury by diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular mechanisms of these pulmonary complications have not yet been characterized comprehensively. To systematically study the effects of insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia on the lung, we combined proteomics and lipidomics with quantitative histomorphological analyses to compare lung tissue samples from a clinically relevant pig model for mutant INS gene-induced diabetes of youth (MIDY) with samples from wild-type littermate controls. Among others, the level of pulmonary surfactant- associated protein A (SFTPA1), a biomarker of lung injury, was moderately elevated. Furthermore, key proteins related to humoral immune response and extracellular matrix organization were significantly altered in abundance. Importantly, a lipoxygenase pathway was dysregulated as indicated by 2.5-fold reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acid lipoxygenase ALOX15 levels, associated with corresponding changes in the levels of lipids influenced by this enzyme. Our multi-omics study points to an involvement of reduced ALOX15 levels and an associated lack of eicosanoid switching as mechanisms contributing to a proinflammatory milieu in the lungs of subjects with diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Improved understanding of the etiologies of delirium, a common and severe neuropsychiatric syndrome, would facilitate the disease prevention and treatment. Here, the authors invesitgate the role of circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of delirium. They observe perturbance of circadian rhythms in mouse models of delirium and disrupted clock gene expression in patients with delirium. In turn, physiological and genetic circadian disruptions sensitize mice to delirium with aggravated cognitive impairment. Likewise, global deletion of E4bp4 (E4 promoter-binding protein), a clock gene markedly altered in delirium conditions, results in exacerbated delirium-associated cognitive decline. Cognitive decline in delirium models is attributed to microglial activation and impaired long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals microglia as the regulatory target of E4bp4. E4bp4 restrains microglial activation via inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Supporting this, mice lacking in microglial E4bp4 are delirious prone, whereas mice with E4bp4 specifically deleted in hippocampal CA1 neurons have a normal phenotype. Mechanistically, E4bp4 inhibits ERK1/2 signaling by trans-repressing Mapk1/3 (genes encoding ERK1/2) via direct binding to a D-box element in the promoter region. These findings define a causal role of clock dysfunction in delirium development and indicate E4bp4 as a regulator of cognition at the crosstalk between circadian clock and delirium.

AB  - The interplay between ambient temperature and nutrition in wild herbivores is frequently overlooked, despite the fundamental importance of food. We tested whether different ambient temperatures (10 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C) influenced the intake of protein by a marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). At each temperature, possums were offered a choice of two foods containing different amounts of protein (57% versus 8%) for one week. Animals mixed a diet with a lower proportion of protein to non-protein (P : NP, 0.20) when held at 26 degrees C compared to that at both 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C (0.22). Since detoxification of plant secondary metabolites imposes a protein cost on animals, we then studied whether addition of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole to the food changed the effect of ambient temperature (10 degrees C and 26 degrees C) on food choice. Cineole reduced food intake but also removed the effect of temperature on P : NP ratio and instead animals opted for a diet with higher P : NP (0.19 with cineole versus 0.15 without cineole). These experiments show the proportion of P : NP chosen by animals is influenced by ambient temperature and by plant secondary metabolites. Protein is critical for reproductive success in this species and reduced protein intake caused by high ambient temperatures may limit the viability of some populations in the future.This article is part of the theme issue 'Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals'.

AB  - Stress, which triggers numerous physiological and behavioral responses in the organism, is a significant risk factor that contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the inflammation, oxidative stress status, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors of adolescent rodents exposed to chronic intermittent cold stress. Adolescent male rats were subjected to a modified chronic intermittent cold stress model (21 days, 1 hour/day, 4 degrees C). Depression-like behaviors were evaluated using the sucrose preference and forced swimming tests, while anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the open field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark box tests. We measured levels of cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, brain-derived natriuretic factor, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, total oxidants and antioxidants, and other chemicals in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus brain regions of rats using ELISA and colorimetric methods. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test and Pearson correlation analysis. After the cold stress treatment, both anxiety and depression-like behaviors increased remarkably in the subjects. Our study revealed significant changes in various brain regions among the stress-exposed subjects. Cold stress resulted in decreased BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex and striatum (p < 0.05), increased cortisol levels in the prefrontal cortex (p < 0.05), increased IL-1 beta levels in the hippocampus and thalamus (p < 0.05), increased protein carbonyl levels in the striatum (p < 0.05), and decreased TAS in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus (p < 0.05). Adolescent rats exposed to cold exhibit both anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. This study observed an increase in inflammation in various brain regions, yet the responses to stress varied. Our findings suggest that adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to stress, which can lead to dramatic consequences.

AB  - Nitrate and fluoride are two of the most prevalent pollutants in drinking water and exposure to their high concentrations could cause methemoglobinemia and fluorosis. This study attempted to evaluate the groundwater quality (pH: 4.4-9) from a relatively understudied part of the southwestern coast in India (i.e., Alappuzha, Kerala state) and assessed the associated health risks from exposures to nitrate (0.2-5.8 mg/l) and fluoride (0.2-1.9 mg/ l) present in the groundwater. Pollution index (PIG: 0.35-5.43) grouped about 21% samples in high pollution and very high pollution categories because of fluoride content above the WHO guidelines. The total hazard index (THI) for adult male (0.17-1.70; average: 0.75), adult female (0.19-1.85; average: 0.81) and children (0.35-3.40; average: 1.50) suggested more non-carcinogenic risks for children from 41.6% samples compared to adult male and female from 33.3% samples in the absence of any mitigation measure. These results provide additional data from the country with highest population and the largest groundwater use in the context of sustainability in availability and supply of groundwater under the increasing risks of population growth, climate change and industrial development.

AB  - Granulosa cells play a crucial role in the reproductive processes of female animals, as their proliferation, apoptosis, and hormonal secretion are vital for follicular development and ovulation. Although the role and mechanisms of CREBRF in the reproductive system have been partly reported, its functions in ovarian granulosa cells have not been fully explored. In this study, the results indicated that the expression of CREBRF in the ovaries at 30 days after birth was significantly higher than that during puberty and sexual maturity. Studies on the function of CREBRF found that CREBRF could enhance the synthesis of estradiol and had no effect on progesterone synthesis in pig granulosa cells. At the same time, CREBRF could suppress apoptosis through the Bax/ caspase3/caspase9 pathway and modulation of ISG15/ISGylation in pig granulosa cells. During this process, the expression of many genes changed in granulosa cells. Several genes (CMPK2, MX1, MX2, ZBP1, PML, CHAC1, and BAX) which were promoted apoptosis, were upregulated after CREBRF knockdown with siRNA. ISG15protein conjugation genes (HERC5, UBA7, UBE2L6, ISG15) were also were upregulated. On the contrary, the expression of anti-apoptotic (RFK, SNAP23) genes decreased. In conclusion, CREBRF could enhance the synthesis of estradiol and acted as anti-apoptosis role in pig granulosa cells. This discovery can provide novel insights for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of granulosa cells in the ovary and potentially identifies CREBRF as a molecular target for improving fertility.

AB  - Freezing-thawing procedures and semen manipulation for in vitro fertilization induce oxidative stress, which in turn leads to impaired sperm quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether incubation of frozen-thawed buffalo semen with olive fruit extracts (OFE), known to contain a high concentration of phenolic antioxidants, would improve semen quality by reducing oxidative stress. Frozen sperm (4 ejaculates/4 bulls/3 replicates) were thawed and diluted to 30 x 10(6)/mL in IVF medium with 0, 72, 143, and 214 mu L/mL of OFE, corresponding to 0 (D0-control), 50 (D50), 100 (D100), and 150 (D150) mu M hydroxytyrosol. Sperm viability, acrosome integrity, membrane functionality, motility, and sperm kinetics were evaluated immediately after thawing (T0) and after 1 (T1) and 2 h (T2) of incubation at 38.7 degrees C. Based on the results, sperm biological antioxidant potential (BAP) and ROS levels (ROMs) were assessed in D0 and D100 groups at T1 and T2. To assess the effect of OFE on fertilizing ability, heterologous penetration rates were also evaluated, using bovine abattoir-derived oocytes. The treatment with OFE at all concentrations tested increased (P < 0.05) the percentage of acrosome intact spermatozoa compared to the D0-control at T1, but the effect was more evident (P < 0.01) with D100 (54.5 +/- 3.0, 60.5 +/- 1.5, 65.2 +/- 3.3, and 62.5 +/- 1.7, with D0, D50, D100, and D150 OFE, respectively). Total motility, progressive motility, rapid velocity, and progressive velocity decreased (P < 0.05) at T2 only in the D0-control group. The percentage of rapidly progressive sperm and the progressive motility tended to increase (P < 0.10) at T1 and T2, respectively, in D100 compared to D0 (24.7 +/- 4.1 vs 16.4 +/- 1.6 and 22.8 +/- 2.7 vs 17.0 +/- 1.2, respectively). The treatment with D100 OFE of frozen-thawed sperm increased (P < 0.05) some kinetic parameters (VAP and WOB). Spermatozoa incubated with D100 OFE exhibited higher (P < 0.01) total and normospermic oocyte penetration rates compared to D0 (86.5 +/- 1.4 vs 78.5 +/- 0.7, and 70.6 +/- 1.5 vs 63.8 +/- 1.1, respectively). Additionally, D100 OFE increased sperm BAP concentrations at both T1 and T2, while ROS levels were unaffected. These results suggest that incubating frozen-thawed buffalo semen with OFE is an effective strategy for preserving semen quality and in vitro fertilization ability by enhancing sperm antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Body condition has always been an important indicator reflecting the health status of livestock, and new automated and contactless methods for assessing it have also been continuously proposed. In recent years, with the continuous expansion of research on quantitative analysis of three-dimensional shapes in the field of agriculture, amount of studies has shown that quantitative analysis of shapes can promote the development of smart agriculture. This article proposed a method for quantitatively analyzing the local three-dimensional shape of livestock to evaluate their body conditions. This is a universal method that can be applied to various species. It uses the method of point-to-point correspondence in the three-dimensional shape to finely calculate the difference between shapes, and then maps the difference value to the range of the body condition score. The article analyzed the shape of 198 dairy cows, 100 beef cattle, and 201 pigs using body condition scores as test parameters. The accuracy of body condition evaluation within the range of error of 0.5 for dairy cows, 1 for beef cattle, and 0.5 for pigs are 100%, 87.61%, and 92.09%, respectively. Compared to previous methods for assessing body condition, the method proposed in this paper is more accurate and versatile. The dataset used in this study, along with the code implementation have been made publicly available in https://gitee.com/kznd/lshape-analyser/tree/master/MATLAB.

AB  - Nearly half of pregnancies globally are unintended, reflecting the current unmet need in safe, effective non-hormonal contraception. While anti-sperm IgM is responsible for infertility in many women, stability and bioprocessing challenges with IgM make them ill-suited for non-hormonal contraception. Similarly, IgG lacks sufficient sperm agglutination potencies. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel, multivalent mAb platform is developed, based on fusing the Laminin 511 heterotrimerization domains to Fabs and IgG1-Fc, allowing for tuning of Fab valency (from 2-12) with molecular specificity. 'LamH10', the most potent mAb among the panel of polyvalent antibodies against CD52g on human sperm, comprises 10 Fabs per molecule, and achieves nanomolar potencies at physiological temperatures and retains stability in the acidic environment of human cervicovaginal mucus. In sheep, LamH10 reduced progressively motile sperm in the vagina by >99% within 2 min at just 33 mu g per sheep. LamH10 utilizes the same conventional bioprocessing as IgGs, and can be formulated into rapidly dissolving tablets for on-demand contraception, achieving 100% sperm agglutination within minutes of vaginal dosing. The laminin-IgG hybrid platform not only forms the basis of the most potent biologic for nonhormonal contraception to date, but also represents a promising platform for multivalent mAbs for other applications.

AB  - Traditional Dipodomys (sub)species identification uses geography, phenotype, and external/skull measurements. Such measurements are correlated with size and thus redundant. I assessed the value of scaled cranial shape, based on two-dimensional landmarks (analyzed using geometric morphometric methods) in distinguishing Dipodomys taxa, and in summarizing their variation. My dataset includes 601 adult specimens from 20 species (49 operational taxonomic units - OTUs) across 190 localities. Cranial shape was highly useful in classifying Dipodomys taxa without considering geography. The auditory bulla was the most variable region-taxa differed in its hypertrophy, accompanied by different degrees of nearby structure crowding. Cranial shape was weakly allometric, with no significant sexual dimorphism. Weak size dimorphism was detected. (Sub)specific taxonomy is not reflective of shape variation, as the number of subspecies per species is not associated with disparity. Shape had significant phylogenetic signal, but subspecies did not always cluster with conspecifics and species did not always cluster according to phylogenetic relationship/taxonomy. Shape variation was correlated with climate, and species differed in morphological disparity and degree of specialization, which may contribute to divergence in shape variation patterns from phylogeny. D. deserti was the most specialized species, diverging greatly from the genus mean; D. heermanni was the least specialized. This study provides new insights into morphological variation of North American keystone species, several of conservation interest, for example, D. heermanni berkeleyensis, D. h. dixoni, D. nitratoides brevinasus, and D. n. nitratoides.

AB  - Cardiomyocyte proliferative maturation and metabolic maturation occur in the same perinatal period. Intrauterine conditions influence developmental trajectories of both processes; however, their interconnectedness is unknown. Circulating fetal lipid levels are typically low, but the heart may be prematurely exposed to elevated lipids. We experimentally increased fetal lipid levels to determine the impact on cardiomyocyte proliferative maturation. Fetal sheep were surgically instrumented with catheters. After recovery, Intralipid 20 or Lactated Ringer's Solution were infused according to a clinical g/kg schedule for 8 days until 133 +/- 1 days of gestation. A left ventricular biopsy was fixed, and remaining cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated. Myocardial composition was measured from Masson's Trichrome-stained sections. Cardiomyocyte length, width, nucleation, and Ki-67+ were studied in dispersed cells. Myocardial composition, cardiomyocyte dimensions, and Ki-67+ were not found to be different between groups. Cardiomyocytes of the Intralipid-treated fetuses were 14% more terminally differentiated than controls (p = 0.025). Early developmental exposure to circulating lipid accelerates fetal cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation and may contribute to fewer cardiomyocytes for life.

AB  - In the present work, we emphasize the studies about integrins and their receptors in pig placental interface at different times of gestation. Uterine placental interface (n = 24) of 17, 30, 60 and 70 days of gestation (dg) and non-pregnant uterus (n = 4) of crossbred sows were used. The presence of alpha v(33 (ITGAV (integrin subunit alpha V) ITGB3 (integrin subunit beta 3)) and alpha 5(31 (ITGA5 (integrin subunit alpha V) ITGB3 (integrin subunit beta 3)) integrins, and their ligands fibronectin (FN) and osteopontin (OPN/ SPP1), was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the immunolabeled area percentage (IAP) and the optical density (OD) were determined. The integrins and its ligands analyzed have presented peaks of expression in early and mid-gestation, both in IAP and in the OD area, decreasing at 70 dg. These temporal changes showed us that the molecules studied in this work participate in embryo/feto-maternal attachment, variably. Besides, we found a significant correlation both in the intensity and in the extension of immunostaining for trophoblastic FN and endometrial alpha v(33, and trophoblastic OPN and endometrial alpha 5(31, throughout the entire pig pregnancy. At late gestation, there is notable placental remodeling with subsequent removal or renewal of folds at the uterine-placental interface that results in the loss of focal adhesions. The decrease of the expression of some integrins and their ligands in late gestation, particularly at 70 dg, would demonstrate that there would be other adhesion molecules and other ligands that could be participating in the establishment of the maternal-fetal interface.

AB  - As organisms age, the activity of the endocannabinoid system in the brain declines, coinciding with increased neuroinflammation and disrupted hypothalamic functions. Notably, cannabinoid receptors type -1 (CB1) are highly expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) within the mediobasal hypothalamus, a central area of neuroendocrine regulation. This study investigates whether the CB1 receptor influences agerelated changes in a brain region -dependent manner. Therefore, we performed stereotaxic injections of rAAV1/2 expressing Cre recombinase in 2 -month -old CB1flox/flox male animals to delete the CB1 gene and in CB1deficient (CB1-STOP) mice to induce its re -expression. The intensity of pro -inflammatory glial activity, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and insulin -like growth factor -1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression was assessed in the hypothalamus of mice at 18-19 months of age. Site -specific CB1 receptor deletion induced proinflammatory glial activity and increased hypothalamic Igf1r mRNA expression. Unexpectedly, GnRH levels remained unaltered. Importantly, rescuing the receptor in null mutant animals had the opposite effect: it reduced pro -inflammatory glial activation and decreased Igf1r mRNA expression without affecting GnRH production. Overall, the study highlights the important role of the CB1 receptor in the VMH in reducing age -related inflammation and modulating IGF-1R signaling.

AB  - While sperm migrate within the reproductive tract of cows experiencing negative energy balance (NEB), they come into contact with elevated concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). For this reason, this study aimed to investigate the effects of three different NEFA - palmitic acid (PA), stearic acid (SA), and oleic acid (OA) - on bovine sperm motility, kinetic parameters, oxidative status, and morphology. Frozen thawed semen samples from Bos taurus bulls were incubated with varying concentrations of each fatty acid, and the sperm's characteristics were analysed at different time points. Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) was employed to assess sperm motility and kinetic parameters. Concurrently, the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total antioxidant capacity were measured to determine the oxidative status. Additionally, sperm morphology was evaluated. In Experiment 1, different concentrations of PA did not show significant effects on total motility, progressive motility, or any kinetic parameters analysed. Similarly, PA did not have a significant impact on the oxidative status or sperm morphology. In Experiment 2, SA at various concentrations did not lead to significant changes in total motility, progressive motility, or any kinetic parameters evaluated. Furthermore, SA did not affect oxidative status or sperm morphology. In Experiment 3, the concentrations of OA used did not result in significant changes in total motility, progressive motility, or any kinetic parameters studied. Likewise, OA did not induce any alterations in oxidative status or sperm morphology. Overall, the results from all three experiments indicate that PA, SA and OA, at the in vitro conditions and tested concentrations, do not exert detrimental effects on bovine sperm function and morphology. These results provide insights that contribute to our understanding of how fatty acids can impact the reduction of fertility rates in cows facing NEB. This, in turn, lays the foundation for additional critical investigations in this area. Further studies are necessary to validate these findings in vivo.

AB  - Tea, which is usually made from the new shoots of tea plants (Camellia sinensis), is one of the most popular and healthy beverages. The tenderness of new shoots plays a critical role in the production of high-quality tea; however, the factors affecting the tenderness of the new shoots of tea have not been extensively studied. Here, we show that cellulose accumulation is negatively correlated with the tenderness of new shoots, including leaves and stems, by characterizing the cellulose content and visualizing cellulose in the new shoots of two cultivars ("Huangjinya" and "Yujinxiang") via toluidine blue staining. We further found that the number of cells with secondary cell walls (SCWs) and the thickness of SCWs increased with the maturity degree of stems in both cultivars. Because cellulose is the most abundant polymer in SCW, we next identified three cellulose synthase CsCesAs, CsCesA4, 7, and 8A, through homologous alignment with Arabidopsis AtCesAs. Protein sequence analysis revealed that these proteins were closely related based on the phylogenetic analysis. We finally showed that the gene expression of the three CsCesAs was positively correlated with the maturity degree and cellulose content of the new shoots. Thus, our data suggest that cellulose accumulation, especially in the SCWs, is negatively correlated with the tenderness of new shoots in tea plants.

AB  - Methionine is an essential amino acid that contributes to protein formation, fetal development, and milk synthesis. Thus, we hypothesized that a supplementation with Optimethione (R) during the last third of gestation in female goats will increase the maternal body live weight, the milk yield and milk composition and the offspring weight and body mass index at birth and postnatal performance. We fed (n = 30) or not (n = 30) herbal methionine Optimethione (R) to pregnant multiparous Alpine goats from gestational day 100 until delivery. We evaluated the productive variables from the dams and offspring. Maternal intake of herbal methionine Optimethione (R) during pregnancy did not increase the live weight or increase the milk yield and composition. However, the tested offspring variables were influenced by the maternal intake of herbal methionine Optimethione (R) during gestation by improving the birth weight, body mass index, and postnatal growth pattern. An increase in birth weight would be expected to increase neonatal survival up to weaning. Moreover, a relative fatness is required for reproductive success; thus, offspring that are born heavier and bigger can display a faster postnatal growth and accelerate the onset of puberty and increase reproductive success.
   The last third of gestation is a period of high energy and protein demand for the dam to support fetal growth and the following onset of lactation. Methionine is an essential amino acid that contributes to protein formation, fetal development, and milk synthesis; thus, is likely to have positive effects on the weight and size of the newborn and, afterward, milk yield and milk composition, which may improve growth patterns of the progeny. To test these hypotheses, we used 60 pregnant multiparous Alpine goats with similar live weights and gestational ages (similar to Day 100 of pregnancy; Mean +/- SD; 1410 +/- 14 days old and 50.4 +/- 6.6 kg) and were separated into two groups: control and supplemented with the delivery. Treatments were T-MET (n = 30; received 1% herbal methionine Optimethione (R) dry matter based on from Day 100 of the pregnancy to delivery) or T-CTL (n = 30; served as the control and did not receive methionine). The methionine powder provided individual supplementation and was adjusted every week as the live weight and dry matter intake changed. At birth, the weight, body mass index (BMI), birth type, and sex of the kids were determined. Subsequently, the progeny was weighed weekly up to weaning. Two weeks after parturition, the milk composition was recorded weekly, and the milk yield was recorded monthly. The maternal live weight at the start (Mean +/- SEM; T-CTL: 50.5 +/- 1.1 vs. T-MET: 50.3 +/- 1.3 kg) and end (T-CTL: 54.2 +/- 1.3 vs. T-MET: 52.8 +/- 1.4 kg) of the experiment did not differ statistically among treatments (p > 0.05); however, daily live weight changes tended to differ between groups (T-CTL: 73 +/- 10 vs. T-MET: 51 +/- 7 g day(-1); p = 0.06). The birth weight (T-CTL: 3.1 +/- 0.1 vs. T-MET: 3.5 +/- 0.1 kg; p < 0.001), daily live weight change (T-CTL: 121 +/- 6 vs. T-MET: 141 +/- 6 g day(-1); p < 0.01), and weaning weight (T-CTL: 8.3 +/- 0.2 vs. T-MET: 9.3 +/- 0.3 kg; p < 0.01) differed between treatments. The BMI at birth (T-CTL: 0.28 +/- 0.01 vs. T-MET: 0.3 +/- 0.01 units kg m(-2); p < 0.01) and at weaning (T-CTL: 0.85 +/- 0.1 kg vs. T-MET: 1.00 +/- 0.06 units kg m(-2); p < 0.05) differed between treatments. Milk components (protein, fat, lactose, and solids non-fat) and milk yield were similar between treatments (p > 0.05). It is concluded that the inclusion of methionine in the maternal goat diet during the last third of gestation increases the birth and growth variables of the progeny but without significant influence on the milk yield and composition.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a pathogenetic association between metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cognitive decline and indicate that T2DM may represent a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are a number of experimental studies presenting evidence that ranolazine, an antianginal drug, acts as a neuroprotective drug. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ranolazine on hippocampal neurodegeneration and astrocytes activation in a T2DM rat model. Diabetes was induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Animals were divided into the following groups: HFD/STZ + Ranolazine, HFD/STZ + Metformin, HFD/STZ + Vehicle, NCD + Vehicle, NCD + Ranolazine and NCD + Metformin. The presence of neurodegeneration was evaluated in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region by cresyl violet staining histological methods, while astrocyte activation was assessed by western blot analysis. Staining with cresyl violet highlighted a decrease in neuronal density and cell volume in the hippocampal CA1 area in diabetic HFD/STZ + Vehicle rats, while ranolazine and metformin both improved T2DM-induced neuronal loss and neuronal damage. Moreover, there was an increased expression of GFAP in the HFD/STZ + Vehicle group compared to the treated diabetic groups. In conclusion, in the present study, we obtained additional evidence supporting the potential use of ranolazine to counteract T2DM-associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Microglia sculpt developing neural circuits by eliminating excess synapses in a process called synaptic pruning, by removing apoptotic neurons, and by promoting neuronal survival. To elucidate the role of microglia during embryonic and postnatal brain development, we used a mouse model deficient in microglia throughout life by deletion of the fms-intronic regulatory element (FIRE) in the Csf1r locus. Surprisingly, young adult Csf1r Delta FIRE/Delta FIRE mice display no changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number and spine density of CA1 hippocampal neurons compared with Csf1r + /+ littermates. However, CA1 neurons are less excitable, receive less CA3 excitatory input and show altered synaptic properties, but this does not affect novel object recognition. Cytokine profiling indicates an anti-inflammatory state along with increases in ApoE levels and reactive astrocytes containing synaptic markers in Csf1r Delta FIRE/Delta FIRE mice. Notably, these changes in Csf1r Delta FIRE/Delta FIRE mice closely resemble the effects of acute microglial depletion in adult mice after normal development. Our findings suggest that microglia are not mandatory for synaptic pruning, and that in their absence pruning can be achieved by other mechanisms.
   Microglia-deficient mouse brains develop with normal hippocampal synapse numbers and pyramidal cell spine density, but deficits in the full maturation of glutamatergic networks, suggesting that microglia are dispensable for synaptic pruning but not for fine-tuning excitatory transmission.Excitatory and inhibitory synapse number and spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells in adult Csf1r Delta FIRE/Delta FIRE mice lacking microglia at all developmental stages are unaltered. Microglial absence causes deficits in CA3 - CA1 excitatory neurotransmission and pre- and postsynaptic function, without alterations in hippocampal-related behavior. Anti-inflammatory cytokines are increased and reactive astrocytes characterized by higher levels of GFAP and MEGF10 in the hippocampus of Csf1r Delta FIRE/Delta FIRE mice.
   Microglia-deficient mouse brains develop with normal hippocampal synapse numbers and pyramidal cell spine density, but deficits in the full maturation of glutamatergic networks, suggesting that microglia are dispensable for synaptic pruning but not for fine-tuning excitatory transmission.

AB  - ObjectiveTwo Cownose Rays Rhinoptera bonasus were presented for management of a severe capsalid monogenean infection Benedeniella posterocolpa in a mixed species habitat at an aquarium.MethodsA series of freshwater (FW) dips were elected to mitigate parasite resistance to praziquantel due to the endemic monogenean population in the system. A pretreatment blood sample was opportunistically obtained, and subsequent samples were processed due to development of clinical signs.ResultWhile the first FW dip was tolerated well and did not induce abnormal behavior, the second led to one individual presenting with tachypnea, pallor, and lethargy. Marked hematological abnormalities requiring medical intervention occurred in both individuals after the second dip. After treatment with elasmobranch Ringer's fluid therapy, sodium bicarbonate, prednisolone acetate, and vitamin E/selenium in the more severely affected ray, and elasmobranch Ringer's alone in the second ray, hematologic derangements and symptoms resolved. Hemoconcentration, hyperproteinemia, hyperlactatemia, and hyperglycemia were attributed to a stress response. A selective loss of urea after exposure to FW resulted in decreased plasma osmolality.ConclusionGiven the severity of the stress response and associated complications observed, hyposalinity treatments should be utilized with caution in this species. If this therapy is employed, the clinician is advised to be prepared to administer supportive care coinciding with the FW dip if necessary.
   To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published report documenting variable intolerance and hematologic changes following freshwater dips in Cownose Rays.Impact statement

AB  - Mathematical models play an important role in management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI). While such models are generally used to study the spread of a solitary virus, in reality multiple viruses co-circulate in the population. These viruses have been studied in detail, including the course of infection and immune defense mechanisms. We developed an agent-based model, called ABM-ARI, assimilating heterogeneous data and theoretical knowledge into a biologically motivated system, that allows to reproduce the seasonal patterns of ARI incidence and simulate interventions. ABM-ARI uses city-specific data to create a synthetic population and to construct realistic contact networks in different activity settings. Characteristics of infection, immune protection and non-specific resistance were varied between individuals to account for the population heterogeneity. For the calibration, we minimised the normalised mean absolute error between simulated and observed epidemic curves. ABM-ARI was built based on the quantitative assessment of features of predominant respiratory viruses and epidemiological characteristics of the population. It provides a good fit to the observed epidemic curves for different age groups and viruses. We also simulated one-week school closures when student absences were at or above 10%, 20% or 30% and found that only 10% and 20% thresholds resulted in a reduction of the incidence. ABM-ARI has a great potential in tackling the challenge of emerging infections by simulating and evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions.

AB  - The slatted floor system is often used in pig housing. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a valuable tech-nique for determining the airflow and gas dispersion within the pit headspace through the slatted floor. However, there is a practical issue related to modeling the thousands of small slot openings in real livestock buildings for CFD simulation. It is unpractical to simulate the slatted floor with geometry details due to the large mesh number and the limited computer capacity. In this study, several methods to simplify the model of the slatted floor were explored to reduce the computational cost. The study was based on CFD analysis supported by experimental validation. The slatted floor was modeled in four ways: direct geometry method (DGM), porous-region method (POM), and profiled-porous-region method (including PPOM-cell (PPOM-C) and PPOM-floor (PPOM-F)). To assess the feasibility of the simplification, the four modeling approaches were compared with the experimental data. The results showed that it's feasible to model the slatted floor as POM or PPOM. The accuracy of POM was high, but it was greatly affected by the calculation of the resistance coefficient. PPOM-C has greatly reduced the amount of calculation, which could be used to simplify the large-scale pig house model whose flow fields and gas emissions below the slatted floor could be ignored. The simulation result of PPOM-F was the closest to DGM, however, due to the large number of meshes and complex setup, it was not suitable for practical simulation.

AB  - Bioprinting is an emerging technology involved in the fabrication of three-dimensional tissue constructs for the repair and regeneration of various tissues and organs. Collagen, a natural protein found abundantly in the extracellular matrix of several tissues, can be extracted from collagen-rich tissues of animals such as sheep, cows, rats, pigs, horses, birds, and marine animals. However, due to the poor printability of collagen bioinks, biocompatible collagen scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) are difficult to fabricate using bioprinting techniques. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), a semi-synthetic polymer with tunable physical and chemical properties, has been found to be a promising biomaterial in various bioprinting applications. The printability of collagen can be improved by combining it with semi-synthetic polymers such as GelMA to develop hybrid hydrogels. Such hybrid hydrogels printed have also been identified to have enhanced mechanical properties. Hybrid GelMA meshes have not previously been prepared with collagen from ovine sources. This study provides a novel comparison between the properties of hybrid meshes with ovine skin and bovine hide collagen. GelMA (8% w/v) was integrated with three different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) of bovine and ovine collagen forming hybrid hydrogels inks that were printed into meshes with enhanced properties. The maximum percentage of collagen suitable for integration with GelMA, forming hybrid hydrogels with a stable degradation rate was 1%. The water-soluble nature of ovine collagen promoted faster degradation of the hybrid meshes, although the structural crosslinking was identified to be higher than bovine hybrid meshes. The 1% bovine collagen hybrid meshes stood out in terms of their stable degradation rates.

AB  - Anthracnose is one of the primary diseases in tea plants that affect tea yield and quality. The geographical distribution, occurrence regularity, and agronomic measures of tea plants with anthracnose have been researched for decades. However, the pathogenic cause of anthracnose in tea plants is diverse in different regions of the world. Identifying the specific pathogenic fungi causing tea anthracnose is an essential control measure to mitigate this disease. In this study, 66 Discula theae-sinensis and 45 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from three different types of diseased tea leaves. Based on multilocus phylogenetic and morphological analysis, eight known species of Colletotrichum, Colletotrichum fructicola, C. camelliae, C. aenigma, C. siamense, C. henanense, C. karstii, C. tropicicola, and C. gigasporum were identified. This study is the first to report C. tropicicola and C. gigasporum in tea plants in China. Discula theae-sinensis was the most common species in this study and caused disease lesions around wounded areas of tea leaves. The dual trials in vitro indicated Discula theae-sinensis and Colletotrichum were slightly inhibited. Co-inoculating Discula theae-sinensis and C. fructicola was superior to single inoculation at low concentrations. The main cause of anthracnose might be the concerted action of a variety of fungi.

AB  - During weaning transition, mammalian newborns suffer severe enteric infections and thus induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, which in turn aggravates enteric disorder. The synthetic dipeptide glycyl-glutamine (GlyGln) has been used as a diet supplement to improve the weaning transition of newborns. However, the effect of dietary GlyGln supplementation on the gut microbiota of piglets with enteric infection remains unclear. Here, weaned piglets received a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 0.25% GlyGln for 3 weeks. Five piglets in each group received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 mu g per kg BW) (LPS and GlyGln + LPS groups) and meanwhile five piglets in a control group received an intraperitoneal injection of saline (Ctrl group). The results showed that dietary GlyGln supplementation improved the LPS induced inflammation response and damage to the ileum morphology by increasing interleukin 10, tight junction proteins, villus height, and the ratio villus height/crypt depth, but decreasing the crypt depth. For the oxidative status, dietary GlyGln supplementation increased the ileal superoxide dismutase and meanwhile reduced the malondialdehyde and nitric oxide synthase activity (NOS) (total NOS and inducible NOS), compared with that in the LPS group. LPS challenge reduced the diversity of gut microbiota and enriched the facultative anaerobic Escherichia coli. The GlyGln restored alpha diversity and the structure of the gut microbiota by enriching obligate anaerobes and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, including Clostridium, Lachnospira, Phascolarctobacterium, Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae, and Synergistetes. GlyGln enriched the gut microbiota function of carbohydrate metabolism and elevated the ileal SCFA concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid that had been decreased by the LPS challenge. The beneficial effects of dietary GlyGln supplementation are closely associated with its enriched bacteria and SCFAs. Taken together, dietary GlyGln supplementation improved the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by LPS challenge and enriched obligate anaerobes and SCFA-producing bacteria, which contributed to the amelioration of intestinal integrity, inflammatory responses, and oxidative status.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of subchronic arsenic exposure on behavior, neurological function, and hippocampal damage in rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups and exposed to different concentrations of arsenic in their drinking water for 12 weeks, while weekly water intake and body weight were recorded. Various neurobehavioral tests were conducted, evaluating overall activity levels, exploratory behavior, short-term memory, spatial learning and memory, anxiety-like behavior, and depressive-like states. Arsenic levels in urine, serum, and brain tissue were measured, and histopathological analysis assessed hippocampal damage using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results demonstrated that arsenic exposure did not significantly affect overall activity or exploratory behavior. However, it impaired short-term memory and spatial learning and memory functions. Arsenic-exposed rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and a depressive-like state. Arsenic levels increased dose-dependently in urine, serum, and brain tissue. The histopathological examinations revealed significant hippocampal damage, including neuronal shrinkage, cell proliferation, irregular structure, disordered arrangement, and vacuolation. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the impact of arsenic exposure on behavior and brain health, highlighting its potential neurological consequences.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;A relationship exists between a female's early nutritional environment and her ability to produce milk when she lactates as an adult. Colostrum is the first milk available to neonates after birth. We hypothesized that differing levels of colostrum stimulate differences in very early mammary development. Despite differences in weight at 24 h and 7 days, mammary morphological development and DNA content was not found to be different between gilts fed a high versus low dose of colostrum. The rate of mammary gland protein and DNA synthesis over the first week was not different between the groups. Circulating levels of amino acids were determined after 24 h of colostrum feeding, and levels of circulating lysine were found to be related to average daily gain and mammary DNA synthetic rate. Moreover, the level of lysine was related to a lower ratio of DNA to protein synthesis, suggesting that higher lysine favored cell division versus differentiation (by leaving the cell cycle). Further studies are needed in this area.</p>
   Perinatal nutrition affects future milk production. The number of mammary epithelial cells affect milk production capacity. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the level of colostrum intake affects the proliferation rate and the total number of mammary epithelial cells in the gland. The ratio of newly synthesized protein to newly synthesized DNA reflects the relative amount of cellular differentiation to cell division. The study objective was to determine the relationship between the level of colostrum intake and 24 h-level of circulating amino acid, glucose and insulin with mammary parenchyma histological features, cell division and protein synthesis over the first week postnatal. One of two standardized doses of a homogenate colostrum sample, 10% (n = 8) and 20% (n = 8) of birth bodyweight, was fed to gilts over the first 24 h postnatal. Gilts were administered deuterium oxide immediately after birth and daily to label newly synthesized DNA and proteins. Gilts were euthanized on postnatal day seven, and DNA and protein were isolated from mammary parenchyma. DNA and protein fractional synthesis (f) and fractional synthetic rate (FSR) were calculated using mass isotopomer distribution analysis. The ratio of protein f and FSR to DNA f and FSR were calculated and used to indicate the relative amounts of differentiation to cell division. Mammary morphological development was also analyzed by measuring the parenchymal epithelial area and the stromal and epithelial proliferation index on postnatal day seven. Colostrum dose was not related to any of the variables used to evaluate mammary development. However, plasma lysine levels at 24 h postnatal were positively related to average daily gain (ADG; r = 0.54, p = 0.05), DNA f (r = 0.57; p = 0.03) and DNA FSR (r = 0.57; p = 0.03) in mammary parenchyma. Plasma lysine was inversely related to the ratio of protein to DNA f and FSR (r = -0.56; p = 0.04). ADG was related to the parenchymal epithelial area and DNA and protein f and FSR (p < 0.05). These relationships support the idea that the nutritional environment affects early mammary development and that higher lysine levels in the perinatal period favored a greater degree of cell division versus differentiation in mammary of neonatal pigs and thus, warrant further investigations.</p>

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that visfatin participates in the regulation of female reproduction. Due to the lack of data concerning the level of visfatin in the ovarian follicles of pigs, one of the most economically important livestock species, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression and localisation of visfatin and the follicular fluid concentration in the ovarian follicles of prepubertal and mature gilts. We also aimed to examine the in vitro effects of gonadotropins (LH, FSH), insulin, progesterone (P4), oestradiol (E2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and F2 & alpha; (PGF2 & alpha;) on visfatin levels. In the present study, we have demonstrated that visfatin expression is dependent on the maturity of the animals and the stage of ovarian follicle development. Visfatin signal was detected in individual follicular compartments from primordial to antral follicles and even in atretic follicles. We have shown that the expression of visfatin in granulosa cells was higher than in theca cells. The level of visfatin is upregulated by LH, FSH, E2, and P4 and downregulated by insulin, while prostaglandins have modulatory effects, dependent on the dose and type of ovarian follicular cells. To summarise, our research has shown that visfatin is widely expressed in the ovarian follicles of prepubertal and mature pigs, and its expression is regulated by gonadotropins, insulin, steroids, and prostaglandins, suggesting that visfatin appears to be an important intraovarian factor that could regulate porcine ovarian follicular function.

AB  - One of the most important alteration factors for archaeological sites is the deposition of dust, primarily onto horizontal surfaces, because it affects both the conservation state of the remains and their appearance. The deposition is responsible for visual changes that prevent proper appreciation of the site, and this is especially negative for the decorative elements such as mosaics. Dust deposition has been seen as a significant problem in sheltered sites as opposed to those located in the open air, where deposits are regularly washed away. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the visual effects of dust on sheltered archaeological remains despite the fact that this information could help to determine cleaning regimes. This research has been undertaken at the House of Hippolytus, a Roman villa located on the outskirts of Complutum, situated where the city of Alcala de Henares (Spain) stands today. The site was covered with a partially enclosed shelter in 1999 and it contains a magnificent mosaic in the central area. This ornamental floor is the center of attention for visitors and has often been used as a promotional image because of its high artistic value. This study has objectively evaluated the visual changes (color and spectral characteristics) of the mosaic at the House of Hippolytus before and after being cleaned with dry and wet systems using a novel approach based not only on a spectrophotometer (CM-2600d Konica Minolta (R)) but also on a LumiCam (R) 1300 camera (Instrument Systems GmbH). Although wet cleaning implies the use of water, which is a decay factor, it has been found to be the best option for recovering the original aspect of the mosaic.

AB  - Omeprazole, a drug of choice for the management of gastric hyperacidity, influences serotonergic neurotransmission in brain regions and its long-term use is known to cause stress-related behavioral deficits including anxiety. Aim of the current study was to explore the effects of omeprazole treatment on immobilization-induced anxiety in rats, specifically on the role of serotonin (5-HT). In view of the role of serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptor in the availability of 5-HT in brain regions, mRNA expression of this autoreceptor was performed in raphe nuclei. Similarly, because of the role of hippocampal 5-HT neurotransmission in anxiety-like disorders, expression of the 5-HT1A heteroreceptors was determined in this region. We found that the treatment with omeprazole reduces anxiety-like behavior in rats, increases the expression of 5-HT1A autoreceptor in the raphe and decreases the hippocampal expression of 5-HT1A heteroreceptor. This suggests a role of 5-HT1A receptor types in omeprazole-induced behavioral changes. It also indicates a potential role of omeprazole in the management of serotonergic disorders.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is considered as one of the most extensively synthesized and used chemicals for industrial and consumer products. Previous investigations have established that exposure to BPA has been linked to developmental, reproductive, cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic effects. Several jurisdictions have imposed restrictions and/or have banned the use of BPA in packaging material and other consumer goods. Hence, manufacturers have replaced BPA with its analogues that have a similar chemical structure. Some of these analogues have shown similar endocrine effects as BPA, while others have not been assessed. In this investigation, we compared the neurodevelopmental effects of BPA and its major replacement Bisphenol F (BPF) on rat fetal neural stem cells (rNSCs). rNSCs were exposed to cell-specific differentiation media with non-cytotoxic doses of BPA or BPF at the range of 0.05 mu M to 100 mu M concentrations and measured the degree of cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphometric parameters. Both of these compounds increased cell proliferation and impacted the differentiation rates of oligodendrocytes and neurons, in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, there were concentration-dependent decreases in the maturation of oligodendrocytes and neurons, with a concomitant increase in immature oligodendrocytes and neurons. In contrast, neither BPA nor BPF had any overall effect on cellular proliferation or the cytotoxicity of astrocytes. However, there was a concentration-dependent increase in astrocyte differentiation and morphological changes. Morphometric analysis for the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons showed a reduction in the arborization. These data show that fetal rNSCs exposed to either BPA or BPF lead to comparable changes in the cellular differentiation, proliferation, and arborization processes.

TI  - The Microbiota-Dependent Treatment of Wuzhuyu Decoction for Chronic Migraine Model Rat Associated with Anxiety-Depression Like Behavior
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
LA  - English
AB  - We previously found that Wuzhuyu Decoction (WZYD) could affect central and peripheral 5-HT to relieve hyperalgesia in chronic migraine (CM) model rats, possibly related to gut microbiota. However, the exact role of gut microbiota has not been elucidated. Accumulating evidence points to the possibility of treating central nervous system disease via the gut-brain axis. In our study, the inflammatory soup-induced CM model rats presented depression- and anxiety-like behaviors which both related to insufficient 5-HT. It was found that antibiotic administration caused community dysbiosis, and proteobacteria became the main dominant bacteria. The bacteria related to short-chain fatty acids and 5-HT generation were reduced, resulting in reduced levels of 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase, and secondary bile acids. Functional prediction-revealed sphingolipid signaling pathway in CM rats was significantly decreased and elevated after WZYD treatment. The effect of WZYD could be weakened by antibiotics. The CM rats exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behavior with 5-HT and number of neurons decreased in the CA1 and CA2 regions of hippocampal. The treatment of WZYD could recover to varying degrees. Antibiotics combined with WZYD attenuate the effect of WZYD on increasing the 5-HT content and related protein expression in the brain stem, plasma and colon, reducing CGRP, c-Fos, and inflammatory factors. And antibiotics also led to colon length increasing and stool retention, so that the antimigraine effect was weakened compared with WZYD. This experiment revealed that gut microbiota mediated WZYD treatment of CM rats with anxiety-depression like behavior.

AB  - The role of ghrelin metabolism in anorexia of ageing is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine acyl-ghrelin, total ghrelin, and ghrelin O-acyltransferase concentrations when fasted and in responses to feeding in older adults exhibiting anorexia of ageing. Twenty-five older adults (OA; 15f, 74 +/- 7 years, 24.5 kg<middle dot>m(-2)) and twelve younger adults (YA; 6f, 21 +/- 2 years, 24.4 kg<middle dot>m(-2)) provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and fasted blood sample (0 min) before consuming a standardised porridge breakfast meal (450 kcal). Appetite was measured every 30 min for 240 min and blood was sampled at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min while participants rested. At 240 min, an ad libitum pasta-based lunch meal was consumed. Older adults were identified as those with healthy appetite (HA-OA) or low appetite (LA-OA), based on habitual energy intake, self-report appetite, BMI, and ad libitum lunch intake. YA ate more at lunch (1108 +/- 235 kcal) than HA-OA (653 +/- 133 kcal, p = 0.007) and LA-OA (369 +/- 168 kcal; p < 0.001). LA-OA, but not HA-OA, had higher fasted concentrations of acyl- and total ghrelin than YA (acyl-ghrelin: 621 +/- 307 pg<middle dot>mL(-1) vs. 353 +/- 166 pg<middle dot>mL(-1), p = 0.047; total ghrelin: 1333 +/- 702 pg<middle dot>mL(-1) vs. 636 +/- 251 pg<middle dot>mL(-1), p = 0.006). Acyl-ghrelin (60 min and 90 min) and total ghrelin (90 min) were suppressed to a greater extent for LA-OA than for YA (p < 0.05). No differences were observed in subjective appetite, acyl-to-total ghrelin ratio, or plasma GOAT content (p > 0.1). Higher fasting ghrelin and an augmented ghrelin response to feeding in LA-OA, but not HA-OA, suggests that alterations to ghrelin metabolism are not functions of ageing per se and may be independent causal mechanisms of anorexia of ageing.

AB  - Key reproductive events such as fertilization and early embryonic development occur in the lumen of the oviduct. Since investigating these processes in vivo is both technically challenging and ethically sensitive, cell culture models have been established to reproduce the oviductal microenvironment. Compartmentalized culture systems, particularly air-liquid interface cultures (ALI; cells access the culture medium only from the basolateral cell side), result in highly differentiated oviduct epithelial cell cultures. The oxygen (O2) tension within the oviduct is 4-10% across species, and its reduced O2 content is presumed to be important for early reproductive processes. However, cell culture models of the oviduct are typically cultivated without O2 regulation and therefore at about 18% O2. To investigate the impact of O2 levels on oviduct epithelium functions in vitro, we cultured porcine oviduct epithelial cells (POEC) at the ALI using both physiological (5%) and supraphysiological (18%) O2 levels and two different media regimes. Epithelium architecture, barrier function, secretion of oviduct fluid surrogate (OFS), and marker gene expression were comparatively assessed. Under all culture conditions, ALI-POEC formed polarized, ciliated monolayers with appropriate barrier function. Exposure to 18% O2 accelerated epithelial differentiation and significantly increased the apical OFS volume and total protein content. Expression of oviduct genes and the abundance of OVGP1 (oviduct-specific glycoprotein 1) in the OFS were influenced by both O2 tension and medium choice. In conclusion, oviduct epithelial cells can adapt to a supraphysiological O2 environment. This adaptation, however, may alter their capability to replicate in vivo tissue characteristics.

AB  - This study assessed the histones methylation profile (H3K4me3 and H3K9me3) in late preantral (PA) and early antral (EA) caprine follicles grown in vivo and in vitro, and the anethole effect during in vitro culture of PA follicles. Uncultured in vivo-grown follicles (PA, n = 64; EA, n = 73) were used as controls to assess the methylation profile and genes' expression related to apoptosis cascade (BAX, proapoptotic; BCL2, antiapoptotic), steroidogenesis (CYP17, CYP19A1), and demethylation (KDM1AX1, KDM1AX2, KDM3A). The isolated PA follicles (n = 174) were cultured in vitro for 6 days in & alpha;-MEM+ in either absence (control) or presence of anethole. After culture, EA follicles were evaluated for methylation, mRNA abundance, and morphometry. Follicle diameter increased after culture, regardless of treatment. The methylation profile and the mRNA abundance were similar between in vivo-grown PA and EA follicles. Anethole treatment led to higher H3K4me3 fluorescence intensity in EA follicles. The mRNA abundances of BAX, CYP17, and CYP19A1 were higher, and BCL2 and KDM3A were lower in in vitro-grown EA follicles than in vivo-grown follicles. In conclusion, in vitro follicle culture affected H3K4me3 fluorescence intensity, mRNA abundance of apoptotic genes, and steroidogenic and demethylase enzymes compared with in vivo-grown follicles.

AB  - The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for tissue repair and regeneration has garnered great attention. While MSCs are likely to interact with microbes at sites of tissue damage and inflammation, like in the gastrointestinal system, the consequences of pathogenic association on MSC activities have yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of pathogenic interaction on MSC trilineage differentiation paths and mechanisms using model intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica ssp enterica serotype Typhimurium. The examination of key markers of differentiation, apoptosis, and immunomodulation demonstrated that Salmonella altered osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation pathways in human and goat adipose-derived MSCs. Anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative responses were also significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in MSCs during Salmonella challenge. These results together indicate that Salmonella, and potentially other pathogenic bacteria, can induce pathways that influence both apoptotic response and functional differentiation trajectories in MSCs, highlighting that microbes have a potentially significant role as influencers of MSC physiology and immune activity.

AB  - Patulin (PAT) is a fungal toxin prevalent in apples and apple products and associated with several toxic effects, potentially harming multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, and colon. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which PAT affects the intestines remains comprehensively unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the molecular effects of PAT on the intestinal epithelium. Gene expression profiling was conducted, hypothesizing that PAT induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Cell cycle analysis, along with Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining, confirmed that PAT induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. Additionally, PAT activated the expression of cell cycle-related genes (CDK1, CCNB1) and apoptosis-related genes (BCL6, CASP9). Treatment with SC79, an AKT activator, mitigated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To identify natural products that could mitigate the harmful effects of PAT in small intestinal epithelial cells in pigs, the high-throughput screening of a natural product library was conducted, revealing 10-Eicosanol as a promising candidate. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that 10-Eicosanol alleviates PAT-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells by activating AKT.

AB  - The effective monitoring and identification of existing subterranean termite populations within coarse woody debris and infested wood in service depend on accurate detection. These insects are often concealed within logs, wooden support structures, walls, and floorboards of buildings. In the absence of external mud tubes, termite infestations normally must be discovered through the destructive exploration of wooden structures to reveal the physical presence of these insect pests. Subterranean termite species are difficult to identify due to similarities in morphological features, but they may be readily distinguished by differences in volatile emissions from which they are divided into chemotaxonomic groups. Consequently, a more effective and nondestructive approach for detection and identification is to take advantage of unique species-specific emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from termite bodies which easily pass through wooden structures, allowing for detection without physical damage to wood and avoiding expensive DNA analysis. Electronic aroma detection analyses were conducted with an Aromascan A32S electronic-nose (e-nose) instrument, fitted with a 32-sensor conducting polymer (CP) sensor array, for discrimination between four common subterranean termite species based on differences in volatile emissions. Principal component analysis (PCA) of whole-body volatiles effectively distinguished between four termite species with the first two principal components accounting for more than 98% of sample variance (p < 0.01). Unique electronic aroma signature patterns (smellprints) were produced from e-nose sensor array outputs that allowed for the effective identification of termite species based on distinct differences in volatile metabolites released from their bodies. The e-nose methods were determined to be an improved means for rapidly detecting and monitoring termite species in wood. The method is cheaper than conventional detection methods and allows for the timelier discovery of species-specific termite infestations necessary for better management. The e-nose capability of detecting the Formosan termite in indoor living spaces was particularly significant due to the production of naphthalene, a volatile hazardous gas causing many adverse human health effects in enclosed environments.

AB  - PurposeBabesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by protozoon species in the Babesia genus of the Babesiadae family. The systemic inflammatory response induced by infection is considered to be an important feature of the pathophysiology of ovine babesiosis. In this study, it was aimed to determine serum oxidative status, levels of some cytokines, acute phase proteins and heart damage markers in babesiosis infection.Materials and MethodsA sample of 40 sheep was used for this purpose, of which 20 were healthy and 20 were infected with Babesia ovis. Babesia infection was diagnosed from Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. Infection was also confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera from blood samples was tested for oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde [MDA], total antioxidant status [TAS], superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT] and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), cytokines (interleukins IL-6, IL-1 & beta;, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor & alpha; (TNF-& alpha;) and interferon-ϒ [IFN-ϒ]), acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA] and haptoglobin [Hp]) and specific (troponin I [cTnI], creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB]) and nonspecific (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], aspartate transaminase [AST]) cardiac damage markers.ResultsMDA, SOD, CAT, Hp, TAS, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta;, INF-& gamma;, AST, LDH, CK-MB mass and troponin I values were higher in the patient group than in the healthy group (P < 0.05). However, there was not found to be a statistical difference between the healthy and patient groups in terms of GPx, SAA and CRP values (P > 0.05).ConclusionsIt can be stated that serum levels of oxidative stress, some acute phase proteins and cardiac damage markers may increase in naturally infected sheep with babesiosis.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease of livestock having serious economic setbacks. The etiological agents of the disease belong to Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. Despite of worldwide distribution of the disease, the molecular studies mainly employ amplification of cox1, nad1 and nad5 genes. To further strengthen the knowledge about significance of other molecular markers and to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of Echinococcus species in Pakistan, the current study was designed in which full length mitochondrial cytb, atp6 and nad2 genes were amplified. Based on BLAST searches of the generated cytb, atp6 and nad2 gene sequences from a total of 18 hydatid cysts collected from cattle, 12 isolates were identified as E. granulousus G3 and 6 as E. granulosus (G1). The phylogeny inferred by the Bayesian method using nucleotide sequences of cytb-atp6-nad2 further confirmed their identity. The diversity indices indicated a high haplotype and a low nucleotide diversity. The negative values of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs test demonstrated deviation from neutrality suggesting a recent population expansion. To the best of our knowledge, the present study described the genetic variation of E. granulosus population for the first time in Pakistan using full-length cytb, atp6 and nad2 mitochondrial genes. The findings on the genetic variation of E. granulosus in Pakistan will constitute useful baseline information for future studies on the prevalence and population structure of E. granulosus based on full-length cytb, atp6 and nad2.

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study provides the first insights to the fecal metabolome of the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). By using untargeted metabolomics via gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOF-MS), this study primarily aims to provide results of the impact that external stimuli, such as supplemental feeding (SF) practices, seasonal variation and sex, might have on the fecal metabolome composition of healthy, free-roaming giraffes. Methods: Untargeted GCxGC/TOF-MS analysis was applied to the feces collected from thirteen giraffes (six males and seven females) from six different locations within the central Free State Province of South Africa over a period of two years. Statistical analysis of the generated data was used to identify the metabolites that were significantly different between the giraffes located in environments that provided SF and others where the giraffes only fed on the natural available vegetation. The same metabolomics analysis was used to investigate metabolite concentrations that were significantly different between the wet and dry seasons for a single giraffe male provided with SF over the two-year period, as well as for age and sex differences. Results: A total of 2042 features were detected from 26 giraffe fecal samples. Clear variations between fecal metabolome profiles were confirmed, with higher levels of amino acid-related and carbohydrate-related metabolites for giraffes receiving SF. In addition, a separation between the obtained profiles of samples collected from a single adult male giraffe during the wet and dry seasons was identified. Differences, such as higher levels of carbohydrate-related metabolites and organic compounds during the wet season were noted. Distinct variations in profiles were also identified for the metabolites from fecal samples collected from the six males and seven females, with higher concentrations in carbohydrate-related metabolites and alkanes for female giraffes comparatively. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the composition of the fecal metabolome of free-roaming giraffes, as well as the effects that external factors, such as environmental exposures, feeding practices, seasonal variations, age and sex, have on it. This novel use of fecal metabolomics assists in developing non-invasive techniques to determine giraffe populations' health that do not require additional stressors such as capture, restraint and blood collection. Ultimately, such non-invasive advances are beneficial towards the conservation of wildlife species on a larger scale.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) root or whole-plant extracts are used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and other nervous system disturbances. Aim of the study: We evaluated the neuroprotective and antidepressant effects of ashwagandha root extract (ARE) on corticosterone-exposed HT-22 cells and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-challenged mice. Materials and methods: The neuroprotective properties of ARE containing withanolide A were assessed in HT-22 cells subjected to corticosterone-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, the effects of ARE on depression-like behavior, stress-related hormones, and inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated in a mouse model of UCMS. Results: In HT-22 cells, ARE (100 and 200 mu g/mL) and its constituent, withanolide A (1.56 and 3.12 mu g/mL), mitigated corticosterone-induced increases in MAO activity, ROS, and MDA levels. Treatment also reversed corticosterone-induced reductions in BDNF, TrkB, p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CREB and normalized Nrf2 and Keap1 levels, thereby elevating HO-1 expression. In UCMS mice, ARE improved behavioral outcomes, increased sucrose preference, and reduced immobility in the forced swimming test while enhancing activity in the open field test and elevated plus maze. ARE decreased the levels of stress hormones (corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosterone) and increased the levels of neurotransmitters (L-DOPA, 5-HTP, and serotonin). Histological analysis revealed that ARE reduced hippocampal cell loss. Additionally, ARE (60 and 100 mg/kg) restored decreased levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CREB and lowered inflammation-related proteins (Cox2, iNOS, IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha). Conclusion: These results indicate that ARE containing withanolide A exhibits notable neuroprotective and antidepressant properties.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to the widespread practice of tail docking in sheep, no data exist regarding the incidence of caudal spine deformities and injuries in this species. The aim of this study was to describe the type and frequency of tail abnormalities in an undocked Merinoland sheep population using radiographic studies. The findings demonstrated that anomalies of the tail bones (such as fractures and block or wedged vertebrae) were predominantly found in the middle and caudal third of the spine. Additionally, a correlation between the occurrence of vertebral fractures and the tail length and number of vertebrae was observed. No significant differences were found in terms of different litter sizes and sex. These results suggest that the proportion of animals with tail malformations and injuries is relatively high, which should be considered when breeding for short tails in the context of a docking ban. As tails are often docked within the first days of life, studies investigating tail malformations and injuries in sheep do not exist thus far. To address this gap in the literature, this research aimed to analyse the occurrence of vertebral anomalies and fractures in the tail within an undocked Merinoland sheep population. At 14 weeks of age, the caudal spines of 216 undocked Merinoland lambs was radiographically examined, and tail length and circumference were measured. Anomalies were documented and statistical correlation and model calculations were performed. The occurrence of block vertebrae was observed in 12.96% and wedged vertebrae in 8.33% of the sample. Of the animals, 59 (27.31%) exhibited at least one vertebral fracture, which were observed in the middle and caudal third of the tail. A significant correlation was found between the occurrence of fractures and tail length (r = 0.168) and number of vertebrae (r = 0.155). Conversely, the presence of block and wedged vertebrae was not significantly correlated with tail length, circumference, or number of vertebrae. Only the sex showed significant differences in the probability of axis deviation. These results emphasize the importance of breeding for short tails to avoid fractures.

AB  - Simple Summary This study developed an indirect ELISA (GMD-ELISA) to detect the Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antibody. The antigen-antibody response was optimized using checkerboard titration. This method has strong specificity and can detect the main epidemic strains of S. suis in China-type 2, type 7, and type 9-compared with using the commercial Streptococcus suis ELISA type 2 kit. The GMD-ELISA method has high sensitivity and good repeatability. The novel GMD-ELISA method provides technical support for rapid diagnosis and epidemiological investigation. S. suis is an important zoonotic pathogen from sick and recessive carrier pigs that poses a serious threat to animal husbandry production and public health. It usually causes horizontal transmission among pigs. The morbidity and mortality of this disease are very high. Human infection is caused through direct or indirect contact with sick pigs. The two large-scale outbreaks in China were due to the outbreak of S. suis on pig farms, which spread to human infection; thus, detecting S. suis in pig herds is crucial. At present, the commercial S. suis ELISA type 2 kits on the market can only detect single serotypes, high probabilities of interaction reactions, and biosafety risks when using inactivated S. suis as an antigen. Phosphate-3-glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH), muramidase-released protein (MRP), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) are important S. suis type 2, S. suis type 7, and S. suis type 9 protective antigens. This study purified the GMD protein (B-cell-dominant epitopes of GAPDH, MRP, and DLDH antigens) and used a diverse combination of dominant epitopes of the multiple different antigens as coated antigens, improving the sensitivity and safety of the indirect ELISA experiments. An indirect ELISA method (GMD-ELISA) was developed for detecting S. suis antibodies. The antigen-antibody response was optimized using checkerboard titration. The results of testing using ELISA for Salmonella enterica (S. enterica), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) were all negative, indicating that this method had strong specificity. The results were still positive when the dilution ratio of S. suis-positive serum reached 1:6, 400, thus indicating that the method had high sensitivity. The results of the reproducibility assay for indirect ELISA showed that the intra-assay coefficient of variation and the inter-assay coefficient of variation were less than 10%, indicating that the method had good repeatability. We investigated the seroprevalence of S. suis in 167 serum samples collected in East China, and 33.5% of the samples were positive for antibodies against S. suis, indicating that the prevalence of S. suis is high in pig farms in Eastern China. The novel GMD-ELISA is a convenient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method that provides technical support for rapid diagnosis and epidemiological investigation.

AB  - Klotho is a protein that plays different functions in female fertility. We have previously reported that klotho protein supplementation during in vitro maturation improves porcine embryo development, while klotho knockout for somatic cell cloning completely blocks full-term pregnancy in vivo. However, the effects of the microinjection of klotho protein or klotho knockdown dual vector in porcine embryos at different time points and the specific molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we injected the preassembled cas9 + sgRNA dual vector, for klotho knockdown, into the cytoplasm of the germinal vesicle stage of oocytes and into porcine embryos after 6-h parthenogenetic activation. Similarly, the klotho protein was inserted into the cytoplasm of germinal vesicle stage oocytes and porcine embryos after 6-h parthenogenetic activation. Compared with the controls, the microinjection of klotho dual vector markedly decreased the blastocyst formation rates in germinal vesicle stage oocytes and activated embryos. However, the efficiency of blastocyst formation when klotho protein was inserted before in vitro maturation was significantly higher than that after klotho protein insertion into parthenogenetically activated embryos. These results indicated that klotho knockdown may impair embryo development into blastocyst irrespective of injection timing. In addition, klotho protein injection timing in pig embryos may be an important factor for regulating embryo development.

AB  - The airway epithelium of the human nasal mucosa acts as a physical barrier that protects against inhaled substances and pathogens via bicellular and tricellular tight junctions (bTJs and tTJs) including claudins, angulin-1/LSR and tricellulin. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) increased by TGF-beta 1 is involved in the induction of nasal inflammation and injury in patients with allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. In the present study, to investigate how HMGB1 affects the barrier of normal human nasal epithelial cells, 2D and 2.5D Matrigel culture of primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells were pretreated with TGF-beta type I receptor kinase inhibitor EW-7197 before treatment with HMGB1. Knockdown of angulin-1/LSR downregulated the epithelial barrier. Treatment with EW-7197 decreased angulin-1/LSR and concentrated the expression at tTJs from bTJs and increased the epithelial barrier. Treatment with a binder to angulin-1/LSR angubindin-1 decreased angulin-1/LSR and the epithelial barrier. Treatment with HMGB1 decreased angulin-1/LSR and the epithelial barrier. In 2.5D Matrigel culture, treatment with HMGB1 induced permeability of FITC-dextran (FD-4) into the lumen. Pretreatment with EW-7197 prevented the effects of HMGB1. HMGB1 disrupted the angulin-1/LSR-dependent epithelial permeability barriers of HNECs via TGF- signaling in HNECs.

AB  - Studies have indicated that ambient pollutant exposure correlates with nasal disease, in which nasal mucosa microbiota play a crucial role. However, the association between exposure to real-ambient air pollutants and the composition of nasal mucosa microbiota has not been well studied. This study aimed to explore the composition of nasal mucosa microbiota after exposure to real-ambient air pollutants with a special system. We monitored PM2.5, O-3, etc. in the system and confirmed PM2.5 and O-3 were the main pollutants. SD rats were exposed to the system for 16 weeks in summer or 22 weeks in autumn-winter. The concentrations of PM2.5 were 24.00 mu g/m(3) in the Summer stage and 22.21 mu g/m(3) in the autumn-winter stage. The O-3 concentrations were 25.46 and 13.55 mu g/ m(3), respectively. Exposure altered bacterial beta diversity in the summer stage. There were 4 and 3 different bacteria at the king, order, family and genus levels between the two groups at the two stages, respectively. The abundance of opportunistic pathogens changed, Pseudomonas decreased in summer stage, and Bifidobacterium increased in the autumn-winter stage. The influence of the season on the nasal mucosa microbiota was analyzed. The alpha diversity of the autumn-winter stage was higher than that of the summer stage. LEfSe analysis revealed 34 differential bacterial taxa at the king, order, family and genus level in the two control groups and 31 of the two exposure groups, which were not the same as the bacteria between the control groups and exposure groups. We found that PM2.5 combined with O-3 exposure was associated with the composition of the nasal mucosa microbiota and the abundance of opportunistic pathogens, in which season likely impacted the microbiota.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient which affects plant development and quality formation for tea plants. Notable genetic variation in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) has been reported among different genotypes of Camellia sinensis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences have not been illuminated. In this study, a N-15 tracing method was used to compare nitrogen use efficiency among six genotypes. The results show that there were significant differences in the NUEs among these genotypes. Among them, TC12 had the highest NUE, while LJCY had the lowest NUE. Transcriptome analysis between these two cultivars showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in photosynthesis-antenna proteins and zeatin biosynthesis in mature leaves and new shoots, respectively. TC12 had higher expression levels of AMT1.2, NRT2.4, and NRT3.2 in the roots, AAP6 and AAP7 in the stems and shoots, and LHC in the mature leaves than LJCY. The expression of ZOG1 and CKX, which are involved in zeatin biosynthesis, was down-regulated in the shoots of TC12 compared with LJCY. These findings will contribute to insights into the molecular mechanism of nitrogen utilization and the identified candidate genes provide a genetic resource for improving N use efficiency in tea plants.

AB  - Although historically widespread in most of the shallow and warm waters of the world, the presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still a debated question. For some authors, they never inhabited this basin except as vagrants, while for other authors both Pristis pristis and Pristis pectinata were present in the Mediterranean Sea but were extirpated in the 1960s-1970s. The sawfish rostrum kept in the Basilica Santuario del Carmine Maggiore (Naples, Italy), and considered by some authors the first record of sawfish in the Mediterranean was studied using a combination of morphological, genetic, radiocarbon dating and histochemical staining methods to validate the taxonomic identification, estimate its age and assess its geographical origin. Results indicate that the rostrum does not belong to P. pristis as reported by previous authors, but instead possesses morphological and genetic characters typical of P. pectinata. In addition, the radiocarbon age shows that the rostrum is more recent than previously believed, dating it back to the mid-nineteenth century, and genetic and meristic results cast doubt on its presumed Mediterranean origin. This study demonstrates that historical records should always be critically evaluated before using them to draw any far-reaching conclusion about species' past ecology and/or biogeography, and that future studies using historical information and specimens should adopt an integrative taxonomy approach similar to the one used here.

AB  - Simple Summary Neuronal plasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt in response to activity-dependent changes. This process, among others, allows the brain to acquire memory or to compensate for a neurocognitive deficit. We analyzed adult FTSJ1-deficient mice in order to gain insight into the role of FTSJ1 in neuronal plasticity. These mice displayed alterations in the hippocampus (a brain structure that is involved in memory and learning, among other functions) e.g., in the form of changes in dendritic spines. Changes in dendritic spines are considered to represent a morphological hallmark of altered neuronal plasticity, and thus FTSJ1 deficiency might have a direct effect upon the capacity of the brain to adapt to plastic changes. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an electrophysiological correlate of neuronal plasticity, and is related to learning and to processes attributed to memory. Here we show that LTP in FTSJ1-deficient mice is reduced, hinting at disturbed neuronal plasticity. These findings suggest that FTSJ1 deficiency has an impact on neuronal plasticity not only morphologically but also on the physiological level. The role of the tRNA methyltransferase FTSJ1 in the brain is largely unknown. We analyzed whether FTSJ1-deficient mice (KO) displayed altered neuronal plasticity. We explored open field behavior (10 KO mice (aged 22-25 weeks)) and 11 age-matched control littermates (WT) and examined mean layer thickness (7 KO; 6 WT) and dendritic spines (5 KO; 5 WT) in the hippocampal area CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) within area CA1 was investigated (5 KO; 5 WT), and mass spectrometry (MS) using CA1 tissue (2 each) was performed. Compared to controls, KO mice showed a significant reduction in the mean thickness of apical CA1 layers. Dendritic spine densities were also altered in KO mice. Stable LTP could be induced in the CA1 area of KO mice and remained stable at for at least 1 h, although at a lower level as compared to WTs, while MS data indicated differential abundance of several proteins, which play a role in neuronal plasticity. FTSJ1 has an impact on neuronal plasticity in the murine hippocampal area CA1 at the morphological and physiological levels, which, in conjunction with comparable changes in other cortical areas, might accumulate in disturbed learning and memory functions.

AB  - The growth and development of horns are primarily controlled by the skin. The ALOX12B gene is crucial for epidermal barrier function and may have a significant impact on horn growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of ALOX12B across different sheep breeds and tissues by utilizing RNA sequencing. Additionally, potential functional sites were identified in conjunction with whole genome sequencing. Our findings revealed that ALOX12B was highly expressed in the scurred horn group as opposed to the normal horn group (SHE). ALOX12B expression was also notably high in the skin across several species. Eight loci that may influence horn size were indicated in this study. Through the alignment of the ALOX12B protein sequence from 16 species, 15 amino acid sites were identified specifically expressed in horned animals. In conclusion, this study established a connection between ALOX12B and horn size and identified a series of functional sites that may serve as molecular markers for reducing the presence of horns in Chinese sheep breeds.

AB  - Synopsis Intrauterine undernutrition in humans typically results in low birth weight ([small for gestational age] SGA) and delayed postnatal neuromotor maturation. Since SGA and intrauterine growth retardation are also common in domestic pigs, piglets are premised as models to study delayed motor development. Applied to the locomotor paradigm, however, questions emerge: (i) how to map the developmental time scale of the precocial model onto the altricial target species and (ii) how to distinguish size from maturation effects? Gait data were collected at self-selected voluntary walking speed during early development (0-96 hours postpartum; pp) for SGA- and normal ([appropriate for gestational age] AGA) piglets. Dimensionless spatiotemporal gait characteristics (according to dynamic similarity) become invariant already after 4 hours pp, suggesting rapid postnatal neuromotor maturation. Moreover, dimensionless gait data are largely identical for SGA- and AGA-siblings, indicating that primarily size effects explain absolute locomotor differences. This is further supported by (i) normalized force-generating capacity of limb muscles, (ii) joint kinematics (<10 hours pp), and (iii) normalized ground reaction forces (<5 days pp) being indifferent between SGA- and AGA- piglets. Furthermore, predictive modeling based on limb joint kinematics is unable to discern the majority of SGA- from AGA-piglets (<10 hours pp). All this leads to the conclusion that, although smaller than the AGA piglets in absolute terms, SGA-piglets mature (neuromechanically speaking) just like, and equally fast as their AGA littermates. Yet, it remains a fact that early SGA piglets are reported to be less mobile, less vital, and less competitive than their AGA siblings (even often die before day 3 pp). This conspicuous difference likely results from the energy level (blood glucose and glycogen) and its mobilization being considerably different between the piglet categories during early development.

AB  - Hypertension is a risk factor for vascular dementia, which is the second most prevalent type of dementia, just behind Alzheimer's disease. This highlights the brain vulnerability due to hypertension, which may increase with aging. Thus, studying how hypertension affects neural cells and behavior, as well as the effects of antihypertensives on these alterations, it's important to understand the hypertension consequences in the brain. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been useful for the study of hypertension alterations in diverse organs, including the brain. Thus, we studied the losartan effects on cognitive and structural neuroplasticity impairments in SHR of 10 months of age. In the first instance, we evaluated the losartan effects on exploratory behavior and novel object recognition test (NORT) in the SHR. Then, we assessed the density and morphology of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) layers 3 and 5, and CA1 of the dorsal Hp (dHp). Our results indicate that in SHR, losartan treatment (2 months, 15 mg/Kg/day) reduces high blood pressure to age matched vehicle-treated Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat levels. Moreover, losartan improved long-term memory in SHR compared with age-matched vehicle-treated WKY rats, without affecting the locomotor and anxiety behaviors. The behavioral improvement of the SHR can be associated with the increase in the number of dendritic spines and the mushroom spine population in the PFC and the dHp. In conclusion, losartan enhances cognitive impairments by controlling the high blood pressure and improving neuroplasticity in animals with chronic hypertension.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Early life and gestational experience influence the behavioural development of the offspring. This study investigated the relationship between gestating gilts' fear of humans and cortisol levels and their feeding and maternal behaviour, and the personality (coping style, human fear) and growth of their piglets. Gilts were classified as fearful or friendly after four human approach tests performed between d 104 and d 111 of gestation, cortisol level was assessed between d 90 and d 108 of gestation, and maternal behaviour evaluated at d 13 of lactation. Piglets were submitted to a back test at 13 days old, and to a human approach test and an open field test at 20 days old. Fearful gilts had higher cortisol levels than friendly gilts. Piglets from friendly gilts tended to have a more active response to the back test, less freezing reaction in the open field test, and accepted human contact more than piglets from fearful gilts. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the fearfulness of gilts towards humans is related to their stress levels, and that both could influence the behavioural profile of their offspring.
   Gestational and early life experiences affect subsequent behavioural and physical development. The objective of the current study was to investigate associations between gilts' fear of humans, gestational stress level, and feeding and maternal behaviour, as well as how these related to aspects of the personality and growth of their offspring. A total of 37 gilts were used. Four human approach tests were performed between d 104 and d 111 of gestation to classify gilts as fearful or friendly. Gilt feeding behaviour and salivary cortisol concentration was measured between d 90 and d 108 of gestation, and gilt nursing behaviour assessed at d 13 of lactation. Piglets were subject to a back test at d 13 of age, to an open field test and a human approach test at d 20 of age, and growth was monitored to weaning (d 26 of age). Gilts classified as having a fearful behavioural profile had higher cortisol levels than friendly gilts (p < 0.05). Human fear level did not affect reproductive performance or the growth of offspring (p > 0.05). The offspring of friendly gilts tended to have a more active response to the back test (p = 0.09), less freezing response in the open field test (p < 0.05), and received human contact more than piglets from fearful gilts (p < 0.05). The present study shows that gilt human fear level is linked to their stress levels, which can affect the personality of their piglets.

AB  - Organisms must adapt to environmental stresses to ensure their survival and prosperity. Different types of stresses, including thermal, mechanical, and hypoxic stresses, can alter the cellular state that accompanies changes in gene expression but not the cellular identity determined by a chromatin state that remains stable throughout life. Some tissues, such as adipose tissue, demonstrate remarkable plasticity and adaptability in response to environmental cues, enabling reversible cellular identity changes; however, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. We hypothesized that positive and/or negative "Integrators" sense environmental cues and coordinate the epigenetic and transcriptional pathways required for changes in cellular identity. Adverse environmental factors such as pollution disrupt the coordinated control contributing to disease development. Further research based on this hypothesis will reveal how organisms adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions, such as temperature, extracellular matrix stiffness, oxygen, cytokines, and hormonal cues by changing their cellular identities.
   Organisms adapt to environmental demands, ensuring their survival and well-being by modifying cellular identities, shaped by chromatin configurations. Here, we propose that environmental signals are sensed by "Integrators", orchestrating the epigenetic and transcriptional processes governing cellular identity. Adverse environmental factors such as pollution disrupt epigenetic control contributing to disease development.image

AB  - The association between cause and effect is usually probabilistic. Memories triggered by ambiguous cues may be altered or biased into a more negative perception in psychiatric diseases. Understanding the formation and modulation of this probabilistic association is important for revealing the nature of aversive memory and alterations in brain diseases. We found that 50% conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS-US) association during Pavlovian fear conditioning results in reduced fear responses and neural spiking in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) due to enhanced inhibition from dmPFC parvalbumin (PV) neurons. Formation of probabilistic memory is associated with increased synaptic inputs to PV-neurons and requires activation of ventral hippocampus, which detects CS-US mismatch during conditioning. Stress prior to conditioning impairs the formation of probabilistic memory by abolishing PV-neuronal plasticity, while stress prior to memory retrieval reverts enhanced PV-neuron activity. In conclusion, PV-neurons tailor learned responses to fit brain state at the moment of retrieval.

AB  - Manipulating dietary nutrients, especially protein fractions, holds significance in enhancing the antioxidant capacity and immunity function of ruminants. This study investigated the impact of dietary adjustments in soluble protein (SP) levels, in conjunction with a reduction in crude protein (CP) content, on the antioxidant capacity, inflammatory response, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of sheep. This study had four dietary treatments, including a control diet (CON) adhering to NRC standards with a CP content of 16.7% on a dry matter basis and three diets with an approximately 10% reduction in CP content compared to CON with SP levels (% of CP) of 21.2 (SPA), 25.9 (SPB) and 29.4% (SPC), respectively. Thirty-two healthy male Hu sheep, with an initial live weight of 40.37 +/- 1.18 kg and age of 6 months, were randomly divided into four groups to receive these respective diets. Our data revealed no significant differences in slaughter performance among treatments (p > 0.05), although low-protein treatments decreased the stomachus compositus index (p < 0.05). Compared with CON, as SP was adjusted to 21.2%, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and catalase (CAT) concentrations were decreased in the serum (p < 0.05), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) content was decreased in jejunum and ileum (p < 0.05), superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration was reduced in the duodenum (p < 0.05), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was increased in spleen and ileum (p < 0.05). On the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8) contents were upregulated in the serum (p < 0.05), while immunoglobulin (IgA and IgM) contents were reduced in the duodenum (p < 0.05) with SP adjustments. Additionally, the SPB and SPC diets reduced the content of saturated fatty acids and increased the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with CON (p < 0.05), along with retention in the tenderness and water-holding capacity of the longissimus lumborum muscle. In summary, reducing CP by 10% with an SP proportion of similar to 25-30% improved meat quality without compromising antioxidant capacity and immunity function, while lower SP levels had adverse effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Auto-immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Continued exposure to high levels of systemic inflammation has several other health consequences, including negative effects on organs such as the brain. These detrimental effects may result in mood and neurological disorders. However, the exact mechanisms through which inflammation can result in mood disturbances and neurological disorders are not well known and are difficult to study in humans. The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model has been used to mimic human autoimmune disorders and systemic inflammation. In this study, we used the CIA model to gain a better understanding of the role of inflammation on the processes that may be involved in mood and neurological disorders, by looking at several molecular markers in different brain regions. Our results showed that all the brain regions studied in the CIA rats had high levels of local inflammation, which may have resulted in cell death in these areas. We also showed that the markers associated with neuron health and neurotransmitters implicated in mood disturbances were dysregulated in some, but not all brain regions. These results suggest that inflammation induced by autoimmune disorders may result in neuroinflammation that could result in neurodegeneration.Abstract Background: The effects of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model of systemic inflammation, on brain regional molecular markers associated with neurological disorders are uncertain. Objective: This study investigated the brain regional molecular changes in markers associated with inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in a CIA model. Methods: Fourteen male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control (n = 5) or CIA (n = 9) groups. 10 weeks after CIA induction, brain tissue was collected. Brain regional mRNA expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1 beta and IL-6), apoptotic markers (BAX and Bcl2) and neurotrophic factors (BDNF, CREB and TrkB) was determined. Monoamine distribution and abundance in different brain regions were determine by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Results: Neuroinflammation was confirmed in the CIA group by increased IL-beta mRNA expression, concurrent with an increased BAX/Bcl2 ratio. The mRNA expression of CREB was increased in the midbrain and hippocampus while BDNF was increased and TrkB was decreased across all brain regions in CIA compared to control animals. Serotonin was decreased in the midbrain and hippocampus while dopamine was decreased in the striatum of CIA rats, compared to controls. Conclusion: CIA resulted in neuroinflammation concurrent with an apoptotic state and aberrant expression of neurotrophic factors and monoamines in the brain, suggestive of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: In humans and livestock species, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to study the association between variants distributed across the genome and a phenotype of interest. To discover genetic polymorphisms affecting the duodenum, liver, and muscle transcriptomes of 300 pigs from 3 different breeds (Duroc, Landrace, and Large White), we performed expression GWAS between 25,315,878 polymorphisms and the expression of 13,891 genes in duodenum, 12,748 genes in liver, and 11,617 genes in muscle. Results: More than 9.68 x 10(11) association tests were performed, yielding 14,096,080 significantly associated variants, which were grouped in 26,414 expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) regions. Over 56% of the variants were within 1 Mb of their associated gene. In addition to the 100-kb region upstream of the transcription start site, we identified the importance of the 100-kb region downstream of the 3UTR for gene regulation, as most of the cis-regulatory variants were located within these 2 regions. We also observed 39,874 hotspot regulatory polymorphisms associated with the expression of 10 or more genes that could modify the protein structure or the expression of a regulator gene. In addition, 2 motifs (5 '-GATCCNGYGTTGCYG-3 ' and a poly(A) sequence) were enriched across the 3 tissues within the neighboring sequences of the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in each cis-eQTL region. Conclusions : The 14 million significant associations obtained in this study are publicly available and have enabled the identification of expression-associated cis-, trans-, and hotspot regulatory variants within and across tissues, thus shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of regulatory variations that shape end-trait phenotypes.

AB  - The distribution of methane sources in Kuwait was mapped through mobile vehicle surveying of methane mole fraction, and by collection of air samples at source for subsequent isotopic analysis. Mobile plume identification and isotopic analysis, reveals that by far the largest observed source of methane in Kuwait is from landfill sites (delta C-13(CH4) of -58 parts per thousand), with smaller contributions from fossil fuel industry (-50 parts per thousand), wastewater treatment (-49 parts per thousand) and ruminant animals (sheep-64 parts per thousand, cows, -62 parts per thousand, camels-60 parts per thousand).
   Regular weekly air samples were collected over two years from three sites in Kuwait, one NW of the city, one to the SE and one in the city from the rooftop of the Kuwait College of Science. Associated with higher mole fraction is a consistent depletion in C-13 of methane, pointing to a national source mix with delta C-13(CH4) of -55.9 parts per thousand. This is significantly different from calculations using EDGAR v.5 inventory that suggest a source mix of-52.8 parts per thousand. Diurnal campaigns from a city location confirm that the sources are dominantly biogenic (-59 to -56 parts per thousand) in and around the urban areas.
   The EDGAR 5.0 inventory suggests that the dominant sources of methane in Kuwait are leaks from gas flaring and fossil fuel distribution, with additional smaller emissions from landfills, sewage (wastewater) treatment and ruminant animals, but with a waste component increasing relative to fossil fuel emissions in recent decades. Measurements during 2015 and 2016 suggest that for all but the far south and SW of the country which is not in the meteorological footprint of fixed site or mobile measurement, there is a dominant waste source and much smaller observed proportion from fossil fuel activities.
   This research demonstrates for the first time in Kuwait that continuous mobile measurements for plume identification coupled with high-precision isotopic analysis using CF-GC-IRMS (Continuous Flow Gas Chromatography-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) is an effective way of identifying methane sources and understanding their relative contributions. To unambiguously quantify relative contributions will require further work, particularly in the SW region of the country, utilizing aircraft and/or satellite retrievals. The results of this research will contribute to understanding the methane budget of this poorly studied region.

AB  - Context Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main bioactive ingredient of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L., [Asteraceae]) for traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. Objective To explore the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of HSYA on post-TBI neurogenesis and axon regeneration. Materials and methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into Sham, controlled cortex impact (CCI), and HSYA groups. Firstly, the modified Neurologic Severity Score (mNSS), foot fault test, hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl's staining, and immunofluorescence of Tau1 and doublecortin (DCX) were used to evaluate the effects of HSYA on TBI at the 14th day. Next, the effectors of HSYA on post-TBI neurogenesis and axon regeneration were screened out by pathology-specialized network pharmacology and untargeted metabolomics. Then, the core effectors were validated by immunofluorescence. Results HSYA alleviated mNSS, foot fault rate, inflammatory cell infiltration, and Nissl's body loss. Moreover, HSYA increased not only hippocampal DCX but also cortical Tau1 and DCX following TBI. Metabolomics demonstrated that HSYA significantly regulated hippocampal and cortical metabolites enriched in 'arginine metabolism' and 'phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism' including l-phenylalanine, ornithine, l-(+)-citrulline and argininosuccinic acid. Network pharmacology suggested that neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were the core nodes in the HSYA-TBI-neurogenesis and axon regeneration network. In addition, BDNF and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) were significantly elevated following HSYA treatment in the cortex and hippocampus. Discussion and conclusions HSYA may promote TBI recovery by facilitating neurogenesis and axon regeneration through regulating cortical and hippocampal metabolism, BDNF and STAT3/GAP43 axis.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is widely present in the natural environment, and exposure to it can lead to learning and memory impairment. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are still largely unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of histone modifications in environmental levels of arsenic (sodium arsenite) exposure-induced learning and memory dysfunction in male rats, and the inter/transgenerational effects of paternal arsenic exposure were also investigated. It was found that arsenic exposure impaired the learning and memory ability of F0 rats and down-regulated the expression of cognition-related genes Bdnf, c-Fos, mGlur1, Nmdar1, and Gria2 in the hippocampus. We also observed that inorganic arsenite was methylated to DMA and histone modification-related metabolites were altered, contributing to the dysregulation of H3K4me1/2/3, H3K9me1/2/3, and H3K4ac in rat hippocampus after exposure. Therefore, it is suggested that arsenic methylation and hippocampal metabolism changes attenuated H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K4ac while enhancing H3K9me1/2/3, which repressed the key gene expressions, leading to cognitive impairment in rats exposed to arsenic. In addition, paternal arsenic exposure induced transgenerational effects of learning and memory disorder in F2 male rats through the regulation of H3K4me2 and H3K9me1/2/3, which inhibited c-Fos, mGlur1, and Nmdar1 expression. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity and highlight the risk of neurological deficits in offspring with paternal exposure to arsenic.

AB  - Parasitoids are known to exploit volatile cues emitted by plants after herbivore attack to locate their hosts. Feeding and oviposition of a polyphagous herbivore can induce the emission of odor blends that differ among distant plant species, and parasitoids have evolved an incredible ability to discriminate them and locate their hosts relying on olfactive cues. We evaluated the host searching behavior of the egg parasitoid Cosmocomoidea annulicornis (Ogloblin) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) in response to odors emitted by two taxonomically distant host plants, citrus and Johnson grass, after infestation by the sharpshooter Tapajosa rubromarginata (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), vector of Citrus Variegated Chlorosis. Olfactory response of female parasitoids toward plants with no herbivore damage and plants with feeding damage, oviposition damage, and parasitized eggs was tested in a Y-tube olfactometer. In addition, volatiles released by the two host plant species constitutively and under herbivore attack were characterized. Females of C. annulicornis were able to detect and significantly preferred plants with host eggs, irrespectively of plant species. However, wasps were unable to discriminate between plants with healthy eggs and those with eggs previously parasitized by conspecifics. Analysis of plant volatiles induced after sharpshooter attack showed only two common volatiles between the two plant species, indole and beta-caryophyllene. Our results suggest that this parasitoid wasp uses common chemical cues released by many different plants after herbivory at long range and, once on the plant, other more specific chemical cues could trigger the final decision to oviposit.

AB  - Most species of Cryptocoryneum have been reported on dead wood, with some species rarely reported from leaf litter or arthropod dung. Cryptocoryneum polyramosum sp. nov., collected from dead twigs of tea (Camellia sinensis), grown in high mountain areas in Sichuan Province in China, is described and illustrated. The new species is distinguished by having up to 24 cylindrical, brown, smooth conidial arms, a significantly higher number compared to other known Cryptocoryneum species, which typically possess fewer than 16 arms. The phylogenetic analyses based on a combined sequence dataset of LSU, SSU, ITS, tef1-alpha, and rpb2 indicate that C. polyramosum forms a distinct clade, sister to other species within the genus. Comparative morphological analysis with other Cryptocoryneum species highlights the unique features of this taxon. A detailed list of morphological variations is provided to enhance the understanding of the genus Cryptocoryneum and its species diversity.

AB  - This is the first scientific report of the behavior of adult Gerstaeckeria bifasciata (Gerstaecker, 1860) and the damage they cause on the globose cactus Stenocactus obvallatus (DC.) A. Berger ex A.W. Hill (Cactaceae). During 2017, we surveyed a population of S. obvallatus (N = 337 plants) in Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato, Mexico, recording the damage that they presented in their stems. A year later, a second survey was carried out, recording survival or death of the plants. Although 86% of plants showed ribs damaged by this weevil in the first census, only a small percentage of them died (5.64%). Our study suggests that S. obvallatus has evolved mechanisms that allow it to tolerate herbivory by this weevil, as we recorded G. bifasciata adults feeding from both caulinary (ribs) and reproductive structures (floral buds and flowers) of S. obvallatus.

AB  - Sheep, like most seasonal mammals, exhibit a cyclic adaptive reproductive physiology that allows ewes to give birth to their progeny during the spring when environmental conditions are favorable to their survival. This process relies on the detection of day length (or photoperiod) and is associated with profound changes in cellular plasticity and gene expression in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, mechanisms that are suggested to participate in the seasonal adaptation of neuroendocrine circuits. Recently, pituitary vascular growth has been proposed as a seasonally regulated process in which the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a well-known angiogenic cytokine, is suspected to play a crucial role. However, whether this mechanism is restricted to the pituitary gland or also occurs in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), a crucial contributor to the control of the reproductive function, remains unexplored. Using newly developed image analysis tools, we showed that the arcuate nucleus (ARH) of the MBH exhibits an enhanced vascular density during the long photoperiod or non-breeding season, associated with higher expression of VEGFA. In the median eminence (ME), a structure connecting the MBH to the pituitary gland, higher VEGFA, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR/VEGFR2) and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) gene expressions were detected during the long photoperiod. We also found that VEGFA and its receptor, VEGFR2, are expressed by neurons and tanycytes in both the ARH and ME. Altogether, these data show variations in the MBH vasculature according to seasons potentially through a VEGFA-dependent pathway, paving the way for future studies aiming to decipher the role of these changes in the hypothalamic control of seasonal reproduction.

AB  - Biocontrol of caterpillars by ants is highly variable, and we investigate how the strength of the trophic relationship between ants and an important outbreaking forest pest depends on phenological synchrony and on social foraging. We test the hypothesis that early spring foraging by ants, coupled with eusocial recruitment behavior, could undermine the caterpillar's strategies to achieve either enemy-free space or predator satiation.We use a series of field surveys and experiments in trembling aspen stands (Populus tremuloides) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada to assess the role of ants in early-instar mortality of the outbreaking, gregarious forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria). We also investigate individual-level mechanisms related to phenology and social behavior that underlie the effectiveness of ants as biocontrol on caterpillars. Our results show that ants climb trees early in the spring and harvest young forest tent caterpillars, suggesting that early phenology does not provide an entirely enemy-free space for caterpillars. Our findings further show that recruitment-based social foraging enables ants to deplete groups of gregarious prey, suggesting that these eusocial insects are particularly effective at generating predation pressure on gregarious herbivores since they do not satiate easily. Finally, a manipulative predator exclusion experiment confirms that ant predation is a significant mortality source for early-instar forest tent caterpillars. Taken together, these results suggest that phenology and sociality could modulate the role of ants as effective caterpillar predators and thus showcase the importance of considering natural history and behavioral traits when studying trophic interactions and their role in population dynamics.

AB  - Maternal nutritional restriction impacted lipogenic gene expression in adipose tissue of offspring, but the association of this programming with DNA methylation is not yet clear. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the effects of maternal feed intake restriction on offsprings' blood indexes, lipid metabolism of perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) and DNA methylation of lipogenic genes. Blood and PAT were collected from the fetuses (at d 100 of gestation) and kids (at d 90 after birth). Maternal undernutrition (at d 45 to d 100) decreases heart and kidney weight of kid goats after birth. Maternal undernutrition decreased the content of leptin in the umbilical cord blood of fetuses. The expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was decreased in fetal PAT of the restriction group, but fatty acid synthetase (FASN) was increased. Protein abundance of UCP1 and FASN was down-regulated in the fetal PAT from the restriction group. Furthermore, only the methylation level of the CpG site (from -756 to -757 bp) in the promoter region of FASN gene was increased for the fetal PAT from the restriction group. These results revealed that maternal feed intake restriction influenced the leptin secretion, changed the expression of FASN and UCP1 gene of fetal PAT. This alteration was able to recover in the kids after removing intake restriction, but the growth performance and visceral organ mass were still impaired, suggesting abnormal fat metabolism may happen in the future.

AB  - The modification of secondary metabolites is crucial to the function of metabolites in tea (Camellia sinensis L.). The arabinan deficient (ARAD) encodes an arabinosyltransferase and is involved in the arabinan biosynthesis pathway. Two full-length sequences of CsARADs were cloned and obtained from tea plants through the rapid amplification of cDNA ends and named CsARAD1 and CsARAD2. CsARAD1 and CsARAD2 are predicted to be 2 membrane proteins containing N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation sites and are 2 homologs of the glycosyltransferases (GT) 47 family, according to various bioinformatic analyses. CsARADs showed higher transcription levels in nonlignified tissues (e.g., buds and young leaves) than in old leaves and stems. CsARADs also exhibited the highest expression level in autumn, indicating that CsARAD regulation is affected by environmental factors. The transcript levels of CsARADs were changed after various abiotic stress treatments, and CsARAD1 and CsARAD2 displayed different regulation patterns in temperature stress, saline, and drought-like conditions. CsARAD1 and CsARAD2 were both significantly downregulated after tea seedlings were treated with an ethylene precursor and abscisic acid. In addition, CsARAD2 was downregulated after being treated with methyl jasmonate and gibberellin. Collectively, our findings on the function of arabinosyltransferase serve as a basis for further research and breeding applications.

AB  - The prevalence of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety is high and often comorbid with other dis-eases. Chronic stress is a common risk factor for these disorders, but the mechanisms behind their development are not yet fully understood. Metabolomics has revealed a close association between purine and pyrimidine metabolism and depression and anxiety, with increased levels of serum xanthine observed in both humans and mice. Xanthine is known as purine metabolism, and this compound shows several biological activities, but the impact of xanthine on our brain function is still unclear. The hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in memory and learning, is also implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. Here, we investigated the effects of xanthine intraperitoneal administration on spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior in mice. The findings indicated that xanthine administration induced a deficit of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and a tendency to anxiety-like behavior in mice. RNA-seq analysis showed that xanthine administration upregulated hemoglobin (Hb) genes involved in oxygen transport in the hippocampus. The upregulated Hb genes occurred in the neuronal cells, and in vitro experiments revealed that both Hba-a1 derived from mice and HBA2 derived from humans were upregulated by xanthine treatment. These observations suggest that the xanthine-induced Hb in the hippocampus could be related to spatial memory deficit and anxiety. This study sheds light on the direct effects of xanthine on the brain and its potential role in the development of depression and anxiety symptoms caused by chronic stress.

AB  - Negative allosteric modulators, such as lynx1 and lynx2, directly interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The nAChRs are integral to cholinergic signaling in the brain and have been shown to mediate different aspects of cognitive function. Given the interaction between lynx proteins and these receptors, we examined whether these endogenous negative allosteric modulators are involved in cognitive behaviors associated with cholinergic function. We found both cell-specific and overlapping expression patterns of lynx1 and lynx2 mRNA in brain regions associated with cognition, learning, memory, and sensorimotor processing, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex, septum, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, and pontine nuclei. Since lynx proteins are thought to play a role in conditioned associations and given the expression patterns across brain regions, we first assessed whether lynx knockout mice would differ in a cognitive flexibility task. We found no deficits in reversal learning in either the lynx1(-/-) or lynx2(-/-) knockout mice. Thereafter, sensorimotor gating was examined with the prepulse inhibition (PPI) assessment. Interestingly, we found that both male and female lynx1(-/-) mice exhibited a deficit in the PPI behavioral response. Given the comparable expression of lynx2 in regions involved in sensorimotor gating, we then examined whether removal of the lynx2 protein would lead to similar behavioral effects. Unexpectedly, we found that while male lynx2(-/-) mice exhibited a decrease in the baseline startle response, no differences were found in sensorimotor gating for either male or female lynx2(-/-) mice. Taken together, these studies provide insight into the expression patterns of lynx1 and lynx2 across multiple brain regions and illustrate the modulatory effects of the lynx1 protein in sensorimotor gating.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder is a serious psychiatric illness having serious damaging effect on the quality of life of suffers. Quercetin is a plant flavonoid, mostly used as a constituent in dietary products. This study evaluated antidepressant effect of quercetin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression in rats. Materials and methods: Twenty-one male rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 7): group 1 (vehicle only), group 2 (quercetin), group 3 (LPS). Rats were treated with vehicle (10 mL/kg, p.o.) or quercetin (50 mg/ kg, p.o.) for seven days. Sixty minutes after treatment on day seven, all animals were injected with LPS (0.83 mg/ kg, i.p.) except group 1 (vehicle only). Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, animals were assessed for depressive symptoms using forced swim, sucrose splash and open field tests. Animals were sacrificed; brain samples collected for bioassay of pro-inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while expressions of NF-kappa B, inflammasomes, microglia and iNOS were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Results: The LPS significantly (p < 0.05) decreased mobility of rats in FST and decreased sucrose preference, which is indicative of depressive-like behaviours. These behaviours were significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated by quercetin compared to control (vehicle only). Following LPS exposure, the expressions of inflammasomes, NF-kappa B, iNOS, proinflammatory cytokines and microglia positive cells in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated. All these were attenuated by pretreating animals with quercetin. Conclusion: Quercetin exhibit antidepressant-like property, which may be related to inhibition of neuro-inflammatory signaling pathways.

AB  - Loss-of-function variants in SYNGAP1 cause a developmental encephalopathy defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy. SYNGAP1 splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts multiple cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function in vivo to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-alpha 1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of alpha 1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing alpha 1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with alpha 1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP-aexpression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.

AB  - Orexins or hypocretins are excitatory neumpeptides predominantly produced by neuronal clusters in the lateral hypothalamus. The orexinergic system's involvement in pain modulation makes it a candidate for pain control alternative to the opioid system. Moreover, orexin-1 and orexin -2 receptors (OX1r and OX2r, respectively) play a role in responsiveness to stressful stimuli. Some evidence indicates that the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus potentially participates in the modulation of both pain and stress. In quest of better understanding the interaction between orexin receptors and stress-induced analgesia (SIA), The present study examined the involvement of OX1r and OX2r within the CAl in response to acute pain after exposure to forced swim stress (FSS) for a 6-min period. Adult male Wistar rats received different doses of OX1r antagonist (5B334867; 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol), OX2r antagonist (TCS OX2 29; 3, 10, 30 and 100 nmol), or vehicle (0.5 mu l DMSO) through an implanted cannula. After that, animals individually experienced acute pain by performing the tail-flick test. Results indicated that FSS produces antinociceptive responses in the tail-flick test. Blockade of both orexin receptors within the CA1 region attenuated the analgesic effect of FSS. The antinociceptive effect of swim stress was prevented by lower doses of SB334867 than TCS OX2 29. These findings show that the orexinergic system might be partially involved in the SIA via the OX1 and OX2 receptors in the hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - The carpal gland is an important exocrine gland in pigs, functioning mainly through diverticula that release strongly odorous secretions. The size of the carpal gland and the number of diverticula may be related to its function. To measure its size, the gland must be dissected from the foreleg, and this procedure is time-consuming and cumbersome. The diverticulum is the outlet of the carpal gland, and its number correlates with the carpal gland size, but the correlation coefficient between them is still unknown. To explore the relationship between the size and diverticular number of the carpal gland, 788 pigs from four populations were used in this study. The length, width, thickness, weight and volume of the carpal gland were measured, together with its diverticular number. The phenotypic correlation coefficient between each pair of the recorded traits was calculated, and a two-factor analysis of variance was used to test whether sex and population have effects on the phenotypes. The carpal gland is a flat small stick with a length of 1.8-8.6 cm, width of 0.6-2.5 cm, and thickness of 0.2-0.8 cm, and its specific gravity is 0.51-1.36. Each carpal gland has 0 to 10 diverticula, and 82.3% carpal glands have 2-6 diverticula. The diverticular number correlates positively with the weight (r = 0.57 and r(s) = 0.58, p < 2.2 x 10(-16)) and volume (r = 0.55 and r(s) = 0.56, p < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Population and sex only explain 20% of the phenotypic variance, suggesting that the 80% of carpal gland influences remain unknown. In conclusion, the diverticular number can be used as a proxy for the weightand volume of the carpal gland, because it is easy to count and has a significant positive correlation with the size of thecarpal gland.

AB  - General anesthesia is widely utilized in the clinic for surgical and diagnostic procedures. However, growing evidence suggests that anesthetic exposure may affect cognitive function negatively. Unfortunately, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and efficient prevention and therapeutic strategies for the anesthesia induced cognitive dysfunction. 5-HT7R, a serotonin receptor family member, is functionally associated with learning and memory. It has recently become a potential therapeutic target in various neurological diseases as its ligands have a wide range of neuropharmacological effects. However, it remains unknown the role of 5-HT7R in the long-term isoflurane anesthesia-induced memory impairment and whether prior activation or blockade of 5-HT7R before anesthesia has modulating effects on this memory impairment. In this study, 5-HT7R selective agonist LP-211 and 5-HT7R selective antagonist SB-269970 were pretreated intraperitoneally to mice before anesthesia; their effects on the cognitive performance of mice were assessed using fear conditioning test and novel object recognition test. Furthermore, the transcriptional level of 5-HT7R in the hippocampus was detected using qRT-PCR, and proteomics was conducted to probe the underlying mechanisms. As a result, long-term exposure to isoflurane anesthesia caused memory impairment and an increase in hippocampal 5-HT7R mRNA expression, which could be attenuated by SB-269970 pretreatment but not LP-211pretreatment. According to the proteomics results, the antiamnestic effect of SB-269970 pretreatment was probably attributed to its action on the gene expression of Slc6a11, Itpka, Arf3, Srcin1, and Epb41l2, and synapse organization in the hippocampus. In conclusion, 5-HT7R is involved in the memory impairment induced by long-term isoflurane anesthesia, and the prior blockade of 5-HT7R with SB-269970 protects the memory impairment. This finding may help to improve the understanding of the long-term isoflurane anesthesia-induced memory impairment and to construct potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for the adverse effects after long-term isoflurane exposure.

AB  - Phytotoxic substances released by invasive plants have been reported to have anti-pathogen, anti-herbivore, and allelopathic activity. The aim of this study was to determine the allelopathic influence of the Ambrosia trifida L. on oxidative stress parameters (the lipid peroxidation process; reduced glutathione (GSH) content; and activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (PX)) and phenolic compounds (total phenolic and tannin content) in maize (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) crops to explore the effect of released allelochemicals through A. trifida root on crops. An analysis by HPLC confirmed the presence of protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and syringic acid as major components in the A. trifida. Based on the obtained results for oxidative stress parameters, it can be concluded that the sunflower was the most sensitive species to A. trifida allelochemicals among the tested crops. The other two crops tested showed a different sensitivity to A. trifida. The soybean did not show sensitivity, while the maize showed sensitivity only 10 days after the sowing.</p>

AB  - Endocardial cushion formation is essential for heart valve de-velopment and heart chamber separation. Abnormal endocardial cushion formation often causes congenital heart defects. B-Catenin is known to be essential for endocardial cushion formation; however, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that endothelial-specific deletion of B-catenin in mice resulted in formation of hypoplastic endocardial cushions due to re -duce d cell proliferation and impaired cell migration. By using a B-cateninDM allele in which the transcriptional function of B-catenin is selectively disrupted, we further reveal that B-catenin regulated cell proliferation and migration through its transcriptional and non-transcriptional function, respectively. At the molecular level, loss of B-catenin resulted in increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21 in cushion endocardial and mesenchymal cells in vivo. In vitro rescue experiments with HUVE Cs and pig aortic valve interstitial cells confirmed that B-catenin promoted cell proliferation by suppressing p21. In addition, one savvy negative observation is that B-catenin was dispensable for endocardial-to-mesenchymal fate change. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that B-catenin is essential for cell proliferation and migration but dispensable for endocardial cells to gain mesenchymal fate during endo-cardial cushion formation. Mechanistically, B-catenin promotes cell proliferation by suppressing p21. These findings inform the potential role of B-catenin in the etiology of congenital heart defects.

AB  - Phase II clinical trials have reported that acute treatment of surgical skin wounds with the therapeutic peptide alpha Connexin Carboxy-Terminus 1 (alpha CT1) improves cutaneous scar appearance by 47% 9-month postsurgery. While Cx43 and ZO-1 have been identified as molecular targets of alpha CT1, the mode-of-action of the peptide in scar mitigation at cellular and tissue levels remains to be further characterized. Scar histoarchitecture in alpha CT1 and vehicle-control treated skin wounds within the same patient were compared using biopsies from a Phase I clinical trial at 29-day postwounding. The sole effect on scar structure of a range of epidermal and dermal variables examined was that alpha CT1-treated scars had less alignment of collagen fibers relative to control wounds-a characteristic that resembles unwounded skin. The with-in subject effect of alpha CT1 on scar collagen order observed in Phase I testing in humans was recapitulated in Sprague-Dawley rats and the IAF hairless guinea pig. Transient increase in histologic collagen density in response to alpha CT1 was also observed in both animal models. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and primary human dermal fibroblasts treated with alpha CT1 in vitro showed more rapid closure in scratch wound assays, with individual cells showing decreased directionality in movement. An agent-based computational model parameterized with fibroblast motility data predicted collagen alignments in simulated scars consistent with that observed experimentally in human and the animal models. In conclusion, alpha CT1 prompts decreased directionality of fibroblast movement and the generation of a 3D collagen matrix postwounding that is similar to unwounded skin-changes that correlate with long-term improvement in scar appearance.

AB  - Introduction: Invasive and superficial fungal infections are increasingly reported in Algeria, testifying to the increase in their frequency in parallel with the increase in risk factors and the availability of diagnostic means, at least in university hospitals (CHU). The latter, located in the major northern cities, are equipped with high-performance diagnostic tools compared to hospitals in the interior of the country.Methods: A comprehensive search of published and grey literature was undertaken. Prevalence and incidence of discrete fungal diseases were estimated using a deterministic modelling approach based on populations at risk. Population (2021) and major underlying disease risk groups were obtained from UNAIDS, WHO Tuberculosis and the international transplant registries as well as published data for asthma and COPD. The health service profile was summarised from national documentation.Results: Among the 43.6 million, including 12.9 million children, living in Algeria, the most prevalent fungal diseases are tinea capitis (>1.5 million), recurrent vaginal candidiasis (>500,000) and allergic fungal lung and sinus disorders (>110,000) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (>10,000). Life-threatening invasive fungal infection incidence includes 774 Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS, 361 cryptococcal meningitis, 2272 candidaemia and 2639 invasive aspergillosis cases. Fungal keratitis probably affects >6000 eyes each year.Conclusions: Fungal infections are underestimated in Algeria because they are sought in patients with risk factors only after bacterial infections when they should be sought in parallel. The diagnosis is only accessible in hospitals in large cities and the work carried out in mycology is rarely published, making the estimation of the burden of these conditions difficult.

AB  - Temperature and food quality are the most important environmental factors determining the performance of herbivorous insects. The objective of our study was to evaluate the responses of the spongy moth (formerly known as the gypsy moth) [Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae)] to simultaneous variation in these two factors. From hatching to the fourth instar, larvae were exposed to three temperatures (19 ?, 23 ?, and 28 ?) and fed four artificial diets that differed in protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) content. Within each temperature regime, the effects of the nutrient content (P+C) and ratio (P:C) on development duration, larval mass, growth rate, and activities of digestive proteases, carbohydrases, and lipase were examined. It was found that temperature and food quality had a significant effect on the fitness-related traits and digestive physiology of the larvae. The greatest mass and highest growth rate were obtained at 28 ? on a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet. A homeostatic increase in activity was observed for total protease, trypsin, and amylase in response to low substrate levels in the diet. A significant modulation of overall enzyme activities in response to 28 ? was detected only with a low diet quality. A decrease in the nutrient content and P:C ratio only affected the coordination of enzyme activities at 28 ?, as indicated by the significantly altered correlation matrices. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that variation in fitness traits in response to different rearing conditions could be explained by variation in digestion. Our results contribute to the understanding of the role of digestive enzymes in post-ingestive nutrient balancing.

AB  - Plant-insect interactions are often influenced by host- or insect-associated metagenomic community members. The relative abundance of insects and the microbes that modulate their interactions were obtained from sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) leaf-associated metagenomes using quantitative reduced representation sequencing and strain/species-level profiling with the Qmatey software. Positive correlations were found between whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and its endosymbionts (Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa, Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum, and Rickettsia spp.) and negative correlations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that implicate nitric oxide in sweetpotato-whitefly interaction. Genome-wide associations using 252 975 dosage-based markers, and metagenomes as a covariate to reduce false positive rates, implicated ethylene and cell wall modification in sweetpotato-whitefly interaction. The predictive abilities (PA) for whitefly and Ocypus olens abundance were high in both populations (68%-69% and 33.3%-35.8%, respectively) and 69.9% for Frankliniella occidentalis. The metagBLUP (gBLUP) prediction model, which fits the background metagenome-based Cao dissimilarity matrix instead of the marker-based relationship matrix (G-matrix), revealed moderate PA (35.3%-49.1%) except for O. olens (3%-10.1%). A significant gain in PA after modeling the metagenome as a covariate (gGBLUP, <= 11%) confirms quantification accuracy and that the metagenome modulates phenotypic expression and might account for the missing heritability problem. Significant gains in PA were also revealed after fitting allele dosage (<= 17.4%) and dominance effects (<= 4.6%). Pseudo-diploidized genotype data underperformed for dominance models. Including segregation-distorted loci (SDL) increased PA by 6%-17.1%, suggesting that traits associated with fitness cost might benefit from the inclusion of SDL. Our findings confirm the holobiont theory of host-metagenome co-evolution and underscore its potential for breeding within the context of G x G x E interactions.

AB  - The release of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) has been recognized to be an important strategy for plant adaptation to herbivore attack. However, whether these induced volatiles are beneficial to insect herbivores, particularly insect larvae, is largely unknown. We used the two important highly polyphagous lepidopteran pests Spodoptera frugiperda and S. litura to evaluate the benefit on xenobiotic detoxification of larval exposure to HIPVs released by the host plant maize (Zea mays). Larval exposure of the invasive alien species S. frugiperda to maize HIPVs significantly enhanced their tolerance to all three of the well-known defensive compounds 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA), chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid in maize and the two commonly used insecticides methomyl and chlorpyrifos. HIPV exposure also improved the larval tolerance of S. litura third instars to chlorogenic and tannic acids. Furthermore, larval exposure to either maize HIPVs or DIMBOA induced the activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), and carboxylesterase (CarE) in the midguts and fat bodies of the two insects, while the induction was significantly higher by the two components together. In addition, the expression of four genes encoding uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases (UGT33F28, UGT40L8) and P450s (CYP4d8, CYP4V2) showed similar induction patterns in S. frugiperda. Cis-3-hexen-1-ol, an important component in maize HIPVs, also showed the same functions as maize HIPVs, and its exposure increased larval xenobiotic tolerance and induced the detoxification enzymes and gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that HIPVs released by the pest-infested host plants are conductive to the xenobiotic tolerance of lepidopteran insect larvae. Hijacking the host plant HIPVs is an important strategy of the invasive alien polyphagous lepidopteran pest to counter-defend against the host plant's chemical defense.

AB  - The evolution of very large body size requires a ubiquitous and abundant source of food. In marine environments, the largest animals such as whale sharks are secondary consumers that filter feed on nekton, which is plentiful, although patchy. Consequently, feeding in coastal environments requires cost-efficient foraging that focuses on oceanographic features that aggregate both nektonic prey and marine debris such as floating macroalgae. Consumption of this algae could present an energetic challenge for these animals, unless some component can be digested. Here, we use a multi-technique approach involving amino acid compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) and fatty acid analysis to determine the trophic level of whale sharks and to identify likely items in the diet. CSIA analyses showed that the species has a trophic level consistent with omnivory. Fatty acid profiles of whale shark tissues, feces and potential prey items suggest that the floating macroalgae, Sargassum, and its associated epibionts is a significant source of food. Although this overcomes the energetic challenge of consumption of floating algae, this mode of feeding and the need to focus on oceanographic features that aggregate prey also increases the threat to the species posed by pollutants such as plastic.

AB  - It is known that fluorine and aluminum are commonly found in the environment and that long-term overexposure can adversely affect the organism's nervous system, damaging the structure and function of brain tissue. Our previous study showed that fluorine combined with aluminum (FA) could trigger apoptosis in vitro and cause spatial learning and memory impairment and differentially expressed miRNAs (including miR-34b-5p) in the hippocampi in vivo. However, the detailed mechanism is unclear. Learning memory damage is implicated in excessive hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and miR-34b-5p participates in regulating the hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the current research, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to FA, and NG108-15 control cells and NG108-15 cells pretransfected with miR-34b-5p agomir or antagomir were exposed to FA. We found that FA triggered apoptosis of rat hippocampal neurons and NG108-15 cells, increased miR-34b-5p expression, and decreased Gnai2, PKA, ERK and CREB expression. Inhibition of miR-34b-5p alleviated FA-induced NG108-15 cell apoptosis and further increased Gnai2, PKA, ERK, and CREB expression, and vice versa. Furthermore, miR-34b-5p modulated the level of Gnai2 by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), as verified through the dual Luciferase reporter assay. These outcomes suggested that miR-34b-5p participated in FA-induced neuronal apoptosis by targeting Gnai2 negatively, thereby inhibiting the PKA/ERK/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Biological control is often the most cost effective and environmentally sound method of managing widespread environmental weeds. Earlier detection of cryptic species and improved understanding of host-herbivore associations during the initial screening for effective natural enemies should further boost success rates. We formalise a framework for improved prioritisation of biological control agents through the successive feedback between ecological surveys and molecular screening. Incorporating enhanced molecular methods to strengthen hypothesis testing in the initial phases of exploratory research will help prioritise herbivores and regions for subsequent native range surveys, and should more readily uncover unrecognised cryptic species that may otherwise remain hidden. We postulate that this iterative methodology should enhance the environmental safety and cost-benefit ratios of future biological control programs, and this approach should help to elucidate problematic aspects of existing programs.

AB  - Biotic stressors, such as pathogens and herbivorous insects, significantly reduce global agricultural productivity, resulting in estimated annual yield losses of 10-40% and considerable economic damage. Plant nutritional status fundamentally influences defense mechanisms against these biotic challenges. This comprehensive review examines the multifaceted roles of mineral nutrients in enhancing plant immune responses and resilience to biotic stress factors. This review examines how macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, B, Cl, Si) influence plant defense through strengthening structures, regulating biochemical pathways, and activating signalling cascades. It specifically highlights the dual roles of nitrogen in forming structural barriers and influencing pathogen susceptibility, potassium's role in regulating stomatal function and activating defense enzymes, calcium's contribution in maintaining cell wall integrity and defense signalling, as well as the catalytic functions of micronutrients in antioxidant systems and phenolic compound synthesis. The review also explores mechanistic aspects of nutrient-mediated immunity, including calcium-dependent signalling pathways, potassium-regulated jasmonic acid synthesis, nitrogen modulation of defense-related proteins, and micronutrient cofactor roles in reactive oxygen species metabolism. Furthermore, the review examines nutrient combinations that work synergistically to improve effectiveness against certain pathogens and pests, while also assessing practical applications of strategic nutrient management in various cropping systems. It concludes by highlighting existing knowledge gaps and suggesting future research avenues, with a focus on integrating molecular methods to clarify nutrient-defense interactions and validating nutrient-based strategies in various agroecological regions.

AB  - Knowledge of plant recognition of insects is largely limited to a few resistance (R) genes against sap-sucking insects. Hypersensitive response (HR) characterizes monogenic plant traits relying on R genes in several pathosystems. HR-like cell death can be triggered by eggs of cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.), pests of cabbage crops (Brassica spp.), reducing egg survival and representing an effective plant resistance trait before feeding damage occurs. Here, we performed genetic mapping of HR-like cell death induced by Pieris brassicae eggs in the black mustard Brassica nigra (B. nigra). We show that HR-like cell death segregates as a Mendelian trait and identified a single dominant locus on chromosome B3, named PEK (Pieris egg- killing). Eleven genes are located in an approximately 50 kb region, including a cluster of genes encoding intracellular TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) receptor proteins. The PEK locus is highly polymorphic between the parental accessions of our mapping populations and among B. nigra reference genomes. Our study is the first one to identify a single locus potentially involved in HR-like cell death induced by insect eggs in B. nigra. Further fine-mapping, comparative genomics and validation of the PEK locus will shed light on the role of these TNL receptors in egg-killing HR.

AB  - Premise of research. This investigation was undertaken to describe a multifloral grass spikelet enclosed in Baltic amber. The fossil, described in the new genus Eograminis, represents the first definite grass to be described from Baltic amber as well as the first fossil member of the subfamily Arundinoideae. The discovery adds a new plant group to the extensive flora previously described from Baltic amber and provides insights into the ecology of the forest habitat. It also supplies morphological and developmental features that existed in early Cenozoic grasses and establishes a calibration point for future phylogenetic studies regarding the origin and splitting of genera in the subtribe Moliniinae. Methodology. The piece of amber containing the fossil was reshaped with a diamond blade lapidary trim saw, a belt sander, and a bench polisher until it was possible to view the grass spikelet from all angles. Because of the excellent preservation of the spikelet, observations of the glumes, paleae, and lemmas could be made under direct light with a stereoscopic and compound microscope. Pivotal results. After the features of the spikelet are characterized, it is described as Eograminis balticus gen. et sp. nov. (Poaceae: Arundinoideae). The new genus is characterized by the presence of stomata with well-developed dome-shaped subsidiary cells, parallel guard cells, and rows of crenulated and noncrenulated epidermal cells with long and short cells and silica bodies. Conclusions. The spikelet has some features of members of the extant genus Molinia Schrank in the tribe Molinieae, subtribe Moliniinae, a wetland genus with extant species concentrated around the Baltic Sea. However, the sparse scabrosity over the lemma veins, minute or absent keel hooks on the paleae, and bicellular or absent microhairs of Molinia spp. separate it from the fossil. The presence of an immature orthopteran and an "Alternaria-like fungal spore" associated with the fossil grass provides data on the microhabitat of the fossil grass.

AB  - Since the beginning of the 21st century, humans have experienced three coronavirus pandemics, all of which were transmitted to humans via animals. Recent studies have found that porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) can infect humans, so swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV) may cause harm through cross-species transmission. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PDCoV have caused tremendous damage and loss to the pig industry around the world. Therefore, we analyzed the genome sequence data of these two SeCoVs by evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography, revealing the genetic diversity and spatiotemporal distribution characteristics. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analysis showed that TGEV could be divided into two different genotypes, and PDCoV could be divided into four main lineages. Based on the analysis results inferred by phylogeography, we inferred that TGEV might originate from America, PDCoV might originate from Asia, and different migration events had different migration rates. In addition, we also identified positive selection sites of spike protein in TGEV and PDCoV, indicating that the above sites play an essential role in promoting membrane fusion to achieve adaptive evolution. In a word, TGEV and PDCoV are the past and future of SeCoV, and the relatively smooth transmission rate of TGEV and the increasing transmission events of PDCoV are their respective transmission characteristics. Our results provide new insights into the evolutionary characteristics and transmission diversity of these SeCoVs, highlighting the potential for cross-species transmission of SeCoV and the importance of enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures for SeCoV in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - Indian tea germplasm is known for its diversity, which not only assists the development of superior planting material for tea breeding but also functions as a genetic resource for other tea-producing countries. In this study, the aim was to develop an improved cryo-protocol for long-term conservation of tea germplasm. Shoot tips (approximately 2 mm) of Camellia sinensis were cryopreserved using vitrification and V cryo-plate techniques. The recovery rate of cryopreserved shoot tips obtained using vitrification was 33.2% at 90 min of Plant Vitrification Solution 2 (PVS2) exposure. To improve recovery rates and tolerance to cryo-injury, shoot tip donor plants were preconditioned with cold hardening, high sucrose, abscisic acid (ABA), and proline prior to cryopreservation. The vitrification technique resulted in an increase of regrowth of shoot tips to 60.5% after preconditioning of shoot tip donor plants for 30 d at 25 degrees C with 10 mg L-1 ABA and 3 mg L-1 proline. Regrowth further increased to 75.6% with the V cryo-plate technique using shoot tip donor plants preconditioned with the above concentrations of ABA and proline. After cryopreservation, shoot tips were recovered on regrowth medium that developed into shoot cultures in 5 wk. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed to test genetic fidelity after cryopreservation and results showed 100% monomorphism among all the regenerants and 10-mo-old in vitro mother cultures. Results showed that the preconditioning strategies along with V cryo-plate technique influenced and improved the cryo-recovery rate of shoot tips of tea and provided a robust protocol for tea cryopreservation.

AB  - Identifying the nursery origins of individual Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is critical to a refined understanding of regional productivity, the effects of environmental forcing on population dynamics, and the spatial impacts of mortality and bycatch. Otolith microchemistry may provide a tool for identifying fish origins, but a precursor to using microchemistry-based assignment models is to evaluate the extent to which there exists detectable spatial structure in these natural tags. Here, we examined assignment accuracy as a function of spatial scale using canonical discriminant function analyses (DFA) applied to microchemical data from age-2 Pacific halibut in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS). Element:calcium ratios were assayed for fourteen trace elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; delta C-13 and delta O-18 were determined via isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Substantial assignment success (similar to 75-90 %) was observed at spatial scales that are consistent with stock management. Elemental signatures were defined primarily by delta O-18, delta C-13, and Sr-88:Ca-48, with a minor contribution from Mn-55:Ca-48. Individuals were most commonly mis-assigned to adjacent locations. However, discontinuities were observed within the western GOA that suggest that elemental signatures do not vary along strictly longitudinal and latitudinal clines. These results highlight the need to exercise caution when attempting to use otolith microchemistry to assign fish to their origins when the baseline elemental data are unable to resolve missing nursery sources from the locations that are included in the discrimination models.

AB  - GABAB receptors play a modulatory role in the mechanisms underlying drug addiction, sleep problems, and aging; however, there are few studies addressing their relationships to each other. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether blockade of these receptors affects methamphetamine (METH) reward memory in adult and adolescent rapid-eye movement sleep-deprived (RSD) rats. Adolescent and adult male Wistar rats were subjected to RSD for seven days. They were then conditioned to receive methamphetamine (METH; 2 mg/kg, ip) during an eight-day conditioning period. METH reward memory was then reactivated during a retrieval trial and the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, ip) was injected prior to the retrieval trial. Afterward, animals were retested for the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) and hippocampal expression of GABAB receptors. Baclofen dose-dependently decreased the retrieval of METH reward memory in control and RSD adult and adolescent rats, but its effects were stronger at the higher dose. Moreover, we found stronger effects of baclofen in adolescent animals than in adult ones. In addition, baclofen at its higher dose decreased GABAB overexpression in the hippocampus of adolescent rats, but not in adult rats. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the role of GABAB receptors in the retrieval of METH reward memory and highlight the importance of considering age and sleep problems in understanding addiction. Further research could potentially lead to the development of therapeutics for individuals struggling with METH addiction.

AB  - The human-elephant conflict is a current issue that receives global attention and occurs in all elephant-distribution countries. This paper focuses on Pu ' er and Xishuangbanna cities in the distribution area of Asian elephants in Yunnan Province. Based on two case studies, we collect basic information from local farmers regarding the severity of the damage caused by Asian elephants and the impact this has on their psychology. Based on the Logit model and modulation effect, we analyze the impact farmers' livelihood capital on how they choose livelihood strategies in the distribution area and whether damage caused by Asian elephants and general conflict conditions can regulate this impact. The results show that the damage caused by Asian elephants and general conflict conditions is serious in the distribution area, but the number of farmers who choose to change their livelihood strategies is small. The damage caused by Asian elephants has a different modulation effect on farmers' livelihood capital. In the future, we should be more considerate of the livelihood capital accumulation of local farmers in the process of protecting Asian elephants, with a view towards maintaining and improving the livelihoods of farmers.

AB  - Simple Summary: The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, a species of significant medical and veterinary importance, harbors an endosymbiont, Rickettsia buchneri. This bacterium is largely restricted to the ovaries, but all life stages can harbor different numbers or lack R. buchneri entirely. The endosymbiont is cultivable in cell lines isolated from embryos of Ixodes ticks. We characterized the cells using microscopy. The doubling time of wildtype R. buchneri and a transformant expressing green fluorescent protein was determined to be > 7 days when measured by quantitative PCR. Quantification based on fluorescence indicated that 11 days were needed to double the amount of green fluorescent protein. Two rRNA probes were tested using rickettsiae grown in vitro and adapted to localize R. buchneri in different organs of field-collected female I. scapularis ticks. We observed strong positive signals of R. buchneri in the ovaries and surrounding the nucleus of the developing oocytes. The sequestration of rickettsia in ticks and the slow growth dynamics strengthen the contemporary understanding of R. buchneri as a transovarially transmitted, non-pathogenic endosymbiont.The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, a species of significant importance to human and animal health, harbors an endosymbiont Rickettsia buchneri sensu stricto. The symbiont is largely restricted to the ovaries, but all life stages can harbor various quantities or lack R. buchneri entirely. The endosymbiont is cultivable in cell lines isolated from embryos of Ixodes ticks. Rickettsia buchneri most readily grows and is maintained in the cell line IRE11 from the European tick, Ixodes ricinus. The line was characterized by light and electron microscopy and used to analyze the growth dynamics of wildtype and GFPuv-expressing R. buchneri. qPCR indicated that the genome copy doubling time in IRE11 was > 7 days. Measurements of fluorescence using a plate reader indicated that the amount of green fluorescent protein doubled every 11 days. Two 23S rRNA probes were tested via RNA FISH on rickettsiae grown in vitro and adapted to evaluate the tissue tropism of R. buchneri in field-collected female I. scapularis. We observed strong positive signals of R. buchneri in the ovaries and surrounding the nucleus of the developing oocytes. Tissue tropism in I. scapularis and in vitro growth dynamics strengthen the contemporary understanding of R. buchneri as a transovarially transmitted, non-pathogenic endosymbiont.

AB  - The mechanisms that underly reproductive hormone effects on cognition, neuronal plasticity, and AD risk, particularly in relation to gonadotropin LH receptor (LHCGR) signaling, remain poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge and clarify the impact of circulating steroid hormones on the therapeutic effects of CNS LHCGR activation, we delivered the LHCGR agonist human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) intracerebroventricularly (ICV) and evaluated functional, structural, plasticity -related signaling cascades, A beta pathology, and transcriptome differences in reproductively intact and ovariectomized (OVX) APP/PS1 AD female mice. Here we demonstrate that CNS hCG delivery restored function to wild -type levels only in OVX APP/PS1 mice. Spine density was increased in all hCG treated groups independently of reproductive status. Notably, increases in BDNF signaling and cognition, were selectively upregulated only in the OVX hCG-treated group. RNA sequencing analyses identified a significant increase in peripheral myeloid and pro -inflammatory genes within the hippocampi of the OVX group that were completely reversed by hCG treatment, identifying a potential mechanism underlying the selective therapeutic effect of LHCGR activation. Interestingly, in intact mice, hCG administration mimicked the effects of gonadectomy. Together, our findings indicate that CNS LHCGR agonism in the post -menopausal context is beneficial through trophic and immune mechanisms. Our findings also underscore the presence of a steroid-LHCGR mechanistic interaction that is unexplored yet potentially meaningful to fully understand "post -menopausal" brain function and CNS hormone treatment response.

AB  - Monoterpenoids are C-10 isoprenoid natural products with diverse functions as volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites. Their biosynthesis from acyclic diphosphate precursors is often accompanied by one or more ring closures, which stabilize the linear, carbocationic intermediates generated during typical terpene synthase reaction sequences. The subset that remains uncyclized following the elimination of the diphosphate group correspondingly retains higher reactivity than their cyclized counterparts, a property that may explain the additional transformations that geraniol and other acyclics undergo to yield monoterpene aldehydes, acids, esters, glycosides, and iridoids, many of which possess allelochemical activity as pollinator attractants, feeding deterrents, or insect repellents. Essential oils of lemon grass (or citronella) (Cymbopogon), rose-scented geraniums (Pelargonium), and lemon-scented gums (Corymbia) are rich sources of the acyclic monoterpene alcohols we collectively refer to in this review as 'citronelloids'. Their formation from geranyl diphosphate may be brought about by the tps-g or tps-b subclade of terpene synthases or, alternatively, by a subclade of Nudix hydrolases which act preferentially on prenyl diphosphate substrates, yielding monoterpene alcohols in a two step process that involves a monophosphate intermediate. In some members of the Lamiid and Campanulid clades, further oxidation of geraniol and a non-classical, reductive cyclization leads to the iridoids, a group of mostly non-volatile, bicyclic monoterpenes with potent anti-herbivory and anti-inflammatory properties. Here we review the recent literature on acyclic monoterpene biosynthesis, their natural distribution across the plant kingdom, and their emerging roles in medicine as biologically active natural products.

AB  - We demonstrate the use of sequence-dependent interactions between peptide-functionalized pi-conjugated pig-ments to tune exciton transport behavior in their supramolecular assemblies in aqueous solutions. Peptide sequences attached to a perylene diimide (PDI) core were selected based on their ability to foster a wide range of excitonic coupling strengths within organized assemblies, as reflected by experimentally measured steady-state absorption and emission spectra. Photoresponses of organized assemblies of weakly interacting PDIs closely resemble those observed for weakly assembled chromophores. In contrast, organized assemblies that support strong intermolecular coupling exhibit significant excitonic delocalization and transport, as observed through distinct transient signatures of fluence-dependent singlet-singlet annihilation and a short-lived biexcitonic state at high initial exciton densities. A one-dimensional (1D) diffusion model appropriately accounts for exciton-exciton encounters in assemblies, with effective exciton diffusion constants that scale with interchromophore coupling strength, ranging between 0 and 7 sites2/ps (0-1 nm2/ps or LD ranging from 0 to 40 nm). Variations in effective diffusion constant arise from peptide-tuned variations in interchromophore alignment and wavefunction overlap, with mixed Frenkel-CT exciton coupling identified as the key interaction that facilitates site-to-site exciton diffusion within PDI stacks. This work demonstrates the potential to use simple peptide sequence variation as a tool for rational engineering of exciton transport and other excited-state behaviors in supramolecular materials.

AB  - Plants being sessile organisms and lacking both circulating phagocytic cells and somatic adaptive immune response, have thrived on various defense mechanisms to fend off insect pests and invasion of pathogens. CYP450s are the versatile enzymes, which thwart plants against insect pests by ubiquitous biosynthesis of phytohormones, antioxidants, and secondary metabolites, utilizing them as feeding deterrents and direct toxins. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of biotic stress-responsive CYPs from Glycine max was performed to ascertain their function against S. litura-infestation. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies on conserved domains and motifs disclosed the evolutionary correspondence of these GmCYPs with already characterized members of the CYP450 superfamily and close relatedness to Medicago truncatula. These GmCYPs were mapped on 13 chromosomes; they possess 1-8 exons; they have evolved due to duplication and are localized in endoplasmic reticulumn. Further, identification of methyl-jasmonate, salicylic acid, defense responsive and flavonoid biosynthesis regulating cis-acting elements, their interaction with biotic stress regulating proteins and their differential expression in diverse types of tissues, and during herbivory, depicted their responsiveness to biotic stress. Three-dimensional homology modelling of GmCYPs, docking with heme cofactor required for their catalytic activity and enzyme-substrate interactions were performed to understand the functional mechanism of their action. Moreover, to gain insight into their involvement in plant defense, gene expression analysis was evaluated, which revealed differential expression of 11 GmCYPs upon S. litura-infestation, 12 GmCYPs on wounding while foliar spray of ethylene, methyl-jasmonate and salicylic acid differentially regulated 11 GmCYPs, 6 GmCYPs, and 10 GmCYPs respectively. Our study comprehensively analysed the underlying mechanism of GmCYPs function during S. litura-infestation, which can be further utilized for functional characterization to develop new strategies for enhancing soybean resistance to insect pests.

AB  - Intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected streptozotocin (STZ) model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is used to explore the effect of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on astrocyte and microglia reactivity in selectively vulnerable brain regions and answer the question whether these changes are in the context of cognitive capacity. The iTBS is a non-invasive approach for stimulating neuronal and glial activity with the ability to induce long-term potentiation-like plasticity and represents a promising treatment for different neurological diseases, including AD. Male Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: 1. Control subjected to icv saline solution, 2. STZ subjected to icv-STZ (bilaterally, 3 mg/kg), 3. STZ+iTBS subjected to iTBS therapy after icv-STZ, 4. STZ+iTBS placebo subjected to noise artifact after icv-STZ and 5. Control+iTBS subjected to iTBS therapy after icv-saline solution. The RotaRod result showed that STZ did not alter motor function in rats. Eight arm radial maze test results showed that iTBS significantly improved cognitive impairment induced by STZ intoxication. Reactive gliosis in the hippocampus and periventricular area, manifested through elevated levels of Iba1(+) and GFAP(+)/VIM+ following icv-STZ, was ameliorated after iTBS treatment. Our research identifies iTBS as an effective therapeutic candidate against STZ-induced neurotoxicity and AD-like changes. The beneficial effects of iTBS on cognitive dysfunction might be due to targeting microglia and astrocytes, as they exert a protective role in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. The results could provoke translation into clinical practice as an early/add-on non-invasive therapeutic intervention for cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Fenchone is a bicyclic monoterpene found in a variety of aromatic plants, including Foeniculum vulgare and Peumus boldus, and is used in the management of airways disorders. This study aimed to explore the bronchodilator effect of fenchone using guinea pig tracheal muscles as an ex vivo model and in silico studies. A concentration-mediated tracheal relaxant effect of fenchone was evaluated using isolated guinea pig trachea mounted in an organ bath provided with physiological conditions. Sustained contractions were achieved using low K+ (25 mM), high K+ (80 mM), and carbamylcholine (CCh; 1 mu M), and fenchone inhibitory concentration-response curves (CRCs) were obtained against these contractions. Fenchone selectively inhibited with higher potency contractions evoked by low K+ compared to high K+ with resultant EC50 values of 0.62 mg/mL (0.58-0.72; n = 5) and 6.44 mg/mL (5.86-7.32; n = 5), respectively. Verapamil (VRP) inhibited both low and high K+ contractions at similar concentrations. Pre-incubation of the tracheal tissues with K+ channel blockers such as glibenclamide (Gb), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and tetraethylammonium (TEA) significantly shifted the inhibitory CRCs of fenchone to the right towards higher doses. Fenchone also inhibited CCh-mediated contractions at comparable potency to its effect against high K+ [6.28 mg/mL (5.88-6.42, n = 4); CCh] and [6.44 mg/mL (5.86-7.32; n = 5); high K+]. A similar pattern was obtained with papaverine (PPV), a phosphodiesterase (PDE), and Ca2+ inhibitor which inhibited both CCh and high K+ at similar concentrations [10.46 mu M (9.82-11.22, n = 4); CCh] and [10.28 mu M (9.18-11.36; n = 5); high K+]. However, verapamil, a standard Ca2+ channel blocker, showed selectively higher potency against high K+ compared to CCh-mediated contractions with respective EC50 values of 0.84 mg/mL (0.82-0.96; n = 5) 14.46 mg/mL (12.24-16.38, n = 4). The PDE-inhibitory action of fenchone was further confirmed when its pre-incubation at 3 and 5 mg/mL potentiated and shifted the isoprenaline inhibitory CRCs towards the left, similar to papaverine, whereas the Ca2+ inhibitory-like action of fenchone pretreated tracheal tissues were authenticated by the rightward shift of Ca2+ CRCs with suppression of maximum response, similar to verapamil, a standard Ca2+ channel blocker. Fenchone showed a spasmolytic effect in isolated trachea mediated predominantly by K+ channel activation followed by dual inhibition of PDE and Ca2+ channels. Further in silico molecular docking studies provided the insight for binding of fenchone with Ca2+ channel (-5.3 kcal/mol) and K+ channel (-5.7), which also endorsed the idea of dual inhibition.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a serious invasive crop pest and threat to food security. Conventional pest control approaches using chemical pesticides can lead to adverse environmental and human health problems calling for safer alternative pest management options. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by plants constitutively and in response to herbivory have been shown to enhance ecologically benign biocontrol alternatives to chemical insecticides for pest management. However, genotypic variations in VOC emissions have also been reported for plant species including maize (Zea mays). Hence, a better insight into the variations in odor profiles of different maize varieties and their corresponding role in recruiting pests' natural enemies are crucial for developing a sustainable biocontrol strategy. Our present study assessed the behavioral responses of the FAW egg-larval parasitoid, Chelonus bifoveolatus (Braconidae: Hymenoptera), to constitutive and induced volatiles from different maize landraces (Jowi Red, Nyamula) and hybrids (SC Duma, DK 777) grown in Kenya and compared their volatile profiles. In a four-arm olfactometer, female parasitoid wasps were significantly attracted to FAW oviposition-induced VOCs from SC Duma and Nyamula. Chemical analysis of test plant volatiles revealed significant variation in the quantity and quality of key bioactive VOCs such as (E)-2-hexenal, alpha-pinene, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, alpha-copaene, (E)-beta-farnesene and (E, E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene. Our findings provide more insights into genetic variation in VOCs emission across maize genotypes and the corresponding differences in attraction of pest natural enemies that provide indirect defense. As such, these traits could be exploited to enhance ecologically sustainable pest management strategies.

AB  - BackgroundGalls are abnormal plant tissues that result from the interaction between the defense responses of plants and the activities of galling herbivores. During infection, secondary metabolites are synthesized to mitigate the oxidative stress whereas growth and cellular processes in infected tissues are reprogrammed. Although the regulatory networks of growth-related phytohormones are recognized as the main component in gall formation, other factors like oxidative stress might also being critical in gall development. In this study, we focused on the spherical psyllid galls found in the leaves of Machilus japonica var. kusanoi to analyze the differences in transcript, protein content, and several metabolites between galls and leaves.ResultsEarly gall tissues were enriched in cell cycle regulation and organization genes, suggesting processes, such as mitosis, meiosis, and microtubule-based movement. Proteins such as CAM7, LSH6, and eIF2 beta, associated with seed development, were highly expressed in early gall tissues. We demonstrated a significant role for ROS-related stress responses in early gall development. Higher amount of polyphenols, which are well-known antioxidants, was found in gall tissue as well.ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying gall development and enhances our understanding of this complex process. Future research should explore the impact of ROS modulation on gall tissue development and assess phytohormone content at various psyllid larval and gall stages to elucidate the regulatory network involved in gall morphogenesis.

AB  - Cellular damage inflicted by wounding, pathogen infection, and herbivory releases a variety of host-derived metabolites, degraded structural components, and peptides into the extracellular space that act as alarm signals when perceived by adjacent cells. These so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) function through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors to regulate wound and immune responses. In plants, DAMPs act as elicitors themselves, often inducing immune outputs such as calcium influx, reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene expression, and phytohormone signaling. Consequently, DAMP perception results in a priming effect that enhances resistance against subsequent pathogen infections. Alongside their established function in local tissues, recent evidence supports a critical role of DAMP signaling in generation and/or amplification of mobile signals that induce systemic immune priming. Here, we summarize the identity, signaling, and synergy of proposed and established plant DAMPs, with a focus on those with published roles in systemic signaling.

AB  - The Andean highlands challenged but did not prevent human exploration and occupation starting in the Late Pleistocene. The timing and nature of these events is an ongoing area of research and debate for which reliable chronologies are required. Our goal is to revise the chronological framework of the Telarmachay rockshelter, a key site from the Andean highlands. To achieve this objective, we have conducted a new AMS dating programme utilizing 33 camelid bone samples from 6 archaeological layers and used a Bayesian modelling approach to determine the chrono-stratigraphy. Our chronology spans a greater than 5000 year sequence dated between 9.0-8.0 and 3.7-3.1 kyr BP, permitting reassessment of the antiquity and duration of the Telarmachay occupation, facilitating comparison with other sites, and allowing examination of domestic and symbolic practices in relation to Holocene climatic variation in the Central Andes. This study highlights the importance of the Junin area in the Andean highland occupation sequence. It also underlines the need for new radiocarbon dates to reassess previous data and directly date artifacts.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ants patrol foliage and exert a strong selective pressure on herbivorous insects, being their primary predators. As ants are chemically oriented, some organisms that interact with them (myrmecophiles) use chemical strategies mediated by their cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to deal with ants. Thus, a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of the mutualistic interactions between myrmecophiles and ants depends on the accurate recognition of these chemical strategies. Few studies have examined whether treehoppers may use an additional strategy called chemical camouflage to reduce ant aggression, and none considered highly polyphagous pest insects. We analyzed whether the chemical similarity of the CHC profiles of three host plants from three plant families (Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Moraceae) and the facultative myrmecophilous honeydew-producing treehopper Aetalion reticulatum (Hemiptera: Aetalionidae), a pest of citrus plants, may play a role as a proximate mechanism serving as a protection against ant attacks on plants. We found a high similarity (>80%) between the CHCs of the treehoppers and two of their host plants. The treehoppers acquire CHCs through their diet, and the chemical similarity varies according to host plant. Chemical camouflage on host plants plays a role in the interaction of treehoppers with their ant mutualistic partners.

AB  - Ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contribute to defense responses under abiotic stresses. The present study explored the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and ascorbate regeneration under high concentration (30 mM) of cadmium in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.). The tea leaves showed speckles and necrosis from the third day of Cd treatment. The content of superoxide anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the leaves were significantly higher until the seventh day after Cd treatment. The content of O2.- and H2O2 were the highest on the fifth day (212.7 and 153.6 % of the control, respectively). The AsA content increased (86.9 %) on the first day after Cd treatment and decreased significantly in the subsequent days, while GSH showed a reverse trend. The enzymatic activity assays showed that dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) involved in AsA regeneration were downregulated considerably after Cd foliar application. In contrast, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) increased on the first day and then declined. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR showed upregulation of glutathione synthetase (CsGSHS), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Cs gamma-ECS), and CsMDHAR of the AsA regeneration pathway and downregulation of CsDHAR and CsGR. The expressions of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (CsGGP), L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (CsGPP), and L-galactono1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (CsGaILDH) of the L-galactose pathway were also downregulated. The results indicated that AsA, which can respond to Cd stress of plants by increasing antioxidant ability, was consumed to scavenge ROS; moreover, Cd stress inhibited AsA synthesis and regeneration, which made that tea plants suffering severe damage.

AB  - Phosphate (Pi) and MYC2-mediated jasmonate (JA) pathway play critical roles in plant growth and development. In particular, crosstalk between JA and Pi starvation signalling has been reported to mediate insect herbivory resistance in dicot plants. However, its roles and mechanism in monocot-bacterial defense systems remain obscure. Here, we report that Pi starvation in rice activates the OsMYC2 signalling and enhances resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection. The direct regulation of OsPHR2 on the OsMYC2 promoter was confirmed by yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Molecular analyses and infection studies using OsPHR2-Ov1 and phr2 mutants further demonstrated that OsPHR2 enhances antibacterial resistance via transcriptional regulation of OsMYC2 expression, indicating a positive role of OsPHR2-OsMYC2 crosstalk in modulating the OsMYC2 signalling and Xoo infection. Genetic analysis and infection assays using myc2 mutants revealed that Pi starvation-induced OsMYC2 signalling activation and consequent Xoo resistance depends on the regulation of OsMYC2. Together, these results reveal a clear interlink between Pi starvation- and OsMYC2- signalling in monocot plants, and provide new insight into how plants balance growth and defence by integrating nutrient deficiency and phytohormone signalling. We highlighted a molecular link connecting OsMYC2-mediated JA pathway and phosphate starvation signalling in monocot plant. We demonstrated that phosphate starvation promoted OsMYC2 signalling to enhance rice defence to bacterial blight via transcriptional regulation of OsPHR2 on OsMYC2.

AB  - Eukaryotic NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (NAD-IDHs) are mitochondria-localized enzymes which catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate using NAD as a cofactor. In mammals, NAD-IDHs (or IDH3) consist of three types of subunits (a, b, and g), and exist as (a2bg)2 heterooctamer. Mammalian NAD-IDHs are regulated allosteri-cally and/or competitively by a diversity of metabolites including citrate, ADP, ATP, NADH, and NADPH, which are associated with cellular metabolite flux, energy demands, and redox status. Proper assembly of the component subunits is essential for the catalysis and regulation of the enzymes. Recently, crystal structures of human IDH3 have been solved in apo form and in complex with various ligands, revealing the molecular mecha-nisms for the assembly, catalysis, and regulation of the enzyme.

AB  - Obesogenic diets (ODs) consumption is associated with anxiety-like behaviour and negative changes in hippocampal BDNF. At the same time, interrupting OD intake, OD withdrawal (WTD), can bring health benefits, but previous studies reported the development of anxiety-like behaviours. The present work aimed to assess the relationship between anxiety-like behaviour with hippocampal BDNF in a WTD rodent model. Male Wistar rats (60d old) were fed a high-sugar/high-fat (HSHF) diet for 30d (n = 32), and half of them were transitioned to a control diet for 48 h (n = 16) afterwards. The control group (n = 16) was fed a control diet across the whole experiment. Besides increasing anxiety-like behaviours and lowering sociability, the WTD led to an increase in BDNF in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 of the hippocampus. It also decreased locomotor activity in both OF and EPM, however, they did not significantly interfere with the other behavioural parameters analysed. Western blotting analysis revealed that the increase in BDNF likely occurred in the mature forms (14 kD monomer and 28 kD dimer). The mediation models analyses suggested that the effect of WTD on anxiety-like behaviour was driven by hippocampal BDNF, this mediation of effect was region-dependent. Our results also suggested that mature BDNF forms (14 kD and 28 kD) were responsible. The present work brought light to a possible new role for mature BDNF, although it is generally associated with beneficial features, it can also be part of the genesis of anxiety-like behaviours and sociability aspects on WTD models.

AB  - Cannabis sativa is known for having unique specialized or secondary metabolites, cannabinoids that are derived from an extension of the terpene pathway in the Cannabis lineage and includes more than 100 other similar metabolites. Despite the assumption that cannabinoids evolved as novel herbivory defense adaptations, there is limited research addressing the role of cannabinoids in C. sativa responses to insect herbivores. Here we investigated the role of cannabidiol (CBD), the predominant cannabinoid in hemp, in plant defense against cannabis aphid (Phorodon cannabis), one of the most damaging pests of hemp. We hypothesize that insect feeding may induce changes in cannabinoids as an adaptive strategy for defense. We found that mean fecundity, net reproductive rate (R-0) and adult longevity of cannabis aphids was reduced on the high cannabinoid cultivar compared to the low- cannabinoid cultivar in whole plant assays. In contrast, supplementation of CBD in artificial feeding assays increased aphid fecundity from day 1 to day 3. Additionally, aphid feeding did not impact cannabinoid levels in leaf tissues with the exception of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This suggests that other cannabinoids and/or metabolites such as terpenes are causing the observed decrease in aphid performance in the whole plant assays. In addition to cannabinoids, C. sativa also possesses a range of defense mechanisms via phytohormone signaling pathways that are well described in other plant species. Indeed, cannabis aphid feeding significantly increased levels of the major phytohormones, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid, which are known to be involved in plant defense responses against aphid species. These results highlight the interplay between cannabinoid synthesis and phytohormone pathways and necessitate further investigation into this complex interaction.

AB  - Individual differences in biology as well as experience and exposures throughout life may contribute risk or resilience to neurocognitive decline in aging. To investigate the role of sex as a biological variable in cognitive function due to normal aging, we used substantial cohorts of healthy male and female aged outbred rats maintained under similar conditions throughout life to assess whether both sexes display a similar distribution of individual differences in behavioral performance using a water maze task optimized to assess hippocampal-dependent cognition in aging. We found both aged male and female rats performed poorer than young adults overall, but with no performance differences between sex in either young adults or aged groups in memory probe tests. In addition, aged male and female rats had similar distributions of individual differences such that the same proportion of male and female performed on par with (intact memory) or outside of (impaired memory) the benchmark of young rats of their respective sex. The data support the use of this outbred model with biological diversity to study the neurobiology of aging trajectories for variation in cognitive outcomes in both male and females.

AB  - Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is a promising microbial agent for quality improvement in crops; however, the effects of B. amyloliquefaciens biofertilizers on tea leaf metabolites are relatively unknown. Herein, a combination of metabolome profiling and transcriptome analysis was employed to investigate the effects of foliar spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens biofertilizers on tea leaf quality. The tea polyphenol to amino acid ratio (TP/AA), catechin, and caffeine levels decreased, but theanine level increased in tea leaves after foliar spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens. The differentially accumulated metabolites included flavonoids, phenolic acids, organic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates. The decrease in catechin was correlated with the catechin/flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The AMPD gene was highly associated with caffeine content, while the GOGAT gene was associated with theanine accumulation. Foliar spraying with B. amyloliquefaciens biofertilizers may improve summer tea quality. Our findings provide a basis for the application of B. amyloliquefaciens biofertilizers in tea plants and new insights on summer tea leaf resource utilization.

AB  - Objective: In vascular dementia (VD), memory impairment caused by the damage of synaptic plasticity is the most prominent feature that afflicts patients and their families. Treadmill exercise has proven beneficial for memory by enhancing synaptic plasticity in animal models including stroke, dementia, and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of treadmill exercise on recognition memory and structural synaptic plasticity in VD rat model. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: control group (C group, n = 6), vascular dementia group (VD group, n = 6), treadmill exercise and vascular dementia group (Exe-VD group, n = 6), and treadmill exercise group (Exe group, n = 6). Four-week treadmill exercise was performed in the Exe-VD and Exe groups. Then, the common carotid arteries of rats in the VD and Exe-VD groups were identified to establish the VD model. Behavior tests (open-field test and novel recognition memory test) were adopted to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and recognition memory. Transmission electron microscopy and Golgi staining were performed to observe synaptic ultrastructure and spine density in the hippocampus. Results: Our study demonstrated that VD rat exhibited significantly anxiety-like behavior and recognition impairment (p < .01), while treadmill exercise significantly alleviated anxiety-like behavior and improved recognition memory in VD rat (p < .01). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that hippocampal synapse numbers were significantly decreased in the VD group compared to the control group (p < .05). These alterations were reversed by treadmill exercise, and the rats exhibited healthier synaptic ultrastructure, including significantly increased synapse (p < .05). Meanwhile, golgi staining revealed that the spine numbers of the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the VD group compared to the control group (p < .05). When compared with the VD group, hippocampal spine numbers were significantly increased in the Exe-VD group (p < .05). Conclusion: The improvement of VD-associated recognition memory by treadmill exercises is associated with enhanced structural synaptic plasticity in VD rat model.

AB  - Microcystins (MCs), a group of most widespread freshwater cyanotoxins that possess strong neurotoxicity, can adversely affect brain structures and functions and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the essential role of lipids in brain structures and functions, the brain lipidome profile of mammals exposed to MCs remains unexplored, hindering a clear understanding of the neurotoxic effects of MCs and underlying mechanisms. In this study, we performed untargeted lipidomic profiling using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice orally exposed to 30 and 300 & mu;g/kg body mass/day of microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) for 180 days to evaluate the impacts of MC-LR on the brain lipidome profile and functions. Our results show that MC-LR resulted in a decline in cognitive parameters, as assessed by the Morris water maze test. Interestingly, apparent neurodegenerative changes were observed in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses uncovered profound, region-specific changes in the phospholipid and sphingolipid profile at the levels of lipid subclasses, lipid species, and fatty acyl composition. These changes showed overall decrease trends of lipid content in the prefrontal cortex yet increasing trends in the hippocampus. We identified distinct transcriptional regulations of lipid metabolism and apoptosis by MC-LR in the two regions, which appeared to underlie the neurodegenerative changes. Collectively, this study uncovers region-specific changes in the brain lipidome profile and functions induced by MCs, shedding light on the role of lipid dysfunction in neurotoxicity mechanism of MCs.

AB  - A growing number of studies have demonstrated associations between poverty and brain structure and function. However, the strength of this association and the effects of poverty level (e.g., family or neighborhood poverty), age and sex on the association are strikingly inconsistent across studies. We aimed to synthesize findings on gray matter volume and task-based brain activation associated with poverty in youth samples and disentangle the effects of poverty level, age, and sex. In general, poverty was associated with alterations in volume and activation in the frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions. Among 14,188 participants and 14,057 participants, poverty was associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. Moderator testing revealed that family poverty had a stronger association than neighborhood poverty and that poverty was related to slower development of amygdala volume. Among 2696 participants, convergent functional alterations associated with poverty were observed in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and left middle frontal gyrus across all task domains, with the percentage of girls positively associated with increased activation in the precuneus. Subgroup analyses revealed that greater poverty was associated with deactivation in the left MTG for top-down control and hyperactivity in the right superior temporal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left insula, cerebellum/left fusiform gyrus, and left amygdala/hippocampus for bottom-up processing. These findings provide insights into the neuroscience of poverty, suggesting implications for targeted interventions to support the cognitive and mental health of children living in poverty.

AB  - Theacrine and epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl) gallate (EGCG3"Me) are notable secondary metabolites in tea (Camellia sinensis), celebrated for their unique flavors and significant health effects. Theacrine has a mild effect on nerve stimulation, while EGCG3"Me exhibits better stability, higher oral bioavailability and stronger biological activity. However, tea plant varieties naturally rich in both theacrine and EGCG3"Me are rare. This study unveils a unique tea variety 'Anxi kucha', which is abundant in both theacrine and EGCG3"Me. Through integrated transcriptome-proteome-metabolome analysis, SAMS3, APRT1, IMPDH, and TCS1 were identified as critical enzymes for theacrine synthesis; while CHI1, CHI2, FLS2 and LAR1 were key for EGCG3"Me synthesis. Additionally, transcription factor analysis revealed that MYB4 and bHLH74 were positively correlated with the contents of theacrine and EGCG3"Me. This study provides valuable materials for further exploring theacrine and EGCG3"Me in tea plants, and establishes a theoretical basis for their biosynthesis.

AB  - Background and aims: Neuroinflammation, a low-grade chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, is linked to age-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as senile depression and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have explored controlling neuroinflammation as a novel treatment strategy. Molecular hydrogen shows anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impacts on neuroinflammation and age-related neuropsychiatric disorders remain unelucidated. We investigated molecular hydrogen's effects on microglial activation, neuroinflammation, depressive-like behavior, and short-term cognitive decline in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Methods: Six-week-old SAMP8 or senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice received hydrogenrich jelly (HRJ) or placebo jelly (PJ) from six weeks of age for 26-28 weeks. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using tail suspension and forced swimming tests, while cognitive function was evaluated using the Ymaze and object recognition tests. Brain tissues were used for immunohistochemical studies or to measure proinflammatory cytokine levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: HRJ intake reduced immobility time in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests and enhanced visual cognitive and spatial working memory in SAMP8 mice. Additionally, HRJ intake suppressed the 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Iba1, and cleaved caspase 3 expression levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, HRJ intake significantly lowered IL-6 levels in brain tissues of SAMP8 mice. Conclusions: These findings suggest that molecular hydrogen treatment may regulate neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia and improve depressive-like behavior and short-term cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) increases the risk of depression later in life. Programmed cell death factor 4 (PDCD4), an apoptosis-related molecule, extensively participates in tumorigenesis and inflammatory diseases. However, its involvement in a person's susceptibility to ELS-related depression is unknown. To examine the effects and underlying mechanisms of PDCD4 on ELS vulnerability, we used a "two-hit" stress mouse model: an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into neonatal mice was performed on postnatal days 7-9 (P7-P9) and inescapable foot shock (IFS) administration in adolescent was used as a later-life challenge. Our study shows that compared with mice that were only exposed to the LPS or IFS, the "two-hit" stress mice developed more severe depression/anxiety-like behaviors and social disability. We detected the levels of PDCD4 in the hippocampus of adolescent mice and found that they were significantly increased in "two-hit" stress mice. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Sholl analysis showed that the number of microglia in the hippocampus of "two-hit" stress mice significantly increased, with morphological changes, shortened branches, and decreased numbers. However, knocking down PDCD4 can prevent the number and morphological changes of microglia induced by ELS. In addition, we confirmed through the Golgi staining and immunohistochemical staining results that knocking down PDCD4 can ameliorate ELS-induced synaptic plasticity damage. Mechanically, the knockdown of PDCD4 exerts neuroprotective effects, possibly via the mediation of BDNF/AKT/CREB signaling. Combined, these results suggest that PDCD4 may play an important role in the ELS-induced susceptibility to depression and, thus, may become a therapeutic target for depressive disorders.

AB  - Pyridaben (PY) is a widely used organochlorine acaricide, which can be detected in the peripheral blood of pregnant women. Available evidence suggests that PY has reproductive toxicity. However, it remains uncertain whether prenatal PY exposure impacts neurobehavioral development in offspring. Here, we administered PY to pregnant mice at a dose of 0.5 and 5 mg kg -1 day -1 via gavage and observed anxiety -like behaviors in PY offspring aged five weeks. We then integrated the metabolome and transcriptome of the offspring's brain to explore the underlying mechanism. Metabolome data indicated that the vitamin B6 metabolism pathway was significantly affected, and the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentration and the active form of vitamin B6 was significantly reduced. Moreover, the transcriptome data showed that both PLP generation-related Pdxk and anxiety-related Gad1 were significantly down-regulated. Meanwhile, there was a decreasing trend in the concentration of GABA in the hippocampal DG region. Next, we supplemented PLP at a dose of 20 mg kg -1 day -1 to the PY offspring via intraperitoneal in-jection at three weeks. We found up-regulated expression of Pdxk and Gad1 and restored anxiety-like behaviors. This study suggests that prenatal exposure to PY can disrupt vitamin B6 metabolism, reduce the concentration of PLP, down-regulate the expression levels of Pdxk and Gad1, inhibit the production of GABA, and ultimately lead to anxiety-like behaviors in offspring.

AB  - Hematological reference samples for external quality assessment (EQA) in hematology are essential for many laboratories in Vietnam, however, the prices are high along with short storing time. This study attempted to establish an optimal formula for the manufacture of hematological reference samples for hematological EQA programs. Human red blood cells (RBCs) were mixed with goose RBCs (pseudo-leucocytes) and goat RBCs (pseudo-platelets) as alternatives for white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets (PLTs), respectively, in different formulas of storage media. The optimal formula was obtained using response surface methodology-central composite design (RSM-CCD). Three main factors affecting the concentrations of RBCs were determined by Plackett-Burmann matrix. The optimal concentrations determined by RSM-CCD were 46% serum, 0.44 g/L neomycin sulfate, and 2.5% glycerol. The model predicted that the maximum number of human RBCs was 4.1 x 10(12) cells/L, pseudo-leucocytes was 6.4 x 10(9) cells/L, and pseudo-platelets was 188 x 10(9) cells/L. The practical concentrations of RBCs, pseudo-leucocytes, and pseudo-platelets were 4.21 x 10(12) cells/L, 6.4 x 10(9) cells/L, and 187 x 10(9) cells/L, respectively, which showed 98.93% similarity with theoretical data. This result could be a premise for further study to improve manufacturing of hematological reference samples for hematology EQA programs.

AB  - ObjectivesVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to be effective for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, long-term (>5 years) studies on the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment have been lacking. Here, we report a long-term clinical follow-up of 5 patients with severe and long-standing TRD, who received a VNS implant.MethodsOf the initial 6 patients with TRD implanted with VNS at our center, 5 of them were followed for 6 to 12 years after implantation. Primary efficacy outcomes were clinical response and improved functioning at follow-up visits. The primary safety outcome was all-cause discontinuation, and the secondary safety outcomes were the number and the severity of adverse events.ResultsThe VNS implant was associated with a sustained response (>10 years) in terms of clinical response and social, occupational, and psychological functioning in 3 patients. Two patients dropped out after 6 and 7 years of treatment, respectively. Vagus nerve stimulation was well tolerated by all patients, who reported only mild adverse effects. One patient, who discontinued concomitant drug treatment, had a hypomanic episode in the 10th year of treatment. The parameters of the VNS device were fine-tuned when life stressors or symptom exacerbation occurred.ConclusionsOur case series showed that VNS can have long-term and durable effectiveness in patients with severe multiepisode chronic depression, and this could be associated with its neuroplastic effects in the hippocampus. In light of good general tolerability, our findings support VNS as a viable treatment option for TRD.

AB  - Bone grafting is essential for the regeneration of bone defects where natural healing is inadequate. Octacalcium phosphate (OCP)/calcium citrate (CC)/pig gelatin (pig Gel) composites promote hydroxyapatite (HAp) formation in simulated body fluid (SBF); however, the rapid degradation of pig Gel leads to their degradation in SBF within 7 d. To address this, we developed a 35% OCP/35% CC/30% methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) composite by leveraging the tuneable photo-crosslinking ability of GelMA to enhance the initial structural stability in SBF. However, the optimal synthetic photo-crosslinking conditions and the apatite-forming abilities of the OCP/CC/GelMA composite require investigation. In this study, we employed photo-crosslinking to synthesize homogeneous OCP/CC/GelMA composites with initial structural stability in SBF and evaluated their HAp-forming ability in SBF as an indicator of osteogenic potential, in comparison with the OCP/CC/pig Gel composites. Both GelMA- and pig Gel-based composites were prepared and immersed in SBF for 7 d to assess HAp formation. Although the OCP/CC/GelMA composite showed reduced HAp nucleation compared to the OCP/CC/pig Gel composites, it exhibited enhanced initial structural stability in SBF while retaining its HAp-forming ability. These findings highlight the OCP/CC/GelMA composite as a stable and promising scaffold for bone regeneration, laying the groundwork for further research.

AB  - Plants rely on the perception of a multitude of herbivory-associated cues (HACs) to activate their defense response to insect herbivores. These stimuli are mainly derived from three functional components, namely, mechanical damage, insect-associated microbe, and insect's chemical cues. While simulated herbivory integrating these stimuli is widely exploited for complementing actual herbivory in clarifying the details of plant-herbivore interaction, breaking down these stimuli and identifying the mechanisms of plant responses associated with them have been less explored. In this study, the components of potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella, PTM) herbivory were reorganized in a cumulative way and their impacts on the early defense responses of potato leaf were characterized. We found that simulated and actual herbivory of PTM triggered similar patterns of phytohormonal and transcriptomic responses in potato leaf. Moreover, the microbe in the PTM herbivory stimuli is associated with the regulation of the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) since reducing the microbe in HAC could reduce JA while increasing ABA. In addition, seven robust gene modules were identified to illustrate how potato plants respond to different PTM herbivory stimuli when herbivory components increased. Significantly, we found that mechanical damage mainly activated JA-mediated signaling; PTM-derived HACs contributed much more to potato early-defense response and induced signaling molecules such as multiple protein kinases; orally secreted bacteria stimuli could antagonize PTM-derived HACs and modulate plant defense, including repressing phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Our study broadened the understanding of how potato plants integrate the responses to a multitude of stimuli upon PTM herbivory and evidenced that insect-associated microbes greatly modulated the plants response to insect herbivory.

AB  - N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) administered at subtoxic dose plays a protective role against neuronal excitotoxicity, a mechanism described as preconditioning. Since the activation of adenosinergic receptors influences the achievement of NMDA preconditioning in the hippocampus, we evaluated the potential functional interplay between adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors (A(1)R and A(2A)R) activities and NMDA preconditioning. Adult male Swiss mice received saline (NaCl 0.9 g%, i.p.) or a nonconvulsant dose of NMDA (75 mg/kg, i.p.) and 24 h later they were treated with the one of the ligands: A(1)R agonist (CCPA, 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or antagonist (DPCPX, 3 mg/kg, i. p.), A(2A)R agonist (CGS21680, 0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) or antagonist (ZM241385, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to contextual fear conditioning task. Binding properties and content of A(2A)R and glutamate uptake were assessed in the hippocampus of mice subjected to NMDA preconditioning. Treatment with CGS21680 increased the time of freezing during the exposure of animals to the new environment. NMDA preconditioning did not affect the freezing time of mice per se, but it prevented the response observed after the activation of A(2A)R. Furthermore, the activation of A(2A)R by CGS21680 after the preconditioning blocked the increase of glutamate uptake induced by NMDA preconditioning. The immunodetection of A(2A)R in total hippocampal homogenates showed no significant differences evoked by NMDA preconditioning and did not alter A(2A)R maximum binding for the selective ligand [H-3]CGS21680. These results demonstrate changes in A(2A)R functionality in mice following NMDA preconditioning.

AB  - Background: Although Amyloid beta (A beta) and N - methyl D- aspartate receptors (NMDARs are involved in Ca2+ neurotoxicity, the function of mitochondrial calcium uniporter in cognition deficit remain uncertain. Here, we examined the effect of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) blocker, together with NMDA receptor agonist Dcycloserine (DCS) on memory impairment in a rat model of AD.
   Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic cannulation for inducing AD by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of A beta(1-42) (5 mu g /8 mu l/rat). Then animals were divided into 5 groups of: Saline + Saline, A beta + Saline, A beta + RU360, A beta + DCS, A beta + RU360 + DCS. Two weeks after the treatments, Morris Water Maze (MWM) and step through passive avoidance learning (SPL) were undertaken for evaluating of spatial and associative memories, respectively. Hippocampal level of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by western blot and ELISA.
   Results: Co - administration of RU360 and DCS significantly improved both acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory as evident by decreased escape latency and increased time spent in the target quadrant (TTS) in MWM, together with increase in step-through latency, but reduced time spent in the dark compartment in SPL. Furthermore, there was a significant rise in the hippocampal level of CREB and BDNF in comparison with A beta + Saline.
   Conclusion: The present study supports the idea that co- administration of RU360 and DCS ameliorate memory impairment induced by A beta (1-42) probably via CREB / BDNF signaling.

AB  - Ant defense against floral enemies incurs a two-fold ant-pollinator conflict, both via pollinator deterrence and nectar or pollen collection by non-pollinating protective ants. Some ant-plants have physical barriers whereas others produce ant-repellent chemicals to avoid ant visitation to flowers and subsequent pollination interference. Passiflora coccinea is a hummingbird-pollinated myrmecophilous plant in which floral enemy repellence occurs without limiting ant access to open flowers. To test the hypothesis that ant activity is restricted within flowers to prevent contact with anthers, we compared ant defense response between reproductive (anthers and stigmas) and non-reproductive (bracts, corona and perianth) floral structures by combining an observational survey with an experimental approach. A few insect species were found to visit flowers without providing pollination service, mostly pollen- collecting bees and nectar-thieving butterflies landing on petals. Ants always attacked floral visitors that landed on non-reproductive structures, but they never attacked insects visiting reproductive structures as ants never accessed anthers. Our results suggest that the differential ant defense response is an adaptative process to prevent ant-pollinator conflict. The eventual mechanism that regulates this process could be closely linked to the corona of filaments that protects nectar chambers, simultaneously restricting ant access to nectar and pollen.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles prime neighbouring plants to respond more strongly to subsequent attacks. However, the key volatiles that trigger this state and their priming mechanisms remain largely unknown. The tea geometrid Ectropis obliqua is one of the most devastating leaf-feeding pests of tea plants. Here, plant-plant communication experiments demonstrated that volatiles emitted from tea plants infested by E. obliqua larvae triggered neighbouring plants to release volatiles that repel E. obliqua adult, especially mated females. Volatile analyses revealed that the quantity of eight volatiles increased dramatically when plants were exposed to volatiles emitted by infested tea plants, including (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene, beta-Ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). The results of behavioural bioassays demonstrated that beta-Ocimene strongly repelled mated E. obliqua females. Individual volatile compound exposure experiments revealed that (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and DMNT triggered the emission of beta-Ocimene from tea plants. Chemical inhibition experiments demonstrated that the emission of beta-Ocimene induced by (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and DMNT were dependent on Ca2+ and JA signalling. These findings help us to understand how E. obliqua moths respond to volatiles emitted from tea plants and provide new insight into volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions. They have potential significance for the development of novel insect and pest control strategies in crops.

AB  - Many Chinese rivers are polluted with multiple pollutants. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the annual inputs of nutrients, macro-and microplastics, and Cryptosporidium (a pathogen) to 395 Chinese rivers from agriculture and urbanization-related sources during 2010-2050 following the storyline of Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3 and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Our model estimates that multiple pollutants in Chinese rivers are projected to increase by 41-88 % between 2010 and 2050. Central, eastern, and southern Chinese sub-basins may be more polluted in the future. In half of the sub-basins, at least two types of pollutants are expected to increase by over 50 % during 2010-2050. By 2050, nutrients and plastics in rivers are projected to increase by 70 % due to urbanization. For nutrients and Cryptosporidium in rivers increases of 49-88 % are projected, due to agricultural activities. In contrast, water is expected to get cleaner in some western sub-basins by 2050 because of fewer human activities. Our insights about multiple pollutants in Chinese rivers could help prioritize water pollution reduction strategies for sub-basins.

AB  - Plants express many types of defenses in response to herbivory damage. These defenses can be displayed as a sequence or they can overlap, increasing efficiency in protection. However, leaf defense shifts during leaf development, including extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), are neglected in natural tropical systems. To address this gap, our study evaluates the shifts in defense strategies of Eriotheca gracilipes, focusing on extrafloral nectaries and leaf toughness across leaf development stages. We also simulate herbivory by cutting the leaves to address the role of visiting ants against herbivores. We observed that E. gracilipes exhibits a defense turnover, shifting from indirect defenses (e.g., EFNs) in young leaves to physical defenses in adult leaves. Simulated herbivory led to heightened ant visitation, which correlated with decreased herbivory rates, indicating that ant recruitment acts as an effective deterrent. We observed a peak of EFN activity in young leaves, increased foliar toughness in adult leaves, and reduced herbivory on ant-patrolled young leaves. Additionally, E. gracilipes demonstrated tolerance to up to 10% foliar loss with no significant impact on leaf asymmetry, although 50% foliar loss increased asymmetry in newly flushed leaves. These results highlight E. gracilipes' adaptive flexibility by attracting protective ants when vulnerable and enhancing structural defenses as leaves develops, E. gracilipes minimizes herbivory impact. This study provides valuable insight into the adaptive roles of EFNs and tolerance in E. gracilipes, contributing to a broader understanding of plant defense strategies.

AB  - The Aphis gossypii is a major threat of cotton worldwide due to its short life cycle and rapid reproduction. Chemical control is the primary method used to manage the cotton aphid, which has significant environmental impacts. Therefore, prioritizing eco-friendly alternatives is essential for managing the cotton aphid. The ladybird, Hippodamia variegata, is a predominant predator of the cotton aphid. Its performance in cotton plantation is directly linked to chemical communication, where volatile compounds emitted from aphid-infested plants play important roles in successful predation. Here, we comprehensively studied the chemical interaction between the pest, natural enemy and host plants by analyzing the volatile profiles of aphid-infested cotton plants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We then utilized the identified volatile compounds in electrophysiological recording (EAG) and behavioral assays. Through behavioral tests, we initially demonstrated the clear preference of both larvae and adults of H. variegata for aphid-infested plants. Subsequently, 13 compounds, namely alpha-pinene, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, 4-ethyl-1-octyn-3-ol, beta-ocimene, dodecane, E-beta-farnesene, decanal, methyl salicylate, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, farnesol, DMNT, and TMTT were identified from aphid-infested plants. All these compounds were electrophysiologically active and induced detectable EAG responses in larvae and adults. Y-tube olfactometer assays indicated that, with few exceptions for larvae, all identified chemicals were attractive to H. variegata, particularly at the highest tested concentration (100 mg/ml). The outcomes of this study establish a practical foundation for developing attractants for H. variegata and open avenues for potential advancements in aphid management strategies by understanding the details of chemical communication at a tritrophic level.

AB  - There are numerous evidence supporting the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the occurrence of cognitive deficits in humans. In this regard, treatment of H. pylori infection has been suggested as an effective strategy to decelerate the neurodegenerative processes of memory deficits in AD patients. Numerous studies support the beneficial effects of probiotics on various pathological conditions, particularly cognitive deficits, however, this concern has not been addressed in relation to the memory impairment induced by H. pylori infection. In the present study, we aimed to reveal whether oral administration of two bacterial probiotics (including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus plantarum), could ameliorate H. pylori-induced memory deficits at behavioral level in rats. Besides, cellular mechanisms were investigated by biochemical methods to find out how probiotic effects are mediated in hippocampal circuitry. Male Wistar rats were infected by H. pylori for 3 consecutive days, then probiotic treatment was done for the next 3 days and after a drug-free period (12 days), animals were assessed by Morris Water Maze and Novel Object Recognition tests. Finally, rats were euthanized by CO2 and hippocampal tissues were excised for biochemical measurements. Results indicated that H. pylori infection markedly impairs memory function in rats which is associated with alterations of oxidative, inflammatory, neurotrophic, and cholinergic markers. Interestingly, treatment with either of the probiotics alone or in combination, significantly improved the H. pylori-induced memory deficits and this was associated with restoration of balance in biochemical factors within the hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Persicaria minor (P. minor) is a herbal plant with many uses in food, perfume, and the medical industry. P. minor extract contains flavonoids with antioxidant and anticholinesterase capacity, which could enhance cognitive functions. P. minor extract has been proven to enhance memory. However, its role in an animal model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), which resembles human vascular dementia, has yet to be explored. Therefore, the present study investigates the effects of chronic (14 days) administration of aqueous P. minor extract on different stages of learning and memory processes and the metabolic pathways involved in the chronic cerebral hypoperfused rats induced by the permanent bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries (PBOCCA) surgery. Chronic treatment of P. minor extract at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg, enhanced recognition memory of the PBOCCA rats. P. minor extract (200 mg/kg) was also found to restore the spatial memory impairment induced by CCH. A high dose (300 mg/kg) of the P. minor extract significantly increased the expression of both ACh and GABA neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. Further, distinctive metabolite profiles were observed in rats with different treatments. Three major pathways involved in the cognitive enhancement mechanism of P. minor were identified. The present findings demonstrated an improving effect of P. minor extract on memory in the CCH rat model, suggesting that P. minor extract could be a potential treatment for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's patients. P. minor is believed to improve cognitive deficits by regulating pathways involved in retinol, histidine, pentose, glucuronate, and CoA metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUNDJasmonic acid (JA) is an important phytohormone used to defend against herbivores, but it does not respond to whitefly feeding. Conversely, another phytohormone, salicylic acid (SA), is induced when plants are fed upon by whiteflies. JA has a better anti-whitefly effect than SA; however, there is limited research on how to effectively improve plant resistance by utilizing the different responses of these phytohormones to whitefly feeding.RESULTSWe discovered that protease inhibitors 8 (PI8) and terpene synthase 10 (TPS10) located downstream of the JA-regulated pathway in plants have anti-whitefly effects, but these two genes were not induced by whitefly feeding. To identify whitefly-inducible promoters, we compared the transcriptome data of tobacco fed upon by Bemisia tabaci with the control. We focused on pathogenesis-related (PR) genes because they are known to be induced by SA. Among these PR genes, we found that expression levels of pathogenes-related protein 1C-like (PR1) and glucose endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase (BGL) can be significantly induced by whitefly feeding and regulated by SA. We then engineered the whitefly-inducible promoters of BGL and PR1 to drive the expression of PI8 and TPS10. We found that compared with control plants that did not induce the expression of PI8 or TPS10, transformed plants expressing PI8 or TPS10 under the PR1 or BGL promoter showed a significant increase in the expression levels of PI8 and TPS10 after whitefly infection, significantly improving their resistance to whiteflies.CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that using SA-inducible promoters as tools to drive the expression of JA-regulated defense genes can enhance plant resistance to whiteflies. Our study provides a novel pathway for the enhancement of plant resistance against insects. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.
   Based on the phenomenon that whitefly feeding induces salicylic acid (SA) but not jasmonic acid (JA), we use the inducible promoters downstream of SA to drive the resistance genes regulated by JA, thereby improving plant insect resistance. image

AB  - NLRP3-inflammasome-mediated signaling is thought to significantly contribute to the extent of myocardial damage after myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor IZD334 on cardiac damage in a pig model of myocardial infarction. Prior to in vivo testing, in vitro, porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and whole blood were treated with increasing dosages of IZD334, a novel NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor, and were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). After determination of the pharmacological profile in healthy pigs, thirty female Landrace pigs were subjected to 75 min of transluminal balloon occlusion of the LAD coronary artery and treated with placebo or IZD334 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg once daily) in a blinded randomized fashion. In vitro, NLRP3-inflammasome stimulation showed the pronounced release of interleukin (IL)-1 beta that was attenuated by IZD334 (p < 0.001). In vivo, no differences were observed between groups in serological markers of inflammation nor myocardial IL-1 beta expression. After 7 days, the ejection fraction did not differ between groups, as assessed with MRI (placebo: 45.1 +/- 8.7%, 1 mg/kg: 49.9 +/- 6.1%, 3 mg/kg: 42.7 +/- 3.8%, 10 mg/kg: 44.9 +/- 6.4%, p = 0.26). Infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was not reduced (placebo: 73.1 +/- 3.0%, 1 mg/kg: 75.5 +/- 7.3%, 3 mg/kg: 80.3 +/- 3.9%, 10 mg/kg: 78.2 +/- 8.0%, p = 0.21). In this pig MI model, we did not observe attenuation of the inflammatory response after NLRP3-inflammasome inhibition in vivo. Consecutively, no difference was observed in IS and cardiac function, while in vitro inhibition successfully reduced IL-1 beta release from stimulated porcine blood cells.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (Ca. oleifera) is a woody tree species cultivated for the production of edible oil from its seed. The growth and yield of tea-oil trees are severely affected by anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides). In this study, the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were performed to detect the key transcripts and metabolites associated with differences in the susceptibility between anthracnose-resistant (ChangLin150) and susceptible (ChangLin102) varieties of Ca. oleifera. In total, 5001 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, of which 479 DEGs were common between the susceptible and resistant varieties and further analyzed. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in tyrosine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, 68 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were detected, including flavonoids, such as epicatechin, phenethyl caffeate and procyanidin B2. Comparison of the DEGs and DAMs revealed that epicatechin, procyanidin B2 and arachidonic acid (peroxide free) are potentially important. The expression patterns of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were confirmed by qRT-PCR. These results suggested that flavonoid biosynthesis might play an important role in the fight against anthracnose. This study provides valuable molecular information about the response of Ca. oleifera to Co. gloeosporioides infection and will aid the selection of resistant varieties using marker-assisted breeding.

AB  - Key messageDamage to leaf veins does not necessarily result in the dieback of leaf galls.
   Oaks serve as host plants for numerous insects, including those forming galls. Galls induced on oaks are completely dependent on leaf resources. Many other folivores damage veins of leaves, which may result in cutting galls off from sources of assimilates, nutrients and water. We hypothesised that the disruption of the continuity of leaf vascular tissues stops gall development, leading to the death of the larva. Leaves of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) with Cynips quercusfolii galls in the initial stage of development were marked. The diameter of the galls was measured, and the vein on which the gall was present was cut. Four experimental treatments were established: control - with no cutting, cutting the vein distal to the gall relative to the petiole, cutting the vein basal to the gall and cutting both sides. The average survival rate (live galls at the end of the experiment including healthy larvae, pupae or imagines inside) - was 28.9%. The rate varied depending on the treatment and was 13.6% in the treatment with the vein cut on both sides and about 30% in the remaining treatments. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The growth dynamics of galls are highly dependent on the experimental treatment. The largest galls grew in the control treatment, and the smallest galls were in the treatments with the veins cut on both sides. Unexpectedly, even cutting veins on both sides did not result in the immediate dieback of the galls. The results suggest that the galls are very strong nutrient and water sinks. The functions of the cut vein are likely taken over by other lower-order veins, allowing nourishment of the gall to complete larva development.

AB  - Quantifying the relations between plant-antagonistic interactions and natural selection among populations is important for predicting how spatial variation in ecological interactions drive adaptive differentiation. Here, we investigate the relations between the opportunity for selection, herbivore-mediated selection, and the intensity of plant-herbivore interaction among 11 populations of the insect-pollinated plant Primula florindae over 2 years. We experimentally quantified herbivore-mediated directional selection on three floral traits (two display and one phenological) within populations and found evidence for herbivore-mediated selection for a later flowering start date and a greater number of flowers per plant. The opportunity for selection and strength of herbivore-mediated selection on number of flowers varied nonlinearly with the intensity of herbivory among populations. These parameters increased and then decreased with increasing intensity of plant-herbivore interactions, defined as an increase in the ratio of herbivore-damaged flowers per individual. Our results provide novel insights into how plant-antagonistic interactions can shape spatial variation in selection on floral traits and contribute toward understanding the mechanistic basis of geographic variation in angiosperm flowers.

AB  - Regulating the lipid nutritional profile of meat by balancing intramuscular fat and backfat is a difficult problem in pork production. In this study, we found that feed supplementation with mulberry leaves increased intramuscular fat while simultaneously reducing backfat. The results of our study suggest that nutritional supplementation with mulberry leaves may be used in pork production to improve the lipid nutrition of meat. Mulberry leaves, a common traditional Chinese medicine, represent a potential nutritional strategy to improve the fat profile, also known as the lipo-nutrition, of pork. However, the effects of mulberry leaves on pork lipo-nutrition and the microorganisms and metabolites in the porcine gut remain unclear. In this study, multi-omics analysis was employed in a Yuxi black pig animal model to explore the possible regulatory mechanism of mulberry leaves on pork quality. Sixty Yuxi black pigs were divided into two groups: the control group (n = 15) was fed a standard diet, and the experimental group (n = 45) was fed a diet supplemented with 8% mulberry leaves. Experiments were performed in three replicates (n = 15 per replicate); the two diets were ensured to be nutritionally balanced, and the feeding period was 120 days. The results showed that pigs receiving the diet supplemented with mulberry leaves had significantly reduced backfat thickness (p < 0.05) and increased intramuscular fat (IMF) content (p < 0.05) compared with pigs receiving the standard diet. Lipidomics analysis showed that mulberry leaves improved the lipid profile composition and increased the proportion of triglycerides (TGs). Interestingly, the IMF content was positively correlated with acyl C18:2 and negatively correlated with C18:1 of differential TGs. In addition, the cecal microbiological analysis showed that mulberry leaves could increase the abundance of bacteria such as UCG-005, Muribaculaceae_norank, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, and Limosilactobacillus. Simultaneously, the relative levels of L-tyrosine-ethyl ester, oleic acid methyl ester, 21-deoxycortisol, N-acetyldihydrosphingosine, and mulberrin were increased. Furthermore, we found that mulberry leaf supplementation significantly increased the mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid-binding protein 4, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma in muscle (p < 0.01). Mulberry leaf supplementation significantly increased the mRNA expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (p < 0.05) while significantly decreasing the expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase in backfat (p < 0.05). Furthermore, mulberry leaf supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (p < 0.05) in backfat. In addition, mulberry leaf supplementation led to increased serum leptin and adiponectin (p < 0.01). Collectively, this omic profile is consistent with an increased ratio of IMF to backfat in the pig model.

AB  - Background: The hippocampus is susceptible to damage, leading to negative impacts on cognition. Conditioned medium (CM) obtained from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) have shown neuroprotective effects independently. This study explored the synergistic potential of ASA and CM from adipose-derived MSCs against hippocampal injury. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats received bilateral hippocampal ethidium bromide (EB) injections to induce hippocampal damage. Rats were treated with ASA and/or CM derived from adipose tissue MSCs every 48 h for 16 days. Behavioral tests (open field test, Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance), oxidative stress, Western blot analysis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) expression, and hippocampal histological investigation were conducted. Results: Administration of EB caused impairments in spatial, recognition, and passive avoidance memory, as well as heightened oxidative stress, reduced BDNF/CDNF expression, and pyramidal cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 region. Administration of ASA, CM, or a combination of both mitigated these hippocampal damages and cognitive deficits, elevated BDNF and CDNF levels, and alleviated the CA1 necrosis caused by EB. Moreover, co-administering ASA and CM resulted in greater improvements in spatial memory compared to administering ASA alone, suggesting possible synergistic interactions. Conclusions: The ability of ASA, CM obtained from adipose tissue-derived MSCs, and their combination therapy to alleviate hippocampal injuries highlights their promising therapeutic potential as a neuroprotection strategy against brain damage. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential synergistic effects of ASA and CM, which warrants further investigations.

AB  - Zinc finger protein 367 (ZNF367) has been documented as a new cancer-related protein that exerts a pivotal role in the carcinogenesis of multiple cancers. However, whether ZNF367 plays a role in colorectal cancer has not been fully understood. Our data showed that ZNF367 expression was higher in colorectal cancer. Depletion of ZNF367 weakened the proliferative and invasive capabilities of colorectal cancer cells. Up-regulation of ZNF367 enhanced the in vitro malignant features of colorectal cancer cells. Knockdown of ZNF367 impeded the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP1). Reactivation of YAP1 reversed the ZNF367-knockdown-mediated anticancer effects. Suppression of YAP1 significantly abolished ZNF367-overexpression-induced tumor-promotion effects. Depletion of ZNF367 repressed the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells in vivo. These findings demonstrate that ZNF367 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and acts as a potential tumor-promoter that contributes to the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer by enhancing the activation of YAP1 signaling.

AB  - Most flowering plants must defend themselves against herbivores for survival and attract pollinators for reproduction. Although traits involved in plant defence and pollinator attraction are often localised in leaves and flowers, respectively, they will show a diffuse evolution if they share the same molecular machinery and regulatory networks. We performed RNA-sequencing to characterise and compare transcriptomic changes involved in herbivory-induced defences and flower development, in tomato leaves and flowers, respectively. We found that both the herbivory-induced responses and flower development involved alterations in jasmonic acid signalling, suppression of primary metabolism and reprogramming of secondary metabolism. We identified 411 genes that were involved in both processes, a number significantly higher than expected by chance. Genetic manipulation of key regulators of induced defences also led to the expression changes in the same genes in both leaves and flowers. Targeted metabolomic analysis showed that among closely related tomato species, jasmonic acid and alpha-tomatine are correlated in flower buds and herbivory-induced leaves. These findings suggest that herbivory-induced responses and flower development share a common molecular machinery and likely have coevolved in nature.

AB  - Conventional microdiscectomy treatment for intervertebral disc herniation alleviates pain but does not repair the annulus fibrosus, resulting in a high incidence of recurrent herniation and persistent dysfunction. The lack of repair and the acute inflammation that arise after injury can further compromise the disc and result in disc-wide degeneration in the long term. To address this clinical need, we developed tension-activated repair patches (TARPs) for annulus fibrosus repair and local delivery of the anti-inflammatory factor anakinra (a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist). TARPs transmit physiologic strain to mechanically activated microcapsules embedded within the patch, which release encapsulated bioactive molecules in direct response to spinal loading. Mechanically activated microcapsules carrying anakinra were loaded into TARPs, and the effects of TARP-mediated annular repair and anakinra delivery were evaluated in a goat model of annular injury in the cervical spine. TARPs integrated with native tissue and provided structural reinforcement at the injury site that prevented aberrant disc-wide remodeling resulting from detensioning of the annular fibrosus. The delivery of anakinra by TARP implantation increased matrix deposition and retention at the injury site and improved maintenance of disc extracellular matrix. Anakinra delivery additionally attenuated the inflammatory response associated with TARP implantation, decreasing osteolysis in adjacent vertebrae and preserving disc cellularity and matrix organization throughout the annulus fibrosus. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of TARPs for the treatment of intervertebral disc herniation.

AB  - The development of hard carbon materials with high plateau capacity as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is crucial to improving the energy density of SIBs, while the closed pores are closely related to the low-voltage (<0.1 V) plateau capacity of hard carbon anodes. Herein, through a simple ZnO template method and acid treatment, a wealth of closed pores were created in the hard carbon material derived from camellia shells. Experimental results reveal the mechanism of sodium ions adsorption at the defect sites and the formation of sodium clusters in the closed pores, which corresponds to the slope region and the plateau region, respectively. Notably, being beneficial to the considerable closed pore content and suitable microstructure, the optimized sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 340 mA h g(-1), which is mainly contributed by the low-voltage plateau process (51%). This work provides a new strategy for precisely regulating the microstructure of biomass-derived hard carbon for sodium-ion storage.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an economically important woody oil plant. Complex ploidy and lack of genomic information have seriously hindered the molecular breeding of C. oleifera. Here, we present an 11.43-Gb haplotyperesolved, chromosome-level genome assembly of tetraploid C. oleifera ( COL-tetra). Methods employed in this study support the conclusion that COL-tetra is an autotetraploid and probably originates from genome doubling of the diploid C. brevistyla. In addition, DNA methylation plays a significant role in imbalanced allelic expression and seed development. Genetic divergence analyses reveal significant differentiation signals for flowering time between spring-flowering and autumn-flowering oil Camellia species, which probably account for reproductive isolation between species with distinct flowering times. Strong introgression signals are detected between COL-tetra and C. sasanqua and between C. vietnamensis and COL-hexa, which might affect the development of agronomic traits and environmental adaptability. This study provides valuable insights into the evolution, agronomic trait development, and genetic architecture of oil Camellia plants.

AB  - Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in leaves have attracted attention as nutritious phytochemicals and olfactory signals that influence the behavior and growth of herbivorous insects. In recognition of the negative effects of increasing tropospheric ozone ( O-3) levels on plants, LCFAs can be altered through peroxidation by O-3. However, how elevated O-3 changes the amount and composition of LCFAs in field-grown plants is still unknown. We investigated palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic LCFAs in the two leaf types (spring and summer) and two stages ( early and late stage after expansion) of Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica) after a multi-year O-3 exposure on the field. Summer leaves exhibited a distinct composition of LCFAs under elevated O-3 at the early stage, whereas both stages of spring leaves did not exhibit significant changes in LCFAs composition by elevated O-3. In the spring leaves, the amounts of saturated LCFAs significantly increased at the early stage, however, the amount of total, palmitic, and linoleic acids at the late stage were significantly decreased by elevated O-3. Summer leaves had a lower amount of all LCFAs at both leaf stages. Regarding the early stage of summer leaves, the lower amount of LCFAs under elevated O-3 was possibly due to O-3- suppressed photosynthesis in the current spring leaves. Furthermore, the decrease ratio of spring leaves over time was significantly increased by elevated O-3 in all LCFAs, whereas summer leaves did not exhibit such an effect. These findings suggest that further studies should be conducted to reveal the biological functions of LCFAs under elevated O-3, considering the leaf type- and stage-dependent changes of LCFAs.

AB  - Plants produce a range of volatile and non-volatile plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) to increase their resistance to biotic threats. The optimal defence allocation theory (ODT) states that the most valuable and vulnerable plant organs should be best defended against herbivory and therefore contain high concentrations of PSMs. However, the production of PSMs can come with metabolic and ecological costs and should be adjusted to the predictability and nature of biotic interactions to minimise interference with the ecological functions of the tissue. The ODT has recently been extended to explain PSM allocation patterns over root organs. Recent research has revealed that valuable but vulnerable root classes, such as taproots or adventitious roots, indeed have higher levels of anti-herbivory PSMs than lateral or fine roots. In this perspective, we analyse how interactions with soil organisms, including insect herbivores and microorganisms, may shape PSM allocation patterns in roots. We thereby focus on the Brassicaceae family and the glucosinolate-myrosinase defence system, but also highlight relevant studies in other species. We summarise the state-of-the-art knowledge of GSL distribution patterns over the plant body, discuss potential drivers of PSM allocation and discuss which mechanisms might regulate constitutive and induced PSM allocation patterns. Finally, we argue that implementing microbial interactions into ODT will improve our understanding of the eco-evolutionary drivers of plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Plants produce a highly diverse array of specialized metabolites. Traditionally,the evolution of these metabolites has been studied primarily through the lensof plants'ecological interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and pollinators,as many of them exhibit defense and/or attraction functions. However, increas-ing evidence suggests that many specialized metabolites, along with their pre-cursors, also act as cellular signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation.We propose that these intrinsic functions are at least equally important factorsin shaping the evolution of plant chemical defenses. We further discuss howfuture research that combines modern single-cell techniques and evolutionarygenomics will provide novel insights into the evolutionary process of specializedmetabolism diversification

AB  - Background and aims - A recent taxonomic and molecular study of the genus Cyrtorchis revealed three new species. Here, we describe one of these new species, endemic to the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), and compare it to its closest relatives. Its conservation status is provided along with detailed information on its ecology and reproductive biology.
   Material and methods - A detailed examination of 21 herbarium specimens was performed using standard practices of herbarium taxonomy. The conservation status of the new species was assessed using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Furthermore, we investigated the reproductive biology of the new species in an easily accessible subpopulation in Cameroon and tested the hypothesis of hawkmoth pollination in the genus Cyrtorchis.
   Key results - The newly discovered species, here named C. okuensis, is restricted to the montane forest (1600 to 2500 m elevation) of the CVL and is currently assessed as Near Threatened (NT). Among angraecoid orchids in which hawkmoth pollination is recorded (similar to 16 species), C. okuensis has the shortest nectar spur (19-40 mm). In situ observations revealed hawkmoths with short proboscis of the genus Hippotion (H. celerio, H. eson, and H. osiris) as the main pollinators. The rate of pollination and fruiting under natural conditions was low and among the 448 surveyed flowers only 38.8% (174/448 flowers) had their pollinia removed, 19% produced fruits (87/448 flowers), and 16% (70/448 flowers) set mature fruits.
   Conclusion - Cyrtorchis okuensis is clearly differentiated from C. submontana by its longer and wider floral bracts, longer anther caps, and wider triangular dorsal sepal.

AB  - Research involving human participants indicates that memories of recently eaten meals limit how much is eaten during subsequent eating episodes; yet, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of ingestion-related memory on future intake are largely unknown. We hypothesize that dorsal hippocampal (dHC) neurons, which are critical for episodic memories of personal experiences, mediate the inhibitory effects of ingestion-related memory on future intake. Our research program aimed at testing this hypothesis has been influenced in large part by our mentor James McGaugh and his research on posttraining manipulations. In the present study, we used an activity-guided optogenetic approach to test the prediction that if dHC glutamatergic neurons limit future intake through a process that requires memory consolidation, then inhibition should increase subsequent intake when given soon after the end of a meal but delayed inhibition should have no effect. Viral vectors containing CaMKII alpha-eArchT3.0-eYFP and fiber optic probes were placed in the dHC of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared to intake on a day when no inhibition was given, postmeal inhibition of dHC glutamatergic neurons given for 10 min after the end of a saccharin meal increased the likelihood that rats would consume a second meal 90 min later and significantly increased the amount of saccharin solution consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Importantly, delayed inhibition given 80 min after the end of the saccharin meal did not affect subsequent intake of saccharin. Given that saccharin has minimal postingestive gastric consequences, these effects are not likely due to the timing of interoceptive visceral cues generated by the meal. These data show that dHC glutamatergic neural activity is necessary during the early postprandial period for limiting future intake and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.

AB  - As plant-specific molecular switches, Rho-like GTPases (Rops) are vital for plant survival in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, their roles in plant defense response to phytophagous insect's damage are largely unknown. In this study, the expression levels of nine maize RAC family genes were analyzed after fall armyworm (FAW) larvae infestation. Among the analyzed genes, ZmRop1 was specifically and highly expressed, and its role in maize response to FAW larvae damage was studied. The results showed that upon FAW larvae infestation, salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate treatment ZmRop1 gene transcripts were all down-regulated. However, upon mechanical injury, the expression level of ZmRop1 was up-regulated. Overexpression of ZmRop1 gene in maize plants could improve maize plant resistance to FAW larvae damage. Conversely, silencing of ZmRop1 increased maize plant susceptibility to FAW larvae damage. The analysis of the potential anti-herbivore metabolites, showed that ZmRop1 promoted the enzyme activities of catalase, peroxidase and the expression levels of ZmCAT, ZmPOD, ZmRBOHA and ZmRBOHB, thereby enhancing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, including the content of O2- and H2O2. In addition, overexpression or silencing of ZmRop1 could have influence on the content of the total soluble phenol through mediating the activity of polyphenol oxidase. In summary, the results illuminated our understanding of how ZmRop1 participate in maize defense response to FAW larvae damage as a positive regulator through mediating ROS production and can be used as a reference for the green prevention and control of FAW larvae.

AB  - Simple Summary Skull and jaw shape are critical to how an animal eats. The goal of this work was to examine how facial variation evolves and the genetic basis of these changes. We used two species of Lake Malawi cichlids with different facial shapes, one which has evolved to eat prey by suction feeding, a second that bites algae from rocks, as well as hybrid individuals generated by artificial mating of the two species. We found a series of changes in craniofacial structure including the shape of the lower jaw and throat region that impact how animals perform at suction feeding and biting. We then identified genetic regions that regulate these facial shapes. These genetic regions suggested that evolution of the senses, among other traits, may play an important role in facial evolution. Also, evolution of different parts of the face are controlled by distinct genetic regions. Despite this, cichlids that eat similar ways have similar facial shapes, suggesting that the function of jaw movement places certain limits on facial evolution in cichlid fishes. Overall, this work provides insights into how the face evolves, how these changes relate to feeding, and the genes and molecules that regulate craniofacial variation. Since Darwin, biologists have sought to understand the evolution and origins of phenotypic adaptations. The skull is particularly diverse due to intense natural selection on feeding biomechanics. We investigated the genetic and molecular origins of trophic adaptation using Lake Malawi cichlids, which have undergone an exemplary evolutionary radiation. We analyzed morphological differences in the lateral and ventral head shape among an insectivore that eats by suction feeding, an obligate biting herbivore, and their F-2 hybrids. We identified variation in a series of morphological traits-including mandible width, mandible length, and buccal length-that directly affect feeding kinematics and function. Using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, we found that many genes of small effects influence these craniofacial adaptations. Intervals for some traits were enriched in genes related to potassium transport and sensory systems, the latter suggesting co-evolution of feeding structures and sensory adaptations for foraging. Despite these indications of co-evolution of structures, morphological traits did not show covariation. Furthermore, phenotypes largely mapped to distinct genetic intervals, suggesting that a common genetic basis does not generate coordinated changes in shape. Together, these suggest that craniofacial traits are mostly inherited as separate modules, which confers a high potential for the evolution of morphological diversity. Though these traits are not restricted by genetic pleiotropy, functional demands of feeding and sensory structures likely introduce constraints on variation. In all, we provide insights into the quantitative genetic basis of trophic adaptation, identify mechanisms that influence the direction of morphological evolution, and provide molecular inroads to craniofacial variation.

AB  - Plant viruses both trigger and inhibit host plant defense responses, including defenses that target their insect vectors, such as aphids. Turnip mosaic viru (TuMV) infection and its protein, NIa-Pro (nuclear inclusion protease a), suppress aphid-induced plant defenses, however the mechanisms of this suppression are still largely unknown. In this study, we determined that NIa-Pro's protease activity is required to increase aphid performance on host plants and that 40 transcripts with predicted NIa-Pro cleavage sequences are regulated in Arabidopsis plants challenged with aphids and/or virus compared to healthy controls. One of the candidates, MEDIATOR 16 (MED16), regulates the transcription of ethylene (ET)/jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense responses against necrotrophic pathogens. We show that a nuclear localization signal is removed from MED16 by specific proteolytic cleavage in virus-infected plants and in plants overexpressing NIa-Pro in the presence of aphids. Although some cleavage was occasionally detected in the absence of virus infection, it occurred at a much higher rate in plants that were virus-infected or overexpressing NIa-Pro, especially when aphids were also present. This suggests MED16 functions in the nucleus may be impacted in virus infected plants. Consistent with this, induction of the MED16-dependent transcript of PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 (PDF1.2), was reduced in virus-infected plants and in plants expressing NIa-Pro compared to controls, but not in plants expressing NIa-Pro C151A that lacks its protease activity. Finally, we show the performance of both the virus and the aphid vector was enhanced on med16 mutant Arabidopsis compared to controls. Overall, this study demonstrates MED16 regulates defense responses against both the virus and the aphid and provides insights into the mechanism by which TuMV suppresses anti-virus and anti-herbivore defenses.

AB  - Aphids are destructive cereal pests causing severe yield losses in wheat crops. Since wheat is a staple food for more than 75% of the human population, properly managing insect pests is crucial to enhance productivity and ensure food security. Aphid herbivory induces highly coordinated defense responses in plants at the cellular and molecular levels. This innate plant defense system is activated by a signal transduction pathway mediated by plant hormones like salicylic acid (SA). In this study, an attempt was made to explore the impacts of benzothiadiazole (BTH), an analog of SA, on wheat plants infested by Sitobion avenae (F.) (English grain aphid). Exogenous application of BTH (0.1 and 1 mM) on two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, i.e. V00146 and Pasban-90, improved growth, chlorophyll pigments, gas exchange parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, phenolics and proline accumulation, ascorbic acid content, total free amino acids, total soluble sugars, leaf Ca2+, and the expression of defense genes. Moreover, aphid feeding on BTHtreated wheat seedlings significantly decreased aphid population, rate of nymph development, pre and postfecundity, and longevity. Our research findings suggest that BTH can lessen the negative impacts of aphid attacks on wheat and deter aphid herbivory by reducing this pest's population. Overall, V00146 showed a better resistance against aphids.

AB  - Plants respond to attack by chewing insects through the recognition of herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) that are present in oral secretions (OS) and released at the wound site, leading to appropriate deployment of plant immune responses. Because insect feeding is accompanied by severe wounding of the leaf tissue, the specific contribution of HAMPs to defense is not well characterized. Also, OS contain effectors that interfere with the activation of defenses, but the underlying downregulated genes are poorly studied. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves in response to wounding alone or to wounding and application of OS from Spodoptera littoralis or Pieris brassicae. For both insects, OS amplified wound-induced responses and specifically promoted the activation of stress and hormonal pathways, as well as pathogen-related responses. In contrast, OS inhibited the expression of genes involved in the regulation and biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates (GS), and cell wall strengthening. In addition, OS-mediated suppression of wound-induced ERF114 and wound healing-related genes uncovered a novel strategy to impair defenses. In support of these findings, we observed an increased performance of S. littoralis and P. brassicae larvae feeding on OS-treated Arabidopsis plants. Altogether, we highlight a major contribution of OS components to plant response to herbivory and unveil the potential role of conserved OS-derived effector(s) in inhibiting defenses.

AB  - Induced resistance provides protection in plants against insect herbivores. Silicon and mycorrhizae often prime plant defenses and thereby enhance plant resistance against herbivores. In rice, Oryza sativa L., insect injury has been shown to induce resistance against future defoliators. However, it is unknown if silicon and mycorrhizae treatments in combination with insect injury result in greater induced resistance. Using the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda Smith, two experiments were conducted to investigate whether (1) silicon or mycorrhizae treatment alters resistance in rice and (2) induced systemic resistance in response to insect injury is augmented in silicon- or mycorrhizae- treated plants. In the first experiment, silicon treatment reduced FAW growth by 20% while mycorrhizae increased FAW growth by 8%. In the second experiment, insect injury induced systemic resistance, resulting in a 23% reduction in FAW larval weight gains on injured compared to uninjured plants, irrespective of treatment. Neither silicon nor mycorrhizae enhanced this systemic resistance in insect-injured plants. Furthermore, mycorrhizae resulted in the systemic increase of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, and injury caused a slight decrease in these enzyme activities in mycorrhizae plants. Silicon treatment did not result in a stronger induction of POD and PPO activity in injured plants. Taken together, these results indicate a lack of silicon and mycorrhizae priming of plant defenses in rice. Regardless of injury, silicon reduced FAW weight gains by 36%. Based on these results, it appears silicon-mediated biomechanical rather than biochemical defenses may play a greater role in increased resistance against FAW in rice.

AB  - Biotic and abiotic cues can trigger priming in plants, which enables plants to respond to subsequent challenge with stronger and/or faster responses. It is well known that herbivory activates defense-related responses in systemic leaves. However, little is known about whether insect feeding activates priming in systemic leaves. To determine whether and how herbivory induces priming in maize systemic leaves, a combination of insect bioassays, phytohormone and defense metabolite quantification, and genetic and transcriptome analyses were performed. Actual and simulated Mythimna separata herbivory in maize local leaves primed the systemic leaves for enhanced accumulation of jasmonic acid and benzoxazinoids and increased resistance to M. separata. Activation of priming in maize systemic leaves depends on both the duration of simulated herbivory and perception of M. separata oral secretions in the local leaves, and genetic analysis indicated that jasmonic acid and benzoxazinoids mediate the primed defenses in systemic leaves. Consistently, in response to simulated herbivory, the primed systemic leaves exhibited a large number of genes that were uniquely regulated or showed further up- or down-regulation compared with the non-primed systemic leaves. This study provides new insight into the regulation and ecological function of priming in maize.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions with a partially elucidated neurobiology. Caffeine, an unspecific adenosine receptor antagonist, is a common psychostimulant with anxiogenic effects in sensitive individuals. High doses of caffeine produce anxiety-like behavior in rats but it is not known if this is specific for rats with high baseline anxiety-like behavior. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate general behavior, risktaking, and anxiety-like behavior, as well as mRNA expression (adenosine A2A and A1, dopamine D2, and, & mu;, & kappa;, & delta; opioid, receptors, BDNF, c-fos, IGF-1) in amygdala, caudate putamen, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, after an acute dose of caffeine. Untreated rats were screened using the elevated plus maze (EPM), giving each rat a score on anxiety-like behavior based on their time spent in the open arms, and categorized into a high or low anxiety-like behavior group accordingly. Three weeks after categorization, the rats were treated with 50 mg/kg caffeine and their behavior profile was studied in the multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) test, and one week later in the EPM. qPCR was performed on selected genes and corticosterone plasma levels were measured using ELISA. The results demonstrated that the high anxiety-like behavior rats treated with caffeine spent less time in risk areas of the MCSF and resituated towards the sheltered areas, a behavior accompanied by lower mRNA expression of adenosine A2A receptors in caudate putamen and increased BDNF expression in hippocampus. These results support the hypothesis that caffeine affects individuals differently depending on their baseline anxiety-like behavior, possibly involving adenosine receptors. This highlights the importance of adenosine receptors as a possible drug target for anxiety disorders, although further research is needed to fully elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of caffeine on anxiety disorders.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance threatens the eradication of infectious diseases and impairs the efficacy of available therapeutics. The bacterial SOS pathway is a conserved response triggered by genotoxic stresses and represents one of the principal mechanisms that lead to resistance. The RecA recombinase acts as a DNA-damage sensor inducing the autoproteolysis of the transcriptional repressor LexA, thereby derepressing SOS genes that mediate DNA repair, survival to chemotherapy, and hypermutation. The inhibition of such pathway represents a promising strategy for delaying the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. We report the identification, via llama immunization and phage display, of nanobodies that bind LexA with sub-micromolar affinity and block autoproteolysis, repressing SOS response in Escherichia coli. Biophysical characterization of nanobody-LexA complexes revealed that they act by trapping LexA in an inactive conformation and interfering with RecA engagement. Our studies pave the way to the development of new-generation antibiotic adjuvants for the treatment of bacterial infections.

AB  - Current developments of electrodes for neural recordings address the need of biomedical research and applications for high spatial acuity in electrophysiological recordings. One approach is the usage of novel materials to overcome electrochemical constraints of state-of-the-art metal contacts. Promising materials are carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as they are well suited for neural interfacing. The CNTs increase the effective contact surface area to decrease high impedances while keeping minimal contact diameters. However, to prevent toxic dissolving of CNTs, an appropriate surface coating is required. In this study, we tested flexible surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes, coated with a CNT-silicone rubber composite. First, we describe the outcome of surface etching, which exposes the contact nanostructure while anchoring the CNTs. Subsequently, the ECoG electrodes were used for acute in vivo recordings of auditory evoked potentials from the guinea pig auditory cortex. Both the impedances and the signal-to-noise ratios of coated contacts were similar to uncoated gold contacts. This novel approach for a safe application of CNTs, embedded in a surface etched silicone rubber, showed promising results but did not lead to improvements during acute recordings.

AB  - Background Due to being rooted in the ground, maize (Zea mays L.) is unable to actively escape the attacks of herbivorous insects such as the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis). In contrast to the passive damage, plants have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from herbivores. Salicylic acid, a widely present endogenous hormone in plants, has been found to play an important role in inducing plant resistance to insects. In this study, we screened and identified the insect resistance gene SPI, which is simultaneously induced by SA and O. furnacalis feeding, through preliminary transcriptome data analysis. The functional validation of SPI was carried out using bioinformatics, RT-qPCR, and heterologous expression protein feeding assays. Results Both SA and O. furnacalis treatment increased the expression abundance of SA-synthesis pathway genes and SPI in three maize strains, and the upregulation of SPI was observed strongly at 6 hours post-treatment. The expression of SPI showed a temporal relationship with SA pathway genes, indicating that SPI is a downstream defense gene regulated by SA. Protein feeding assays using two different expression vectors demonstrated that the variation in SPI protein activity among different strains is mainly due to protein modifications. Conclusions Our research results indicate that SPI, as a downstream defense gene regulated by SA, is induced by SA and participates in maize's insect resistance. The differential expression levels of SPI gene and protein modifications among different maize strains are one of the reasons for the variation in insect resistance. This study provides new insights into ecological pest control in maize and valuable insights into plant responses to SA-induced insect resistance.

AB  - Intact capsids of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) play a vital role in eliciting a protective immune response. Any change in the physico-chemical environment of the capsids results in dissociation and poor immunogenicity. Structural bioinfomatics studies have been carried out to predict the amino acids at the interpentameric region that resulted in the identification of mutant virus-like particles(VLPs) of FMDV serotype Asia1/IND/63/1972. The insect cell expressed VLPs were evaluated for their stability by sandwich ELISA. Among 10 mutants, S93H showed maximum retention of antigenicity at different temperatures, indicating its higher thermal stability as revealed by the in-silico analysis and retained the antigenic sites of the virus demonstrated by Sandwich ELISA. The concordant results of the liquid phase blocking ELISA for estimation of antibody titre of known sera with stable mutant VLP as antigen in place of virus antigen demonstrate its diagnostic potential. The stable mutant VLP elicited a robust immune response with 85.6 % protection in guinea pigs against virus challenge. The stabilized VLP based antigen requires minimum biosafety and cold storage for production and transit besides, complying with differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals. It can effectively replace the conventional virus handling during antigen production for prophylactic and diagnostic use.

AB  - A two-year field study was conducted using canola to check the efficacy of different soil amendment treatments (SAT), i.e., with elemental sulfur (ES), bio-sulfur (BS), and compost (Cp) mixtures against insecticide-treated (Carbosulfan) and untreated controls regarding aphid populations. The results of the experiment revealed that ES treatments significantly reduced aphid abundance, followed by Cp and ES+Cp. However, BS improved aphid herbivory. The number of siliques, seeds, thousand-seed weight, and yield were improved with a trend of ES+Cp > Cp > BS+Cp. Similarly, physiological mechanisms revealed the regulation of nutrient and phenolic contents in canola with ES improving sulfur, BS nitrogen, Cp, and ES+Cp calcium, and BS+Cp enhancing phosphorus, potassium, iron, and zinc. Furthermore, RP-HPCL indicated that ferulic acid was highest in insecticide-treated plot. Similarly, Cp improved quercetin and gallic acid; ES+Cp caffeic, chlorogenic, m-coumaric, and sinapic acid; and BS+Cp enhances syringic, vanillic, ferulic, p-coumaric, and cinnamic acid. The analysis regarding health risk assessment revealed among different SAT, ES+Cp significantly reduced the Hazardous Quotient (HQ) of Cu and Zn. However, further research is still needed to explore SAT's potential to remediate other heavy metal stresses with possible implications for pest management in different field crops.

AB  - Most flowering plants are colour monomorphic, while within-population flower colour variation is rare. Multiple selection agents on flower colour, each favouring a different colour morph, may drive such uncommon polymorphisms. We tested the role of biotic antagonistic interactions in maintaining flower colour variation in Anemone coronaria (Ranunculaceae), in colour-polymorphic populations comprised of red, purple, and white flowers. We estimated the extent of leaf herbivory and petal florivory in each flower colour morph in three populations over two flowering seasons. We categorized types of damage to four groups of herbivores and estimated the plant maternal fitness. We tested pollinator response to different levels (0-30%) of simulated florivory in experimental flower arrays. Leaf and petal damage did not differ between white- and purple-flowering plants. Red-flowering plants had higher leaf damage than white-flowering plants and higher petal damage than purple-flowering plants. Nevertheless, all colour morphs had similar fitness. Red flowers exhibited more petal scratches (attributed to glaphyrid beetles), but fewer petal bites (attributed to caterpillars or grasshoppers), than white and purple flowers. Experimentally induced florivory did not reduce visits by potential pollinators in any colour morph. Glaphyrid beetles are the major pollinators of red anemone flowers, suggesting that their service to red flowers as mutualists (pollinators) should be weighed against their disservice as antagonists (florivores). A balance between pollination service and petal scratch damage of red flowers, both mediated by Glaphyird beetles, may equalize fitness between the red and the purple/white colour morphs, contributing to colour polymorphism.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play crucial regulatory roles in many biological processes, including the growth and development of skeletal muscle. miRNA-100-5p is often associated with tumor cell proliferation and migration. This study aimed to uncover the regulatory mechanism of miRNA-100-5p in myogenesis. In our study, we found that the miRNA-100-5p expression level was significantly higher in muscle tissue than in other tissues in pigs. Functionally, this study shows that miR-100-5p overexpression significantly promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, whereas miR-100-5p inhibition results in the opposite effects. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that Trib2 has potential binding sites for miR-100-5p at the 3 ' UTR region. A dual-luciferase assay, qRT-qPCR, and Western blot confirmed that Trib2 is a target gene of miR-100-5p. We further explored the function of Trib2 in myogenesis and found that Trib2 knockdown markedly facilitated proliferation but suppressed the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, which is contrary to the effects of miR-100-5p. In addition, co-transfection experiments demonstrated that Trib2 knockdown could attenuate the effects of miR-100-5p inhibition on C2C12 myoblasts differentiation. In terms of the molecular mechanism, miR-100-5p suppressed C2C12 myoblasts differentiation by inactivating the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway. Taken together, our study results indicate that miR-100-5p regulates skeletal muscle myogenesis through the Trib2/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway.

AB  - Tartary buckwheat protein (BWP) is well known for the wide-spectrum antibacterial activity and the lipid metabolism- regulating property; therefore, BWP can be applied as feed additives to improve the animal's nutritional supply. With the aim to investigate the bioactive actions of the BWP, growth performance, lipid metabolism and systemic immunity of the weaned piglets were measured, and the alterations of pig gut microbiota were also analyzed. According to the results, the growth performances of the weaned piglets which were calculated as the average daily gain (ADG) and the average daily feed intake (ADFI) were significantly increased when compared to the control group. Simultaneously, the serum levels of the total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were decreased, while the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were increased in the BWP group. Moreover, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Prevotella_9, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and other potential probiotics in the gut microbiota of weaned piglets were obviously increased in the BWP group. However, the relative abundances of Escherichia-Shigella, Campylobacter, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and other opportunistic pathogens were obviously decreased in the BWP group. In all, BWP was proved to be able to significantly improve the growth performance, lipid metabolism, and systemic immunity of the weaned piglets, and the specific mechanism might relate to the alterations of the gut microbiota. Therefore, BWP could be explored as a prospective antibiotic alternative for pig feed additives.

AB  - AimsPlant-beneficial fungi play an important role in enhancing plant growth and protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. However, context-dependency of such effects and differences among fungi often lead to inconsistent results that hamper their widespread use. Here, we investigated the effect of plant-beneficial fungi on plant growth and herbivore resistance, and how effects are mediated by fertilization.MethodsSweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants were root-inoculated with the plant-beneficial fungi Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 3097 and Trichoderma harzianum T22 and grown in a low-nutrient potting mix, with or without additional nutrients. Plant growth and herbivore resistance against the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula L.) were compared between fungal treatments and fertilization levels by measuring several growth traits and quantifying feeding damage and plant defense-related gene expression.ResultsFertilization significantly increased plant growth, but at the same time made plants more susceptible to herbivory. Irrespective of fertilization, T. harzianum stimulated growth and reduced feeding damage (number of leaf punctures), while B. bassiana only enhanced growth. For both strains, fungal inoculation generally increased the expression of marker genes involved in salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses upon herbivory, but this was less pronounced for salicylic acid-dependent defense signaling under fertilization.ConclusionsWe conclude that fungal inoculation improved plant growth and generally elicited a stronger defense response to stink bug feeding. Accordingly, plant damage was reduced by T. harzianum. Overall these results show that plant-beneficial fungi have the potential to promote plant growth and reduce feeding damage, irrespective of fertilization.

AB  - Endometrial receptivity is a critical process for the successful establishment of pregnancy in ruminants. However, the biological role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of endometrial receptivity is poorly understood. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of immortalised goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) treated with interferon-t (IFNT). Transcriptome profiles showed that 8069 high-confidence putative lncRNAs, including 6498 intronic lncRNA transcripts, 1078 lincRNAs and 493 antisense lncRNAs were identified in gEECs with or without IFNT treatment. Functional clustering analysis was performed by using cis and trans lncRNAs prediction. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that differentially expressed lncRNAs may regulate tissue remodelling and immune responses. Subsequently, six of the 21 differentially expressed antisense lncRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. Through func-tional screening and co-expression analysis of lncRNAs in gEECs, we identified that ISG15-AS was mainly expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelium on days 5 and 15 and was strongly upregulated on day 18 of pregnancy in vivo. Similarly, ISG15-AS was abundant in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and was significantly upregulated after treatment with IFNT in gEECs. In addition, ISG15 is an IFNT-responsive gene, that displayed an evident increase in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, sense ISG15 was significantly upregulated following ISG15-AS silencing. The key genes related to ISGylation and endometrial recep-tivity in gEECs dramatically increased after ISG15-AS inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that a novel antisense lncRNA, ISG15-AS, may be important in regulating endometrial receptivity through ISGylation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) has evolved viviparous reproduction mode. Different from the oviparous fishes, the spermatozoa of black rockfish are stored on the surface of ovarian follicle for over four months until the egg mature in ovary, while the adaptive evolution of fertilization-related genes remains to be studied. In the present study, based on the genome and transcriptome information of black rockfish, a total of 10 hyaluronidase genes were identified by phylogenetic and sequence analyses, including hyal1, hyal2, hyal3, hyal4, hyal6 and spam1a, spam1b, spam1c and spam1d. The spam1 subfamilies, including spam1a, spam1b, spam1c and spam1d, were significantly expanded compared to other species. The adaptive evolution of hyaluronidase was further investigated by selection pressure analysis of branch model and branch site model. The results showed that only spam1 subfamily was positively selected with a large number of positive selection sites, and the evolution rate was significantly higher thanthose of other teleosts. Two positively selected sites, LYS-171 and GLY-164, were located in the neutral hyaluronidase activity domain, which was pivotal for SPAM1 to participate in enzymatic hydrolysis of the extracellular hyaluronic acid matrix and mediate acrosome reaction in mammals. Furthermore, spam1 was mainly expressed in spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids of testis, whereas it was not found in metamorphic sperm and mature sperm based on the spatiotemporal expression analysis. All results indicated that spam1 might originate from the testis and might be an adaptation of viviparous trait in black rockfish.

AB  - The relationship between animal welfare at slaughter and slaughterhouse profitability is complex, with potential trade-offs between animal welfare costs and benefits. Slaughterhouses currently lack data support for decisions on investments that can improve both animal welfare and profitability. Therefore, this study mapped the economic impacts for slaughterhouse businesses of improved cattle and pig welfare at slaughter. Specific aims were to: (i) highlight the possible economic impact of animal welfare improvements, based on the scientific literature; (ii) develop an economic model demonstrating the theoretical contribution of animal welfare to slaughterhouse profitability; and (iii) validate the economic model through focus group interviews with slaughterhouse personnel in Sweden.The findings indicated that investing in animal welfare improvements could result in accumulation of an intangible asset that can be considered together with other production factors in the economic model. Model validation stressed the importance of selling by-products for the economic outcome and of smooth workflow for productivity. The study thus improves understanding of the economic impacts of animal welfare at slaughter and incentives for slaughterhouse businesses to improve animal welfare.The results are important for public and private policy-makers interested in enhancing animal welfare at slaughter.

AB  - Background: Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 4 (TRPV4) is a Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel that is involved in the development of cough hypersensitivity. Purinergic 2 receptors (P2X) belong to a class of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated non-selective cation channels that also play an important role in cough hypersensitivity. Nevertheless, little is known about the interaction between them for cough hypersensitivity. The present study was designed to clarify the roles of TRPV4 and ATP-P2X receptors in cough hypersensitivity, and to explore the possible involvement of ATP-P2X receptors in the development of cough hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV4. Design and Method: This study aims to establish a guinea pig model of citric acid-induced enhanced cough to confirm the effects of the TRPV4-mediated purinergic signaling pathway on cough sensitivity by testing the number of coughs, the release of ATP, and the expressions of P2X and TRPV4 receptors in the tracheal carina and vagal ganglion; recording the activity of cellular currents with the whole-cell patch clamp technique; and detecting changes in intracellular calcium flow in the vagus nerve cells. Results: The number of coughs in the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A-treated control group was elevated compared with that in the control group, whereas the number of coughs in the TRPV4 antagonist HC067047-treated model group was significantly reduced compared with that in the chronic cough group. When the individuals in the chronic cough group were treated with A317491, PSB12062, and A804598 (P2X3,4,7 antagonists), the number of coughs was significantly decreased. This suggests that TRPV4 and P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors have an effect on cough hyper-responsiveness in guinea pigs with chronic cough. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results suggested that TRPV4 antagonist and P2X3,4,7 antagonist could differentially reduce the levels of inflammatory factor SP and CGRP in alveolar lavage fluid, and TRPV4 antagonist could reduce the ATP content in the alveolar lavage fluid of guinea pigs in the model. Western blot and immunohistochemistry results showed that, in the tracheal carina and vagal ganglion, the TRPV4 and P2X3,4,7 expression was elevated in the chronic cough group compared with the control group, and could be significantly inhibited by TRPV4 antagonist. Vagus ganglion neurons were isolated, cultured, identified, and subjected to whole-cell membrane clamp assay. When ATP was given extracellularly, a significant inward current was recorded in the examined cells of individuals in the chronic cough and control groups, and the inward current induced by ATP was higher in the chronic cough group relative to the control group. This inward current (IATP) was differentially blocked by P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 antagonists. Further studies revealed that TRPV4 agonists potentiated ATP-activated currents, and the potentiated currents could still be inhibited by P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 receptor antagonists, whereas TRPV4 inhibitors partially blocked ATP-activated currents. It is suggested that TRPV4 affects P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 receptor-mediated ATP-activated currents. Calcium imaging also showed that TRPV4 agonists induced different degrees of calcium inward currents in the vagal neurons of the chronic cough and the control group, and the calcium inward currents were more significant in the model group. Conclusions: The TRPV4-mediated purinergic signaling pathway was identified to be involved in the development of cough hypersensitivity in guinea pigs with chronic cough; i.e.
   , TRPV4 can lead to the release of airway epithelial ATP, which can stimulate P2X receptors on the cough receptor, and further activate the sensory afferent nerves in the peripheral airway, leading to increased cough sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antioxidants minimise oxidative stress and enhance sperm quality in the process of cryopreservation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Cinnamomum zeylanicum extract as an additive during the post -dilution and post -thaw stages of Murrah buffalo semen cryopreservation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The semen sample was diluted using Tris-Egg-Yolk-Citric-AcidFructose-Glycerol extender and subsequently divided into three groups: Group 1, TEYCAFG without any additives or controls (C); Group 2, TEYCAFG fortified with a 50 mu g/mL aqueous extract of cinnamon (T1); and Group 3, TEYCAFG fortified with a 50 mu g/mL ethanolic extract of cinnamon (T2). The evaluation included an assessment of progressive motility, live spermatozoa, sperm abnormalities, HOST, CMPT, and enzyme leakage (GOT and GPT) at both the post -dilution and postthaw stages. RESULTS: The groups that received cinnamon supplementation demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in various parameters, including an increase in the progressive motility, live spermatozoa, and HOS-positive spermatozoa, as well as greater distance traveled by vanguard spermatozoa compared to the control group. Furthermore, the cinnamon -added groups exhibited a significant decrease (p<0.05) in the percentage of sperm abnormalities and lower enzyme leakage (GOT and GPT) in post -thawed semen. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of C. zeylanicum at a concentration of 50 mu g/mL provides superior protection of sperm structures and functions as compared to both the ethanolic extract of C. zeylanicum at the same concentration and the control group.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminants at the Mediterranean latitudes show a reproductive seasonality determining the seasonal availability of their production, resulting in problems for the marketing of these products. In order to better manage this crucial aspect, it is essential to study the genes that can influence seasonality. In different sheep breeds, polymorphisms at the melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) gene are associated with an early reproductive recovery in spring, which is advantageous to shorten the anestrus period. Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in the relationship between these polymorphisms and the reproductive activity, and if these mutations could influence the effectiveness of the ram introduction in the flock, based on different time periods, succeeding the seasonal anestrous. The present research evaluated the impact of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs430181568 and rs407388227 at the MTNR1A gene exon 2 on the resumption of reproductive activity in 240 ewes carrying different genotypes at these loci and submitted to different periods of ram introduction (February, March, April and May) in order to provide new information to stakeholders. Animals were divided into four groups (A-D) based on genotype and month of ram introduction. Fertility rate, distance from ram introduction to lambing and litter size were recorded in order to measure potential differences in crucial reproductive parameters based on different genotypes. The results confirmed the association between SNPs and reproductive recovery, with beneficial effects even in February and March, which are immediately subsequent to the photo-refractoriness period. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the association between the SNPs rs430181568 and rs407388227 located in the MTNR1A gene with the reproductive recovery of Sarda sheep in different months of ram introduction in the flock (February, March, April and May). In order to address this research gap, we selected two farms, each of which consisted of approximately 1000 animals; a total of 800 ewes (400 for each farm) were genotyped for the two single nucleotide polymorphisms rs430181568 and rs407388227 located in the exon 2 of the MTNR1A. These SNPs are completely linked; thus, each genotype of rs430181568 corresponded to the same genotype for rs407388227. Among the genotyped animals, 240 individuals were selected and divided into four homogeneous groups (A, B, C and D) of 60 subjects, each group based on age (range 3-6 years old), body condition score (BCS) (range 2.0-4.0) and genotype (20 ewes carrying CC/CC, 20 CT/CT and 20 TT/TT genotype). The dates of the ram introduction in each group were 15 February, 15 March, 15 April and 15 May, respectively. In all groups, the lambing date and the number of lambs born from 150 to 220 days after the ram introduction were recorded. In all the groups, the genotypes CC/CC and CT/CT of the polymorphism (rs430181568 and rs407388227) showed the greatest fertility (the ratio between the number of lambed ewes and the ewes exposed to the rams) (p < 0.01) and the shortest distance between ram introduction to lambing (p < 0.01), compared with the TT/TT genotype. In conclusion, we determined that the polymorphisms rs430181568 and rs407388227 were associated with reproductive recovery, after ram introduction, even in February and March, months subsequent to the photorefractoriness period.

AB  - When beetles are not in flight, their hind wings are folded and hidden under the elytra to reduce their size. This provided inspira-tion for the design of flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles (FWMAVs). In this paper, microstructures and nanomechanical proper-ties of three beetle species with different wing folding ratios living in different environments were investigated. Factors affecting their flight performance, that is, wind speed, folding ratio, aspect ratio, and flapping frequency, were examined using a wind tunnel. It was found that the wing folding ratio correlated with the lift force of the beetles. Wind speed, folding ratio, aspect ratio, and flap-ping frequency had a combined effect on the flight performance of the beetles. The results will be helpful to design new deployable FWMAVs.

AB  - Simple Summary During the course of evolution, animals have evolved biological rhythms that are associated with changes in the lighting and temperature of their environment. Females in most breeds of sheep are seasonal breeders, with ovulatory cycles occurring in the autumn and winter and anovulation in the spring and summer. Secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone, the main hormones regulating reproduction in females, displays a circadian pattern; however, data concerning the day/night differences in their secretion in ewes are incomplete. The aim of the undertaken study was to determine the day/night differences in the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone in follicular phase and anestrous ewes. It was demonstrated that secretion of investigated hormones is subject to diurnal and seasonal changes. The observed reduction in luteinizing hormone release, a few hours after the sunset, seems to be universal for both the anestrus and follicular phase. It could be concluded that the nocturnal suppression of luteinizing hormone secretion in follicular phase ewes may be a mechanism moving this hormone surge to the early morning. Secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) displays a circadian pattern. Data concerning differences in daily GnRH/LH secretion during different seasons in sheep are fragmentary. The aim of the study was to determine day/night differences in GnRH/LH secretion in the follicular phase and in the anestrous ewes. The studies were performed on Blackhead ewes (n = 24). Ewes from each season were divided into two groups of six animals (day and night group). The animals were euthanized 5 h after sunset or 5 h after sunrise and blood was taken to determine LH and melatonin concentrations. In the hypothalamus, the expression of GnRH and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) was determined. In the anterior pituitary, the expression of mRNA encoding subunit beta of LH (LH beta) and GnRHR was assayed. Our study showed that GnRH/LH secretion is subject to diurnal and seasonal changes. The observed reduction in LH release, a few hours after the sunset, seems to be universal for both the anestrus and follicular phase, when the processes occurring at the hypothalamus are more equivocal. It could be concluded that the nocturnal suppression of LH secretion in follicular phase ewes may be a mechanism moving the LH surge to the early morning.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a common outcome of excessive reactive oxygen species in the cochlea, and the targeted delivery of antioxidants to the inner ear is a potential therapeutic strategy. In this paper, a novel natural biomaterials-derived multifunctional delivery system using silk fibroin-polydopamine (PDA)-composited inverse opal microcarriers (PDA@SFMCs) is presented for inner ear drug delivery and NIHL therapy. Due to their large specific surface area and interpenetrating nanochannels, PDA@SFMCs can rapidly load active biomolecules making them a convenient medium for the storage and delivery of such molecules. In addition, surface modification of PDA enables the microcarriers to remain in the round window niche, thus facilitating the precise local and directed delivery of loaded drugs. Based on these features, it is demonstrated here that n-acetylcysteine-loaded silk microcarriers have satisfactory antioxidant properties on cells and can successfully prevent NIHL in guinea pigs. These results indicate that the natural multifunctional silk microcarriers are promising agents for local inner ear drug delivery in the clinic.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects one-third of the world's population and is a leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. New TB vaccines are urgently needed to augment immunity conferred by the current modestly protective BCG vaccine. We have developed live attenuated recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (rLm)-vectored TB vaccines expressing five [Mpt64/23.5-EsxH/TB10.4-EsxA/ESAT6-EsxB/CFP10-Ag85B/r30] (rLmMtb5Ag) or nine (additionally EsxN-PPE68-EspA-TB8.4) immunoprotective Mtb antigens (rLmMtb9Ag) and evaluated them for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy as standalone vaccines in two mouse models and an outbred guinea pig model. In immunogenicity studies, rLmMtb5Ag administered subcutaneously induces significantly enhanced antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and rLmMtb9Ag induces antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation in guinea pigs. In efficacy studies, both rLmMtb5Ag and rLmMtb9Ag are safe and protect C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and guinea pigs against aerosol challenge with highly virulent Mtb. Hence, multi-antigenic rLm vaccines hold promise as new vaccines against TB.

AB  - The object of the present study was to investigate some hormonal responses to mild hypoxia. Thirty Ile De France ewes were selected according to their hematocrit level and were allocated into 3 groups: low hematocrit (LHct) (hematocrit range - 19.7-27.9%), high hematocrit (HHct) (hematocrit range - 32.0-36.9%) and mean hematocrit (MHct) (hematocrit range - 28.3-29.8%). Immediately after shearing, ewes were transported from the Institute farm (altitude 500 m) to a mountain pasture (altitude 1440 m). Blood samples were taken by jugular venepuncture at the following time points: before transportation (baseline level), on day 7, 20 and 42 after the transport. The traits investigated were blood cortisol, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), growth hormone, reticulocyte count and lactate. Moderate altitude exposure resulted in significant increase on day 7 in plasma cortisol levels in LHct ewes (P < 0.05). Cortisol levels increased significantly on d 20 in HHct and MHct ewes (P < 0.05) compared to baseline levels. Thyroxine levels in LHct and MHct ewes were significantly higher on d 7 as compared to baseline levels (P < 0.05). Triiodothyronine in LHct and HHct ewes declined significantly at 20 d compared to baseline level. (P < 0.05). Growth hormone levels declined significantly in HHct ewes on d 42 as compared to baseline levels (P < 0.05), while in LHct and MHct ewes remained unchanged. Corrected reticulocyte count was significantly higher in HHct ewes compared to LHct ewes at 7 d (P < 0.05). There was a general trend of a slight decrease in T3 and T4 levels in all ewes at 20 d and 42 d. Blood lactate levels increased significantly in LHct (P < 0.001) and HHct ewes (P < 0.05) at d 7 compared to baseline levels. Lactate levels on d 20 d and d 42 in LHct ewes and HHcrt ewes declined but remained significantly higher compared to baseline leves (P < 0.05). There were significant correlations on day 7 between: GH and T3 (r = 0.503; P < 0.05); GH and lactate (r = 0,574; P < 0.01); T3 and lactate (r = 0.517); P < 0.05). In conclusion, Adaptation of shorn pregnant ewes to moderate altitude hypoxia was associated with a slight decrease in basal metabolism accompanied by a slight increase in lactate level.

AB  - Spatial variation and interspecies differences in the trophic position (TP) of copepods were investigated using nitrogen isotope ratios of amino acids. In the summer of 2021, coastal waters and the Changjiang diluted water generated clear seawater temperature and salinity fronts in the South Sea of Korea. Paracalanus parvus s. l. was a dominant species in the copepod community, and the second dominant species differed among inshore, intermediate, and offshore sites. The TP of each copepod species was estimated in two ways, considering only metazoan diets (TPGlu, based on glutamic acid and phenylalanine nitrogen isotope ratios) and both metazoan and protistan diets (TPAla, based on alanine and phenylalanine nitrogen isotope ratios). Both TPGlu and TPAla indicated trophic variability among copepod species and the contribution of protistan diets as a food source in the study area. Calanus sinicus showed a similar herbivorous TP of 2.0 in both TPGlu and TPAla, suggesting little contribution from protistan diets. Two copepod species (P. parvus s. l. and Acartia omorii) exhibited TPGlu values of approximately 2.0 but their TPAla values increased from 0.1 to 0.5, indicating mixed diets of both primary producers and protists. The other three copepods (Pseudocalanus sp., Oithona similis, and O. atlantica) showed a wide range in TPGlu (2.4-3.1) and TPAla (2.7-3.4), suggesting that protistan trophic transfers enhance TPAla (by up to 0.5) in omnivorous copepods. We found a spatial variation in the TPs of copepods among water masses by various controlling factors including surface seawater temperature, salinity, and size -fractionated Chl-a. Our findings support that the TP values could be potential indicative of interspecies variability, providing useful information on the composition of the planktonic food web.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), an upcoming superfood plant, has attracted researchers' attention worldwide for its medicinal, nutritional, and socio-economic value, along with its characteristic features to sustain extreme climatic conditions. We have studied microsatellite marker-based genetic and morphometric diversity in 93 collections of H. rhamnoides from different geographic sites representing two regions, namely Leh and Lahaul of the Indian Himalayas. Microsatellite markers were isolated using two different approaches, including screening of microsatellite-enriched genomic library, and in silico screening of in-house developed seabuckthorn EST database and whole transcriptome assembly. In Leh and Lahaul collections, 32 and 30 microsatellite markers were found polymorphic, respectively. All the markers developed for H. rhamnoides showed cross-species transferability to H. salicifolia and H. tibetana. Two to six alleles were recorded in the two sets of collections with an average of 3.71 and 3.53 alleles per locus in Leh and Lahaul collections, respectively. Mean polymorphic information content (PIC) values for microsatellite markers were 0.39 and 0.41 for Leh and Lahaul collections, respectively. The average expected heterozygosity was less than the observed heterozygosity. Wright's fixation index (F-IS) varied from (-)0.2045 to 1.0 and (-)0.1688 to 1.0 for Leh and Lahaul collections, respectively. Shannon's informative index (I) remained in the range of 0.6745 to 1.8621, and 0.6824 to 1.6308 for Leh and Lahaul collections, respectively. The UPGMA-based combined dendrogram showed clear demarcation between Leh and Lahaul collections, although a few ecotypes were regrouped with collections from the other region. No significant relationship was observed between the morphological distance matrix and molecular marker distance matrix. The findings of the present study may prove helpful in future breeding and conservation strategies aiming for seabuckthorn improvement.

AB  - The tannery industries utilize environmentally hazardous chemicals to achieve dehairing of animal hides, which causes enormous waterbed pollution & high TDS load. Alkaline protease enzyme for dehairing can be an effective solution to resolve the environmental problems of the tannery industry waste. However, stable, cost-efficient and eco-benign formulations of alkaline protease need to be developed for commercial applications in the tannery industry. This works aimed at development of a nano-formulation of the enzyme alkaline protease (AKP) as a bioconjugate nano silica-alkaline protease enzyme (BCeSiNP-AKP). This work reports one pot green synthesis of the BC-SiNP-AKP bionanoconjugate complex which included both biotemplating and immobilization of the AKP on to the synthesized silica nanoparticles from cell-free extracts of Bacillus circulans grown in potato peel based medium. Among the cell free crude, acetone concentrated and purified sols of the enzyme AKP, acetone precipitated enzyme sol was found to be best for the biological SiNP synthesis and formation of BC-SiNPAKP conjugate. The BC-SiNP-AKP had size ranging from 100 to 200 nm with crystalline morphologies varying from spherical, tubular to laminated crystallites. The developed bioconjugate formulation displayed 1.7-fold increase in the enzyme activity post nano- conjugation with superlative dehairing potential on goat skin. The optimized parameters for dehairing were found to be as temperature 37 degrees C for 24 h of incubation and with enzyme to buffer ratio (2: 50 mL). Thereafter, the dehaired skin was assessed for its histopathological effects, which were found to be safe without any deteriorative changes. The developed formulation is environmentally congenial for its use as depilating agent for animal hides in terms of being green, single pot and cost effective synthesis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Amadori rearrangement products (ARPs) derived from the Maillard reaction between theanine and glucose (ARP 1), as well as pyroglutamic acid and glucose (ARP 2), were identified by liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectroscopy methods. The effects of initial reactant ratio, temperature, pH, and heating time on ARP generation were analyzed. The formation of both ARPs was most favored under 100 degrees C, while an alkaline environment slightly promoted the generation of ARP 1 and acidic conditions contributed more to ARP 2 formation. The decomposition of ARP 1 was suggested to be the predominant formation mechanism of ARP 2. Preparation, purification, and structure identification of ARP 1 were conducted, with its structure confirmed as 1-deoxy-1-Ltheanino-D-fructose. The contents of ARP 1 in green, black, dark, white, yellow, and Oolong teas were quantitatively determined, of which black teas contained the highest levels of ARP 1, possibly due to the high glucose content and processing techniques.

AB  - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that presents sex differences in the severity and presentation of symptoms, whose neurobiological basis is still unknown. Both Growth -associated Protein 43 (GAP-43) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) are considered essential proteins for the appro-priate brain development, but their participation in ADHD neurobiology have not been investigated yet. In this study, we hypothesized that alterations in these proteins could be related to behavioral traits to ADHD pheno-type. Thus, both sexes of infant Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, used as ADHD animal model) were evaluated for developmental milestones, locomotor activity, olfactory and recognition memory. Both GAP-43 and Shh were assessed in the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex and hippocampus in early and late infancy. During early infancy, SHR reached three developmental milestones later, and females showed olfactory memory impairment accompanied by increased levels of Shh in the olfactory bulb. In later infancy, hyperlocomotion, impaired recognition memory, and decreased Shh in the hippocampus were observed in SHR from both sexes. While in early infancy GAP-43 was not altered, it was decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of female SHR in late infancy. Therefore, both Shh and GAP-43 are involved in the sex-dependent behavioral alterations showed by infant SHR. Despite the disorder's complexity and heterogeneity, our findings reveal important developmental parameters during SHR development and also emphasizes the relevance of studying sex differ-ences in the ADHD context.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus thrives at animal-human-environment interfaces. A large-scale work from our group indicated that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in commensal S. aureus strains from wild ungulates is associated with agricultural land cover and livestock farming, raising the hypothesis that AMR genes in wildlife strains may originate from different hosts, namely via exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGE). In this work, we generate the largest available dataset of S. aureus draft genomes from wild ungulates in Portugal and explore their mobilome, which can determine important traits such as AMR, virulence, and host specificity, to understand MGE exchange. Core genome multi-locus sequence typing based on 98 newly generated draft genomes and 101 publicly available genomes from Portugal demonstrated that the genomic relatedness of S. aureus from wild ungulates assigned to livestock-associated sequence types (ST) is greater compared to wild ungulate isolates assigned to human-associated STs. Screening of host specificity determinants disclosed the unexpected presence in wildlife of the immune evasion cluster encoded in phi Sa3 prophage, described as a human-specific virulence determinant. Additionally, two plasmids, pAVX and pETB, previously associated with avian species and humans, respectively, and the Tn553 transposon were detected. Both pETB and Tn553 encode penicillin resistance through blaZ. Pangenome analysis of wild ungulate isolates shows a core genome fraction of 2133 genes, with isolates assigned to ST72 and ST3224 being distinguished from the remaining by MGEs, although there is no reported role of these in adaptation to wildlife. AMR related gene clusters found in the shell genome are directly linked to resistance against penicillin, macrolides, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides, and they represent mobile ARGs. Altogether, our findings support epidemiological interactions of human and non-human hosts at interfaces, with MGE exchange, including AMR determinants, associated with putative indirect movements of S. aureus among human and wildlife hosts that might be bridged by livestock.

AB  - BACKGROUND Snails of the genus Biomphalaria are intermediate hosts of Schistosoma mansoni, the main etiological agent of schistosomiasis mansoni, which affects about 236.6 million people in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The World Health Organization recommends the population control of vector snails as one of the strategies to reduce the prevalence and incidence of schistosomiasis. In this study, molluscicidal and antiparasitic activities of plumbagin, a naturally sourced naphthoquinone with a range of biological effects, were evaluated against B. glabrata and cercariae of S. mansoni. RESULTS After 24 h of exposure, plumbagin demonstrated molluscicidal activity at low concentrations against embryos (LC50 of 0.56, 0.93, 0.68, 0.51 and 0.74 mu g mL(-1) for the blastula, gastrula, trochophore, veliger and hippo stage, respectively) and adult snails (LC50 of 3.56 mu g mL(-1)). There were no changes in exposed snails' fecundity or fertility; however, plumbagin was able to increase the frequency of DNA damage and the number of hemocytes, with apoptosis and binucleation being the main hemocyte alterations. In addition, plumbagin showed death of S. mansoni cercariae in the concentration of 1.5 mu g mL(-1) in 60 min, while showing moderate toxicity to Artemia salina. CONCLUSION Plumbagin proved to be a promising substance for the control of B. glabrata population, intermediate host of S. mansoni, as well as the cercariae, infective stage for humans (definitive host), while being moderately toxic to A. salina, a crustacean widely used in ecotoxicity tests.

AB  - The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

AB  - Background: Indonesia is a tropical country, warm and humid, with numerous environmental fungi. Data on fungal disease burden help policymakers and clinicians.
   Objectives: We have estimated the incidence and prevalence of serious fungal diseases.
   Methods: We found all published and unpublished data and estimated the incidence and prevalence of fungal diseases based on populations at risk. HIV data were derived from UNAIDS (2017), pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) data from 2013-2019, data on chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) were used to estimate CPA prevalence and likely deaths, COPD data from Hammond (2020), lung cancer incidence was from Globocan 2018, and fungal rhinosinusitis was estimated using community data from India.
   Results: Overall similar to 7.7 million Indonesians (2.89%) have a serious fungal infection each year. The annual incidence of cryptococcosis in AIDS was 7,540. Pneumocystis pneumonia incidence was estimated at 15,400 in HIV and an equal number in non-HIV patients. An estimated 1% and 0.2% of new AIDS patients have disseminated histoplasmosis or Talaromyces marneffei infection. The incidence of candidaemia is 26,710. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis was estimated at 49,500 and the prevalence of CPA is at 378,700 cases. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis prevalence in adults is estimated at 336,200, severe asthma with fungal sensitisation at 443,800, and fungal rhinosinusitis at 294,000. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated at 5 million/year (15-50 years old). The incidence of fungal keratitis around 40,050. Tinea capitis prevalence in schoolchildren about 729,000.
   Conclusions: Indonesia has a high burden of fungal infections.

AB  - Late-onset psychosis (LOP) represents a highly heterogeneous and understudied condition, with potential origins ranging from atypically late onset of schizophrenia (SCZ) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite the clinical necessity of differentiating these conditions to guide effective treatment, achieving an accurate diagnosis remains challenging. This study aimed to utilize data-driven analyses of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish between these diagnostic possibilities. Utilizing publicly available datasets of MRI scans from 699 healthy control (HC) participants and 469 patients diagnosed with SCZ or AD, our analysis focused on bilateral subcortical volumetric measures in the caudate, hippocampus, putamen, and amygdala. We first trained an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm based on SCZ and AD patients and achieved a clustering accuracy of 81 % and an area under curvature (AUC) of 0.79 in distinguishing between these two groups. Subsequently, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the AD and SCZ cluster centroids for each of ten patients with unexplained onset of psychosis after age 45 from a clinical MRI registry. Six patients were classified as AD and four as SCZ. Our findings revealed that among LOP participants, those classified in the SCZ cluster exhibited significantly greater right putamen volumes compared to those in the AD cluster (p < 0.0025). There were also intriguing clinical differences. While we do not have diagnostic biomarker information to confirm these classifications, this study sheds light on the heterogeneity of psychoses in late life and illustrates the potential use of widely available structural MRI and data-driven methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for LOP patients.

AB  - The object of the present study was to investigate leukocyte subsets distribution and the dynamics of some pro -inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to moderate altitude exposure in sheep having different hematocrit values. Thirty Ile De France ewes were selected from an experimental herd according to their hematocrit levels and were allocated into 3 groups as follows: low hematocrit (LHct) group (hematocrit range 19.7-27.9 %), high hematocrit (HHct) group (hematocrit range 32.0-36.9 %) and mean hematocrit (MHct) group (hematocrit range 28.3-29.8 %). Immediately after shearing, ewes were transported from the Institute farm (altitude 500 m) to a mountain pasture (altitude 1440 m). Blood samples were taken by jugular venepuncture at the following time points: before transportation (baseline level), on day 7, 20 and 42 after the transport. The traits investigated were leukocyte subsets (basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, large immature cells) and cytokines (IL-2, Il-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-a). Moderate altitude exposure elicited significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers in all the 3 groups at d 7 after transport to moderate altitude followed by a return to normal levels at d 20 after transport. Neutrophil numbers were not influenced by moderate altitude hypoxia. There was hematocrit associated changes in basophil, eosinophil and monocyte numbers suggesting different trafficking patterns of these leukocyte subsets. There was a tendency of slight increase in large immature cells in HHct ewes at d 7. There was a relation between N/L ratio and large immature cells as follow: baseline levels (r = 0.627995, P < 0.01); at 7 d (r = 0.771221, P < 0.001); at 20 d (r = 0.606801, P < 0.01); at 42 d (r = 0.566646, P < 0.01). IL-10 levels in HHct and MHct ewes tended to decrease at 7 d compared to basal levels. There was relation between IL-2 and IL-6 at 20 d (r = 0.531371, P < 0.01) and 42 d (r = 0.586212, P < 0.01). Investigated pro-inflammatory Th17 (IL-17A) and Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-a), as well as anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were not influenced by moderate altitude exposure. The results are interpreted to suggest that exposure of pregnant ewes at ambient temperature below the lower critical temperature at moderate altitude prevents cytokines increase.

AB  - Hypoxia tolerance is a critical trait in fish breeding, however, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia regulation in the tuft gills of seahorses remain unclear. In this study, we compared the gill structures of the big-belly seahorses (Hippocampus abdominalis, BBS) with lamellae gill fish and evaluated the effects of hypoxia on BBS. The average oxygen tension threshold for loss of equilibrium (LOEcrit) of BBS (2.68 mg center dot L-1) was higher than that of the common hypoxia-sensitive fish. Compared with the normoxia group, the duration of stationary, irregular swimming, curled tail, lying down behaviors, and respiratory rate significantly (P < 0.05) increased, while the duration of swinging and swimming behaviors significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in response to hypoxia. After 4or 7-days of hypoxia treatment, the red blood cell counts, SOD, CAT, GSH, and T-AOC of BBS were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in the normoxia group. Notably, when BBS were exposed to hypoxia, the relative surface area of the exposed distal gill filaments significantly increased (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, no significant (P > 0.05) changes were observed in the medial and proximal regions. Ultimately, we identified 5 significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated (itgav, itga6a, itga1, pcna, and adcy9) and 5 significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated (gusb, src, cdc20, ccnb1, and plk1) core hub genes related to gill remodeling. This study demonstrates that BBS is sensitive to hypoxia, and its unique tuft gills respond to hypoxia through local gill remodel, providing valuable insights for the breeding of hypoxia-tolerance seahorses.

AB  - The canonical view of neuronal function is that inputs are received by dendrites and somata, become integrated in the somatodendritic compartment and upon reaching a sufficient threshold, generate axonal output with axons emerging from the cell body. The latter is not necessarily the case. Instead, axons may originate from dendrites. The terms 'axon carrying dendrite' (AcD) and 'AcD neurons' have been coined to describe this feature. In rodent hippocampus, AcD cells are shown to be functionally 'privileged', since inputs here can circumvent somatic integration and lead to immediate action potential initiation in the axon. Here, we report on the diversity of axon origins in neocortical pyramidal cells of rodent, ungulate, carnivore, and primate. Detection methods were Thy-1-EGFP labeling in mouse, retrograde biocytin tracing in rat, cat, ferret, and macaque, SMI-32/beta IV-spectrin immunofluorescence in pig, cat, and macaque, and Golgi staining in macaque and human. We found that in non-primate mammals, 10-21% of pyramidal cells of layers II-VI had an AcD. In marked contrast, in macaque and human, this proportion was lower and was particularly low for supragranular neurons. A comparison of six cortical areas (being sensory, association, and limbic in nature) in three macaques yielded percentages of AcD cells which varied by a factor of 2 between the areas and between the individuals. Unexpectedly, pyramidal cells in the white matter of postnatal cat and aged human cortex exhibit AcDs to much higher percentages. In addition, interneurons assessed in developing cat and adult human cortex had AcDs at type-specific proportions and for some types at much higher percentages than pyramidal cells. Our findings expand the current knowledge regarding the distribution and proportion of AcD cells in neocortex of non-primate taxa, which strikingly differ from primates where these cells are mainly found in deeper layers and white matter.

AB  - Pseudorabies (PR) is an acute and severe infectious disease caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV). Once the virus infects pigs, it is difficult to eliminate, resulting in major economic losses to the global pig industry. In addition, reports of human infection with PRV suggest that the virus is a potential threat to human health; thus, its significance to public health should be considered. In this paper, the anti-PRV activities of emodin in vitro and in vivo, and its mechanism of action were studied. The results showed that emodin inhibited the proliferation of PRV in PK15 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.127 mg/mL and a selection index of 5.52. The addition of emodin at different stages of viral infection showed that emodin inhibited intracellular replication. Emodin significantly inhibited the expression of the IE180, EP0, UL29, UL44, US6, and UL27 genes of PRV within 48 h. Emodin also significantly inhibited the expression of PRV gB and gD proteins. The molecular docking results suggested that emodin might form hydrogen bonds with PRV gB and gD proteins and affect the structure of viral proteins. Emodin effectively inhibited the apoptosis induced by PRV infection. Moreover, emodin showed a good protective effect on PRV-infected mice. During the experimental period, all the control PRV-infected mice died resulting in a survival rate of 0%, while the survival rate of emodin-treated mice was 28.5%. Emodin also significantly inhibited the replication of PRV in the heart, liver, brain, kidneys and lungs of mice and alleviated tissue and organ damage caused by PRV infection. Emodin was able to combat viral infection by regulating the levels of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-4 in the sera of infected mice. These results indicate that emodin has good anti-PRV activity in vitro and in vivo, and is expected to be a new agent for the prevention and control of PRV infection.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is a major pathogen causing dehydrating diarrhea and fatality in newborn piglets, resulting in substantial economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Therefore, the development of a safe and effective medication for treating PoRV infection is imperative. This study provides the first report on the anti-PoRV activity of Portulaca oleracea L. (POL). Our findings demonstrate that POL-P has antiviral activity against PoRV infection in vitro, and thus might be developed into a novel antiviral agent to control PoRV in pig farms. Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of death in young piglets. Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) belongs to the genus Rotavirus within the family Reoviridae, and is considered to be the primary pathogen causing diarrhea in piglets. Portulaca oleracea L. (POL) has been reported to alleviate diarrhea and viral infections. However, the antiviral effect of Portulaca oleracea L. polysaccharide (POL-P), an active component of POL, on PoRV infection remains unclear. This study demonstrated that the safe concentration range of POL-P in IPEC-J2 cells is 0-400 & mu;g/mL. POL-P (400 & mu;g/mL) effectively inhibits PoRV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, reducing the expression of rotavirus VP6 protein, mRNA and virus titer. Furthermore, on the basis of viral life cycle analysis, we showed that POL-P can decrease the expression of PoRV VP6 protein, mRNA, and virus titer during the internalization and replication stages of PoRV. POL-P exerts antiviral effects by increasing IFN-& alpha; expression and decreasing the expression levels of TNF-& alpha;, IL-6, and IL-10 inflammatory factors. Overall, our study found that POL-P is a promising candidate for anti-PoRV drugs.

AB  - Bioaugmentation is an attractive method to improve methane production (MP) in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In this study, to tackle the ammonia inhibition problem, a long-term (operating over 6 months) accli-matized consortia and a well-constructed consortia were selected as the bioaugmentation consortia for sequencing batch AD reactors fed with dairy manure and pig manure under mesophilic condition. Similar re-sponses, in terms of the reactor performance and microorganisms structure to the different consortia, were observed with both manure kinds indicating that the effectiveness of bioaugmentation was mainly decided by the composition of the added consortia, not the feedstock. 39 - 49% increment in MP was obtained in the reactors bioaugmented with well-constructed consortia, which was higher than the acclimatized consortia (about 25% increment in MP). Both acetogenesis and methanogenesis (advantageous) steps were stimulated with well-constructed consortia bioaugmentation. According to key functional enzyme analysis, the increment of glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate mutase might be the critical point in the bioaugmented AD system. Based on the higher functional contribution rate of the well-constructed consortia bioaugmentation reactors, Methanosarcina could have expressed more comprehensive functions or performed stronger activities in different functions than Methanosaeta.

AB  - Simple Summary The application of maize silage has certain limitations, and the development of new forage resources is of great significance for improving resource utilization and environmental protection. Mulberry leaves are rich in nutritional value and are widely used in animal husbandry. However, excessive antinutritional factors, such as crude fiber, tannins, and phytic acid, in mulberry leaves affect the absorption and the utilization of nutrients by animals. Microbial fermentation technology can significantly reduce the contents of crude fiber, and the antinutritional factors in mulberry leaves minimize nutrient loss and improve the palatability of mulberry leaves. Therefore, this experiment found that the replacement of maize silage and soyabean meal with mulberry silage in the diet of Hu lambs has the potential to enhance muscle nutritional value and to improve mutton flavor without negatively affecting growth performance, serum biochemical indices, slaughter performance, or meat quality. Maize silage has a high demand for fertilizer and water. As an unconventional feed resource, mulberry silage has the potential to replace most maize silage and to alleviate the shortage of roughage in the mutton sheep industry in China. The purpose of this experiment was to study the effect of the replacement of maize silage and soyabean meal with mulberry silage in the diet of Hu lambs on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, slaughter performance, and meat quality. Ninety-six healthy Hu lambs were randomly divided into four groups with six replicates per group and four lambs per replicate. The amounts of 0, 20, 40, and 60% of maize silage were replaced by mulberry silage in each group (denoted as CON, L, M, and H, respectively). The results showed that replacing maize silage with mulberry silage had no significant effect on the growth performance or the slaughter performance of Hu lambs (p > 0.05). Feeding Hu lambs with mulberry silage significantly reduced serum glucose (GLU) and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) content (p < 0.05), and it increased the content of ether extract (EE) in the longissimus dorsi muscle (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the percentage of EAA in the M and H groups was significantly lower than that in the CON and L groups (p < 0.05). In addition, in the fatty acid profile, the percentage of C16:1 in the M group was significantly increased, while the percentage of C18:0 and C20:0 were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Based on these findings, it was recommended that 20-40% of maize silage be replaced by mulberry silage in the diet of Hu lambs.

AB  - The teat number is a pivotal reproductive trait that significantly influences the survival rate of piglets. A meta-analysis is a robust instrument, enhancing the universality of research findings and improving statistical power by increasing the sample size. This study aimed to identify universal candidate genes associated with teat number traits using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis with three breeds. We identified 21 chromosome threshold significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with five teat number traits in single-breed and cross-breed meta-GWAS analyses. Using a co-localization analysis of expression quantitative trait loci and GWAS loci, we detected four unique genes that were co-localized with cross-breed GWAS loci associated with teat number traits. Through a meta-analysis and integrative analysis, we identified more reliable candidate genes associated with multiple-breed teat number traits. Our research provides new information for exploring the genetic mechanism affecting pig teat number for breeding selection and improvement.

AB  - Pigeons are commonly utilized in psychological research, and their cognitive abilities have been thoroughly investigated. Yet very little is known about how these abilities change with age. In contrast, age-related changes in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents are well documented. Mammalian research consistently shows that older subjects show deficits in a variety of learning and memory processes, particularly those that rely on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. This research expands the avian aging literature by administering a memory task, the delayed match to sample procedure, and an associative learning task, a conditional or symbolic match to sample procedure, to nine young and 11 old pigeons. Previous research has indicated that these tasks rely on the avian equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex, and we predicted that performance on both tasks would decline with age. In contrast to our predictions, only the associative learning task was sensitive to age-related decline. Performance on the memory task was maintained in older subjects. These results highlight further potential differences in avian versus mammalian aging, particularly when it comes to the prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Volatile terpenes are important compounds that influence fruit flavour and aroma of kiwifruit. Terpenes in plants also impact on the floral bouquet and defence against pests and pathogens in leaves and fruit. To better understand the overlapping roles that terpenes may fulfil in plants, a systematic gene, chemical and biochemical analysis of terpenes and terpene synthases (TPS) was undertaken in Red5 kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.). Analysis of the Red5 genome shows it contains only 22 TPS gene models, of which fifteen encode full-length TPS. Thirteen TPS can account for the major terpene volatiles produced in different tissues of Red5 kiwifruit and in response to different stimuli. The small Red5 TPS family displays surprisingly high functional redundancy with five TPS producing linalool/nerolidol. Treatment of leaves and fruit with methyl jasmonate enhanced expression of a subset of defence-related TPS genes and stimulated the release of terpenes. Six TPS genes were induced upon herbivory of leaves by the economically important insect pest Ctenopseustis obliquana (brown-headed leaf roller) and emission, but not accumulation, of (E)- and (Z)-nerolidol was strongly linked to herbivory. Our results provide a framework to understand the overlapping biological and ecological roles of terpenes in Actinidia and other horticultural crops.

AB  - Stable isotope values can express resource usage by organisms, but their precise interpretation is predicated using a controlled experiment-based validation process. Here, we develop a stable isotope tracking approach towards exploring resource shifts in a key primary consumer species Daphnia magna. We used a diet switch experiment and model fitting to quantify the stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope turnover rates and discrimination factors for eight dietary sources of the plankton species that differ in their cellular organization (unicellular or filamentous), pigment and nutrient compositions (sterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids), and secondary metabolite production rates. We also conduct a starvation experiment. We evaluate nine tissue turnover models using Akaike's information criterion and estimate the repetitive trophic discrimination factors. Using the parameter estimates, we calculate the hourly stable isotope turnover rates. We report an exceedingly faster turnover value following dietary switching (72 to 96 h) and a measurable variation in trophic discrimination factors. The results show that toxic stress and the dietary quantity and quality induce trophic isotope variation in Daphnia individuals. This study provides insight into the physiological processes that underpin stable isotope patterns. We explicitly test multiple alternative dietary sources and fasting and discuss the parameters that are fundamental for field- and laboratory-based stable isotope studies.

AB  - Asthma, the respiratory disorder associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness, affected 300 million people across the globe, with a prevalence of 4.05% in Saudi Arabia and causing 61.6% of hospital emergency room annual visits. Increased side effects of conventional drugs demand the necessity for the development of natural drugs. In this study, an herbal composite from Bacopa monnieri and Euphorbia hirta was prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In vitro bacterial inhibition and anti-asthmatic activity were evaluated using animal models. Ethanolic herbal composite (EHC) showed significant anti-pathogenic activities. GC-MS analysis identified potential bioactive compounds and FT-IR analysis revealed functional groups corresponding to plant composites. The EHC increased the preconvulsive time against 1% histamine aerosol compared to control animals. In sensitized + EHC-treated animals, total leukocyte, eosinophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts were found to be reduced as compared to sensitized and control groups. EHC decreased malondialdehyde and bicarbonate levels denoting the reduced oxidative burden and increased the antioxidant activity by increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) level. The EHC-treated group showed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration compared to the sensitized. A significant anti-asthmatic effect was observed in the EHC-treated group (P < 0.05). Thus, herbal composites are used in the treatment of asthma and can be used as an alternative to commercially available pharmaceutical drugs.

AB  - Simple Summary A complete pelleted diet is one of the most popular and effective approaches for feeding livestock because of its contribution to improved flock productivity, low cost, and profitability. However, there are a number of negative effects associated with feeding such diets to livestock which can impact the livestock producer and consumer preferences; these include wool biting, wool eating, odor emission, and the dark color of ruminal tissue. The addition of yucca plays a beneficial role in the nutrition and welfare of livestock, particularly sheep, by reducing the negative effects of feeding complete pelleted diets. Animal diets supplemented with yucca target growth, productivity, and physiological responses. The aim of this study was to improve the quality of complete pelleted diets in order to avoid or mitigate their effects on fecal and urinary odor emission. The results found that supplementing Yucca schidgera extract at a level of 600 mg YS/kg dry matter (DM) in feed improved the fecal and urinary odors of lambs fed on pelleted diets. Sixty male Awassi lambs were used to investigate the effects of dietary Yucca schidgera extract (YS) on the production, fecal and urinary odor emissions, and carcass traits of growing lambs fed complete pellets. Lambs were fed either a complete pelleted diet without yucca (control) or supplemented with 300 or 600 mg YS/kg dry matter (DM) during the 84-day experiment. The weights and feed consumption of the lambs were measured weekly. Blood samples were taken on days 1, 28, 58, and 84, and ruminal fluid samples were collected on day 70. On day 90, the odor emissions from feces and urine were measured. On day 84, 12 lambs were slaughtered for the evaluation of carcass and meat quality. The final values for bodyweight, bodyweight gain, and feed efficiency of lambs fed the YS300 diet were 3.40%, 6.64%, and 6.17%, respectively, higher (p < 0.05) than those fed the YS600 diet. Additionally, the percentage of dressing, myofibril fragmentation index, and ruminal isovalerate percentage of lambs treated with YS600 were higher than those treated with YS300. Compared with the control, the addition of yucca reduced odor emissions from feces and urine. In conclusion, dietary YS300 had no additional benefits on growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass traits, while dietary YS600 improved fecal and urinary odors.

AB  - Background: White matter damage is an important contributor to cognitive impairment after stroke. This study was designed to explore the beneficial effects of enriched environment (EE) on white matter recovery and cognitive dysfunction after stroke, and further explore the potential mechanism of EE on white matter recovery from the perspective of microglia and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.
   Methods: Male SD rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. During the MCAO operation, a laser Doppler blood flow meter was used to monitor the blood flow to ensure the success of the model. At 72 h after the operation, 3 rats were selected for TTC staining to identify the infarct size. One week after surgery, the rats were randomly assigned into four different groups-MCAO+standard environment (SE), MCAO+enriched environment (EE), Sham+SE and Sham+EE for 4 weeks. At four weeks after MCAO surgery, neurological function deficiency condition and cognitive function were assessed using Longa score and Morris Water Maze prior to euthanasia. The loss or regeneration of myelin was stained with LFB, the expression of myelin regeneration-related protein and microglia protein was quantified by western blot and immunofluorescence, and the level of inflammatory factors was measured by ELISA.
   Results: EE treatment remarkably decreased the neurological deficit score, ameliorated the cognitive functional deficit in MCAO rats. Furthermore, EE alleviated white matter lesions and demyelination, increased myelin basic protein expression and decreased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus of MCAO rats. In addition, ELISA analysis indicated that EE decreased the level of IL-1 beta, IL-6, which further suggests that EE may reduce the level of pro-inflammatory factors by affecting the expression of microglia marker, IBA1, provide a benefit physiological environment for myelin recovery, and improve post stroke cognitive impairment.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that exposure to EE substantially reduced the damage to brain tissue caused by activation of microglia activation, decreased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokins, which may induced by microglia, protected and promote white matter recovery to improve cognitive function after stroke. Our findings also indicate exposure to EE is beneficial for patients with white matter impairment characterised by white matter disease-related inflammation.

AB  - Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, associated with several pathophysiological complaints. Impaired insulin signaling in the brain, is one of the important characteristic features of AD which is accompanied by cognitive deficits. According to the multifactorial and complicated pathology of AD, no modifying therapy has been approved yet. Imipramine is a kind of tricyclic antidepressant with reported anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects in the brain. There are controversial studies about the effect of this drug on spatial memory. This study investigates the effect of imipramine on streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impairment in rats. Pursuing this objective, rats were treated with imipramine 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p. once a day for 14 days. 24 h after the last injection, memory function was evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test in 4 consecutive days. Then, hippocampi were removed and the activity of caspase-3, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family and inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1ser307) were analyzed using Western blotting. Results showed that imipramine prevents memory impairment in STZ induced rats and this improvement was accompanied with an increase in ERK activity, reduction of caspase3 and JNK activity, as well as partial restoration of P38 and IRS-1 activity. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that at least some members of the MAPK family are involved in the neuroprotective effect of imipramine.

AB  - Aberrantly synchronized neuronal discharges in the brain lead to epilepsy, a devastating neurological disease whose pathogenesis and mechanism are unclear. SAPAP3, a cytoskeletal protein expressed at high levels in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses, has been well studied in the striatum, but the role of SAPAP3 in epilepsy remains elusive. In this study, we sought to investigate the molecular, cellular, electrophysiological and behavioral consequences of SAPAP3 perturbations in the mouse hippocampus. We identified a significant increase in the SAPAP3 levels in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in mouse models of epilepsy. In addition, behavioral studies showed that the downregulation of SAPAP3 by shRNA decreased the seizure severity and that the overexpression of SAPAP3 by recombinant SAPAP3 yielded the opposite effect. Moreover, SAPAP3 affected action potentials (APs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated currents in the CA1 region, which indicated that SAPAP3 plays an important role in excitatory synaptic transmission. Additionally, the levels of the GluN2A protein, which is involved in synaptic function, were perturbed in the hippocampal PSD, and this perturbation was accompanied by ultrastructural morphological changes. These results revealed a previously unknown function of SAPAP3 in epileptogenesis and showed that SAPAP3 may represent a novel target for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - The repressor-element 1-silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) controls hundreds of neuron-specific genes. We showed that REST/NRSF downregulates glutamatergic transmission in response to hyperactivity, thus contributing to neuronal homeostasis. However, whether GABAergic transmission is also implicated in the homeostatic action of REST/NRSF is unknown. Here, we show that hyperactivity-induced REST/NRSF activation, triggers a homeostatic rearrangement of GABAergic inhibition, with increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and amplitude of evoked IPSCs in mouse cultured hippocampal neurons. Notably, this effect is limited to inhibitory-onto-excitatory neuron synapses, whose density increases at somatic level and decreases in dendritic regions, demonstrating a complex target- and area-selectivity. The upscaling of perisomatic inhibition was occluded by TrkB receptor inhibition and resulted from a coordinated and sequential activation of the Npas4 and Bdnf gene programs. On the opposite, the downscaling of dendritic inhibition was REST-dependent, but BDNF-independent. The findings highlight the central role of REST/NRSF in the complex transcriptional responses aimed at rescuing physiological levels of network activity in front of the ever-changing environment.

AB  - Musk secreted by the musk glands in male forest musk deer (FMD; Moschus berezovskii) ) is highly valued for its pharmaceutical and perfumery applications. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying musk secretion are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the genes and transcription factors involved in musk secretion across different periods and ages. We analyzed the musk glands of adult male FMD during the non- secretory and secretory periods, as well as juvenile and adult male FMD during the secretory period, using single-cell multiome ATAC+gene +gene expression technique. Our analysis identified 13 cell types, including acinar cells of Types 1 and 2. Chromatin accessibility analysis and gene expression data confirmed that the genes Map3k2, , Hsd17b12, , and Jun are critical for musk secretion. Additionally, EHF, NR4A2, and FOXO1 proteins play crucial regulatory roles. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted the importance of GnRH signaling pathway in musk secretion. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway is notably enriched in acinar cells. Furthermore, intercellular communication appears to influence both the initiation and maintenance of musk secretion. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular pathways of musk secretion in FMD, offering potential avenues for increasing musk production and developing treatment for inflammation and tumors.

AB  - Maternal obesity (MO) is associated with offspring cardiometabolic diseases that are hypothesized to be partly mediated by glucocorticoids. Therefore, we aimed to study fetal endothelial glucocorticoid sensitivity in an ovine model of MO. Rambouillet/Columbia ewes were fed either 100% (control) or 150% (MO) National Research Council recommendations from 60 d before mating until near-term (135 days gestation). Sheep umbilical vein and artery endothelial cells (ShUVECs and ShUAECs) were used to study glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and function in vitro. Dexamethasone dose-response studies of gene expression, activation of a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-dependent luciferase reporter vector, and cytosolic/nuclear GR translocation were used to assess GR homeostasis. MO significantly increased basal GR protein levels in both ShUVECs and ShUAECs. Increased GR protein levels did not result in increased dexamethasone sensitivity in the regulation of key endothelial gene expression such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, or intercellular adhesion molecule 1. In ShUVECs, MO increased GRE-dependent transactivation and FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5) expression. ShUAECs showed generalized glucocorticoid resistance in both dietary groups. Finally, we found that ShUVECs were less sensitive to dexamethasone-induced activation of GR than human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These findings suggest that MO-mediated effects in the offspring endothelium could be further mediated by dysregulation of GR homeostasis in humans as compared with sheep.

AB  - This study compares two scenarios for sewage sludge treatment i.e., agricultural-land application (LA) and incineration (INC), in an Italian context (Pavia province, Po Valley). The study was realised within a regional project aiming to obtain useful data to better address future sludge management policies. To do so, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was chosen and the multi-functionality was addressed by using system expansion. Results indicated that the scenario INC had higher impacts than scenario LA for the categories linked to process inputs and to the direct emissions of incineration, such as Global warming potential (= + 60 %)., Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, Ozone Formation, Mineral Resource Scarcity and Fossil Resource Scarcity. System expansion i.e., the production of non-renewable fertilisers, played a large role (higher impacts) in the categories related to resource scarcity in the INC scenario. On the other hand, LA scenario showed higher impacts than INC for direct emissions due to fertilisation (Marine and Freshwater Eutrophication, and Particulate Matter).In conclusion, the use of sewage sludge in agriculture seemed to be competitive with the alternative of incineration but both sludge quality and emission reduction during sludge distribution in the field play an important role in the reduction of environmental impacts.

AB  - Underactive bladder (UAB) patients experience straining to void and typically cannot sense bladder fullness. Previous closed-loop bladder volume control systems are limited in neurogenic UAB patients and face infection risk due to wired connections. Here, we propose an intelligent bladder volume control system (IBCS) combining an implantable meshed magnetic soft robot (MMR) with a wearable magnetic field sensor. The MMR, tightly sutured to the bladder, compresses the bladder to facilitate urination under magnetic actuation, achieving a voiding efficiency of 94.8%. The wearable magnetic field sensor outside the abdomen achieves continuous and wireless monitoring of bladder volume with a 4.8% error in time. The MMR was validated on a UAB pig model, demonstrating a pressure increase of up to 33 cmH2O and voiding efficiency of over 83%. Our IBCS provides a biocompatible solution for wireless and continuous bladder volume management by integrating wearable sensors and magnetic robotics.

AB  - Twin lambs establish a social attachment soon after birth, which implies that they prefer to interact with each other during the suckling period. However, the role of the mother's presence in maintaining the social attachment between twins has been scarcely studied. The aims of this study were to characterize the dynamics of the distance between twin lambs during lactation until three months after weaning, and to determine the impact of the mother in this regard. The study was performed with 11 East Friesian multiparous ewes, nine Finnish Landrace multiparous ewes, and their twin lambs under grazing conditions. The distances among all lambs of the flock were measured from aerial pictures taken with a drone in three periods: before weaning (on 33, 49, 62 and 78 days of age); before and after a temporary maternal separation (on 79, 81, 82 and 83 days of age) and immediately before and after weaning [ 94, 95, 96, 98 (weaning day), 99, 110, 124, 145 and 186 days of age]. The mothers and their lambs were temporarily separated at 81, 82, and 83 days of age to determine if the distance between siblings differed when the mother was absent. Distances between siblings vs the mean distance from each twin to the other lambs of the flock, and the distance between siblings vs the distance from each twin lamb to its' mother, were compared separately during the aforementioned periods. The sibling lambs were closer to each other than the other lambs of the flock before and after weaning (P < 0.0001, for both). While the distance between siblings increased from 49 to 78 days of age (P = 0.01), the distance from each twin lamb to its' mother did not change. After the temporary maternal separation, the distance between siblings was shorter than the mean distance from each twin to the other lambs of the flock (P < 0.0001). The distance between siblings increased from 33 to 78 days of age (P <= 0.03), while the mean distance from each twin to the other lambs of the flock did not change. The distance between siblings and the mean distance from each twin to the other lambs of the flock decreased from 94 to 96-98 days of age (P < 0.0001). From 98-110 days of age, the distance between siblings and the mean distance from each twin to the other lambs of the flock increased (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, twins had a preferential social attachment to each other, that was gradually weakened during their development. The social attachment between siblings was likely because of their mother's presence, as it gradually disappeared after abrupt weaning.

AB  - Introduction: Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, has diverse roles in various physiological processes. Enhancing lysosomal function by TFEB activation has recently been implicated in restoring neural stem cells (NSCs) function. Overexpression of TFEB can inhibit the cell cycle of newborn cortical NSCs. It has also been found that TFEB regulates the pluripotency transcriptional network in mouse embryonic stem cells independent of autophagy lysosomal biogenesis. This study aims to explore the effects of TFEB activation on neurogenesis in vivo through transgenic mice. Methods: We developed a GFAP-driven TFEB overexpression mouse model (TFEB GoE) by crossing the floxed TFEB overexpression mice and hGFAP-cre mice. We performed immunohistochemical and fluorescence staining on brain tissue from newborn mice to assess neurogenesis changes, employing markers such as GFAP, Nestin, Ki67, DCX, Tbr1 and Neun to trace different stages of neural development and cell proliferation. Results: TFEB GoE mice exhibited premature mortality, dying at 10-20 days after birth. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant abnormalities, including disrupted hippocampal structure and cortical layering. Compared to control mice, TFEB GoE mice showed a marked increase in radial glial cells (RGCs) in the hippocampus and cortex, with Ki67 staining indicating these cells were predominantly in a quiescent state. This suggests that TFEB overexpression suppresses RGCs proliferation. Additionally, abnormal distributions of migrating neurons and mature neurons were observed, highlighted by DCX, Tbr1 and Neun staining, indicating a disruption in normal neurogenesis. Conclusion: This study, using transgenic animals in vivo, revealed that GFAP-driven TFEB overexpression leads to abnormal neural layering in the hippocampus and cortex by dysregulating neurogenesis. Our study is the first to discover the detrimental impact of TFEB overexpression on neurogenesis during embryonic development, which has important reference significance in future TFEB overexpression interventions in NSCs for treatment.

AB  - In-situ and ex-situ Asian elephant populations are threatened with extinction, and male elephants pose unique challenges to long-term sustainability. The heightened sexual state of "musth" is accompanied by a suite of physical, behavioral and physiological changes. Furthermore, musth is unique to male elephants and requires special consideration when developing short-and long-term management strategies for elephants in the wild and in human care. The purpose of this study was to identify associations between fecal hormone metabolites [fecal androgen metabolites, FAM; fecal glucocorticoid metabolites, FGM; and fecal triiodothyronine (T3) metabolites, FT3] and visible musth indicators [temporal gland secretions (TGS) and urine dribbling (UD)], and behavioral changes around musth. From fecal samples collected non-invasively from wild elephants in Wasgamuwa National Park, Sri Lanka, and zoo-housed elephants in the United States, we hypothesized that (1) TGS and/or UD would be associated with changes in FAM, FGM, and/or FT3 concentrations; (2) variation in fecal hormone metabolites would be associated with increased locomotion and chemosensory behavior, and decreased foraging; and (3) relationships we identified would be similar between wild and zoo-housed elephants. We found that FAM concentrations changed significantly with TGS and UD activity in both wild and zoo elephants. Further while FGM concentrations were higher with increased TGS and UD in zoo elephants, the opposite pattern occurred in wild elephants. We did not identify substantial change in FT3 concentrations with TGS/UD activity. Behavioral changes in zoo elephants were significantly associated with FAM concentration as predicted, but these relationships were more difficult to identify in wild elephants due to lower sample availability. Further, FGM concentration was directly related to time spent locomoting in zoo elephants, but no other apparent association existed between FGM concentration with other behaviors in zoo elephants, or in any behaviors in wild elephants. Likewise, we did not report associations between FT3 and any behaviors we measured. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex response patterns that male Asian elephants exhibit around musth, and it provides another example of complementary in-situ-ex-situ research that can be directly applied to improve the well-being of elephants and other wildlife.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is an important woody economic crop that has been cultivated worldwide. Adversity stress acts as a significant factor affecting the growth and development of tea plants. Brassinazole-resistant (BZR) family protein is an essential factor in regulating plant stress resistance and plays a key role in cold stress response, heat, drought and salt resistances. In this study, the promoter region upstream of CsBZR1-2 was cloned. The promoter sequence and its 5'-end truncated segment were inserted upstream of ss-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in the pCambia1391Z plasmid. Stably expressed transgenic tobacco lines were obtained by Agrobacterium tumefaciens- mediated genetic transformation. The results showed that except for promoter lacking the core element, both full-length and truncated promoters could initiate the expression of GUS, but the level of expression was affected by the degree of deletion at the 5'-end. The core region of the promoter was in a 311 bp region including the transcription start site (TSS). In addition, the regulatory mechanism of the promoter was explored. It was found that the genes regulated by the promoter were responsive to stress such as cis-acting elements (MeJA, ABRE and LTR), BR and light. This paper provides a theoretical basis to further explore the regulatory mode of the promoter and to achieve efficient gene expression.

AB  - Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), as a molecular chaperone, regulates hundreds of protein clients under both physiological and stress conditions in eukaryotic cells. However, the functional role of HSP90 in mammalian male reproduction remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the function and effect of HSP90AA1 on the basic and reproductive function of pig immature Sertoli cells (iSCs). We first confirmed that the transfection of pBI-CMV3-HSP90AA1 vector into porcine iSCs for 24 h significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of HSP90AA. Moreover, HSP90AA1 over-expression significantly increased cell viability and the PLK2 mRNA abundance, promoted lactate production via elevating the LDHA activity, and inhibited the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol. In comparison, HSP90AA inhibition by allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (2 mM) treatment of pig iSCs for 36 h had a totally contrasting effect, i.e. significantly reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis via modulating expression of genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis (CCNB1, CCN1, PLK2, PTMA, YBX3 and CASP3), suppressed lactate production via dropping LDHA activity, but increased the secretion of antiMullerian hormone and estradiol. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that HSP90AA1 could regulate positively cell viability and lactate production, but negatively the secretion of reproductive hormones (anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of HSP90AA1 remains to be investigated.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is abundant in the mammalian brain and is considered to have a wide range of effects on learning and memory. Here, we found that the upregulated methyltransferase-like protein 16 (METTL16) in the hippocampal tissues of Morris water maze (MWM)-trained mice contributed to improved memory formation and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Mechanismly, METTL16 promoted the expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) by the m(6)A methylation of the MAT2A mRNA-3'UTR-end to increase its stability, and this involved in improving hippocampal global m(6)A levels, plasticity of dendritic spine, learning and memory. This study provides a new perspective to explore the regulatory mechanisms of m(6)A for learning and memory.

AB  - Arsenic is a well-established carcinogen known to increase mortality, but its effects on the central nervous system are less well understood. Epidemiological studies suggest that early life exposure is associated with learning deficits and behavioral changes. Studies in arsenic-exposed rodents have begun to shed light on potential mechanistic underpinnings, including changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, previous studies relied on extended exposure into adulthood, and little is known about the effect of arsenic exposure in early development. Here, we studied the effects of early developmental arsenic exposure in juvenile mice on synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. C57BL/6J females were exposed to arsenic (0, 50 ppb, 36 ppm) via drinking water two weeks prior to mating, with continued exposure throughout gestation and parturition. Electrophysiological recordings were then performed on juvenile offspring prior to weaning. In this paradigm, the offspring are exposed to arsenic indirectly, via the mother. We found that high (36 ppm) and relatively low (50 ppb) arsenic exposure both decreased basal synaptic transmission. A compensatory increase in pre-synaptic vesicular release was only observed in the high-exposure group. These results suggest that indirect, ecologically relevant arsenic exposure in early development impacts hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity that could underlie learning deficits reported in epidemiological studies.

AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica ranks third among the pathogens that often cause the digestive disorder. It is transmitted to humans through food materials, especially contaminated meats. This research aimed to survey the frequency of Yersinia enterocolitica in sheep local products, especially meat, in Erbil. To carry out this study, 500 samples of raw milk, soft cheese, ice cream, and meat were collected by random sampling from different shops in Erbil City of Iraq. The samples were divided into four groups, including raw milk, soft cheese, ice cream, and meat. Many microbiological tests (culture, & staining, biochemical Tests, Vitek 2, and species-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplicon for 16S RNA gene) were performed. Results showed that 5.1% of all of the studied samples were contaminated with Yersinia enterocolitica. Analysis of the results showed that meat is more contaminated than other samples. Also, the sequenced DNA evolutionary phylogeny tree of Yersinia enterocolitica isolates showed that all bacteria originated from the same genus and species. Therefore, it is recommended to pay special attention to this issue in order to avoid health and economic risks

AB  - Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent psychiatric disorders, characterized by a chronic course and often accompanied by comorbid symptoms that impair functionality and decrease quality of life. Despite advances in basic and clinical research in our understanding of these disorders, currently available pharmacological options are associated with limited clinical benefits and side effects that frequently lead to treatment discontinuation. Importantly, a significant number of patients do not achieve remission and live with lifelong residual symptoms that limit daily functioning. Since the 1970s, basic and clinical research on cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, has indicated relevant anxiolytic effects, garnering attention for its therapeutic potential as an option in anxiety disorder treatment. This chapter aims to review the history of these studies on the anxiolytic effects of CBD within the current understanding of anxiety disorders. It highlights the most compelling current evidence supporting its anxiolytic effects and explores future perspectives for its clinical use in anxiety disorders.

KW  - EXTRACTION
AB  - Polyphenols, as one of the primary compounds produced by plant secondary metabolism, have garnered considerable attention because of their non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and biodegradable properties, as well as their notable medicinal value. This study presents a metabolomic analysis of polyphenols from 11 woody plants, including Camellia oleifera, Quercus acutissima, and Punica granatum, investigating a total of 40 polyphenolic metabolites. A differential metabolite dynamics map highlighted the five most differentiated substances among the 11 plants, including vitexin, dihydromyricetin, genistin, resveratrol, and isorhamnetin. To evaluate the application of polyphenol-rich plants as natural dyes, dye performance tests, and color fastness evaluations were conducted, focusing on the specific role of polyphenols in dyeing cotton fabrics. The composition of polyphenols had a minor effect on the color of dyed cotton fabrics, typically imparting only black or brown tones to the fabric. However, their effect on dyeing performance is notable, with the ratio of the dye absorption coefficient (k) to the dye scattering coefficient (s) (K/S) ranging from 1 to 20, and lightness varying from 26 to 78. The addition of mordants not only improved the dye's color fastness but also expanded the color range. Furthermore, this study identified four key substances that influence the dyeing performance of plant dyes, including naringenin, epicatechin, catechin, and dihydromyricetin, and discovered a novel natural dye compound, naringenin. Importantly, six of the 11 plant dyes selected in this study are derived from plant waste, thus providing a theoretical basis for advancing environmentally friendly and sustainable dyeing technologies.

AB  - In ruminants, conceptus elongation requires the endometrium and its secretions. The amino acid, carbohydrate, and protein composition of the uterine lumen during early pregnancy has been defined in sheep; however, a comprehensive understanding of metabolomic changes in the uterine lumen is lacking, particularly with respect to lipids. Here, the lipidome and primary metabolome of the uterine lumen, endometrium, and/or conceptus was determined on day 14 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Lipid droplets and select triglycerides were depleted in the endometrium of pregnant ewes. In contrast, select ceramides, diglycerides, and non-esterified fatty acids as well as several phospholipid classes (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerols, and diacylglycerols) were elevated in the uterine lumen of pregnant ewes. Lipidomic analysis of the conceptus revealed that triglycerides are particularly abundant within the conceptus. Primary metabolite analyses found elevated amino acids, carbohydrates, and energy substrates, among others, in the uterine lumen of pregnant ewes. Collectively, this study supports the hypothesis that lipids are important components of the uterine lumen that govern conceptus elongation and growth during early pregnancy.

AB  - Simple Summary Agriophyllum squarrosum (sand rice) is an annual psammophyte that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. Its medicinal properties have been studied in mice and human, but the nutritional value and metabolic function of the above-ground parts as a ruminant feed ingredient have not been reported. Here, we find that supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. These findings have provided strong evidence that A. squarrosum has the potential to be used as a beneficial dietary supplement for ruminants. Agriophyllum squarrosum (sand rice), a widespread desert plant, possesses anti-hyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. However, its effects on ruminants are unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of A. squarrosum on the immune and anti-inflammatory responses of lambs. A total of 23, 6-month-old Tan ewe-lambs (27.6 +/- 0.47 kg) were divided into four groups and offered a basic diet (C-control), or a diet that contained 10%, 20%, or 30% A. squarrosum, on a dry matter basis, for 128 days. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol were lower (p = 0.004) in the 30% supplemented lambs than controls, while concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower (p = 0.006) in the 10% and 20%, but not in 30% supplemented lambs than controls. Serum-cortisol concentrations were lower (p = 0.012) in the 30% supplemented lambs and free fatty acid concentrations were higher in the 10% and 20% supplemented lambs than in control lambs (p < 0.001). Supplementation with A. squarrosum decreased (p < 0.05) the area of adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but there was no difference between the 20% and 30% diets. Conversely, the area in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) increased (p < 0.05), especially for the 10% and 20% supplemented diets. Supplementation with A. squarrosum also enriched immune and anti-inflammatory related and lipid and glucose-metabolic pathways and associated differentially expressed gene expressions in adipose tissue. A total of 10 differential triacylglycerol, 34 differential phosphatidylcholines and seven differential phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the diet with 30% supplementation, when compared to the other diets. Finally, adipocyte-differentiation genes, and immune and inflammatory response-related gene expression levels decreased in lamb adipocytes cultured with an aqueous A. squarrosum extract. In conclusion, supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. A level of approximately 10% is recommended, but further research is required to determine the precise optimal level.

AB  - Few studies have examined shiftwork adaptation among police officers or potential differences in disease biomarkers among adapted and maladapted shiftworkers. This study characterized shiftwork adaptation among 430 police officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) study. Police officers working fixed night shifts with symptoms characteristic of adaptation and maladaptation were identified using latent class analysis (n = 242). Two approaches were applied, one with police-specific symptoms and another using more general symptoms as shiftwork adaptation indicators. Biomarkers of inflammation, heart rate variability, and cardiometabolic risk were then compared between shiftwork adaptation groups, and with officers working day shifts, after adjusting for confounding. When analyses included police-specific symptoms, maladapted shiftworkers (n = 73) had more self-reported stress, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and less social support than adapted shiftworkers (n = 169). Using more general symptoms, maladapted officers (n = 56) reported more stress and depression, and less social support than adapted officers (n = 186). In police-specific models, adjusted (least-squares) means (+/- standard error) of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in maladapted officers (0.8 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml]) were modestly elevated relative to adapted shiftworkers (0.7 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml], p = .09) and relative to permanent day workers (0.5 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml], p <= 0.01), and leptin levels in maladapted officers (9.6 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml]) exceeded those in the adapted (9.4 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml], p <= 0.01) and day shift groups (9.4 +/- 0.1 ln[pg/ml], p = .03). In the general model, adjusted mean tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations among maladapted officers (5.6 +/- 0.23 pg/ml) exceeded the adapted (4.8 +/- 0.2 pg/ml, p <= 0.01) and day workers (5.0 +/- 0.2 pg/ml, p = .04), and insulin among maladapted officers was higher (2.4 +/- 0.1 ln[uu/ml]) than the adapted group (1.8 +/- 0.1 ln[uu/ml], p = .03). No differences were observed for the other biomarkers. The results suggest that maladaptation among police officers working fixed night shifts may lead to increases in leptin, insulin, IL-6, and TNF-alpha; however, the cross-sectional design and possible residual confounding preclude interpretation of cause and effect. Prospective studies are planned to further characterize the relationship between shiftwork maladaptation and biomarkers of chronic disease risk in this police officer cohort.

AB  - The application of animal manures to cropland is an important nutrient recycling strategy in many parts of the world. Commonly, aggregated manure wastes contain chemical stressors including veterinary antimicrobials, heavy metals, and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that can stimulate the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While the presence of antimicrobials in manure is well-documented, the co-occurrence of other potentially impactful chemical stressors in swine manure remains underreported. This study quantifies and analyzes correlations between antimicrobials, metals, and certain ARGs present in manure samples from swine farms in Iowa, United States. Relationships between chemical stressors and different stages of swine production or feed composition are also investigated. Results revealed substantial levels of tetracyclines [up to 1,260 mu g g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) of manure for oxytetracycline] detected in all samples. Tiamulin, two ionophores (monensin and lasalocid), and one macrolide (tilmicosin) were detected at maximum class concentrations of 9.4, 0.547, and 0.472 mu g g(-1) d.w., respectively. The median relative abundances of ermB and tetM were 0.13 and 0.17 copies g(-1) wet weight (w.w.) manure (normalized to 16S gene), respectively. Additionally, high levels of copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) were detected in all samples, with maximum concentrations of 887, 1,900, and 2,100 mu g g(-1) d.w., respectively. Notably, uranium (U) was detected in 11 samples, at concentrations up to 0.77 mu g g(-1). A global analysis of AMR-stressor relationships using Spearman's rank correlation indicates Cu, and Ba are the most positively and significantly correlated with cytotoxic anhydrotetracycline (ATC) and/or anhydrochlortetracycline (ACTC) concentrations in all tested facilities (Cu-ATC: rho = 0.67, p = 0.0093; Cu-ACTC: rho = 0.75, p = 0.0022; Ba-ATC: rho = 0.84, p = 0.0002). Interestingly, ermB and tetM genes were strongly, positively correlated to each other (rho = 0.92, p < 0.0001), suggesting possible co-selection, despite the absence of correlation between ARGs and tetracycline concentrations. This study demonstrates the complexity of interactions between antimicrobials, metals, and ARGs in multiple manure storage pits prior to cropland application.

AB  - Simple Summary Gastrointestinal diseases are relatively common in pigs, and cause important economic losses. These disorders include, among others, swine dysentery, a severe diarrheal disease in growing and finisher pigs caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Flumequine, a fluoroquinolone indicated in the treatment of colibacillosis, enteritis and gastroenteritis, may help to minimize the impact of swine dysentery. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess flumequine concentrations in pig plasma, colon tissue and intestinal contents following oral administration through drinking water, and determine if it would be effective against the sensitive bacteria found in the colon. The drug was not detected in any plasma sample, while concentrations were higher on the days of treatment than after having finished it. Concentrations achieved in colon tissue and intestinal contents were lower than those effective against the most common intestinal pathogenic microorganisms in swine, including B. hyodysenteriae, suggesting that this dosage would not be effective. Flumequine concentrations in plasma, colon tissue and intestinal contents were evaluated in 12 healthy pigs after oral administration (12 mg/kg every 24 h for 5 consecutive days in drinking water). Plasma, colon tissue and intestinal content samples were collected from animals sacrificed on days 3, 6 and 7. Concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography after having validated the method, following the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements. The drug was not detected in any plasma sample. In colon tissue, concentrations were higher on day 3 (0.230 +/- 0.033 mu g/g, descending colon; 0.156 +/- 0.093 mu g/g, ascending colon) than on day 6 (0.187 +/- 0.123 mu g/g, descending colon; 0.107 +/- 0.007 mu g/g, ascending colon). Concentrations were considerably higher in intestinal contents, again on day 3 (1.349 +/- 1.401 mu g/g, descending colon; 0.591 +/- 0.209 mu g/g, ascending colon) than on days 6 (0.979 +/- 0.346 mu g/g, descending colon; 0.595 +/- 0.075 mu g/g, ascending colon) and 7 (0.247 +/- 0.172 mu g/g, descending colon; 0.172 +/- 0.086 mu g/g, ascending colon). Measured concentrations were lower than those effective against the most common intestinal pathogenic microorganisms in swine and, more specifically, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), as a kind of widely exerted environmental hazardous material, brings toxicity to both humans and animals. This study aimed to investigate the role of glutamine (Gln) in intestinal inflammation and micro -biota in BPA-challenged piglets. Thirty-two piglets were randomly divided into four groups according to 2 factors including BPA (0 vs. 0.1%) and Gln (0 vs. 1%) supplemented in basal diet for a 42-day feeding experiment. The results showed BPA exposure impaired piglet growth, induced intestinal inflammation and disturbed microbiota balance. However, dietary Gln supplementation improved the growth performance, while decreasing serum pro -inflammatory cytokine levels in BPA-challenged piglets. In addition, Gln attenuated intestinal mucosal damage and inflammation by normalizing the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-p38/MAPK-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway caused by BPA. Moreover, dietary Gln supplementation decreased the abundance of Actino-bacteriota and Proteobacteria, and attenuated the decreased abundance of Roseburia, Prevotella, Romboutsia and Phascolarctobacterium and the content of short-chain fatty acids in cecum contents caused by BPA exposure. Moreover, there exerted potential relevance between the gut microbiota and pro-inflammatory cytokines and cecal short-chain fatty acids. In conclusion, Gln is critical nutrition for attenuating BPA-induced intestinal inflammation, which is partially mediated by regulating microbial balance and suppressing the TLR4/p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling.

AB  - "Human-elephant conflict (HEC)", the alarming issue, in present day context has attracted the attention of environmentalists and policy makers. The rising conflict between human beings and wild elephants is common in Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR) and its adjoining area in West Bengal State, India, making the area volatile. People's attitudes towards elephant conservation activity are very crucial to get rid of HEC, because people's proximity with wild elephants' habitat can trigger the occurrence of HEC. The aim of this study is to conduct an in-depth investigation about the association of people's attitudes towards HEC with their locational, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics in BTR and its adjoining area by using Pearson's bivariate chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. BTR is one of the constituent parts of Eastern Doors Elephant Reserve (EDER). We interviewed 500 respondents to understand their perceptions to HEC and investigated their locational, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics including location of village, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, caste, poverty level, education level, primary occupation, secondary occupation, household type, and source of firewood. The results indicate that respondents who are living in enclave forest villages (EFVs), peripheral forest villages (PFVs), corridor village (CVs), or forest and corridor villages (FCVs), mainly males, at the age of 18-48 years old, engaged with agriculture occupation, and living in kancha and mixed houses, have more likelihood to witness HEC. Besides, respondents who are illiterate or at primary education level are more likely to regard elephant as a main problematic animal around their villages and refuse to participate in elephant conservation activity. For the sake of a sustainable environment for both human beings and wildlife, people's attitudes towards elephants must be friendly in a more prudent way, so that the two communities can live in harmony.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the past three decades, sows' litter sizes have been increased to improve productivity, but have also led to increased proportions of (very) low birth weight piglets, and consequently, higher pre-weaning mortality. One possible intervention to counter the increased mortality is supplementing a milk replacer. This study aimed to determine if the performance of low birth weight piglets can be improved by drenching a dense, concentrated milk replacer and whether the frequency of drenching and the severity of the low birth weight played a role. Secondly, this study compared the supplementation of the same milk replacer at two farms with different perinatal management. No effect of drenching a dense milk replacer on the survival or performance of (very) low birth weight piglets was observed, regardless of farm and, apparently, of the applied management. However, mortality rates were lower at the farm with a higher level of perinatal management, suggesting that high-quality care might have more effect on the survival of small piglets than drenching a dense milk replacer. Introducing hyperprolific sows has led to proportionally more (very) low birth weight ((V)LBW) piglets, accompanied by higher mortality. To improve the survival of (V)LBW piglets, drenching a dense milk replacer (DMR) could be applied. A first experiment evaluated the effect of drenching DMR (1 or 3 doses within 24 h after birth) to LBW ((mean litter birth weight - 1*SD) and weighing between 1 kg and 750 g) and VLBW piglets ((mean litter birth weight - 1.5*SD) and weighing less than 750 g). On days 1, 2, 3, 9, and two days post-weaning, body weight, growth, skin lesions, and mortality were monitored. No effect of DMR was observed on any of the parameters. In a second experiment, LBW piglets were supplemented with DMR (similarly to experiment 1) at two farms differing in the level of perinatal care. The same parameters were evaluated, and again none were affected by drenching DMR. Overall survival of the LBW piglets was significantly higher at the farm with high perinatal care. It can be concluded that good perinatal management is more effective in enhancing the survival of LBW piglets than drenching.

AB  - Mammalian spermatozoa undergo a series of physiological and biochemical changes in the oviduct that lead them to acquire the ability to fertilize eggs. During their transit in the oviduct, spermatozoa face a series of environmental changes that can affect sperm viability. A series of ion channels and transporters, as well as the sperm cytoskeleton, allow spermatozoa to remain viable and functional. Cl- channels such as TMEM16A (calcium-activated chloride channel), CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), and ClC3 (chloride voltage-gated channel 3) are some of the ion transporters involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. They are expressed in mammalian spermatozoa and are associated with capacitation, acrosomal reaction, and motility. However, little is known about their role in maintaining sperm volume. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the mechanism through which TMEM16A maintains sperm volume during capacitation. The effects of TMEM16A were compared to those of CFTR and ClC3. Spermatozoa were capacitated in the presence of specific TMEM16A, CFTR, and ClC3 inhibitors, and the results showed that only TMEM16A inhibition increased acrosomal volume, leading to changes within the acrosome. Similarly, only TMEM16A inhibition prevented actin polymerization during capacitation. Further analysis showed that TMEM16A inhibition also prevented ERK1/2 and RhoA activation. On the other hand, TMEM16A and CFTR inhibition affected both capacitation and spontaneous acrosomal reaction, whereas ClC3 inhibition only affected the spontaneous acrosomal reaction. In conclusion, during capacitation, TMEM16A activity regulates acrosomal structure through actin polymerization and by regulating ERK1/2 and RhoA activities.

AB  - Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. Currently, the treatment has limited effectiveness and high toxicity, is expensive, requires long-term treatment, induces significant side effects, and promotes drug resistance. Thus, new therapeutic strategies must be developed to find alternative compounds with high efficiency and low cost. Solidagenone (SOL), one of the main constituents of Solidago chilensis, has shown gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
   Purpose: This study assessed the in vitro effect of SOL on promastigotes and Leishmania amazonensis-infected macrophages, as well its microbicide and immunomodulatory mechanisms.
   Methods: SOL was isolated from the roots of S. chilensis, 98% purity, and identified by chromatographic methods, and the effect of SOL on leishmanicidal activity against promastigotes in vitro, SOL-induced cytotoxicity in THP-1, J774 cells, sheep erythrocytes, and L. amazonensis-infected J774 macrophages, and the mechanisms of death involved in this action were evaluated.
   Results: In silico predictions showed good drug-likeness potential for SOL with high oral bioavailability and intestinal absorption. SOL treatment (10-160 mu M) inhibited promastigote proliferation 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. After 24 h of treatment, SOL at the IC50 (34.5 mu M) and 2 x the IC50 (69 mu M) induced several morphological and ultrastructural changes in promastigotes, altered the cell cycle and cellular volume, increased phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface, induced the loss of plasma membrane integrity, increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, induced loss of mitochondrial integrity (characterized by an apoptosis-like process), and increased the number of lipid droplets and autophagic vacuoles. Additionally, SOL induced low cytotoxicity in J774 murine macrophages (CC50 of 1587 mu M), THP-1 human monocytes (CC50 of 1321 mu M), and sheep erythrocytes. SOL treatment reduced the percentage of L. amazonensis-infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes per macrophage (IC50 9.5 mu M), reduced TNF-alpha production and increased IL-12p70, ROS and nitric oxide (NO) levels.
   Conclusion: SOL showed in vitro leishmanicidal effects against the promastigotes by apoptosis-like mechanism and amastigotes by reducing TNF-alpha and increasing IL-12p70, ROS, and NO levels, suggesting their potential as a candidate for use in further studies on the design of antileishmanial drugs.

AB  - Low temperatures are a major abiotic stress factor that adversely affects the growth, development, and productivity of tea plants. Soluble sugars play a critical role in enhancing tea plants' resistance to cold stress. However, the mechanisms by which tea plants perceive and transmit sugar signals remain poorly understood. In this study, the transcription of CsHXK4, a type B hexokinase (HXK) gene in tea plants, was significantly upregulated by low temperatures and glucose signaling. CsHXK4 exhibited multiple subcellular localizations, particularly in the nucleus and mitochondria, and was ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with predominant expression in younger organs. Hexose phosphorylation analysis using the HXK-deficient yeast triple mutant YSH7.4-3C demonstrated that CsHXK4 functions as a hexokinase with catalytic activity. Overexpression (OE) of CsHXK4 in Arabidopsis resulted in hypersensitivity to glucose, suggesting its role in sugar signal transduction. Furthermore, CsHXK4-OE Arabidopsis plants exhibited enhanced cold tolerance compared to wild-type plants, as evidenced by increased photosynthetic capacity, elevated sugar content, and stable cell membrane permeability. Transient induction of CsHXK4 expression in tea leaves improved freezing tolerance and activated the expression of cold-responsive marker genes, including CsCBF1/2/3/4, CsKIN2.2, CsCOR413, CsLEA14, and CsGOLS1, compared to the empty vector control. Overall, our findings reveal that CsHXK4 positively regulates cold resistance in tea plants by mediating sugar signaling and CBF signaling pathways.

AB  - Pathogen infection in host plants can alter the attraction and adaptability of herbivorous insects. Female adult insects often exhibit selective behaviours based on their environmental experiences, enabling their offspring to avoid adverse conditions and ensuring healthy growth and development. However, comprehensive studies integrating both the perspectives of offspring fitness and host plant to validate the selective significance of such parental 'Mother knows worst' experiences remain limited. Building on our previous findings that female Conogethes punctiferalis (Yellow peach moth, YPM) adults exhibit oviposition avoidance behaviour towards corn infected with Trichoderma asperellum, we further confirmed that corn infected by T. asperellum significantly inhibits the growth and development of YPM larvae. Feeding on infected corn decreases larval gut microbiota diversity, core microbiota abundance and led to differential expression of key genes in juvenile hormone metabolic pathway. Moreover, the content of flavonoid wogonin, a secondary metabolite, was significantly increased in infected corn. In vitro feeding experiments revealed that wogonin negatively impacts YPM larval growth by causing the juvenile hormone accumulation and suppressing the abundance of core gut microbial strains. This study validates the adaptive significance of parental empiricism from the perspective of offspring, while further elucidating the mechanisms by which microbial-mediated plant resistance against insects, as well as for exploring and utilizing effective biocontrol resources against YPMs.

AB  - With the help of in-body antennas, the wireless communication among the implantable medical devices (IMDs) and exterior monitoring equipment, the telemetry system has brought us many benefits. Thus, a very thin-profile circularly polarized (CP) in-body antenna, functioning in ISM band at 2.45 GHz, is proposed. A tapered coplanar waveguide (CPW) method is used to excite the antenna. The radiator contains a pentagonal shape with five horizontal slits inside to obtain a circular polarization behavior. A bendable Roger Duroid RT5880 material (epsilon(r) = 2.2, tan delta = 0.0009) with a typical 0.25 mm-thickness is used as a substrate. The proposed antenna has a total volume of 21x13x0.25 mm(3). The antenna covers up a bandwidth of 2.38 to 2.53 GHz (150 MHz) in vacuum, while in skin tissue it covers 1.56 to 2.72 GHz (1.16 GHz) and in the muscle tissue covers 2.16 to 3.17 GHz (1.01 GHz). GHz). The flexion analysis in the x and y axes was also performed in simulation as the proposed antenna works with a wider bandwidth in the skin and muscle tissue. The simulation and the curved antenna measurements turned out to be in good agreement. The impedance bandwidth of -10 dB and the axis ratio bandwidth of 3 dB (AR) are measured on the skin and imitative gel of the pig at 27.78% and 35.5%, 13.5% and 4.9%, respectively, at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The simulations revealed that the specific absorption rate (SAR) in the skin is 0.634 and 0.914 W/kg in muscle on 1g-tissue. The recommended SAR values are below the limits set by the federal communications commission (FCC). Finally, the proposed low-profile implantable antenna has achieved very compact size, flexibility, lower SAR values, high gain, higher impedance and axis ratio bandwidths in the skin and muscle tissues of the human body. This antenna is smaller in size and a good applicant for application in medical implants.

AB  - Background: We recently reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling via the TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors mediates the effects of long-term exercise on locomotion, cognition and anxiety, but not depressive-like behavior. We now investigated whether the TNF signaling via its receptors also mediates the effects of short-term exercise on cognition, anxiety and depressive-like behaviors.
   Methods: Thirteen-month-old C57BL/6 (WT), TNF-/-, TNFR1- /-, and TNFR2-/- mice were provided with 4 weeks of voluntary wheel running followed by behavioral testing using an established behavioral battery. Each genotype had a respective non-exercise control.
   Results: There was no interaction between genotype and exercise in any of the tests but the main effect of genotype, and not exercise, were found to be significant in the open field (OF), forced-swim test (FST) and Barnes maze (BM). In the OF, the control and exercise TNFR2-/- mice spent significantly less time in the inner zone than mice in the control and exercise WT and TNF-/- cohorts. In the FST, control and exercise WT mice showed significantly higher immobility time than their control and exercise TNF-/-, TNFR1-/- and TNFR2- /- cohorts. In the BM, the latency to escape over 4 days of training was significantly higher in all KO groups compared to WT, irrespective of exercise. Also, the latency to escape to the original location during the probe trial was higher for control and exercise WT compared to corresponding TNFR1-/- mice. In contrast, the latency to escape to the new location was lower for control and exercise WT compared to control and exercise TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/mice. The latency to escape to the new location in exercise groups was longer compared to control within all genotypes.
   Conclusion: While TNF signaling via the TNF receptors mediates cognition, anxiety and depressive-like behaviors independently, it does not mediate the effects of short-term exercise on these behaviors in middle-aged mice.

AB  - Tea leaf spot, caused by Didymella segeticola, is an important disease which negatively affects the productivity and the quality of tea leaves. During infection by the pathogen, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) from tea leaves could contribute to achieving pathogenicity. In this study, circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), constituting ceRNAs, which share binding sites on microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from infected and uninfected leaves of tea (Camellia sinensis 'Fuding-dabaicha') were sequenced and analyzed, and the identity and expression levels of the target genes of miRNA-mRNA and miRNA-lncRNA/circRNA were predicted. Analysis indicated that 10 mRNAs were bound by 20 miRNAs, 66 lncRNAs were bound by 40 miRNAs, and 17 circRNAs were bound by 29 miRNAs, respectively. For the regulation modes of ceRNAs, five ceRNA pairs were identified by the correlation analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA. For instance, expression of the xyloglucan endotransglycosylase gene in infected leaves was downregulated at the level of mRNA through miRNA PC-5p-3511474_3 binding with lncRNA TEA024202.1:MSTRG.37074.1. Gene annotation indicated that expression of this gene was significantly enriched in cell wall biogenesis and in the pathway of plant hormone signal transduction. The functional analysis of ceRNAs isolated from infected tea leaves will provide a valuable resource for future research on D. segeticola pathogenicity.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with taurine (TAU) on the meat quality, muscle fiber type, and mitochondrial function of finishing pigs. The results demonstrated that TAU significantly increased the alpha* value while decreasing b*(45 min), L*(24 h), and drip loss(24 h) and drip loss(24 h) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. Dietary supplemented with TAU reduced the content of lactate and the glycolytic potential (GP) in the LD muscle. Dietary supplemented with TAU enhanced the oxidative fiber-related gene expression as well as increased succinic dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase activities while reducing lactate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with TAU increased the contents of mtDNA and ATP and mitochondrial function-related gene expression. Moreover, TAU enhanced the mRNA expressions of calcineurin (CaN) and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and protein expressions of CNA and NFATc1. The results indicate that dietary TAU supplementation improves meat quality and mitochondrial biogenesis and function and promotes muscle fiber-type conversion from the glycolytic fiber to the oxidative fiber via the CaN/NFATc1 pathway.

AB  - Glucosinolates (GSLs) are nitrogen/sulfur-containing glycosides widely present in the order of Brassicales, particularly in the Brassicaceae family. Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an oilseed plant belonging to this family. Its seeds, in addition to a distinctive fatty acid composition, contain three aliphatic GSLs: glucoarabin, glucocamelinin, and homoglucocamelinin. Our study explored the impact of these GSLs purified from Camelina press cake, a by-product of Camelina oil production, on yeast chronological aging, which is the established model for simulating the aging of post-mitotic quiescent mammalian cells. Supplementing yeast cells with GSLs extends the chronological lifespan (CLS) in a dose-dependent manner. This enhancement relies on an improved mitochondrial respiration efficiency, resulting in a drastic decrease of superoxide anion levels and an increase in ATP production. Furthermore, GSL supplementation affects carbon metabolism. In particular, GSLs support the pro-longevity preservation of TCA cycle enzymatic activities and enhanced glycerol catabolism. These changes contribute positively to the phosphorylating respiration and to an increase in trehalose storage: both of which are longevity-promoting prerequisites.

AB  - Developing red-phosphors with outstanding chemical and luminescent stability is essential for fabricating phosphor-in-glass (PiG) for the next-generation solid-state lighting source because the currently commercial silica red phosphor easily suffers from corrosion by glass melt. Herein, we report the discovery of an enhanced red-emitting aluminate phosphor of Mn4+/Ca2+ co-doped YAG (YAGMC) using a full-solution combustion approach. This phosphor exhibits two broad excitation bands with an optimum doping level of only 0.2 at%. Under 470 nm light excitation, the emission intensity of YAGMC is greatly enhanced by 7 times compared with that of phosphor without Ca2+. Both Stokes and anti-Stokes bands are identified as originating from the same luminescence dynamic process. By performing a theoretical simulation, the predominant phonon in the vibronic process is determined to be 25 meV in energy. Temperature-dependent PL spectra exhibit excellent thermal stability at T < 260 K, while a serious thermal quenching phenomenon occurs at high temperatures. Finally, the YAGMC-based PiG is fabricated for constructing an LED device, and the measured results reveal a significant effect of PiG on luminous performance. From both experimental and theoretical viewpoints, our study demonstrates an efficient approach to enhancing red emission by a co-doping approach and provides a deep insight into the internal photophysical mechanism for YAGMC red phosphor.

AB  - Mathematical models are a helpful tool that can help palaeoecology research advance in similar ways as the ones already used in theoretical ecology. In this article, we use a mathematical model based on differential equations to estimate the past Mammuthus columbi population in the Valsequillo Basin, Puebla, Mexico. We calibrated the model based on the biological and etiologic parameters of the African elephant Loxodonta africana. In addition to the mean population, the analysis allows inferring the population dynamics of the M. columbi on the Valsequillo Basin. The model is based on the ecological interactions between M. columbi and its food resource. It was found that the population must have been oscillating before an equilibrium was reached. Several potential scenarios based on on-site food production (grass) are here analysed. It was found that a good efficiency of the M. columbi to find food can lead to recurrent cycles of abundance and famine. In this situation, the M. columbi populations must have emigrate and then immigrate in periodic circles to avoid starvation.

AB  - In Roman times, the brown bear (Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758) was one of the most important hunted wild animal species. Bears were killed for e.g. their furs, their teeth and their meat. One of the reasons for catching bears alive was for their use in the context of public entertainment, i.e., animal hunts in amphitheatres. Bear bones from the Roman settlement of Augusta Raurica, NW Switzerland, attest the tradition of hunting (or trading?) bears in this part of the Roman Empire. Archaeozoological investigations of several complete bear skeletons from this site indicated that at least one bear was kept in captivity for some period. The remains of four bears, deposited in two wells, were selected for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to explore whether life (stages) in captivity had an impact on the diets and in consequence to the stable isotope ratios in bear bone collagen. A comparison with (herbivorous) horses and (omni-)carnivorous dogs from the same Roman city and with bears from other prehistoric and modern contexts indicates that the diet of the adult brown bear specimen from Augusta Raurica was plant-based and does not provide evidence of human-influenced feeding in (prolonged) captivity. Nitrogen enrichment in the young bears is most likely explained by suckling. Human-influenced additional feeding in captivity cannot be completely ruled out but the enrichment results from stable isotope data from wild brown bear data from the literature and from dogs and equids from the same site argue suggest that this was not taking place.

A total of seven species were recorded, with Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart in Webb and Berthelot, 1839) representing a new record for the fauna of Romania. To the best of the authors' knowledge, many of the parasite-host associations are new and are previously unpublished. In addition, a graphical network illustrating these associations is provided. This network highlights the frequency and diversity of host-parasite interactions across the study sites. The recorded phoresis of Guimaraesiella (Mallophaga) on Ornithomya avicularia (Linnaeus, 1758) and the hyperparasites Hemimyialges macdonaldi (Evans et al., 1963) and Myialges anchora Sergent and Trouessart, 1907 (both Acariformes: Epidermoptidae) on Ornithoica turdi (Olivier in Latreille, 1811) are newly documented in Romania.

AB  - Extensive research provides evidence that neuroinflammation underlies numerous brain disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators determine synaptic and cognitive dysfunction occurring in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) are far from being fully understood. Here we investigated the role of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and the molecular cascade downstream the activation of its receptor, to the synaptic dysfunction occurring in the mouse model of multiple Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) reactivations within the brain. These mice are characterized by neuroinflammation and memory deficits associated with a progressive accumulation of neurodegenerative hallmarks (e.g., amyloid-beta protein and tau hyperphosphorylation). Here we show that mice undergone two HSV-1 reactivations in the brain exhibited increased levels of IL-1 beta along with significant alterations of: (1) cognitive performances; (2) hippocampal long-term potentiation; (3) expression synaptic-related genes and pre- and post-synaptic proteins; (4) dendritic spine density and morphology. These effects correlated with activation of the epigenetic repressor MeCP2 that, in association with HDAC4, affected the expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes. Specifically, in response to HSV-1 infection, HDAC4 accumulated in the nucleus and promoted MeCP2 SUMOylation that is a post-translational modification critically affecting the repressive activity of MeCP2. The blockade of IL-1 receptors by the specific antagonist Anakinra prevented the MeCP2 increase and the consequent downregulation of gene expression along with rescuing structural and functional indices of neurodegeneration. Collectively, our findings provide novel mechanistic evidence on the role played by HSV-1-activated IL-1 beta signaling pathways in synaptic deficits leading to cognitive impairment.

AB  - Xinyang Maojian (XYMJ) tea is one of the world's most popular green teas; the development of new sprouts directly affects the yield and quality of tea products, especially for XYMJ, which has hairy tips. Here, we used transcriptome and small RNA sequencing to identify mRNAs and miRNAs, respectively, involved in regulating leaf development in different plant tissues (bud, leaf, and stem). We identified a total of 381 conserved miRNAs. Given that no genomic data for XYMJ green tea are available, we compared the sequencing data for XYMJ green tea with genomic data from a closely related species (Tieguanyin) and the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis database; we identified a total of 506 and 485 novel miRNAs, respectively. We also identified 11 sequence-identical novel miRNAs in the tissues of XYMJ tea plants. Correlation analyses revealed 97 miRNA-mRNA pairs involved in leaf growth and development; the csn-miR319-2/csnTCP2 and miR159-csnMYB modules were found to be involved in leaf development in XYMJ green tea. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate the expression levels of the miRNAs and mRNAs. The miRNAs and target genes identified in this study might shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of leaf development in tea plants.

AB  - At present, there lacks a definitive pharmaceutical intervention or therapeutic approach for diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Herein, we delved into the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function in high-fat diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice and underlying mechanisms. Hippocampal insulin resistance was determined by western blot analysis. Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. The morphology of the hippocampal neurons was observed through hematoxylin & eosin staining and Nissl staining. Synaptic plasticity was assessed by western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot and real-time PCR were employed to detect the levels of ferroptosis markers, autophagy markers, and netrin-1. Electroacupuncture treatment exhibited ameliorative outcomes on hippocampal insulin resistance, spatial learning, memory function, neuronal damage, and synaptic plasticity in T2DM mice. Furthermore, it effectively suppressed neuronal ferroptosis in the hippocampus by upregulating GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression, and reducing 4-HNE expression. Meanwhile, electroacupuncture intervention increased the levels of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I, as well as decreased the levels of p62 and phosphorylated-mTOR in the hippocampus of T2DM mice, suggesting that electroacupuncture facilitated autophagy activation by inhibiting mTOR activity. 3-MA-mediated autophagy inhibition undermined the beneficial effects of electroacupuncture on neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive deficits in T2DM mice. Additionally, the beneficial effects of electroacupuncture on autophagy and ferroptosis was achieved by upregulation of netrin-1 in the hippocampus. Our study revealed that electroacupuncture therapy inhibited neuronal ferroptosis via the activation of autophagy, thereby ameliorating cognitive deficits in T2DM mice.

AB  - Background: One of the hallmarks of Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the overexpression of IL-13, which may influence the proliferation and differentiation of nasal epithelial basal cells. However, the pathway is not clear enough, and the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway is related to cell growth. This study was trying to explore if IL-13 could impact nasal epithelial basal cells through the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway.Methods: PCR, western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to compare the difference between IL-13 and the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway-related molecules expression level between the healthy control (HC) and CRSwNP groups. WB, 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine staining, and Immunofluorescent (IF) were performed on human nasal epithelial progenitor cells (HNEPCs) to detect the proliferation ability under the effect of IL-13. In addition, qRT-PCR, WB, and IF were used to detect the differentiation ability with the stimulation of IL-13 in the air-liquid interface (ALI) system.Results: The expression of IL-13, mTOR/p70S6K1-related molecules, and proliferation-related molecules Ki67, CDK2, and cyclin E1 were upregulated in CRSwNP compared to HC. In HNEPCs, IL-13 could stimulate nasal epithelial cells proliferating through the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway, and this phenomenon could be inhibited when mTOR (with rapamycin) and S6K1 (with PF-4708671) were blocked. In the ALI system, the effect of IL-13 added in the proliferation phase could persist in the proliferation and differentiation stage, affecting the nasal epithelial progenitor/stem cells' irregular differentiation.Conclusion: IL-13 may affect the proliferation and differentiation of nasal epithelial progenitor/stem cells through the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway, which may affect the development of nasal polyps.

AB  - Simple Summary COVID-19 related symptoms and severity of infection vary greatly among individuals and altho mu gh various factors including age, gender, obesity, and underlying co-morbidities are s mu ggested to be the confounding variables that affect the severity of disease, a small percentage of apparently healthy and young people also succumb to disease, this was especially true before the COVID-19 vaccines were developed. Recently, few studies have s mu ggested that COVID-19 severity is lower in individuals who followed a plant based and pescatarian diet. Aim of the current study was to examine whether symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients can be predictive of mild and long-term disease pre-vaccination and if the intake of specific nutrients as well as serum 25(OH)D concentrations are related to the severity of symptoms experienced by individuals. Additionally, we performed longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis on antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 to examine the duration and degree of protection conferred by natural immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found several nutrients such as vitamin E, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, and fibre amongst others to be possibly linked to a reduced COVID-19 severity. The heterogeneity of the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 experienced by the young and healthy individuals is poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to mainly examine whether the respective diets and the type of symptoms experienced by patients are predictive of having long COVID-19. Disease severity was assessed with a symptomatology questionnaire and used to group 55 participants in asymptomatic (AS), mild symptoms (S) and long COVID (LC). We found that experiencing a higher number of symptoms as well as fatigue were predictors of developing LC whereas those who experienced rhinorrhea were less likely to develop LC. Blood samples were also taken to measure vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and duration of spike IgG antibodies. In this study, serum 25(OH)D was not significantly different between 3 symptom groups with median (IQR) ng/mL levels of 22.0 (12.3) in the AS, 22.3 (7.5) in S, and 24.9 (9.4) in the LC group (p >= 0.05). The duration of IgG antibody response was found to vary greatly, with some individuals showing raised IgG over a year after infection. To examine whether dietary factors can influence the severity of symptoms, diet was analysed using 4-7-day food diaries as well as a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Some nutrients such as vitamin E, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibre, and iron were associated with lower severity of COVID-19. Lower intake of vitamin E was associated with having LC with a median (IQR) intake of 6.2 mg (3.8) seen in LC vs. 8.6 mg (7.2) in the AS group (p = 0.047). This pilot study has highlighted a few differences in the number and type of symptoms experienced by the young non-hospitalised individuals with mild and long COVID-19 and identified a few dietary components for their potential protective role against long COVID-19, however, the findings need to be confirmed with further large scale studies.

AB  - Exosome microRNAs are vital for gene transcription and expression, influencing target genes. They may play direct and indirect roles in pregnancy across animal models and humans. The objective of this research was to comprehensively explore the expression profiles of plasma exosomal miRNAs during the early pregnancy stage in sheep. This study specifically delved into the differences in the expression of plasma exosomal miRNAs between Chinese Merino and Suffolk sheep. The primary focus was on clearly elucidating the changes in plasma exosomal miRNAs, pinpointing potential biomarkers that might exert an impact on early pregnancy, and thoroughly exploring their biological functions as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Chinese Merino and Suffolk sheep were divided into two groups of 20 for artificial insemination. Blood samples were collected at various pregnancy stages (day 0, day 14, and day 30), Ultrasound diagnosis was carried out five weeks following artificial insemination. Three pregnant sheep from each group were selected for isolating extracellular vesicle-derived miRNAs from plasma. High-throughput sequencing identified differentially expressed miRNAs, and their target genes were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. In plasma exosomal samples derived from all sheep of both breeds at various time points during the early pregnancy stage, a cumulative total of 80 known miRNAs and 182 novel miRNAs were successfully identified. Compared to day 0 gestation controls, both sheep breeds showed differential expression of six known miRNAs: four were up- regulated and two down- regulated. Pathway analysis linked these miRNAs to biological processes such as ECM receptor interactions, growth hormone synthesis, carbohydrate digestion, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and MAPK signaling regulation. Notably, Oar-mir-27a differed between the two groups at various time points. In summary, this research meticulously carried out a profiling analysis of the expression of plasma exosomal miRNAs in Chinese Merino and Suffolk sheep. Through this analysis, several exosomal miRNAs were identified, which display distinct abundance levels during the early pregnancy period. These

AB  - Simple Summary Insufficient energy and nutrient ingestion of primiparous lactating sows causes excess body weight loss and oxidative stress and compromises piglet growth. Two strategies to enhance the daily intake of dietary energy and nutrients were compared with a standard lactation diet to understand the potential modes of action. We found that feeding on either high-quality or flavor plus multi-enzyme diets both improved sow feed digestibility and consequently increased the growth of piglets. In addition, the flavor plus multi-enzyme diet also improved the antioxidant capacity and health of sows. The data suggest that dietary supplementation with flavor and multi-enzymes may be more promising than a high-quality diet from a health and economic perspective like enhancing utilization of cereal byproducts and thus reducing expenditure of corn and soybeans. This study was aimed to explore how a high-quality diet or a flavor plus multi-enzyme diet affects the feed intake, nutrient digestibility and antioxidation capacity of lactating sows and the growth of their progeny. Thirty primiparous sows were randomly assigned to three treatments from d 2 of lactation until weaning (d 21): control (CON), with a basal diet; high quality (HQ), with 200 kcal/kg higher net energy than CON; or the CON diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg flavor and 100 mg/kg multi-enzymes (F + E). Sows fed with the HQ or F + E diets improved piglets' live weight (p < 0.05) and average daily weight gain (p < 0.10), litter weight gain (p < 0.10) and piglet growth to milk yield ratio (p < 0.10). Compared with CON, the HQ and F + E groups increased the digestibility of ether extract, ash, neutral detergent fiber, crude fiber and phosphorus (p < 0.10), and the HQ group also increased dry matter, gross energy, crude protein, acid detergent fiber and energy intake (p < 0.05). Compared with CON, the F + E group decreased serum urea nitrogen and aspartate aminotransferase (p < 0.05) and enhanced superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, but it decreased malondialdehyde in milk supernatant (p < 0.05).

AB  - A vast array of herbivorous arthropods live with symbiotic microorganisms. However, little is known about the nature and functional mechanism of bacterial effects on plant defense responses towards herbivores. We explored the role of microbes present in extracts of oral secretion (OS) isolated from larvae of Spodoptera litura, a generalist herbivore, in phytohormone signaling-dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). In response to mechanical damage (MD) with application of bacteria-free OS (OS-) prepared by sterilization or filtration of OS, Arabidopsis leaves exhibited enhanced de novo synthesis of oxylipins, and induction of transcript abundance of the responsible genes, in comparison to those in leaves with MD + nonsterilized OS (OS+), indicating that OS bacteria serve as suppressors of these genes. By contrast, de novo synthesis/signaling of salicylic acid and signaling of abscisic acid were enhanced by OS bacteria. These signaling networks were cross-regulated by each other. Meta-analysis of OS bacteria identified 70 bacterial strains. Among them was Staphylococcus epidermidis, an anaerobic staphylococcus that was shown to contribute to the suppression/manipulation of phytohormone-dependent plant defense signaling. The presence of OS bacteria was consequently beneficial for S. litura larvae hosted by Brassicaceae.

AB  - The myometrium is the outer layer of the uterus. Its contraction and steroidogenic activities are required for embryo implantation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions remain unknown in pigs. The myometrium includes the inner circular muscle (CM) and the outer longitudinal muscle (LM) layers. In this study, we collected the CM and LM samples from the mesometrial side (named M) of the uterus on days 12 (pre-implantation stage) and 15 (implantation stage) of pregnancy and day 15 of the estrous cycle. The transcriptomic results revealed distinct differences between the uterine CM and LM layers in early pregnancy: the genes expressed in the LM layer were mainly related to contraction pathways, whereas the transcriptional signatures in the CM layer on day 15 of pregnancy were primarily involved in the immune response processes. Subsequent comparisons in the CM layer between pregnant and cyclic gilts show that the transcriptional signatures of the CM layer are implantation-dependent. Next, we investigated the genome-wide profiling of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in pig uterine CM and LM layers. The genomic regions that had transcriptional activity and were associated with the expression of genes in the two layers were characterized. Taken together, the regulatory regions identified in the study may contribute to modulating the gene expression in pig uterine CM and LM layers during implantation.

AB  - The clinical effectiveness of Oxiris (R), particularly in reducing cytokines, remains uncertain due to the limited data provided. This study explored and analyzed the application value of Oxiris (R) endotoxin adsorption technology in a large animal model. Pigs received an intravenous LPS infusion. Six animals were treated 2 h after the infusion with an Oxiris (R) hemadsorption using a pumpless extracorporeal technique for 6 h. Five animals served as controls. Cardiocirculatory parameters, hyperspectral analysis, and a panel of cytokines were measured. The lipopolysaccharide infusion induced sepsis-like inflammation with tachycardia, elevated pulmonary pressure, elevated lactate level, as well as elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, increases of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1ra and IL-10 were found. After 3 and 6 h in both groups, pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced. No differences between the intervention and the control group could be detected after 3 and 6 h for IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, suggesting no effect of the Oxiris (R) filter on the elimination of elevated cytokines with a pumpless extracorporeal hemadsorption technique. The presented large animal model may be a promising option for studying the effects of hemadsorption techniques.

AB  - Stress can have long-lasting impacts on plants. Here we report the long-term effects of the stress hormone jasmonic acid (JA) on the defence phenotype, transcriptome and DNA methylome of Arabidopsis. Three weeks after transient JA signalling, 5-week-old plants retained induced resistance (IR) against herbivory but showed increased susceptibility to pathogens. Transcriptome analysis revealed long-term priming and/or upregulation of JA-dependent defence genes but repression of ethylene- and salicylic acid-dependent genes. Long-term JA-IR was associated with shifts in glucosinolate composition and required MYC2/3/4 transcription factors, RNA-directed DNA methylation, the DNA demethylase ROS1 and the small RNA (sRNA)-binding protein AGO1. Although methylome analysis did not reveal consistent changes in DNA methylation near MYC2/3/4-controlled genes, JA-treated plants were specifically enriched with hypomethylated ATREP2 transposable elements (TEs). Epigenomic characterization of mutants and transgenic lines revealed that ATREP2 TEs are regulated by RdDM and ROS1 and produce 21 nt sRNAs that bind to nuclear AGO1. Since ATREP2 TEs are enriched with sequences from IR-related defence genes, our results suggest that AGO1-associated sRNAs from hypomethylated ATREP2 TEs trans-regulate long-lasting memory of JA-dependent immunity.

AB  - Due to the content of active ingredients, teas can be used prophylactically, but most of all they are consumed for taste reasons. As with food or water, these products can be contaminated with heavy metals, including mercury. Mercury (Hg) is a toxic element, it causes many side effects in the human body depending on the form of Hg, which can include respiratory failure, kidney damage, neurological disorders. At the cellular level, Hg and its compounds lead to a disturbance of metabolism and cell death. The aim of the study was to evaluate the mercury concentration of tea (Camellia sinensis) and Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis). Eighty-six samples were collected and analyzed, including the following kinds: black, green, white, Pu-erh, and Yerba Mate. The samples came from Poland. The Hg concentration was determined with an AMA 254 atomic absorption spectrometer. The study showed that the Hg content in each tea sample averaged 2.47 mu g/kg. The Hg concentration in the tested types of tea differed significantly statistically (p = 0.000). It was the largest in Yerba Mate, followed by green, Pu-erh, and white tea, and was the smallest in black tea. Statistically significant differences in the Hg content (p = 0.004) were also dependent on the form of the product; in leaf tea samples, the concentration of Hg (2.54 mu g/kg) was higher than in tea bags (1.16 mu g/kg). The Hg concentration determined in the tested samples does not exceed the permitted EU standard. Consuming these teas poses no health risk in terms of the amount of Hg.

AB  - Physalis floridana Rydb., a member of the Solanaceae family, is renowned for its diverse secondary metabolites, including physalins and withanolides. The 28-spotted ladybird beetle (Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata) is a notorious pest severely damaging Solanaceous crops. This study demonstrates that P. floridana Rydb. significantly impacts on the development and reproductive suppression of H. vigintioctopunctata. A comparative transcriptome analysis was performed by feeding H. vigintioctopunctata larvae on P. floridana Rydb., Solanum nigrum L., Solanum tuberosum L., and Solanum lycopersicum L. The results reveal that larvae fed on P. floridana Rydb. exhibit numerous differentially expressed genes, which are notably enriched in pathways related to energy metabolism, immunity, and detoxification. These functions and pathways are less enriched in larvae fed by other hosts. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) indicates that feeding on P. floridana Rydb. influences the expression of specific genes involved in the Toll and IMD signaling pathways, impacting the immune system of H. vigintioctopunctata larvae. This study provides transcriptomic insights into larval responses to different diets and suggests that the effect of P. floridana Rydb. on the immune system of H. vigintioctopunctata is a key defense mechanism against herbivores.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) impairs memory due to disturbing oxidative stress parameters. Selenium is a main component of several antioxidant enzymes and provides a neuroprotective effect. The present study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of chronic selenium administration on cognitive impairments induced by chronic SD. Adult male Wister rats were randomly assigned into five groups (n = 12/group). The SD was induced in rats using modified multiple platform model. Selenium (6 mu g/kg of animal's body weight) was administered to rats via oral gavage for 6 weeks. The spatial learning and memory were assessed using the radial arm water maze (RAWM). Moreover, we measured the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and GSH/GSSG, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. The results indicate that short-and long-term memory were impaired by chronic sleep deprivation (P < 0.05), while selenium administration prevented this effect. Moreover, selenium normalized antioxidants activities which were reduced by SD such as: catalase (P < 0.05), and SOD (P < 0.05), and significantly enhanced the ratio of GSH/ GSSG in sleep-deprived rats (P 0.05), without significant alteration of BDNF (P 0.05), GSH (P > 0.05), or TBARS levels (P > 0.05). In conclusion, chronic SD induced memory impairment, and chronic treatment with selenium prevented this impairment by normalizing antioxidant enzymes activities in the hippocampus.

AB  - The main active components of the Camellia sect. Chrysantha flowers were analyzed and the antioxidant activity of total flavonoids were compared. The results showed that among the flowers of the 10 species of Sect. Chrysantha plants, C. nitidissima had the highest contents of TFC (0.848 g/100 g) and TSC (6.824 g/100 g), and C. insularis had the highest content of TPOC (4.3 g/100 g). The TPC (17.188 g/100 g) and CTC (101.026 mg/100 g) of C. achrysantha was significantly higher than that of the other 9 species. C. pubipetala had the highest content of GAC (1.586 g/100 g), and the amino acids of C. tunghinensis had the highest amino acid content of all the 10 species. Comprehensive evaluation of the active components of Camellia sect. Chrysantha flowers, it rankings were: C. achrysantha > C.insularis > C. pubipetala> C. quinqueloculosa >C. tunghinensis > C. impressinervis> C. longzhouensis > C. perpetua > C. nitidissima >C. micrantha .This indicated that the combined value of the seven active ingredients was the highest in the flowers of C. achrysantha , followed by C. insularis in Vietnam and C. pubipetala. The results provide reference for the development and utilization of new plant food resources of Sect. Chrysantha.

AB  - The porcine body length trait is an essential factor affecting meat production and reproductive performance. It is evident that the development/lengthening of individual vertebrae is one of the main reasons for increases in body length; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was used to profile the transcriptome (lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA) of the thoracic intervertebral cartilage (TIC) at two time points (1 and 4 months) during vertebral column development in Yorkshire (Y) and Wuzhishan pigs (W). There were four groups: 1- (Y1) and 4-month-old (Y4) Yorkshire pigs and 1- (W1) and 4-month-old (W4) Wuzhishan pigs. In total, 161, 275, 86, and 126 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 1478, 2643, 404, and 750 DE genes (DEGs), and 74,51, 34, and 23 DE miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified in the Y4 vs. Y1, W4 vs. W1, Y4 vs. W4, and Y1 vs. W1 comparisons, respectively. Functional analysis of these DE transcripts (DETs) demonstrated that they had participated in various biological processes, such as cellular component organization or biogenesis, the developmental process, the metabolic process, bone development, and cartilage development. The crucial bone development-related candidate genes NK3 Homeobox 2 (NKX3.2), Wnt ligand secretion mediator (WLS), gremlin 1 (GREM1), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX), (collagen type XI alpha 1 chain (COL11A1), and Wnt Family Member 16 (WNT16)) were further identified by functional analysis. Moreover, lncRNA, miRNA, and gene interaction networks were constructed; a total of 55 lncRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 7 genes formed lncRNA-gene, miRNA-gene, and lncRNA-miRNA-gene pairs, respectively. The aim was to demonstrate that coding and non-coding genes may co-regulate porcine spine development through interaction networks. NKX3.2 was identified as being specifically expressed in cartilage tissues, and it delayed chondrocyte differentiation. miRNA-326 regulated chondrocyte differentiation by targeting NKX3.2. The present study provides the first non-coding RNA and gene expression profiles in the porcine TIC, constructs the lncRNA-miRNA-gene interaction networks, and confirms the function of NKX3.2 in vertebral column development. These findings contribute to the understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms regulating pig vertebral column development. They expand our knowledge about the differences in body length between different pig species and provide a foundation for future studies.

AB  - Until recently, the pre-slaughter logistic chain of cull sows had received limited study, and their behaviour during transport remains understudied. Previously, an observational study of journeys up to 8 h in Denmark showed that the clinical condition of sows had deteriorated from departure until arrival at the slaughterhouse. The suggested main risk factors for this were journey duration, in-vehicle temperature and stationary periods, often in interaction. To disentangle these risk factors, we performed a 3 x 2 factorial study simulating commercial conditions of varying journey durations (4 h, 6 h, 8 h) and the presence of a stationary period of 30-50 min after 1-4 h of driving (long stop: yes/no). In 28 vehicle loads of sows from six herds, behaviour (posture and aggression) and in-vehicle temperature were recorded in the rear compartment holding 11-12 sows during transport to a Danish slaughterhouse. Unexpectedly, the sows were generally standing during transport (median 89-92% standing sows per hour). More sows were standing in the initial hours compared to later. Fewer sows were standing when in-vehicle temperature was higher and with higher temperature standard deviation per hour. We found that fewer sows were standing during the long stop when the latency until the long stop was longer. There was variation in the frequency of aggression among sows (median 2-3, range: 0-155 events per sow), but no differences were detected in the rate of aggression as an effect of time since departure, the presence of a long stop, or in-vehicle temperature. The frequency of aggression received per sow positively correlated with number of scratches on the front of the sow (r = 0.24). Comparing the present results with the scientific literature on finisher pigs, cull sows seem to differ in their tendency to remain standing and show aggressive behaviour throughout journeys to the slaughterhouse. We discuss possible explanations including the pre-transport clinical condition of cull sows, their sensitivity to heat stress and mixing of unfamiliar animals in a confined space as well as the experimental design choice of observing sows in the rear compartment of the vehicle. In conclusion, contrary to expectations, sows were generally standing during transport, and aggression was found throughout the journeys. The higher proportion of sows lying down during a long stop with longer time until the stop may suggest fatigue. These initial findings on the behaviour of cull sows during transport suggest challenges to their welfare.

AB  - Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a significant disease affecting oil tea (Camellia oleifera Abel.). Extensive molecular studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum fructicola is the dominant pathogen of oil tea anthracnose in China. This study aims to investigate differences in molecular processes and regulatory genes at a late stage of infection of C. fructicola, to aid in understanding differences in pathogenic mechanisms of C. fructicola of different geographic populations. We compared the pathogenicity of C. fructicola from different populations (Wuzhishan, Hainan province, and Shaoyang, Hunan province) and gene expression of representative strains of the two populations before and after inoculation in oil tea using RNA sequencing. The results revealed that C. fructicola from Wuzhishan has a more vital ability to impact oil tea leaf tissue. Following infection with oil tea leaves, up-regulated genes in the strains from two geographic populations were associated with galactosidase activity, glutamine family amino acid metabolism, arginine, and proline metabolism. Additionally, up-regulated gene lists associated with infection by Wuzhishan strains were significantly enriched in purine metabolism pathways, while Shaoyang strains were not. These results indicate that more transcriptional and translational activity and the greater regulation of the purine metabolism pathway in the C. fructicola of the Wuzhishan strain might contribute to its stronger pathogenicity.

AB  - This research investigates the impacts of pre-processing techniques on the effectiveness of topic modeling algorithms for Arabic texts, focusing on a comparison between BERTopic, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Using the Single-label Arabic News Article Data set (SANAD), which includes 195,174 Arabic news articles, this study explores pre-processing methods such as cleaning, stemming, normalization, and stop word removal, which are crucial processes given the complex morphology of Arabic. Additionally, the influence of six different embedding models on the topic modeling performance was assessed. The originality of this work lies in addressing the lack of previous studies that optimize BERTopic through adjusting the n-gram range parameter and combining it with different embedding models for effective Arabic topic modeling. Pre-processing techniques were fine-tuned to improve data quality before applying BERTopic, LDA, and NMF, and the performance was assessed using metrics such as topic coherence and diversity. Coherence was measured using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI). The results show that the Tashaphyne stemmer significantly enhanced the performance of LDA and NMF. BERTopic, optimized with pre-processing and bi-grams, outperformed LDA and NMF in both coherence and diversity. The CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-da embedding yielded the best results, emphasizing the importance of pre-processing in Arabic topic modeling.

AB  - Salsola baryosma is a valuable food source for livestock in Saudi Arabia, notably for camels. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common agents of infection-related mortality and morbidity worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the activity of the aqueous ethanolic extract of Salsola baryosma (AEESB) against Staphylococcus aureus and to identify the key polyphenol and volatile components using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography- mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), respectively. The results indicated that AEESB displayed a remarkable activity against Staphylococcus aureus, as evidenced by a disc diffusion assay and DNA fragmentation assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 43 mu g/mL. The HPLC analysis of AEESB resulted in the identification of fourteen polyphenolic bioactive compounds, where ferulic acid (3055.87 mu g/g), gallic acid (1749.35 mu g/g) and caffeic acid (421.89 mu g/g) were the major phenolic acids in Salsola baryosma. While rutin (911.41 mu g/g), naringenin (539.40 mu g/g) and daidzein (265.42 mu g/g) were the major flavonoids. Subsequent analysis of Salsola baryosma by GC-MS revealed thirty volatile components; the major percentages were oleic acid (34.86%), l-(+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate (13.25%), and butylated hydroxytoluene (8.24%). In addition, extracts from the aerial parts of S. baryosma demonstrated anti-microbial activity against Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Camelina sativa is regarded as a low-input oilseed crop for versatile food, biofuels and industrial applications with potential production on marginal lands, whereas phosphate (Pi) deficiency greatly reduces camelina seed production. To improve camelina resilience to low P conditions, here we overexpressed the Pi deficiency-induced non-specific phospholipase C4 (NPC4) to test its effect on camelina seed production under different levels of Pi availability. NPC4-overexpressing (OE) plants displayed increased seed yield and oil production, with a greater magnitude of increases under Pi-deficient than Pi-sufficient conditions. NPC4-OE camelina had a higher level of total P and free Pi in young leaves but a lower level in old leaves than in wild-type plants. More Pi was moved from old leaves to young leaves in NPC4-OE than in wild-type plants. NPC4-OE increased the expression of Pi transporter genes, and the increase was greater in old leaves and under Pi-deficient conditions. These data indicate that NPC4 improves camelina growth by promoting Pi remobilization from old to young tissues, revealing a mechanism by which NPC4 mediates plant response to Pi deficiency.

AB  - Background Climate change and the associated risk for the occurrence of extreme temperature events or permanent changes in ambient temperature are important in the husbandry of farm animals. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of permanent cultivation temperatures below (35 degrees C) and above (39 degrees C, 41 degrees C) the standard cultivation temperature (37 degrees C) on porcine muscle development. Therefore, we used our porcine primary muscle cell culture derived from satellite cells as an in vitro model. Neonatal piglets have limited thermoregulatory stability, and several days after birth are required to maintain their body temperature. To consider this developmental step, we used myoblasts originating from thermolabile (five days of age) and thermostable piglets (twenty days of age). Results The efficiency of myoblast proliferation using real-time monitoring via electrical impedance was comparable at all temperatures with no difference in the cell index, slope or doubling time. Both temperatures of 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C led to similar biochemical growth properties and cell viability. Only differences in the mRNA expression of myogenesis-associated genes were found at 39 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C with less MYF5, MYOD and MSTN and more MYH3 mRNA. Myoblasts grown at 35 degrees C are smaller, exhibit higher DNA synthesis and express higher amounts of the satellite cell marker PAX7, muscle growth inhibitor MSTN and metabolic coactivator PPARGC1A. Only permanent cultivation at 41 degrees C resulted in higher HSP expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Interactions between the temperature and donor age showed that MYOD, MYOG, MYH3 and SMPX mRNAs were temperature-dependently expressed in myoblasts of thermolabile but not thermostable piglets. Conclusions We conclude that 37 degrees C to 39 degrees C is the best physiological temperature range for adequate porcine myoblast development. Corresponding to the body temperatures of piglets, it is therefore possible to culture primary muscle cells at 39 degrees C. Only the highest temperature of 41 degrees C acts as a thermal stressor for myoblasts with increased HSP expression, but it also accelerates myogenic development. Cultivation at 35 degrees C, however, leads to less differentiated myoblasts with distinct thermogenetic activity. The adaptive behavior of derived primary muscle cells to different cultivation temperatures seems to be determined by the thermoregulatory stability of the donor piglets.

AB  - In rodent models of smoking during pregnancy, early postnatal nicotine exposure results in impaired hippocampus-dependent memory, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Given that hippocampal cholinergic systems modulate memory and rapid development of hippocampal cholinergic systems occurs during nicotine exposure, here we investigated its impacts on cholinergic function. Both nicotinic and muscarinic activation produce transient or long-lasting depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that postnatal nicotine exposure impairs both the induction and nicotinic modulation of NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD). Activation of muscarinic receptors decreases excitatory synaptic transmission and CA1 network activity in both wild-type and alpha 2 knockout mice. These muscarinic effects are still observed in nicotine-exposed mice. M1 muscarinic receptor activity is required for mGluR-dependent LTD. Early postnatal nicotine exposure has no effect on mGluR-dependent LTD induction, suggesting that it has no effect on the function of m1 muscarinic receptors involved in this form of LTD. Our results demonstrate that early postnatal nicotine exposure has more pronounced effects on nicotinic function than muscarinic function in the hippocampal CA1 region. Thus, impaired hippocampus-dependent memory may arise from the developmental disruption of nicotinic cholinergic systems in the hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - Early antral follicles (EAFs) represent the transitional stage between pre-antral and antral follicles, containing oocytes that have completed most of their growth phase. Therefore, they offer an easily exploitable reserve for producing mature oocytes and preserving genetic resources, given their higher abundance compared to antral follicles (AFs) and shorter culture period than other pre-antral follicles (PAFs). Despite these advantages, the culture of EAFs remains challenging, and the success rates of in vitro embryo production (IVEP) from EAFderived oocytes are still far below the standard achieved with fully grown oocytes in ruminant species.The difficulty is related to developing suitable in vitro culture systems tailored with nutrients, growth factors, and other signaling molecules to support oocyte growth. In this review, we focus on the in vitro development of sheep EAFs to provide an informative reference to current research progress. We also summarize the basic aspect of folliculogenesis in sheep and the main achievements and limitations of the current methods for EAF isolation, in vitro culture systems, and medium supplementation. Finally, we highlight future perspectives and challenges for improving EAF culture outcomes.

AB  - Yunnan Province has a very wide diversity of tea germplasm resources. A variety of special tea germplasms with outstanding traits have been discovered, including tea germplasms with high anthocyanin content and low caffeine content. Albino tea cultivars generally have higher contents of theanine that contribute to the umami taste, and the quality of tea brewed from it is higher. The catechin index (CI), the ratio of dihydroxylated catechins (DIC) to trihydroxylated catechins (TRIC), is a crucial index of suitability for processing tea. In this study, the albino tea plant Menghai Huangye (MHHY) with yellow leaves was identified. Analysis of the biochemical components revealed that MHHY was enriched in theanine and the total catechins (TC) were lower than Yunkang 10 (YK10). In addition, the CI value of MHHY was extremely significantly higher than that of YK10. Metabolic profile of catechins and the related gene expression profile analysis found that the coordinated expression of the key branch genes F3'H and F3'5'Ha for the synthesis of DIC and TRIC in tea plant was closely related to the high CI and low TC of MHHY. Further analysis of the F3'H promoter showed that a 284-bp deletion mutation was present in the F3'H promoter of MHHY, containing the binding sites of the transcriptional repressor MYB4 involved in flavonoid metabolism, which might be an important reason for the up-regulated expression of F3'H in MHHY. Overall, this study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the characteristics of albino tea germplasm resources and efficiently utilizing high-CI tea germplasm resources.

AB  - Circulating Hsp70 levels were determined in feline and porcine cohorts using two different ELISA systems. These comparative animal models of larger organisms often reflect diseases, and especially malignant tumors, better than conventional rodent models. It is therefore essential to investigate the biology and utility of tumor biomarkers in animals such as cats and pigs. In this study, levels of free Hsp70 in the blood of cats with spontaneously occurring tumors were detected using a commercial Hsp70 ELISA (R&D Systems). Sub-analysis of different tumor groups revealed that animals with tumors of epithelial origin presented with significantly elevated circulating Hsp70 concentrations. In addition to free Hsp70 levels measured with the R&D Systems Hsp70 ELISA, levels of exosomal Hsp70 were determined using the compHsp70 ELISA in pigs. Both ELISA systems detected significantly elevated Hsp70 levels (R&D Systems: median 24.9 ng/mL; compHsp70: median 44.2 ng/mL) in the blood of a cohort of APC(1311/+) pigs diagnosed with high-grade adenoma polyps, and the R&D Systems Hsp70 ELISA detected also elevated Hsp70 levels in animals with low-grade polyps. In contrast, in flTP53(R167H) pigs, suffering from malignant osteosarcoma, the compHsp70 ELISA (median 674.32 ng/mL), but not the R&D Systems Hsp70 ELISA (median 4.78 ng/mL), determined significantly elevated Hsp70 concentrations, indicating that in tumor-bearing animals, the dominant form of Hsp70 is of exosomal origin. Our data suggest that both ELISA systems are suitable for detecting free circulating Hsp70 levels in pigs with high-grade adenoma, but only the compHsp70 ELISA can measure elevated, tumor-derived exosomal Hsp70 levels in tumor-bearing animals.

AB  - Introduction: Neuro-navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left angular gyrus has been broadly investigated for the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Although abnormalities in two hippocampal networks, the anterior -temporal (AT) and posterior -medial (PM) networks, are consistent with aMCI and are potential therapeutic targets for rTMS, the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of rTMS on hippocampal network connections remain unknown. Here, we assessed the impact of left angular gyrus rTMS on activity in these networks and explored whether the treatment response was due to the distance between the clinically applied target (the group average optimal site) and the personalized target in patients with aMCI. Methods: Sixty subjects clinically diagnosed with aMCI participated in this study after 20 sessions of shamcontrolled rTMS targeting the left angular gyrus. Resting -state functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments were performed before and after rTMS. Functional connectivity alterations in the PM and AT networks were assessed using seed -based functional connectivity analysis and two -factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). We then computed the correlations between the functional connectivity changes and clinical rating scales. Finally, we examined whether the Euclidean distance between the clinically applied and personalized targets predicted the subsequent treatment response. Results: Compared with the sham group, the active rTMS group showed rTMS-induced deactivation of functional connectivity within the medial temporal lobe -AT network, with a negative correlation with episodic memory score changes. Moreover, the active rTMS lowers the interdependency of changes in the PM and AT networks. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the clinically applied and personalized target distances could predict subsequent network lever responses in the active rTMS group. Conclusions: Neuro-navigated rTMS selectively modulates widespread functional connectivity abnormalities in the PM and AT hippocampal networks in aMCI patients, and the modulation of hippocampal-AT network connectivity can efficiently reverse memory deficits. The results also highlight the necessity of personalized targets for fMRI.

AB  - As actively sensing animals guided by acoustic information, echolocating bats must adapt their vocal-motor behavior to various environments and behavioral tasks. Here, we investigated how the temporal patterns of echolocation and flight behavior were adjusted in 2 species of bats with a high duty cycle (HDC) call structure, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Hipposideros armiger, when they flew along a straight corridor and then passed through windows of 3 different sizes. We also tested whether divergence existed in the adaptations of the 2 species. Both H. armiger and R. ferrumequinum increased their call rates by shortening the pulse duration and inter-pulse interval for more rapid spatial sampling of the environment when flying through smaller windows. Bats produced more sonar sound groups (SSGs) while maintaining a stable proportion of calls that made up SSGs during approaches to smaller windows. The 2 species showed divergent adjustment in flight behavior across 3 different window sizes. Hipposideros armiger reduced its flight speed to pass through smaller windows while R. ferrumequinum increased its flight speed. Our results suggest that these 2 species of HDC bats adopt similar acoustic timing patterns for different tasks although they performed different flight behaviors.

AB  - When considering future outcomes, humans tend to discount gains more than losses. This phenomenon, referred to as the temporal discounting sign effect, is thought to result from the greater anticipated emotional impact of waiting for a negative outcome (dread) compared to waiting for a positive outcome (mixture of savoring and impatience). The impact of such anticipatory emotions has been proposed to rely on episodic future thinking. We evaluated this proposal by examining the presence and magnitude of a sign effect in the intertemporal decisions of individuals with hippocampal amnesia, who are severely impaired in their ability to engage in episodic mental simulation, and by comparing their patterns of choices to those of healthy controls. We also measured loss aversion, the tendency to assign greater value to losses compared to equivalent gains, to verify that any reduction in the sign effect in the hippocampal lesion group could not be explained by a group difference in loss aversion. Results showed that participants with hippocampal amnesia exhibited a sign effect, with less discounting of monetary losses compared to gains, that was similar in magnitude to that of controls. Loss aversion, albeit greater in the hippocampal compared to the control group, did not account for the sign effect. These results indicate that the sign effect does not depend on the integrity of hippocampally mediated episodic processes. They suggest instead that the impact of anticipatory emotions can be factored into decisions via semantic future thinking, drawing on non-contextual knowledge about oneself.

AB  - The enhancement of anaerobic digestion improves biogas production, but it has some environmental implications. The need to achieve a trade-off between the energy gains and environmental sustainability necessitated this research. In this study, a comparative assessment of the potential environmental impacts of biogas production from enhanced anaerobic digestion of agro-industrial wastes with different enhancement options, biogas utilization and digestate management was carried out. The anaerobic digestions (mono-or co-digestion) of okra and pig wastes were enhanced with polypyrrole magnetite nanocomposites (PPy/Fe3O4 NPs), nano zerovalent iron (nZVI), magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) and alkaline pretreatment (NaOH). The impact categories were analyzed according to these adopted assessment processes: substrate production, substrate transportation and processing, feedstock enhancement (pretreatment, co-digestion and additive supplementation), biogas utilization, and digestate management. From the analyzed results of this assessment, it was revealed that among all other scenarios, the combined enhancement (co-digestion + PPy/Fe3O4 NPs) option had the least global warming potential of 0.0053 kg CO2-eq/MJ. Based on the energy and environmental performances, the use of combined enhancement, followed by PPy/Fe3O4 NPs only is recommended to minimize the adverse impacts of electricity generation from biogas on the environment. It is further recommended that techno-economic and life cycle cost analysis of the preferred scenario be conducted.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily caused by the loss of the full-length Dp427 dystrophin in both muscle and brain. The basis of the central comorbidities in DMD is unclear. Brain dystrophin plays a role in the clustering of central gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), and its loss in the mdx mouse alters the clustering of some synaptic subunits in central inhibitory synapses. However, the diversity of GABAergic alterations in this model is still fragmentary. In this study, the analysis of in vivo PET imaging of a benzodiazepine-binding site radioligand revealed that the global density of central GABA(A)Rs is unaffected in mdx compared with WT mice. In contrast, semi-quantitative immunoblots and immunofluorescence confocal imaging in tissue sections revealed complex and differential patterns of alterations of the expression levels and/or clustered distribution of a variety of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)R subunits in the hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex, and spinal cord. Hence, dystrophin loss not only affects the stabilization of synaptic GABA(A)Rs but also influences the subunit composition of GABA(A)Rs subtypes at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. This study provides new molecular outcome measures and new routes to evaluate the impact of treatments aimed at compensating alterations of the nervous system in DMD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to select progenies of Opuntia undulata Griffiths cv. African Elephant Ear (AEE) through morphological, productive, and nutritional traits, and also evaluate the repeatability and selection gain. The experiment was carried out between 2018 and 2020, in the semiarid region of Brazil. A completely randomized design was used, with ten replications. The treatments consisted of 12 progenies of Opuntia undulata cv. AEE. Morphological, productive, and nutritional characteristics were evaluated, also the selection gain and repeatability were estimated. There was a variation in the productivity of up to 11.2 t DM ha- 1 . Progenies number 6 and 7 stood out in terms of selection gain. Progenies 6, 7, 9, and 12 were the most productive. Progeny 6 stood out in terms of dry matter production and minor presence of spines; both traits are of great interest in breeding programs of forage cacti. Based on the repeatability analysis, fewer evaluations were enough to predict with confidence morphological traits and dry matter production in different progenies of Opuntia undulata Griffiths.

AB  - Background: Chronic alcohol (ethanol) drinking changes central serotonin and dopamine levels, and thereby the functioning of brain circuits that support cognition and anxiety. Previously, it has been proven that Nigella sativa oil (NSO) improves cognition and reduces anxiety by regulating the neurotransmission but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods: To address the knowledge gap, an in vivo experiment was done to investigate effects of NSO on behavior and neurotransmission in ethanol drinking Wistar male rats. Specifically, control, NSO treated, ethanol and ethanol + NSO treated groups were tested for changes in anxiety-like behavior, locomotor activity and learning and memory using the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and light and dark (L&D) box test; open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test, respectively. Brain neurotransmitter concentrations were determined using HPLC-EC. To validate the in vivo findings, we assessed in silico the docking between NSO compounds and proteins using auto dock vina. Key findings: Ethanol and NSO reduced weight in the ethanol and ethanol + NSO groups. Food intake, fluid consumption, calorie intake, and growth were similarly affected by ethanol and NSO. In the in behavioral tests, ethanol drinking rats spent less time in the open arms of the EPM and had fewer entries compared to controls, while ethanol + NSO group also showed reduced entries. Similar patterns were observed in the OFT. No differences were found in the L&D box test. In the memory tests, ethanol + NSO treatment increased latency in short-term memory, while ethanol consumption increased latency in retention. Neurochemical analysis revealed that ethanol + NSO treatment increased serotonin levels in the PFC and hippocampus while reducing dopamine levels in the PFC compared to all groups, and in the hippocampus compared to control and NSO groups. The in silico experiment revealed that NSO has nine main active compounds. By molecular docking, we found that all nine compounds showed good binding affinity with our target proteins but the best docking values were obtained with thymoquinone and dithymoquinone. The binding affinity estimations identified the superior binding affinity and efficiency of dithymoquinone over all nine NSO compounds for serotonin, dopamine receptors and MAO-enzymes. Conclusions and significance: NSO partially modulated ethanol induced neurobehavioral and neurochemical alterations, improving serotonin levels but not fully reversing behavioral deficits. Further studies are needed to explore its protective potential.

AB  - Exploitation of the symbiotic relationship between endophytic fungi and ryegrass is a crucial technique for reducing the incidence of insect pests. This is primarily due to the production of alkaloids, such as peramine, by the fungi. This alkaloid has been reported as both a deterrent and toxic to a variety of insects. However, insects have developed various strategies to counteract plant defenses. One of the most studied methods is their ability to sequester toxic compounds from plants. In this study, we examined the feeding preferences and adaptation to peramine in Chilesia rudis, a native Chilean larva. Using a no-choice assay, we assessed larval feeding preferences and mass gain on seven experimental lines and two commercial cultivars of endophyte-infected and non-infected ryegrass. Pupal development time and adult performance were evaluated post-assay. Additionally, we measured peramine content in larval carcasses, feces, and ryegrass leaves. Jumbo was the most preferred cultivar with 32 mm(2) of leaf tissues consumed. The longest pupal development time was observed in L161 and ALTO AR1, both at 28 days. Wing length in adults was greatest in the Jumbo and L163 cultivars, measuring 1.25 cm and 1.32 cm, respectively. Peramine concentrations were detected in the bodies of C. rudis. In conclusion, this larva can adapt to endophyte-infected ryegrass and develop counter-adaptation mechanisms to mitigate the effects of peramine.

AB  - Invasive aspergillosis is a rare but severe fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced new complexities in managing aspergillosis due to the widespread use of corticosteroids for treating COVID-19-related respiratory distress, which can increase susceptibility to fungal infections. Here, we present a challenging case of progressive cerebral aspergillosis complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) in a 67-year-old male with a history of COVID-19. The patient, initially misdiagnosed with temporal arteritis, received pulse corticosteroid therapy twice before presenting with persistent left-sided headaches and vision loss. Cranial imaging revealed findings consistent with fungal sinusitis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and orbital pseudotumor, which progressed despite initial antifungal therapy. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging indicated an invasive mass extending into the left cavernous sinus and other intracranial structures, raising suspicion of aspergillosis. A transsphenoidal biopsy confirmed Aspergillus infection, leading to voriconazole therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, follow-up imaging revealed significant progression, with extension to the right frontal region and left cavernous sinus. The patient then developed visual impairment in the right eye and was diagnosed with CST secondary to fungal sinusitis. Management included a combination of systemic antifungals and antibiotics; however, the patient declined surgical intervention. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges and rapid progression associated with cerebral aspergillosis in post-COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. This report highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion and prompt, targeted interventions in similar cases to improve patient outcomes. Further research is required to understand the optimal management of invasive fungal infections.

AB  - Bull spermatozoa depend equally on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for the maintenance of the energy necessary for their proper functioning. The aim of the present work was to delineate the mitochondrial activity of bull spermatozoa after incubation with specific inhibitors of the different mitochondrial complexes and evaluate their ROS production. Thawed bull sperm cells (30 x 106 mL-1 in Tyrode's extender) were incubated 1 and 3h at 37 & DEG;C with rotenone 5 & mu;M (ROT), complex I inhibitor; dimethyl-malonate 10 mM (DMM), complex II inhibitor; carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine 5 & mu;M (CCCP), uncoupling agent; antimycin A 1 & mu;g/mL (ANTI), complex III inhibitor; oligomycin 5 & mu;M (OLIGO), ATP synthase inhibitor, and 0.5% DMSO, vehicle (CTR). Sperm motility and kinematics were assessed by Hamilton Thorn IVOS 12.0. Mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial O2 ⠅- production and H2O2 intracellular content were evaluated by BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and sperm viability (SYBR-14/PI) and mitochondrial activity (JC-1/SYBR-14/PI) were assessed by epifluorescence microscopy. A multivariate analysis was performed on the results. In addition, sperm kinematic features, registered for each motile spermatozoon, were studied by cluster analysis. The incubation during 1 or 3 h in presence of the inhibitors of mitochondrial functionality only had a minor effect on motility parameters, decreasing the proportion of the SP1 (fast progressive) subpopulation after 3 h of incubation with ROT, ANTI or OLIGO. The percentage of live spermatozoa with active mitochondria was reduced under the effect of ANTI and CCCP both at 1 and 3 h. In conclusion, mitochondrial function is somehow impaired in frozen thawed bull sperm as not all live cells showed active mitochondria. These results support the findings that bull spermatozoa can alternatively rely on oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis for energy obtainment and that their mitochondria are less affected by ETC inhibitors.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of postharvest piling up in bulk on Camellia oleifera seed qualities, including moisture content, oil content, fatty acid composition, soluble sugar, soluble protein content, acid value, peroxide value, lipase activity, lipoxygenase activity, and mold colony, under varying relative humidity (60%, 80%, 98%) and time durations (1-8 days). Additionally, it examined the impact of piling temperature and diverse postharvest treatments. The results revealed that piling up in bulk promoted the post-ripening of Camellia oleifera seeds, leading to a gradual decrease in seed moisture content while initially increasing oil content before stabilizing. After 2 days of piling, seed oil content increased by 5.65%, 4.40%, and 1.06% under RH conditions of 60%, 80%, and 98%, respectively. However, after 4 days, the oil content declined by 8.36%, 6.06%, and 4.14%, respectively. The proportions of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids declined gradually, while monounsaturated fatty acids increased significantly. The acid value decreased, correlating positively with lipase activity. Mold colonies on seeds increased minimally with piling duration, while those on fruit shells increased sharply by 1-4 logarithmic units after the 4th day. When examining the effect of temperature, higher piling temperatures were found to gradually increase the seed oil content. Based on the order of oil content, the different treatment methods were ranked as follows: piling up in bulk-sun drying > piling up in bulk-drying > shelling-sun drying > direct sun drying > shelling-drying. Therefore, these findings advance our understanding of postharvest piling up in bulk of Camellia oleifera seeds and provide valuable insights for selecting treatment methods and parameters.

AB  - S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the main methyl group donor and has antioxidant potential. In this study, preventive and regressive potential of SAM were investigated in high fat/high were injected with SAM (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 6 weeks along with HFHC diet or 4 weeks after HFHC (CYP2E1) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) levels, prooxidative and antioxidative parameters, protein expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor-(31 (TGF-(31) together with histopathological changes were examined in the liver. SAM treatment diminished HFHC diet-induced increases in serum transaminase activities and hepatic TC, TG, CYP2E1, Hyp, alpha-SMA and TGF-(31 expressions and ameliorated prooxidant-antioxidant balance. Histopathological scores for hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were decreased by SAM treatment. Increases in TC, diene conjugate levels, and lipid vacuoles within the tunica media of the aorta were reduced in HFHC-fed animals treated with SAM. These protective effects were also detected in the regression period of HFHC-guinea pigs due to SAM. In conclusion, SAM treatment was found to be effective in prevention and regression of HFHC-induced hepatic and aortic lesions together with decreases in oxidative stress in guinea pigs with NAFLD.

AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted to determine the incidence of mortality and morbidity rates of camel calves (birth to 180 day) and associated risk factors. Results showed that diseases, parasite infections, feed shortage, inadequate veterinary services and recurrent drought were the major constraints. Out of 205 calves, 185 had manifested 256 disease symptoms and 34 of them were died. Thus, a calf had 74.7% and 16.4% likelihood of developing a disease and dying during the cohort period. The incidence of diarrhea, pneumonia, camel pox and septicemia were 59, 51, 38 and 17 cases per 100 calves-six-months at risk, respectively. The risk of diarrhea (hazard ratio = 1.15) and pneumonia (HR = 1.48) were higher during the wet season and in calves kept on communal grazing than others. The hazard of camel pox incidence was higher during dry periods and in calves fed limited amount of colostrum. The mortality rate was found to be lower among calves above three months (HR = 0.31), calves with normal delivery (HR = 0.32) and those kept at homestead (HR = 0.45) compared to others. The hazards of mortality were 6.80 and 3.02 times higher during the dry season than wet period and in calves that consumed less colostrum than their counterparts.

AB  - Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO; removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes) prior to age 48 is associated with elevated risk for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea. In early midlife, individuals with BSO show reduced hippocampal volume, function, and hippocampal-dependent verbal episodic memory performance associated with changes in sleep. It is unknown whether BSO affects fine-grained sleep measurements (sleep microarchitecture) and how these changes might relate to hippocampal-dependent memory. We recruited thirty-six early midlife participants with BSO. Seventeen of these participants were taking 17 beta-estradiol therapy (BSO+ET) and 19 had never taken ET (BSO). Twenty age-matched control participants with intact ovaries (AMC) were also included. Overnight at-home polysomnography recordings were collected, along with subjective sleep quality and hot flash frequency. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was used to assess how sleep varied between groups. Compared to AMC, BSO without ET was associated with significantly decreased time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep as well as increased NREM stage 2 and 3 beta power, NREM stage 2 delta power, and spindle power and maximum amplitude. Increased spindle maximum amplitude was negatively correlated with verbal episodic memory performance. Decreased sleep latency, increased sleep efficiency, and increased time spent in rapid eye movement sleep were observed for BSO+ET. Findings suggest there is an association between ovarian hormone loss and sleep microarchitecture, which may contribute to poorer cognitive outcomes and be ameliorated by ET.

AB  - Glyphosate (GLY), which is a commonly used herbicide in tea plantations worldwide, effectively controls the spread of gramineous and broadleaf weeds. However, owing to its toxicity, the maximum residue limits of GLY in food have become increasingly stringent. In this study, we developed an analytical method for accurate and precise quantification of trace levels of GLY and its main metabolite, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), in Wuyi Rock tea using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The method was based on a rapid detection kit including solid-phase extraction columns and derivatisation agents. The limits of quantification of GLY and AMPA in Wuyi Rock tea samples were 0.03 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. Good linear calibrations curves (R2 >= 0.996) were achieved for GLY and AMPA solutions in the concentration range 2-100 ng/mL. The recovery values of the samples spiked with 16, 80, and 160 mu g/kg of the analytes ranged between 89.32% and 97.62%, and the relative standard deviations ranged between 2.02% and 3.86%. Compared with the standard method currently used to analyse tea samples in China, the HPLC-MS/MS method requires lower amounts of reagents and shorter pretreatment times, involves facile operation, is highly accurate, and presents a low detection limit. Therefore, the method is suitable for batch detection and analysis of GLY and AMPA in Wuyi Rock tea samples.

AB  - Treatments that elevate NAD(+) levels have been found to improve oocyte quality in mice, cattle, and pigs, suggesting that NAD(+) is vital during oocyte maturation. This study aimed to examine the influence of different NAD(+) biosynthetic pathways on oocyte quality by inhibiting key enzymes. Porcine oocytes from small antral follicles were matured for 44 h in a defined maturation system supplemented with 2-hydroxynicotinic acid [2-HNA, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) inhibitor], FK866 [nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor], or gallotannin [nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) inhibitor] and their respective NAD(+) pathway modulators (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and nicotinamide mononucleotide, respectively). Cumulus expansion was assessed after 22 h of maturation. At 44 h, maturation rates were determined and mature oocytes were fixed and stained to assess spindle formation. Each enzyme inhibitor reduced oocyte maturation rate and adversely affected spindle formation, indicating that NAD(+) is required for meiotic spindle assembly. Furthermore, NAMPT and NMNAT inhibition reduced cumulus expansion, whereas NAPRT inhibition affected chromosomal segregation. Treating oocytes with gallotannin and nicotinamide mononucleotide together showed improvements in spindle width, while treating oocytes with 2-HNA and nicotinic acid combined showed an improvement in both spindle length and width. These results indicate that the salvage pathway plays a vital role in promoting oocyte meiotic progression, while the Preiss-Handler pathway is essential for spindle assembly.

AB  - Cocaine is one of the most consumed illegal drugs among (young) adults in the European Union and it exerts various acute and chronic negative effects on psychical and physical health. The central mechanism through which cocaine initially leads to improved performance, followed by addictive behavior, has already been intensively studied and includes effects on the homeostasis of the neurotransmitters dopamine, partly mediated via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and serotonin. However, effects on the peripheral nervous system, including the enteric nervous system, are much less understood, though a correlation between cocaine consumption and gastrointestinal symptoms has been reported. The aim of the present study was to gain more information on the effects of cocaine on enteric neuronal functions and the underlying mechanisms. For this purpose, functional experiments using an organ bath, Ussing chamber and neuroimaging techniques were conducted on gastrointestinal tissues from guinea pigs. Key results obtained are that cocaine (1) exhibits a stimulating, non-neuronal effect on gastric antrum motility, (2) acutely (but not chronically) diminishes responses of primary cultured enteric neurons to nicotinic and serotonergic stimulation and (3) reversibly attenuates neuronal-mediated intestinal mucosal secretion. It can be concluded that cocaine, among its central effects, also alters enteric neuronal functions, providing potential explanations for the coexistence of cocaine abuse and gastrointestinal complaints.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease that significantly impacts the physical and mental health of >300 million people worldwide and places a major burden on society. Ginsenosides are the main active ingredient in ginseng and have been proven to have various pharmacological effects on the nervous system. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant effect of ginsenoside Rk3 and its underlying mechanism in a murine model of depression. Rk3 significantly improved depression-like behavior in mice, ameliorated the disturbance of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Additionally, Rk3 improved the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan in brain tissue by targeting tryptophan hydroxylase, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Rk3 reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota of mice and regulated intestinal tryptophan metabolism, which alleviated intestinal barrier damage. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the role of Rk3 in the tryptophan metabolic cycle along the brain-gut axis, suggesting that Rk3 may have the potential for treating depression.

AB  - This paper evaluates a machine learning-based approach for identifying and analyzing African bush elephants within complex terrains using high-resolution drone imagery. With human-wildlife conflict posing a significant threat to elephants worldwide, accurate and efficient monitoring techniques are crucial, yet challenging in diverse landscapes. Our study utilizes approximately 3,180 drone-captured images from Kasungu National Park in Malawi, encompassing various terrains including dense forests and open bushlands. These images were systematically preprocessed and analyzed using three distinct ML algorithms: Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Mask R-CNN, each fine-tuned for identification of elephants across different age groups. Comparative performance metrics revealed nuanced strengths and limitations: Faster R-CNN showed notable proficiency in detecting adult elephants, particularly in dense foliage. Mask R-CNN, while less precise overall, demonstrated increased effectiveness in identifying juveniles and infants. RetinaNet, optimized for larger images, showed particular adeptness with adult elephants but less so with younger ones. Despite these promising results, overall recognition rates were lower than ideal, highlighting the complexities of wildlife identification in natural settings. This study not only facilitates the identification and counting of individual elephants but also provides insights into the challenges of applying ML in complex ecological contexts. The derived insights can assist conservationists and park officials in making informed decisions related to wildlife protection and habitat preservation. Furthermore, the study offers a valuable blueprint for integrating AI and machine learning technology into wildlife conservation strategies, presenting a scalable model with potential applications for different species and geographic regions, while acknowledging the need for further refinement to enhance accuracy and reliability in diverse ecological settings

AB  - Conceptus secretory factors include galectins, a family of carbohydrate binding proteins that elicit cell adhesion and immune suppression by interacting with intracellular and extracellular glycans. In rodents, galectin-1 (LGALS1) promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance in the decidua through expansion of tolerogenic cluster of differentiation 11c (CD11c) positive dendritic cells, increased anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10, and activation of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) positive regulatory T cells (Treg). This study characterized galectin expression in early ruminant conceptuses and endometrium. We also tested the effect of recombinant bovine LGALS1 (rbLGALS1) and progesterone (P4) on endometrial expression of genes and protein related to maternal-conceptus immune tolerance in cattle. Elongating bovine and ovine conceptuses expressed several galectins, particularly, LGALS1, LGALS3, and LGALS8. Within bovine endometrium, expression of LGALS3, LGALS7, and LGALS9 was greater on Day 16 of pregnancy compared to the estrous cycle. Within ovine endometrium, LGALS7 was greater during pregnancy compared to the estrous cycle and endometrium of pregnant sheep tended to have greater LGALS9 and LGALS15. Expression of endometrial LGALS4 was less during pregnancy in sheep. Treating bovine endometrium with rbLGALS1 increased endometrial expression of CD11c, IL-10, and FOXP3, within 24 h. Specifically, within caruncular endometrium, both rbLGALS1 and P4 increased FOXP3, suggesting that both ligands may promote Treg expansion. Using IHC, FOXP3(+) cells with a leukocyte phenotype were localized to the bovine uterine stratum compactum near the uterine surface and increased in response to rbLGALS1. We hypothesize that galectins have important functions during establishment of pregnancy in ruminants and bovine conceptus LGALS1 and luteal P4 confer mechanisms of maternal-conceptus immune tolerance in cattle.
   Summary Sentence
   Bovine and ovine conceptuses express galectin-1, which induces endometrial gene expression related to maternal immune tolerance in cattle.

AB  - 5The cerebellum, or "little brain", is often overlooked in studies of brain metabolism in favour of the cortex. Despite this, anomalies in cerebellar amino acid homeostasis in a range of disorders have been reported. Amino acid homeostasis is central to metabolism, providing recycling of carbon backbones and ammonia between cell types. Here, we examined the role of cerebellar amino acid transporters in the cycling of glutamine and alanine in guinea pig cerebellar slices by inhibiting amino acid transporters and examining the resultant metabolism of [1-C-1(3)]D-glucose and [1,2-C-1(3)]acetate by NMR spectroscopy and LCMS. While the lack of specific inhibitors of each transporter makes interpretation difficult, by viewing results from experiments with multiple inhibitors we can draw inferences about the major cell types and transporters involved. In cerebellum, glutamine and alanine transfer is dominated by system A, blockade of which has maximum effect on metabolism, with contributions from System N. Inhibition of neural system A isoform SNAT1 by MeAIB resulted in greatly decreased metabolite pools and reduced net fluxes but showed little effect on fluxes from [1,2-C-13]acetate unlike inhibition of SNAT3 and other glutamine transporters by histidine where net fluxes from [1,2-C-1(3)]acetate are reduced by similar to 50%. We interpret the data as further evidence of not one but several glutamate/glutamine exchange pools. The impact of amino acid transport inhibition demonstrates that the cerebellum has tightly coupled cells and that glutamate/glutamine, as well as alanine cycling, play a major role in that part of the brain.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of the supplementation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) at different ratios in protein restriction diets on lipid metabolism in a finishing pig model. The BCAA supplementation (leucine/isoleucine/valine = 2:1:1 and 2:1:2) ameliorated the poor growth performance and carcass characteristics, particularly high fat mass caused by a protein-restricted diet. Serum adiponectin increased while leptin decreased in BCAA diets in comparison to the 12% CP group. BCAA supplementation also increased the low-protein expression of AMPK and SIRT1 caused by protein restriction. The mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were highest in the protein-restricted group and lowered in the 2:1:1 or 2:1:2 group. In conclusion, BCAAs supplemented in an adequate ratio range of 2:1:1 to 2:1:2 (2:1:2 is recommended) in reduced protein diets could modulate lipid metabolism by accelerating the secretion of adipokines and fatty acid oxidation.

AB  - The attempt to investigate hepatitis E virus (HEV) contamination in naturally growing mangrove bivalve mollusks captured for local sale in a touristic area of Maranh & atilde;o state in Brazil revealed the detection of rat hepatitis E virus (ratHEV). Using international standard protocols for processing and nucleic acid extraction, we analyzed 89 bivalve samples (Mytella falcata and Crassostrea rhizophorae) with two broadly reactive assays: heminested pan-Hepeviridae (ORF-1) and probe-based HEV-1 to HEV-4 (ORF-2/ORF-3). Heminested reactions presented 2 (2.2%) amplifications of the expected size. Nucleotide identities ranged from 86.6 to 89.0% with ratHEV isolates from wild rats, pigs, one human case and sewage reported in different countries. Regarding the phylogenetic tree, the sequences grouped with genotype HEV-C1. This first report of ratHEV detection in bivalve mollusks may be a starting point for further research on virus variability, distribution, host range and especially the possible role of contaminated shellfish as a vehicle for ratHEV transmission.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of no tail docking on the performance, health, and behavior of piglets raised under commercial conditions in Brazil. The study included 768 weaned piglets from the Pietrain synthetic line, randomly divided into two groups: DT = the final third part of the tail-docked (n = 384) and NTD = non-tail-docked (n = 384). Tail docking was performed on day two using an electrocautery clipper for piglets from the DT group, and both groups were subjected to standard environmental enrichment with branched chains. In cases of tail biting, a contingency plan was adopted to mitigate this problem by enriching the pen with a sisal rope. Behavioral measurements were performed using scan sampling. Tail biting, reactivity to humans, and health were assessed using a methodology adapted from the Welfare Quality Protocol (R). The piglets were weighed at 140 days of age and inspected according to the parameters established by the Pig Genealogical Registration Service to be used as reproduction animals. The off-test rate was calculated based on the total number of piglets approved for animal use relative to the total number evaluated. During the nursery stage, the NDT piglets showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.07) toward a higher occurrence of tail biting than the DT piglets and exhibited a higher incidence of severe lesions. They also engaged more frequently (p < 0.05) in exploratory behavior, interacting with branched chains and sisal rope, than the DT piglets. During the finishing phase, tail biting was observed only in the NDT piglets (p = 0.001). The NDT piglets that did not require the contingency plan exhibited lower fear responses (p = 0.02) during human interactions in the nursery phase than the DT piglets. Conversely, the NDT piglets that required a contingency plan showed higher fear levels (p < 0.001). Productivity performance was not affected (p > 0.05), and new cases of tail biting ceased after the contingency plan was implemented. The number of animals that died or were removed did not differ between the treatments (p > 0.05). In conclusion, managing piglets with intact tails on commercial farms presents a significant welfare challenge. By contrast, docking the final third of the tail, in accordance with regulations, was associated with fewer negative welfare outcomes, even when best management practices were applied.

AB  - The widespread use of atrazine (ATR), a commonly applied herbicide, has raised growing concerns about its neurotoxic effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ATR disrupts hippocampal function by inducing Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Using both in vivo and in vitro tests, we show that ATR exposure leads to mitochondrial swelling, cristae loss, and fragmentation in hippocampal neurons, correlating with impaired spatial learning and memory. ATR significantly increases Ser616-Drp1 phosphorylation, promoting excessive mitochondrial fission and exacerbating neuronal damage. In contrast, the Drp1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 effectively restores mitochondrial integrity, mitigates mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and alleviates neurotoxicity. Interestingly, ATR exposure results in a non-linear response in the expression of mitochondrial regulatory genes, suggesting complex dose-dependent effects. These findings provide novel insights into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in ATR-induced cognitive impairment and underscore the importance of Drp1-mediated fission in herbicide neurotoxicity. Our study highlights the need for further investigation into the long-term effects of ATR exposure and suggests that targeting mitochondrial dynamics may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for ATR-induced neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - Synaptic structural plasticity, key to long-term memory storage, requires translation of localized RNAs delivered by long-distance transport from the neuronal cell body. Mechanisms and regulation of this system remain elusive. Here, we explore the roles of KIF5C and KIF3A, two members of kinesin superfamily of molecular motors (Kifs), and find that loss of function of either kinesin decreases dendritic arborization and spine density whereas gain of function of KIF5C enhances it. KIF5C function is a rate-determining component of local translation and is associated with similar to 650 RNAs, including EIF3G, a regulator of translation initiation, and plasticity-associated RNAs. Loss of function of KIF5C in dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons constrains both spatial and contextual fear memory, whereas gain of function specifically enhances spatial memory and extinction of contextual fear. KIF5C-mediated long-distance transport of local translation substrates proves a key mechanism underlying structural plasticity and memory.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of citicoline and silymarin nanomicelles (SMnm) in repeated restraint stress (RRS). Method: Mice were exposed to RRS for four consecutive days, 2 hrs. daily. On day 5 of the study, SMnm (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) and citicoline (25 and 75 mg/kg), and a combination of them (25 mg/kg, i.p.) were initiated. On day 18, anxiety-like behavior, behavioral despair, and exploratory behavior were evaluated. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus were dissected measuring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) through Western Blot and ELISA, respectively. Results: In RR-exposed mice, anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) was enhanced by reductions in open arm time (OAT%) P < 0.001, and open arm entry (OAE%) P < 0.001. In the forced swimming test (FST), the immobility increased P < 0.001 while the swimming and climbing reduced P < 0.001. In the open field test (OFT), general motor activity was raised P < 0.05. Further, body weights reduced P < 0.001, and tissue BDNF and pCREB expressions decreased P < 0.001 while TNF-alpha increased P < 0.001. Conversely, SMnm, citicoline and their combination could reduce anxiety-like behavior P < 0.001. The combination group reduced the depressivelike behaviors P < 0.001. Moreover, body weights were restored P < 0.001. Besides, BDNF and pCREB expressions increased while TNF-alpha reduced, P < 0.001. Conclusion: The combination synergistically improved emotion-like behaviors, alleviating the inflammation and upregulating the hippocampal BDNF-mediated CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Neuroinflammation and fever are the main triggers in febrile seizures (FS). Focusing on inflammatory pathways and anti-inflammatory drugs could compensate for the limitations of existing medications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of specific antagonizing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), as a prominent inflammatory axis, on the consequences of FS and adulthood using animal models. Complex FS was induced on 9-11 day old male rat pups using a heated chamber. TAK-242, as a specific TLR4 inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally before seizure induction. Seizure threshold, duration, and spike number were measured by electrocorticography. The levels of inflammatory cytokines, TLR4 protein expression, and oxidative stress markers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assessments in the cortex and hippocampus. Also, spatial and non-spatial memory were evaluated using the novel object recognition test (NORT) and double Y-maze test during adulthood. The results revealed that provoked inflammatory responses in neonate rats, after FS, were associated with the increase of the tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and enhanced TLR4 protein expression. Meanwhile, based on performed behavioral tests, the inflammatory process was also involved in adulthood memory deficit. Pretreatment with TAK-242 reduced the inflammatory cytokines and TLR4 protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus of neonate rats and improvement in memory deficit in NORT and double Y-maze tasks. Also, pretreatment with TAK-242 elevated seizure threshold, SOD, and CAT activities, and decreased seizure duration and MDA level with no significant change in spike number. TAK-242 possibly controlled FS via inhibiting inflammation.

AB  - Louse flies (Diptera, Hippoboscidae) are ectoparasites often found on birds. As they spend most of their life on their host, they are not often collected or studied. Hence, little is known about their species richness and prevalence on raptors in Canada. In this study, louse flies were collected from 184 out of 1467 raptors examined during the 2020 fall migration in southern Ontario, Canada, giving an overall prevalence of 12.5%. In total, 256 louse fly specimens were collected (mean intensity = 1.41) representing four species (identified morphologically, with support of DNA barcoding): Icosta americana (91.9%), Ornithomya anchineuria (0.3%), O. avicularia (7.3%) and O. bequaerti (0.3%). Mite clusters were found on 42% of O. avicularia. This study also presents the first North American record for O. avicularia and the presence of O. bequaerti in Europe was confirmed for the first time. Based on the different parameters recorded during banding, it appears that the host species and the month play a part in the presence of louse flies on the host. Further study of louse flies is needed to better understand their prevalence across different bird groups and geographic distribution.

AB  - Non-crop flora is often used on arable lands to augment beneficial arthropods in cropping systems. Though there may be an enhancement in the abundance of beneficials, this increase may be limited to crop borders or may not result in greater herbivore suppression. French marigold (Tagetes patula L.) was evaluated as an insectary plant for sweet corn (Zea mays L.) and compared with monoculture sweet corn plots. Several families of parasitoids and predators representing multiple taxa were attracted to marigold plants and more parasitoids were captured on sticky card traps located at the margins of sweet corn plots bordered by marigold as opposed to margins of sweet corn plots without marigold strips. Still, similar numbers of predators and/or parasitoids were found on sweet corn plants and/or card traps within the border and interior rows of sweet corn plots in both treatments. Furthermore, the percentage of sweet corn ears with herbivore feeding damage was similar in marigold diver-sified and monoculture sweet corn plots. Though marigold attracted some beneficial insects, it may not result in enhanced biological control of herbivorous pests in sweet corn plantings.

AB  - The present study had two aims: molecular characterization of Hyalomma dromedarii infesting one-humped camels of Haryana (North India), and assessment of the acaricidal potential of herbal methanolic extracts against H. dromedarii larvae in comparison to synthetic acaricides. Phylogenetics and population neutrality indices were assessed by targeting partial amplification of mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences. Larval packet test (LPT) was performed to evaluate the acaricidal efficacy of herbal extracts (Ferula asafoetida and Trachyspermum ammi) and synthetic acaricides (deltamethrin and fipronil). Phylogenetic studies established the collected ticks to be H. dromedarii, exhibiting a homology of 99.8-100%. However, the present study isolates formed a different sub-clade compared to H. dromedarii sequences from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity values were indicative of demographic expansion and low gene flow. Negative values of Tajima's D (-0.612) and Fu and Li's Fst (-0.479) highlighted deviations from neutrality and emphasized recent population expansion. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values recorded for T. ammi, F. asafoetida and their combination were 3.68, 2.87 and 2.59 mg/mL, respectively, whereas the 90% lethal concentration (LC90) values were 4.09, 3.58 and 3.35 mg/mL, respectively. It was also observed that the H. dromedarii population under study was completely susceptible to both the formulated synthetic acaricides. In conclusion, combination of methanolic extracts of F. asafoetida and T. ammi could provide a potential substitute to toxic synthetic chemical acaricides and might prove a valuable component of integrated tick management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) due to Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains a major cause of economic losses for the pig industry. Therapy to combat PWD typically consists of antibiotic treatment or supplementation of zinc oxide to the feed. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance and new EU regulations prompt the need for alternative control strategies, such as immunization. The aim of the field study was to evaluate the effect of an oral live non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine on piglet performance, health, and antimicrobial use. We compared 10 batches receiving a standard antimicrobial control treatment to 10 batches vaccinated with the oral E. coli vaccine. The vaccine-treated groups demonstrated a significant improvement in performance, mortality weight, and antimicrobial use. In addition, secondary infections due to Streptococcus suis in the second part of nursery were reduced, as indicated by the reduction in amoxicillin use. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of an oral live non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine for the active immunization of piglets against PWD under field conditions. Therefore, vaccination against PWD may be considered a valuable alternative for strengthening piglet performance while meeting the new EU requirements concerning the prudent use of antimicrobials in intensive pig production. Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) due to Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains a major cause of economic losses for the pig industry.

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance to E. coli and new EU regulations prompt the need for alternative control strategies, such as immunization. The aim of the field study was to evaluate the effect of an oral live non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine on piglet performance, health, and antimicrobial use. We evaluated vaccination with an oral live non-pathogenic E. coli F4/F18 under field conditions in 10 consecutive batches against a standard antimicrobial treatment in 10 historical control batches. The vaccine-treated groups demonstrated a significant improvement in feed conversion rate, mortality weight, and antimicrobial use. From a general health perspective, secondary infections due to Streptococcus suis (S. suis) in the second part of nursery were markedly reduced, as indicated by the reduction in amoxicillin use. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of an oral live non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine for active immunization of piglets against PWD under field conditions. The vaccine-treated groups showed an improvement in several economically important performance parameters while reducing the overall antimicrobial use and infection pressure due to S. suis. Therefore, vaccination against PWD may be considered a valuable alternative for consolidating piglet performance while meeting the new EU requirements concerning the prudent use of antimicrobials in intensive pig production.

AB  - Background Neuroinflammation has been identified as one of the primary pathogenic factors of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). However, there are no dedicated treatments available in clinics to alleviate neuroinflammation in NPSLE. It has been proposed that stimulating basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons may provide potent anti-inflammatory effects in several inflammatory diseases, but its potential role in NPSLE remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate whether and how stimulating BF cholinergic neurons has a protective effect on NPSLE.
   Results Optogenetic stimulation of BF cholinergic neurons significantly ameliorated olfactory dysfunction and anxiety- and depression-like phenotype in pristane induced lupus (PIL) mice. The increased expression of adhesion molecules (P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)), leukocyte recruitment, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage were significantly decreased. Notably, the brain histopathological changes, including the elevated levels of Lpro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 ss), IgG deposition in the choroid plexus and lateral ventricle wall and lipofuscin accumulation in the cortical and hippocampal neurons, were also significantly attenuated. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization between the BF cholinergic projections and the cerebral vessels, and the expression of a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR) on the cerebral vessels.
   Conclusion Our data indicate that stimulation of BF cholinergic neurons could play a neuroprotective role in the brain through its cholinergic anti-inflammatory effects on cerebral vessels. Therefore, this may be a promising preventive target for NPSLE.

AB  - The deuterium content modification in an organism has a neuroprotective effect during the hypoxia model, affecting anxiety, memory and stress resistance. The aim of this work was to elucidate the possible mechanisms of the medium D/H composition modification on nerve cells. We studied the effect of an incubation medium with a 50 ppm deuterium content compared to a medium with 150 ppm on: (1) the activity of Wistar rats' hippocampus CA1 field neurons, (2) the level of cultured cerebellar neuron death during glucose deprivation and temperature stress, (3) mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the generation of reactive oxygen species in cultures of cerebellar neurons. The results of the analysis showed that the incubation of hippocampal sections in a medium with a 50 ppm deuterium reduced the amplitude of the pop-spike. The restoration of neuron activity was observed when sections were returned to the incubation medium with a 150 ppm deuterium content. An environment with a 50 ppm deuterium did not significantly affect the level of reactive oxygen species in neuron cultures, while MMP decreased by 16-20%. In experiments with glucose deprivation and temperature stress, the medium with 50 ppm increased the death of neurons. Thus, a short exposure of nerve cells in the medium with 50 ppm deuterium acts as an additional stressful factor, which is possibly associated with the violation of the cell energy balance. The decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is known to be associated with ATP synthesis, indicates that this effect may be associated with the cell energy imbalance. The decrease in the activity of the CA1 field hippocampal neurons may reflect reversible adaptive changes in the operation of fast-reacting ion channels.

AB  - A novel indoor positioning method for a pigsty based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is proposed via reasonably arranging the base stations and positioning tags, which can provide strong support for the accurate positioning of specific pig pens in the pig house. The distribution of Dilution of Precision (DOP) values is analyzed in different deployment schemes which include the amount, the height, the deployment shape, and the distance of the base stations through positioning simulation. Moreover, the positioning effect of dynamic following positioning, the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the variance of static positioning are measured. It is noteworthy that the Kalman filtering algorithm is adopted to smooth the dynamic following positioning experimental data for reducing the positioning error. The simulated results show that the DOP values decrease with the increase in height and distance, and these results and laws are consistent with the experimental results. However, the DOP values are best reached when the height is from 1.75 m to 2.75 m, and the distance is over 3.00 m. Furthermore, the DOP values of quadrilateral deployment are smaller than the ones of triangular deployment. In addition, the variance of static positioning and dynamic following positioning is decreased by utilizing the Kalman filtering algorithm. Therefore, the excellent positioning system and its solutions in a pigsty can be provided by our proposed indoor positioning method.

AB  - We recently developed a combination of four chemiluminescence-based assays for selective detection of different nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, including nitrite, S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), heme-nitrosyl (heme-NO), and dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs). However, these NO species (NOx) may be under dynamic equilibria during sample handling, which affects the final determination made from the readout of assays. Using fetal and maternal sheep from low and high altitudes (300 and 3801 m, respectively) as models of different NOx levels and compositions, we tested the hypothesis that sample handling introduces artifacts in chemiluminescence assays of NOx. Here, we demonstrate the following: (1) room temperature placement is associated with an increase and decrease in NOx in plasma and whole blood samples, respectively; (2) snap freezing and thawing lead to the interconversion of different NOx in plasma; (3) snap freezing and homogenization in liquid nitrogen eliminate a significant fraction of NOx in the aorta of stressed animals; (4) A "stop solution" commonly used to preserve nitrite and SNOs leads to the interconversion of different NOx in blood, while deproteinization results in a significant increase in detectable NOx; (5) some reagents widely used in sample pretreatments, such as mercury chloride, acid sulfanilamide, N-ethylmaleimide, ferricyanide, and anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, have unintended effects that destabilize SNO, DNICs, and/or heme-NO; (6) blood, including the residual blood clot left in the washed purge vessel, quenches the signal of nitrite when using ascorbic acid and acetic acid as the purge vessel reagent; and (7) new limitations to the four chemiluminescence-based assays. This study points out the need for re-evaluation of previous chemiluminescence measurements of NOx, and calls for special attention to be paid to sample handling, as it can introduce significant artifacts into NOx assays.

AB  - Chemical investigations into solid phase cultivations of an Australian sheep station pasture plant derived Streptomyces sp. CMB-PB042 yielded the rare enamine naphthopyranoquinones BE-54238A (1) and BE-54238B (2), together with four new analogues, glenthenamines B-D (4-6) and F (8), and two handling artifacts, glenthenamines A (3) and E (7). Single-crystal X-ray analyses of 1 and 2 resolved configurational ambiguities in the scientific literature, while detailed spectroscopic analysis and biosynthetic considerations assigned structures inclusive of absolute configuration to 3-8. We propose a plausible sequence of biosynthetic transformations linking structural and configurational features of 1-8 and apply a novel Schiff base "fishing" approach to detect a key deoxyaminosugar precursor. These enamine naphthopyranoquinones disclose a new P-gp inhibitory pharmacophore capable of reversing doxorubicin resistance in P-gp overexpressing colon carcinoma cells.

AB  - Morphological alterations in dendritic spines have been linked to changes in functional communication between neurons that affect learning and memory. Kinesin-4 KIF21A helps organize the microtubule-actin network at the cell cortex by interacting with KANK1; however, whether KIF21A modulates dendritic structure and function in neurons remains unknown. In this study, we found that KIF21A was distributed in a subset of dendritic spines, and that these KIF21A-positive spines were larger and more structurally plastic than KIF21A-negative spines. Furthermore, the interaction between KIF21A and KANK1 was found to be critical for dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Knockdown of either KIF21A or KANK1 inhibited dendritic spine morphogenesis and dendritic branching, and these deficits were fully rescued by coexpressing full-length KIF21A or KANK1, but not by proteins with mutations disrupting direct binding between KIF21A and KANK1 or binding between KANK1 and talin1. Knocking down KIF21A in the hippocampus of rats inhibited the amplitudes of long-term potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation and negatively impacted the animals' cognitive abilities. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the function of KIF21A in modulating spine morphology and provide insight into its role in synaptic function.

AB  - Intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of diabetogenic drug streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents consistently produces a model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) which is characterized by tau pathology and concomitant cognitive decline, insulin resistance, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial malfunction. Paeonol is an active phenolic component in some medicinal plants like Cortex Moutan with neuroprotective efficacy via exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. This study was conducted to assess beneficial effect of paeonol in amelioration of cognitive deficits in ICV STZ rat model of sAD. STZ (3 mg/kg) was microinjected into the lateral ventricles on days 0 and 2, and paeonol was given p.o. at two doses of 25 (low) or 100 (high) mg/kg from day 0 (post-surgery) till day 24 post-STZ. Cognitive performance was evaluated in different tasks, and oxidative stress- and inflammation-related parameters were measured in addition to immunohistochemical assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a marker of astrocytes. Paeonol at the higher dose ameliorated cognitive deficits in Barnes maze, novel object recognition (NOR) task, Y maze, and passive avoidance test. In addition, paeonol partially reversed hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione reductase, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Paeonol treatment was also associated with lower hippocampal immunoreactivity for GFAP. This study showed that paeonol can alleviate cognitive disturbances in ICV STZ rat model of sAD via ameliorating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and also through its attenuation of astrogliosis.

AB  - A developing understanding suggests that spatial compartmentalisation in pancreatic beta cells is critical in controlling insulin secretion. To investigate the mechanisms, we have developed live-cell subcellular imaging methods using the mouse organotypic pancreatic slice. We demonstrate that the organotypic pancreatic slice, when compared with isolated islets, preserves intact beta-cell structure, and enhances glucose-dependent Ca2+ responses and insulin secretion. Using the slice technique, we have discovered the essential role of local activation of integrins and the downstream component, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in regulating beta cells. Integrins and FAK are exclusively activated at the beta-cell capillary interface and using in situ and in vitro models we show their activation both positions presynaptic scaffold proteins, like ELKS and liprin, and regulates glucose-dependent Ca2+ responses and insulin secretion. We conclude that FAK orchestrates the final steps of glucose-dependent insulin secretion within the restricted domain where beta-cell contact the islet capillaries.

AB  - Ouabain (OUA) is a cardiotonic steroid that modulates Na+, K+ -ATPase activity. OUA has been identified as an endogenous substance that is present in human plasma, and it has been shown to be associated with the response to acute stress in both animals and humans. Chronic stress is a major aggravating factor in psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. The present work investigates the effects of the intermittent administration of OUA (1.8 mu g/kg) during the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol in a rat's central nervous system (CNS). The results suggest that the intermittent OUA treatment reversed CUS-induced HPA axis hyperactivity through a reduction in (i) glucocorticoids levels, (ii) CRH-CRHR1 expression, and by decreasing neuroinflammation with a reduction in iNOS activity, without interfering with the expression of antioxidant enzymes. These changes in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus may reflect in the rapid extinction of aversive memory. The present data demonstrate the ability of OUA to modulate the HPA axis, as well as to revert CUS-induced long-term spatial memory deficits.

AB  - Third-party interventions may regulate conflicts to reduce aggression and promote cohesion amongst group members, but are rarely documented in ungulates. The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) lives in mixed-sex herds of hundreds of individuals in Neotropical forests, which are likely to benefit from mechanisms that sustain social cohesiveness. We examined third-party conflict interventions between individuals in captive groups of white-lipped peccaries. During a period of 60 days, we recorded agonistic interactions and occurrences of thirdparty conflict interventions, and estimated the genetic relatedness between the individuals involved using multilocus microsatellite genotypes. Most third-party conflict interventions were by the dominant male of each group, resulting in conflict termination 100% of the time. Our results also revealed that white-lipped peccaries favour their closest relatives and that individuals showed lower levels of aggression towards kin than to non-kin, and interventions on behalf of kin were more frequent than on behalf of non-kin. Our findings support the idea that genetic relatedness is fundamental in both social structure and third-party conflict interventions in this species, allowing us to suggest that kin selection could have a key role in the evolution of social behaviour of white-lipped peccaries.

AB  - The auditory biology of Monachinae seals is poorly understood. Limited audiometric data and certain anatomical features suggest that these seals may have reduced sensitivity to airborne sounds compared to related species. Here, we describe the in-air hearing abilities of a Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) trained to participate in a psychophysical paradigm. We report absolute (unmasked) thresholds for narrowband signals measured in quiet conditions across the range of hearing and masked thresholds measured in the presence of octave-band noise at two frequencies. The behavioral audiogram indicates a functional hearing range from 0.1 to 33 kHz and poor sensitivity, with detection thresholds above 40 dB re 20 mu Pa. Critical ratio measurements are elevated compared to those of other seals. The apparently reduced terrestrial hearing ability of this individual-considered with available auditory data for a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris)-suggests that hearing in Monachinae seals differs from that of the highly sensitive Phocinae seals. Exploration of phylogenetic relationships and anatomical traits support this claim. This work advances understanding of the evolution of hearing in amphibious marine mammals and provides updated information that can be used for management and conservation of endangered Hawaiian monk seals.

AB  - Current antipsychotics have limited effects on the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia patients, therefore, cognitive remediation has been applied to schizophrenia patients to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. However, the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive training programs have not been well studied because established animal models are not suitable or because repetitive training has not been introduced in such animal models. In the present study, we employed Toll-like receptor 2 knockout (TLR2 KO) mouse as a schizophrenia mouse model and evaluated the effects of repetitive training as cognitive remediation therapy for schizophrenia. TLR2 KO mice could fully learn the Barnes maze paradigm through repetitive training to improve memory retrieval and reversal learning ability, although the learning speed was slower than that of wild-type (WT) animals. In addition, highly repetitive training activated the neuronal cells in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampal CA3 and hippocampal DG regions of TLR2 KO mice, similar to WT mice. These results indicated that TLR2 KO mouse would be a useful tool for studying the neumbiological mechanisms of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia.

AB  - N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is essential for RNA metabolism in cells. The YTH domain, conserved in the kingdom of Eukaryotes, acts as an m(6)A reader that binds m(6)A-containing RNA. In plants, the YTH domain is involved in plant hormone signaling, stress response regulation, RNA stability, translation, and differentiation. However, little is known about the YTH genes in tea-oil tree, which can produce edible oil with high nutritional value. This study aims to identify and characterize the YTH domains within the tea-oil tree (Camellia chekiangoleosa Hu) genome to predict their potential role in development and stress regulation. In this study, 10 members of the YTH family containing the YTH domain named CchYTH1-10 were identified from C. chekiangoleosa. Through analysis of their physical and chemical properties and prediction of subcellular localization, it is known that most family members are located in the nucleus and may have liquid-liquid phase separation. Analysis of cis-acting elements in the CchYTH promoter region revealed that these genes could be closely related to abiotic stress and hormones. The results of expression profiling show that the CchYTH genes were differentially expressed in different tissues, and their expression levels change under drought stress. Overall, these findings could provide a foundation for future research regarding CchYTHs in C. chekiangoleosa and enrich the world in terms of epigenetic mark m(6)A in forest trees.

AB  - Neuronal death and synaptic loss are major pathogensis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be related to the ionic glutamate receptors abnormality. Ionic glutamate receptors are important postsynaptic membrane receptors that regulate excitatory synaptic transmission and are also major component of the postsynaptic density. Beta-Amyloid (A beta) attacks ionic glutamate receptors to reduce synaptic efficacy and synaptic plasticity, resulting in neuronal death and synaptic loss. The current study aimed to investigate whether exercise-ameliorated AD was associated with changes in ionic glutamate receptors. Transgenic APP/PS1 mice (TgAPP/PS1) and age-matched littermate wild mice were divided into wild type control group, wild type exercise group, transgenic control group and transgenic exercise group. The mice in exercise groups were subjected to treadmill training for 12 weeks. The results showed that 12-week treadmill exercise improved the spatial learning and memory abilities of TgAPP/PS1 mice. Moreover, exercise decreased the contents of A beta 40, A beta 42 and amyloid plaque deposition in hippocampus of TgAPP/PS1 mice. The number of synapses and the length and thickness of postsynaptic densities (PSD) in the hippocampal CA1 region of TgAPP/PS1 mice were significantly increased after exercise. Concomitantly, TgAPP/PS1 displayed obstacles in synaptic plasticity as evidenced by significant decreases in the levels of synaptic structural plasticity-related proteins SYN, PSD95, MAP2 and NCAM, as well as ionic glutamate neuroreceptor subunit proteins GluN2B and GluA1. Interestingly, exercise alleviated these synaptic plasticity disorder in TgAPP/PS1 mice. Thus, this study demonstrates that 12-week treadmill exercise reduces A beta levels in the hippocampus and mitigates cognitive decline in TgAPP/PS1 mice, which may be mediated by improvements in synaptic structural plasticity and excitatory neurotransmission.

AB  - The consumption of sprouts has been steadily increasing due to their being an excellent source of nutrition. It is known that the bioactive constituents of legumes can be increased after germination. In this study, the extract from Senna tora sprouts is shown to exhibit improved radical scavenging activities and better neuroprotective effects in HT22 hippocampal neuronal (HT22) and R28 retina precursor (R28) cells than those from seeds due to an increased content of phenolic constituents, especially compounds 1 and 3-6. A phytochemical investigation of S. tora sprouts resulted in the isolation of two new naphthopyrone glycosides (1-2) with 27 previously reported compounds. Their structures were determined via interpreting spectroscopic data. Compounds 1 and 3-6 were found to possess radical scavenging activities and neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in both neuronal cells.

AB  - A prevailing assumption in the cardiovascular field is that the metabolic rate of the heart is a constant proportion of a mammal's whole-body aerobic metabolic rate. In this Commentary, we assemble previously published cardiovascular, metabolic and body mass data from matched terrestrial mammalian species, at rest and during heavy exercise, and reveal scaling relationships that challenge this assumption. Our analyses indicate that the fractional metabolic cost of systemic perfusion compared with whole-body metabolic rate increases significantly with body size among resting mammals, from 2.5% in a mouse to 10% in an elephant. We propose that two significant body size-dependent effects contribute to this conclusion; namely, that larger species generate higher mean systemic arterial blood pressure and that their myocardium operates with lower external mechanical efficiencies compared with those of smaller species. We discuss potential physiological and mechanical explanations, including the additional energy needed to support the arterial blood column above the heart in larger species, especially those with long necks, as well as the possible sources of greater internal energy losses from the heart of larger species. Thus, we present an updated view of how increasing blood pressure and decreasing efficiency of the myocardium result in an increasing fractional metabolic cost of perfusion as body size increases among resting mammals.

AB  - Rodents produce a variety of acoustic signals to communicate different types of information such as identity, reproductive state, or danger. The degree to which hearing sensitivity matches particular frequencies of conspecific vocalizations may provide insight into the relative importance of different acoustic signals. In this experiment, we characterized vocal and footdrumming behaviors of white-throated woodrats (Neotoma albigula) and measured their hearing sensitivity using the auditory brainstem response. Adult and juvenile woodrats produced seven categories of vocalizations, with six categories containing frequencies that overlap their peak hearing sensitivity. In addition, woodrats produced low-frequency footdrumming signals in the presence of same- and opposite-sex social partners and in social isolation. Woodrats varied spectral and temporal characteristics of vocalizations based on social composition of the dyad. Woodrat audition spanned 1 to 42 kHz, with a broad range of best hearing sensitivity between 4 and 20 kHz. Compared to other rodents that primarily produce high-frequency vocalizations in social contexts, woodrat audition was more sensitive to low frequencies that typify their vocal repertoire. Our results suggest that the auditory system of white-throated woodrats is broadly tuned to detect behaviorally relevant acoustic signals.

AB  - Sleep is essential for important physiological functions. Impairment of learning and memory function caused by lack of sleep is a common physiological phenomenon of which underlying changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus are not well understood. The possible different effects of sleep deprivation (SD) lasting for various durations on learning and memory function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity are still not completely clear. In this study, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce rapid eye movement SD (REM SD), lasting for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, separately. The novel place recognition (NPR) and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks were used to test the novelty-related object recognition memory (ORM) and object location memory (OLM) of mice. Then, hippocampal synaptic plasticity was evaluated after all behavioural experiments. The results showed that REM SD played a key role in OLM but not in ORM. Specifically, 24 h REM SD improved novelty-related OLM, accompanied by a significantly increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, including gain of dendritic spines, increased expression of hippocampal GluA1, and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas 48 h REM SD showed no effect on OLM or the hippocampal synaptic plasticity mentioned above; however, 72 h REM SD impaired novelty-related OLM and weakened hippocampal synaptic plasticity, including serious loss of dendritic spines, decreased expression of hippocampal GluA1, and significantly attenuated LTP. Our results suggest that REM SD of various durations has different effects on both novelty-related OLM and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is one of the most common types of autoimmune encephalitis, primarily presenting with prodromal symptoms, such as fever and headache, followed by a range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Chaihu Guizhi Decoction (CGD), a traditional Chinese medicine formulated by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han Dynasty, has been effectively used in clinical practice to treat the symptoms of Taiyang and Shaoyang disorders, including fever, headache, and psychiatric disorders. Aim of the study: To demonstrate the protective effects of CGD in an animal model of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and explore the potential mechanisms involved. Materials and methods: UHPLC-HRMS was used to identify CGD's chemical components and serum metabolomic profiles. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were performed to predict potential targets of CGD for the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The effect of CGD on anti-NMDAR encephalitis was evaluated using a mouse model induced by patients' antibodies. Behavioral tests were performed to assess cognitive impairment and schizophrenia-like behaviors. The effect of CGD on the cell-surface NMDAR GluN1 subunit in cultured neurons treated with patient antibodies was detected by immunofluorescence. Golgi staining was used to observe morphological changes in hippocampal dendrites. The expression of NMDAR-interacting proteins and various neuroreceptors in the hippocampus were examined to validate the targets predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking. Results: CGD alleviated cognitive, memory, and sensorimotor gating deficits in mice treated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients' antibodies. Further experiments demonstrated the effect of CGD in preventing NMDAR reduction both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, CGD regulated NMDAR-interacting proteins and dopamine receptors but did not affect hippocampal dendritic morphology and synaptic density. Additionally, CGD modifies metabolic pathways associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: CGD exhibited protective effects against anti-NMDAR encephalitis by mitigating the antibody-induced reduction in NMDAR and NMDAR-interacting proteins.

AB  - Behaviors and auditory physiological responses of some species of echolocating bats remain unaffected after exposure to intense noise, but information on the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Here, we studied whether the vocalization-induced middle ear muscle (MEM) contractions (MEM reflex) and auditory fovea contributed to the unimpaired auditory sensitivity of constant frequency-frequency modulation (CF-FM) bats after exposure to broad-band intense noise. The vocalizations of the CF-FM bat, Hipposideros pratti, were inhibited through anesthesia to eliminate the vocalization-induced MEM reflex. First, the anesthetized bats were exposed to intense broad-band noise, and the findings showed that the bats could still maintain their auditory sensitivities. However, auditory sensitivities were seriously impaired in CBA/Ca mice exposed to intense noise under anesthesia. This indicated that the unimpaired auditory sensitivity in H. pratti after exposure to intense noise under anesthesia was not due to anesthetization. The bats were further exposed to low-frequency band-limited noise, whose passband did not overlap with echolocation call frequencies. The results showed that the auditory responses to sound frequencies within the noise spectrum and one-half octave higher than the spectrum were also unimpaired. Taken together, the results indicate that both vocalization-induced MEM reflex and auditory fovea do not contribute to the unimpaired auditory sensitivity in H. pratti after exposure to intense noise. The possible mechanisms underlying the unimpaired auditory sensitivity after echolocating bats were exposed to intense noise are discussed.

AB  - Individual behavioural testing in sheep is common; however, outcomes may be misleading as they are a highly gregarious species that is usually managed in groups. We investigated whether behaviour expressed by 3-4-month-old Merino lambs (n = 220) in social isolation was related to their behaviour towards the same stimuli when three other conspecifics were present, and if measures of temperament (vocalisations and locomotory behaviours) were repeatable across both social situations. Expression of all behaviours were reduced when conspecifics were present, and vocalisations were rarely performed in social groups, suggesting that this behaviour is a response to social isolation. Similarities across the two social situations, in ranked order of how individual lambs expressed each behaviour, indicate that vigilance and attentional orienting towards a human were repeatable (p < 0.001), as was vigilance in a startle test (p < 0.05). However, no clear relationship between behaviours expressed across the two social situations was found. The results of this study suggest that testing sheep individually should be conducted with caution where the outcome is applied to animals managed in groups. Vigilance shows promise as a measure of an underlying trait that is stable across social contexts.

AB  - Ladybird beetles Scymnus nubilus Mulsant, Scymnus interruptus (Goeze), and Hippodamia convergens Gu & eacute;rin-M & eacute;neville are key contributors to biological control of some pests including Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley. This study explores their feeding preferences, functional response, and interference in controlled laboratory conditions. Feeding experiments, including both no-choice and free-choice tests, were conducted at temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 degrees C fed on different developmental stages of P. solenopsis. The study analyzed the functional response with Holling's disc equation and assessed mutual interference among predators using the Hassell and Varley model. In the no-choice feeding tests, H. convergens adults exhibited the highest consumption at 26 degrees C, with values of 46.0 1st instar nymphs, 40.9 2nd instar nymphs, and 34.9 adult females of P. solenopsis, followed by S. interruptus. Free-choice feeding tests also showed a preference for 26 degrees C, with H. convergens consistently consuming the most prey at all stages, followed by S. interruptus. Functional response analysis revealed a type II functional response for three predators. Hippodamia convergens exhibited a significantly higher attack rate (1.0250 h-1) and a shorter handling time (0.0449 h) compared to the other species. Interference among predators was observed, with a progressive decline in prey consumption as predator density increased. Mutual interference constants (m) were calculated as 1.70, 1.74, and 1.77 for S. nubilus, S. interruptus, and H. convergens, respectively. As predator densities increased, searching efficiency declined. This suggest that H. convergens and S. interruptus adults at 26 degrees C with a prey density of 40 can effectively contribute to sustainable P. solenopsis management.

AB  - We aimed to establish efficient donor cells to produce piglets by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) of the endangered Vietnamese I pig. In Experiment 1, we assessed the effects of cell passages on the in vitro development of SCNT embryos. Cells with five and six passages showed significantly cleaved and blastocyst formation rates (86.72 and 86.64; 35.68 and 35.51, respectively, P < 0.05). The highest average total cell number per blastocyst was observed in groups of cells with five and six passages (50.45 and 50.18, respectively). Experiment 2 was performed to assess the sex of donor cells on the subsequent development of SCNT embryos. There was no significant difference in the cleaved and blastocyst formation rates, and the average total cell between female and male groups (86.51 % vs 86.94 % and 35.31 % vs 35.08 %, 50.29 % vs 50.67 %, respectively, P > 0.05). Experiment 3 was performed to assess the effect of cell lines on the development of SCNT embryos. Our results showed no significant difference in the success rate of fibroblast nuclear transfer into recipient oocytes, the cleaved and blastocyst formation rates, and the average total cell number per blastocyst among the cell lines 6004, 9154, 9155, 9156 and 9157 (P > 0.05). Experiment 4 was performed to assess the ability of SCNT embryos to induce pregnancy and to develop term. SCNT embryos were produced from I fibroblast cells established based on the results of Experiments 1, 2 and 3. Transfer of blastocyst stage embryos into 19 recipients (100-120 embryos in each) resulted in 14 pregnancies, in which 8 pregnant females terminated on Day 22-42 and 6 others produced 20 cloned piglets from donor cells of a female pig but 5 piglets died before birth and 15 healthy cloned piglets. However, 3 out of 15 healthy piglets died of unknown causes within 24h of birth and 3 out of 15 healthy piglets died at 3-5 days of age due to diarrhoea, 9 out of 15 healthy piglets are now 3 months of age. Finally, we established a protocol for the donor cell production which enabled the production of the endangered I pig embryos by SCNT and maximized blastocyst production rate by more than 35 % and pregnant rate after the transfer of cloned I pig embryos to recipients at 73.68 % for the first time in Vietnam.

AB  - Sahul unites the world's largest and highest tropical island and the oldest and most arid continent on the back-drop of dynamic environmental conditions. Massive geological uplift in New Guinea is predicted to have acted as a species pump from the late Miocene onward, but the impact of this process on biogeography and diversification remains untested across Sahul as a whole. To address this, we reconstruct the assembly of a recent and diverse radiation of rodents (Murinae: Hydromyini) spanning New Guinea, Australia, and oceanic islands. Using phylogenomic data from 270 specimens, including many recently extinct and highly elusive species, we find that the orogeny and expansion of New Guinea opened ecological opportunity and triggered diversification across a continent. After a single over-water colonization from Asia ca. 8.5 Ma, ancestral Hydromyini were restricted to the tropical rainforest of proto-New Guinea for 3.5 million years. Following a shift in diversification coincident with the orogeny of New Guinea ca. 5 Ma and subsequent colonization of Australia, transitions be-tween geographic regions (n = 24) and biomes (n = 34) become frequent. Recurrent over-water colonization between mainland and islands demonstrate how islands can play a substantial role in the assembly of continental fauna. Our results are consistent with a model of increased ecological opportunity across Sahul following major geological uplift in New Guinea ca. 5 Ma, with sustained diversification facilitated by over-water colonization from the Pleistocene to present. We show how geological processes, biome transitions, and over-water colonization collectively drove the diversification of an expansive continental radiation.

AB  - Phloem-feeding insects include many important agricultural pests that cause crop damage globally, either through feeding-related damage or upon transmission of viruses and microbes that cause plant diseases. With genetic crop resistances being limited to most of these pests, control relies on insecticides, which are costly and damaging to the environment and to which insects can develop resistance. Like other plant parasites, phloem-feeding insects deliver effectors inside their host plants to promote susceptibility, most likely by a combination of suppressing immunity and promoting nutrient availability. The recent emergence of the effector paradigm in plant-insect interactions is highlighted by increasing availability of effector repertoires for a range of species and a broadening of our knowledge concerning effector functions. Here, we focus on recent progress made toward identification of effector repertoires from phloem-feeding insects and developments in effector biology that will advance functional characterization studies. Importantly, identification of effector activities from herbivorous insects promises to provide new avenues toward development of crop protection strategies.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Studies indicating the influence of masticatory dysfunction, due to a soft diet or lack of molars, on impairing spatial memory and learning have led to research about neuronal connections between areas and cell populations possibly affected. In this sense, with scarce detailed data on the subfields of hippocampus in dementia neurodegeneration, there is no information about astrocytic responses in its different layers. Thus, considering this context, the present study evaluated the effects of deprivation and rehabilitation of masticatory activity, aging, and environmental enrichment on the stereological quantification of hippocampal astrocytes from layers CA1, CA3, and DG. For this purpose, we examined mature (6-month-old; 6M), and aged (18-month-old; 18M) mice, subjected to distinct masticatory regimens and environments. Three different regimens of masticatory activity were applied: continuous normal mastication with hard pellets (HD); normal mastication followed by deprived mastication with equal periods of pellets followed by soft powder (HD/SD); or rehabilitated masticatory activity with equal periods of HD, followed by powder, followed by pellets (HD/SD/HD). Under each specific regimen, half of the animals were raised in standard cages (impoverished environment (IE)) and the other half in enriched cages (enriched environment (EE)), mimicking sedentary or active lifestyles. Microscopic stereological, systematic, and random sampling approaches with an optical dissector of GFAP-immunolabeled astrocytes were done, allowing for an astrocyte numerical estimate. Stratum moleculare and hilus, from the dentate gyrus (DG) and Strata Lacunosum-Moleculare, Oriens, and Radiatum, similarly to the dentate gyrus, showed no significant change in any of the investigated variables (age, diet, or environment) in these layers. However, in Stratum radiatum, it was possible to observe significant differences associated with diet regimens and age. Therefore, diet-related differences were found when the HD 18M IE group was compared to the HD/SD/HD 18-month-old group in the same environment (IE) (p = 0.007). In the present study, we present modulatory factors (masticatory function, environmental enrichment, and aging) for the differentiated quantitative laminar response in the hippocampal regions, suggesting other studies to read the plasticity and responsiveness of astrocytes, including the molecular background.

AB  - Weather prediction is the hottest topic in remote sensing to understand natural disasters and their intensity in an early stage. But in many cases, the typical imaging models have resulted in less forecasting rate. Hence, to overcome this problem, a novel buffalo-based Generalized Adversarial Cyclone Intensity Prediction System (BGACIPS) was designed for cyclone intensity prediction using space satellite images. The processed satellite images contained features like rain, snow, Tropical depression (T.Depression), thunderstorms (T.strom), and cyclone. Initially, the noise features were removed in the pre-processing module, and the refined data was entered into the classification layer. Consequently, the analysis of the features was performed, and the intensity of each feature and cyclone stages were identified. Furthermore, the planned design is executed in the python environment, and the improvement score has been analyzed regarding prediction exactness, mean errors, and error rate. Hence, the proposed novel BGACIPS has a lower error rate and higher prediction accuracy than the compared models.

AB  - This article shows the effect that biogases obtained from crop residuals from the Andean region have on the performance of a whole medium-sized electrical-generating gas turbine. This technology could be used to supply electricity in energy-depressed areas where biogas is the only accessible resource. The gas turbine worked with higher efficiencies when the obtained biogases were used compared to natural gas. The biofuel that presented the highest efficiencies was the one obtained from wheat residuals alone. Despite this fact, this biofuel would be the most prone to create aerodynamic problems in the stages of the gas turbine. In this work, it was found that the addition of guinea pig manure to different crop residuals created biofuels less prone to create aerodynamic problems in the compression and expansion stages. In particular, the studied biofuel that had the most similar aerodynamic behavior to the design natural gas case was the one obtained from guinea pig manure and quinoa residuals. On the other hand, this biogas presented the lowest efficiencies of the studied biofuels. Despite this fact, this biofuel showed higher efficiencies than the natural gas case. In the gas turbine combustion chamber, all the studied biofuels operated at lower temperatures than the ones with natural gas, even in the high-power range. This would be an important feature for the running of the combustion chamber and the high-pressure turbine superalloys.

AB  - Cell competition, the elimination of cells surrounded by more fit neighbors, is proposed to suppress tumorigenesis. Mahjong (Mahj), a ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate receptor, has been thought to mediate competition of cells mutated for lethal giant larvae (lgl), a neoplastic tumor suppressor that defines apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells. Here, we show that Drosophila cells mutated for mahjong, but not for lgl [l(2)gl], are competed because they express the bZip-domain transcription factor Xrp1, already known to eliminate cells heterozygous for ribosomal protein gene mutations (Rp/+ cells). Xrp1 expression in mahj mutant cells results in activation of JNK signaling, autophagosome accumulation, eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and lower translation, just as in Rp/+ cells. Cells mutated for damage DNA binding-protein 1 (ddb1; pic) or cullin 4 (cul4), which encode E3 ligase partners of Mahj, also display Xrp1-dependent phenotypes, as does knockdown of proteasome subunits. Our data suggest a new model of mahj-mediated cell competition that is independent of apical-basal polarity and couples Xrp1 to protein turnover.

AB  - Environmental enrichment and social isolation constitute two well-studied experimental manipulations that result in several behavioral, neural, and molecular changes in rodents. Enrichment is linked to enhanced cognitive performance, and mitigation of different nervous system injuries and disorders. In contrast, social isolation or impoverished environment often induce negative effects on cognitive and affective systems. Both manipulations are typically examined with a short-term or chronic exposure, which cannot capture the actual human experiences. In this study, we explored the behavioral and neural alterations led by intermittent environmental enrichment or social isolation in adult Wistar rats. Animals were assigned to an enriched condition (EC), isolation/impoverished condition (IC), or standard condition (SC). The differential housing protocol involved transferring the animals to their respective cages for two days at the end of each five-day standard housing period for 8 weeks. Enriched animals exhibited behavioral despair in the forced swim test without differential overall locomotor activity. In the Morris water maze, impoverished animals displayed a slower learning rate compared to the SC and EC groups. In line with this, the IC group had fewer parvalbumin (PV) immunopositive (+) cells in the CA1 and dentate gyrus. No differences were observed in PV+ cell levels in the amygdala, while the IC group had more c-Fos+ cells in the same region following acute restraint stress. These findings implicate that intermittent isolation or enrichment are sufficient to trigger distinct behavioral changes at the cognitive and affective domains, and pinpoint PV as a biomarker for environmentally induced alterations in hippocampal memory performance.

AB  - A comprehensive GC-MS based metabolome analysis was conducted by analyzing the differential solvent derivatized extracts of leaves of male and female seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L. and H. salicifolia D.Don) plants collected from three diverse regions of the Indian Himalayas, namely Himachal Pradesh, Union Territory of Ladakh, and Uttarakhand. The quantified peak intensity of metabolites was matched with the standard compounds present in the different libraries of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, including NIST14, NIST14s, and Wiley8. Multivariate analysis tools, PLS-DA and VIP plots, provided a comparative analysis of gender-based metabolomic diversity prevailing in the different geographical regions. The GC-MS profiling and PLS-DA supervised approach revealed 58 metabolites, of which 25 metabolites were considered as significant at Variable Importance Projection (VIP > 1, p < 0.05). The PLS-DA-VIP plot revealed marked expression of 21 crucial metabolites in H. rhamnoides female collections from Himachal Pradesh comparative to only two metabolites in male collections. Nineteen metabolites were highly expressed in H. rhamnoides female samples from Union Territory of Ladakh comparative to only seven metabolites highly expressed in the male collections. Similarly, 20 metabolites were over-expressed in H. salicifolia female collections from Uttarakhand regions comparative to four metabolites in the male collection. An overall higher expression of metabolites was observed in the female collections compared to male collections representing different regions. The comprehensive comparative metabolome analysis allowed the identification of gender-specific and region-specific metabolomic discriminators. The findings of the present study provide valuable information for the identification of crucial metabolites in male and female collections of seabuckthorn, useful for their industrial applications.

AB  - Simple Summary Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA that does not produce proteins but plays crucial roles in diverse metabolic processes, including cellular development and differentiation, the regulation of protein production, the inactivation of genes and chromosomes, and gamete formation. Despite their recognized importance, there is a limited understanding of how these molecules function in pigs, particularly during fetal development. For this reason, we conducted this exploratory work, in which we aimed to identify and characterize potential novel lncRNAs in the initial fetal phase of pigs. We have not only identified potentially new lncRNAs but also identified that some of them have sex-specific expression. In the current study, hundreds of potential and already described lncRNAs were identified This allows for the expansion of our knowledge about genomics and transcriptomics in pigs, while also providing novel RNA sequences for the genomic databases of these species. This is particularly important as we are providing data for the international community regarding a research theme that is at its early stages. The potential novel lncRNAs identified in our study provide a basis for future research on their biological functions in a highly important livestock species.Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding transcripts involved in various biological processes. The Y chromosome is known for determining the male sex in mammals. LncRNAs on the Y chromosome may play important regulatory roles. However, knowledge about their action mechanisms is still limited, especially during early fetal development. Therefore, we conducted this exploratory study aiming to identify, characterize, and investigate the differential expression of lncRNAs between male and female swine fetuses at 35 days of gestation. RNA-Seq libraries from 10 fetuses were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina platform. After sequencing, a data quality control was performed using Trimmomatic, alignment with HISAT2, and transcript assembly with StringTie. The differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using the limma package of the R software (4.3.1). A total of 871 potentially novel lncRNAs were identified and characterized. Considering differential expression, eight lncRNAs were upregulated in male fetuses. One was mapped onto SSC12 and seven were located on the Y chromosome; among them, one lncRNA is potentially novel. These lncRNAs are involved in diverse functions, including the regulation of gene expression and the modulation of chromosomal structure. These discoveries enable future studies on lncRNAs in the fetal stage in pigs.

AB  - Background: Opium addiction can affect various organs such as the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain. The hippocampus is one of the brain regions affected early on in Alzheimer's disease and has a vital role in neurogenesis, cognitive function, and memory. This region also is sensitive to oxidative stress and pathophysiological alterations. Hence, this study evaluated the effects of opium on memory and learning, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of male addicted rats. Since, the hormonal alterations in female arts can affect immune response, metabolism, and behavior, we have selected male rats. Methods: Male rats were randomly divided into two groups: control and opium addicts. Animals received opium (40 mg/kg) for one month. Then, naloxone (2 mg & frasl;kg), a morphine antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally to confirm addiction. The activities and gene expressions of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GPr), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined by ELISA and Real-time PCR, respectively. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative state (TOS), glutathione, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, as well as hippocampus histopathology were assessed. Memory and learning were determined by water maze shuttle box tests. Results: The TAC and glutathione levels were decreased, while MDA and TOS increased (P < 0.05) in addicted animals. The gene expressions and activities of GPX, GPr, and SOD decreased in opium-treated animals when compared to control (P < 0.05). Histological analysis showed structural changes in the hippocampal in the opium group. Opium also impaired memory and learning in animals (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Opium consumption has a detrimental effect on hippocampus function and structure.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies. Pharmacological treatment with antiseizure drugs (ASDs) remains the mainstay in epilepsy management. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a second-generation ASD with a novel SV2A protein target and is indicated for treating focal epilepsies. While there is considerable literature in acute models, its effect in chronic epilepsy is less clear. Particularly, its effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and histological changes in chronic epilepsy have not been evaluated thus far, which formed the basis of the present study. Six weeks post-lithium-pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus (SE), epileptic rats were injected with levetiracetam (54 mg/kg b.w. i.p.) once daily for two weeks. Following LEV treatment, Schaffer collateral - CA1 (CA3-CA1) synaptic plasticity and structural changes in hippocampal subregions CA3 and CA1 were evaluated. The number of doublecortin (DCX+) and reelin (RLN+) positive neurons was estimated. Further, mossy fiber sprouting was evaluated in DG by Timm staining, and splash test was performed to assess the anxiety-like behavior. Chronic epilepsy resulted in decreased basal synaptic transmission and increased paired-pulse facilitation without affecting post-tetanic potentiation and long-term potentiation. Moreover, chronic epilepsy decreased hippocampal subfields volume, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and increased reelin expression and mossy fiber sprouting with increased anxiety-like behavior. LEV treatment restored basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation ratio in CA3-CA1 synapses. LEV also restored the CA1 subfield volume in chronic epilepsy. LEV did not affect epilepsy-induced abnormal adult hippocampal neurogenesis, ectopic migration of newborn granule cells, mossy fiber sprouting in DG, and anxiety-like behavior. Our results indicate that in addition to reducing seizures, LEV has favorable effects on synaptic transmission and structural plasticity in chronic epilepsy. These findings add new dimensions to the use of LEV in chronic epilepsy and paves way for further research into its effects on cognition and affective behavior.

AB  - IntroductionChronic ethanol intake has been found to favor hippocampal deterioration and alter neuronal morphological maturation; resveratrol has been suggested as an antioxidant that may counteract these effects. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress markers, endogenous antioxidant system in the hippocampus, and the behavior of male Wistar rats administered different concentrations of ethanol.MethodsThe animals, at 3 months old, were randomly distributed into 11 study groups (n = 6/group), orally administered (5 days on, 2 days off) with water (control), ethanol (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50%), or ethanol (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50%) plus resveratrol (10 mg/Kg/day) for 2 months. Subsequently, the production of nitrites, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxy-alkenal (HNE) and the enzymatic activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified.ResultsThe levels of nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation products were significantly increased in each ethanol concentration and were statistically different compared to the control group; however, resveratrol significantly reduced oxidative stress caused by high ethanol concentration. The SOD and CAT did not present significant changes with respect to the controls in any of the study groups. In the different concentrations of ethanol used, GR increases significantly in the groups administered with resveratrol but not GPx. Resveratrol was shown to maintain the results similar to the control at most ethanol concentrations.DiscussionOur results suggest that resveratrol prevents oxidative stress induced by ethanol in the hippocampus by decreasing cellular lipid peroxidation, but does not prevent the activation of catalase or SOD enzymes; however, allows glutathione to be kept active and in adequate concentrations in its reduced form and avoids alterations in the locomotor system.

AB  - As a traceless, bioreversible modification, the esterification of carboxyl groups in peptides and proteins has the potential to increase their clinical utility. An impediment is the lack of strategies to quantify esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis rates for esters in esterified biologics. We have developed a continuous Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for esterase activity based on a peptidic substrate and a protease, Glu-C, that cleaves a glutamyl peptide bond only if the glutamyl side chain is a free acid. Using pig liver esterase (PLE) and human carboxylesterases, we validated the assay with substrates containing simple esters (e.g., ethyl) and esters designed to be released by self-immolation upon quinone methide elimination. We found that simple esters were not cleaved by esterases, likely for steric reasons. To account for the relatively low rate of quinone methide elimination, we extended the mathematics of the traditional Michaelis-Menten model to conclude with a first-order intermediate decay step. By exploring two regimes of our substrate -> intermediate -> product (SIP) model, we evaluated the rate constants for the PLE-catalyzed cleavage of an ester on a glutamyl side chain (k (cat)/K-M = 1.63 x 10(3) M(-1 )s(-1)) and subsequent spontaneous quinone methide elimination to regenerate the unmodified peptide (k(I) = 0.00325 s-1; t( 1/2) = 3.55 min). The detection of esterase activity was also feasible in the human intestinal S9 fraction. Our assay and SIP model increase the understanding of the release kinetics of esterified biologics and facilitate the rational design of efficacious peptide prodrugs.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone is among the global change factors that pose a threat to plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms can assist plants to cope with stress, but their role in the tolerance of plants to ozone is poorly understood. Here, we subjected endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants of Lolium multiflorum, an annual species widely distributed in temperate grasslands, to high and low (i.e., charcoal-filtered air) ozone levels at vegetative and reproductive phases. Exposure to high ozone reduced leaf photochemical efficiency and greenness in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. However, ozone-induced oxidative damage at biochemical level (i.e., lipid peroxidation) was mostly detected in symbiotic plants. Ozone exposure at the vegetative phase did not affect the reproductive investment in seeds, indicating full recovery from stress. Ozone exposure at the reproductive phase reduced biomass and seed production only in symbiotic plants indicating a symbiontassociated cost. At low ozone, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a steeper slope in the relationship between seed number and seed weight (i.e., a number-weight trade-off) compared to non-symbiotic plants. However, when plants were treated at the reproductive phase, ozone increased the imbalance between seed number and seed weight in both endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. Plants with endophytes at the reproductive stage produced fewer seeds, which were not compensated by increased seed weight. Thus, fungal mycelium growing within ovaries or ozone-induced antioxidant systems may result in costs that finally depress the fitness of plants. Despite ozone pollution could destabilize plant-endophyte mutualisms and render them dysfunctional, other endophyte-mediated benefits (e.g., resistance to herbivory, tolerance to drought) could over-compensate these losses and explain the high incidence of the symbiosis in nature.

AB  - The range of metals used for industrial purposes electrical engineering, solar panels, batteries has increased substantially over the last twenty years. Some of these emerging metals are the subject of geopolitical conflict and are considered critical as their unique properties make them irreplaceable. Many of these elements are poorly studied and their biogeochemical cycles still raise many questions. Aim of this study is to analyse the soil to-plant transfer of some of these chemical elements and to shed light on their uptake pathways. For this purpose, the geological site of Jas Roux (France) was chosen as this alpine site is naturally rich in critical and potentially toxic elements such as As, Sb, Ba and Tl, but nevertheless is host to a high diversity of plants. Elemental concentrations were analysed in the topsoil and in 12 selected alpine plant species sampled in situ. Statistical tools were used to detect species dependent characteristics in elemental uptake. Our analyses revealed accumulation of rare earth elements by Saxifraga paniculata, selective oxyanion absorption by Hippocrepis comosa, accumulation of Tl by Biscutella laevigata and Galium corrudifolium and an exclusion strategy in Juniperus communis. These findings advance our understanding of the environmental behaviour of critical metals and metalloids such as V, As, Y, Sb, Ce, Ba and Tl and might bare valuable information for phytoremediation applications.

AB  - Forage selection by mammalian herbivores has shown to be influenced by plant nutritional content, but the role of plant secondary compounds (PSCs) on forage selection is less well understood. Here, we studied the role of PSCs in giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) foraging strategies; examined seasonal and age class variation in PSC composition in the panda's principal food resource, bamboo (Bashania fargesii); evaluated anti-oxidant and antibacterial effects of bamboo extract; and determined how panda's seasonal movements and foraging patch selection which were determined by GPS collars related to patterns of PSC concentrations in bamboo. Panda's selection of foraging sites indicated positive selection for several PSCs, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannins. Pandas primarily ingested bamboo leaves, as opposed other parts of the bamboo, during the time of year when many PSC concentrations were at their highest. Further, pandas prefer to forage on younger bamboo, which contains higher concentrations of alkaloids and antibacterial activity than older bamboo. As might be expected for compounds that can have positive or negative biological effects depending on dose, pandas appeared to select both for and against some PSCs depending on context. Ex situ experiments showed that flavonoids and alkaloids were influential antioxidants and tannins and alkaloids had high levels of antibacterial activity. Panda foraging sites were characterized by high anti-oxidant activity. Variation in PSC content of bamboo on the landscape may have profound effects on pandas, including parasite control, protecting against cancer, improved cardiovascular health, and disease prevention. These potential roles of PSCs should receive greater attention in ecology and conservation.

AB  - The highly organized transverse tubule (t-tubule) network facilitates cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and synchronous cardiac myocyte contraction. In cardiac failure secondary to myocardial infarction (MI), changes in the structure and organization of t-tubules result in impaired cardiac contractility. However, there is still little knowledge on the regional variation of t-tubule remodelling in cardiac failure post-MI. Here, we investigate post-MI t-tubule remodelling in infarct border and remote regions, using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) applied to a translationally relevant sheep ischaemia reperfusion MI model and matched controls. We performed minimally invasive coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery, followed by reperfusion after 90 min to establish the MI model. Left ventricular tissues obtained from control and MI hearts eight weeks post-MI were imaged using SBF-SEM. Image analysis generated three-dimensional reconstructions of the t-tubular network in control, MI border and remote regions. Quantitative analysis revealed that the MI border region was characterized by t-tubule depletion and fragmentation, dilation of surviving t-tubules and t-tubule elongation. This study highlights region-dependent remodelling of the tubular network post-MI and may provide novel localized therapeutic targets aimed at preservation or restoration of the t-tubules to manage cardiac contractility post-MI.This article is part of the theme issue 'The cardiomyocyte: new revelations on the interplay between architecture and function in growth, health, and disease'.

AB  - Plants simultaneously interact with belowground symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and aboveground antagonists such as aphids. Generally, plants gain access to valuable resources including nutrients and water through the AM symbiosis and are more resistant to pests. Nevertheless, aphids' performance improves on mycorrhizal plants, and it remains unclear whether a more nutritious food source and/or attenuated defenses are the contributing factors. This study examined the shoot and root transcriptome of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) plants highly colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (Blaszk., Wubet, Renker, and Buscot) C. Walker and A. Schussler (Glomerales: Glomeraceae) and exposed to 7 days of mixed age pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)) herbivory. The RNA-seq samples chosen for this study showed that aphids were heavier when fed mycorrhizal plants compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. We hypothesized that (i) insect-related plant defense pathways will be downregulated in shoots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids compared to nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids; (ii) pathways involved in nutrient acquisition, carbohydrate-related and amino acid transport will be upregulated in shoots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids compared to nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids; and (iii) roots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids will exhibit mycorrhiza-induced resistance. The transcriptome data revealed that the gene repertoire related to defenses, nutrient transport, and carbohydrates differs between nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants with aphids, which could explain the weight gain in aphids. We also identified novel candidate genes that are differentially expressed in nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids, thus setting the stage for future functional studies.

AB  - Many plant bugs (Miridae) are generalist herbivores that feed on multiple host species. The reasons these bugs move across hosts and the behavioural mechanisms responsible for their retention at specific hosts remain elusive. Green mirids (Creontiades dilutus) are endemic to Australia. These insects are important pests of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and even in low numbers can cause substantial damage to crops. These bugs are also present in relatively much higher numbers on pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) planted alongside cotton fields, and evidence shows they move across these crops in both directions. Observations of these highly mobile insects in the field are challenging, but indirect evidence suggests that they may be nocturnal. This study evaluated: (1) the diel (24 h) period in which C. dilutus adults were most active, (2) whether they respond to plant volatiles immediately prior to landing on host substrates, and (3) if their presence on a host is in response to attraction or arrestment cues. The results suggest that C. dilutus bugs are typically most active early in the evenings, after remaining motionless during the day (unless disturbed). Their movement (at night) was arrested by hosts prior to touching plant tissues. There was no evidence to suggest that these bugs are attracted by volatiles beyond 2 cm. These outcomes demonstrate that insect behaviours need to be investigated within their typical activity periods, and that arrestment cues possibly play a central role in the host finding process of generalist C. dilutus and probably, therefore, other mirid species.

AB  - To address the growing global demand for aquatic protein and the need for sustainable aquaculture, this study explored Aspalathus linearis tea extract as a novel feed additive for Oreochromis mossambicus larvae. Over an eight-week feeding trial, the efficacy of diets supplemented with 30% fermented or green rooibos extract was assessed against a control. Both fermented and green rooibos treatments significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced larval growth, evidenced by improved weight gain and feed conversion ratios (fermented: 1.50 +/- 0.25; green: 1.41 +/- 0.07). Notably, A. linearis extracts also demonstrated genoprotective potential, as indicated by a marked reduction in micronucleus frequency, most likely attributed to their abundant phenolic compounds. These findings demonstrate that rooibos extract, especially the green variety, can improve growth performance and feed utilization, and also provide genoprotective benefits. The superior outcomes in growth and feed conversion are likely due to the bioactive phenolic compounds, which may enhance palatability, gut health, and nutrient absorption, rather than macronutrient content. This positions rooibos extract as a promising natural functional additive for aquafeed, offering a sustainable strategy to enhance tilapia farming productivity and resource utilization. However, further research is necessary to uncover specific molecular mechanisms, conduct in-depth analyses of gut health and immune responses, and evaluate effects on product quality to facilitate its sustainable and effective integration into aquaculture practices, thereby contributing to both fish health and food security.

AB  - The ERF gene family is widely present in plants and has crucial regulatory importance in plant seed development, organ morphogenesis, the synthesis of secondary metabolites, and coping with abiotic stresses such as cold and drought. In this study, 90 members of CsERF were screened by bioinformatics tools analysis and named CsERF1-CsERF90. Their molecular characteristics and systematic evolution were studied, and the tissue expression characteristics of CSERF genes and the composition of promoter cis-acting elements were predicted. The results showed that 81 proteins encoded by CsERF genes had conserved motifs 1, 2, and 3, while 64 members possessed other motifs. The theoretical isoelectric point was between 4.49 and 10.24, and 85 members constituted unstable proteins, while the rest were stable proteins. Subcellular localization predicted that 77 members were in the nucleus, 8 were in the chloroplasts, and 5 were in the mitochondria. The promoter sequence of CsERFs was found to include not only cis-acting elements related to hormone regulation, such as gibberellin (41), methyl jasmonate (110), and abscisic acid (185), but also cis-acting elements involved in low-temperature response (56) and light response (22), indicating that CsERFs have a key role in plant growth and abiotic stress. Phylogenetic analysis of tea plant and Arabidopsis thaliana ERF gene families showed that the tea plant ERF gene families could be divided into six groups, with B3 having 29 members at most and B1 having only 3 members at least. The phylogenetic tree constructed using only the CsERF genes is also divided into six groups, with slightly different but minimal differences in members. Of the 90 tea plant ERF members, 85 were located on 15 chromosomes, whereas 5 were not located on chromosomes. The collinearity analysis showed that there were 41 homologous gene pairs among the CsERFs, and these homologous gene pairs may have the same function. According to the expression of CsERFs in cold-stressed tea plant and in different tissues, 90 CsERF genes played their respective roles in different tissues and stages to regulate plant growth, and some of them participated in the process of cold stress tolerance. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the study of tea plant growth and development and low-temperature resistance.

AB  - A recurring analogy for photosynthesis research is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Photosynthesis has many complex working parts, which has driven the need to study each of them individually, with an inherent understanding that a more complete picture will require systematic integration of these views. However, unlike the blind men, who are limited to using their hands, researchers have developed over the past decades a repertoire of methods for studying these components, many of which capitalize on unique features intrinsic to each. More recent concerns about food security and clean, renewable energy have increased support for applied photosynthesis research, with the idea of either improving photosynthetic performance as a desired trait in select species or using photosynthetic measurements as a phenotyping tool in breeding efforts or for high precision crop management. In this review, we spotlight the migration of approaches for studying photosynthesis from the laboratory into field environments, highlight some recent advances and speculate on areas where further development would be fruitful, with an eye towards how applied photosynthesis research can have impacts at local and global scales.

AB  - Mammals that live in groups play critical roles in ecosystems and are significant conservation and management targets. However, efficiently and reliably estimating both the number of groups and group sizes for monitoring their population status presents challenges. Point-count surveys, such as camera trapping, face difficulties in estimating these variables because multiple groups are detected repeatedly at the same observation station. In such cases, the observed group sizes should conform to finite mixture distributions-that is, probability distributions with varying parameters may be combined, and the number of distributions involved remains uncertain. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously estimate these variables while accounting for imperfect detection based on point-count survey data. Specifically, we extend the N-mixture model to estimate group size by introducing a mixture structure for each group observation using a truncated stick-breaking (TSB) prior. Additionally, by incorporating the Royle-Nichols model as a sub-model, we estimate the number of potentially detectable clusters at a given point, enabling effective truncation of the prior distribution for cluster assignment probability by the TSB prior. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that while the conventional N-mixture model overestimated group sizes by 56.1%, the mixture models using TSB prior reduced this bias to - 5.2%. Further inclusion of information from the Royle-Nichols model improved accuracy, resulting in a minimal bias of + 0.6% in group size estimates. The estimation of the number of groups showed a 35.0% positive bias when using the TSB prior alone but incorporating auxiliary information by the RN model reduced this bias to - 2.1%. Using a random walk model that simulated movements of group-living animals, we demonstrated that our model provided robust group size estimates even under model misspecification, when the individual detection probability exceeded 0.5 and mortality remained below 13%. The model slightly underestimated the number of groups but maintained acceptable accuracy. Field surveys using camera trap data from juvenile wild boars yielded satisfactory goodness of fit. Our model is robust to changes in group membership during surveys, offering an underlying structure for future refinement to address more realistic situations.

AB  - Swine nursery mortality is highly impacted by the pre-weaning performance of the piglets. Even though the importance of the pre-weaning phase on the downstream post-weaning performance is acknowledged, predictive modeling has yet to be described in the swine industry to predict the downstream nursery performance of groups of pigs based on their previous pre-weaning phase. One obstacle to building such predictive models is that pieces of information concerning the factors impacting swine mortality are collected with separate record-keeping programs and stored in unconnected databases, creating multiple unutilized data stream clusters. Thus, in this study, we described the process of building a data-wrangling pipeline that automatically integrates diverse and dispersed data streams collected from one swine production company, creating then a master table that was utilized to predict the mortality of groups of pigs during the nursery phase.
   The performance of five forecasting models was investigated for predicting nursery mortality using the master table built for 3242 groups of pigs (similar to 13 million animals) and 42 variables, which concerned the pre-weaning phase of production and conditions at placement in growing sites. After training and testing each model's performance through cross-validation, the model with the best overall prediction results was the Support Vector Machine model in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE = 0.406), Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 0.284), and Coefficient of Determination (R-2 = 0.731). Subsequently, the forecasting performance of the SVM model was tested on a new dataset containing 72 new groups, simulating ongoing and near real-time forecasting analysis. Despite a decrease in R-2 values on the new dataset (R-2 = 0.554), the model demonstrated high accuracy (77.78%) for predicting groups with high (>5%) or low (<5%) nursery mortality. This study demonstrated the capability of forecasting models to predict the nursery mortality of commercial groups of pigs using pre-weaning information and stocking condition variables collected post-placement in nursery sites.

AB  - Patterns in pigs activity can be an indicator of health and welfare of the animals. This motivates researchers to develop Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) tools for automated monitoring of pig activity level. In this research we compared two important technologies that can be used for this purpose, ear tag accelerometer and computer vision. Additionally, we compared both technologies with gold standard based on human labelling. A state-ofthe-art object detection algorithm RetinaNet was trained on 9969 images and validated on 4273 images to automatically detect head of a sow, body of a sow, left ear, right ear and a hay rack. It was possible to detect these objects with a performance of 0.26 mAP@0.5:0.95. Activity of 6 sows was derived from detected parts of animals' bodies and compared with activity measurement based on ear tag accelerometer data. Dynamic relation between activity measurement based on both technologies was modelled with Transfer Function (TF) models. For all 6 animals activity of the body of a sow based on object detection was very similar to accelerometer based activity measurement (R2 > 0.7). Similarly R2 between activity of a head of a sow and accelerometer based activity was also very similar for most sows (R2 > 0.7). Results of fitting of TF models to animal activity data based on ear tag accelerometer and output of object detection on body of sows and head of sows suggests that both technologies, the accelerometer and computer vision provide very similar information on activity level of animals. The presented computer vision method is limited to monitoring one animal under camera view as detected body parts cannot be associated with multiple individuals. Moreover, we expect that the method requires re-training the RetinaNet object detection algorithm with additional images collected on additional farms to achieve satisfactory performance in different environments. Application of computer vision approach might be advantageous in some PLF applications as it is non-invasive and might be less laborious than method based on ear tag accelerometer data.

AB  - Naturally occurring compounds such as sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (SQTs) have been shown to modulate GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). In this study, the modulatory potential of 11 SQTs at GABA(A)Rs was analyzed to characterize their potential neurotropic activity. Transfected HEK293 cells and primary hippocampal neurons were functionally investigated using electrophysiological whole-cell recordings. Significantly different effects of beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene, as well as their respective derivatives beta-caryolanol and humulol, were observed in the HEK293 cell system. In neurons, the concomitant presence of phasic and tonic GABA(A)R configurations accounts for differences in receptor modulation by SQTs. The in vivo presence of the gamma(2) and delta subunits is important for SQT modulation. While phasic GABA(A) receptors in hippocampal neurons exhibited significantly altered GABA-evoked current amplitudes in the presence of humulol and guaiol, negative allosteric potential at recombinantly expressed alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) receptors was only verified for humolol. Modeling and docking studies provided support for the binding of SQTs to the neurosteroid-binding site of the GABA(A)R localized between transmembrane segments 1 and 3 at the ((+)alpha)-((-)alpha) interface. In sum, differences in the modulation of GABA(A)R isoforms between SQTs were identified. Another finding is that our results provide an indication that nutritional digestion affects the neurotropic potential of natural compounds.

AB  - (1) Background: This study determined whether adding butyric acid and lauric acid glycerides in nursing pigs' feed would improve growth performance, proteinogram, biochemical parameters, and antioxidant status. (2) Methods: Ninety male pigs were divided into five groups with six repetitions per group: NC, negative control (no additive); TRI-BUT, addition of tributyrin in the basal ration; MDT-BUT, addition of mono-, di-, and triglycerides of butyric acid in the basal feed; MDT-LAU, the addition of mono-, di-, and triglycerides of lauric acid in the basal feed; and PC, positive control (addition of gentamicin in the basal feed). (3) Results: PC, TRI-BUT, and MDT-LAU resulted in a high average daily WG from days 1 to 39 (p < 0.01). MDT-LAU, MDT-BUT, and PC resulted in a greater feed:gain from days 1 to 39 than the NC (p = 0.03). Great concentrations of the gamma globulin fraction in all groups were observed than in the NC (p = 0.01). Ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein concentrations were lower in all groups than in the NC (p < 0.05). Higher serum glutathione S-transferase activity was observed in the TRI-BUT and MDT-BUT than in the PC (p = 0.04). (4) Conclusions: The addition of butyric acid and lauric acid glycerides in the diet of pigs in the nursery phase can replace growth promoters since the products improve the growth performance, reduce acute-phase proteins, and increase gamma globulin concentrations.

AB  - Salinity is the most important abiotic stress factor that negatively affects agricultural produc-tion and quality. It necessitates a wider introduction of resistant species and the development of high-yielding varieties, especially in salinity-affected areas. Camelina is a plant that has an effective structure against abiotic stress factors. The research was carried out to determine the physiological and chemical changes caused by different salt concentrations in the camelina plant, and the salt concentration to which camelina is most sensitive. The research was carried out in greenhouse conditions. PI-650142 camelina genotype was used as the plant material, and 6 different NaCl concentrations (0, 35, 70, 140, 210 and 200 mM) were used as salt treat-ment. Plant height, leaf area, plant water content, relative water content, membrane permea-bility, amount of chlorophyll and carotenoids and biomass accumulation were evaluated. As a result, it was found that the applied NaCl doses showed significant differences on all the parameters evaluated. It has been determined that plants can tolerate salt stress up to 140 mM NaCl concentration, and there were serious negative changes in plant height, the weight of plant parts that make up the biomass, total biomass, leaf parameters and membrane permeability above the 140 mM NaCl concentration. These findings reveal that up to a certain level (140 mM NaCl concentration) in regions with salt stress, the camelina plant can be grown without encountering a serious problem in terms of morphological and physiological adaptation mechanisms.

AB  - Exposure of biological systems to acute or chronic insults triggers a host of molecular and physiological responses to either tolerate, adapt, or fully restore homeostasis; these responses constitute the hallmarks of resilience. Given the many facets, dimensions, and discipline-specific focus, gaining a shared understanding of "resilience" has been identified as a priority for supporting advances in cardiovascular health. This report is based on the working definition: "Resilience is the ability of living systems to successfully maintain or return to homeostasis in response to physical, molecular, individual, social, societal, or environmental stressors or challenges," developed after considering many factors contributing to cardiovascular resilience through deliberations of multidisciplinary experts convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute during a workshop entitled: "Enhancing Resilience for Cardiovascular Health and Wellness." Some of the main emerging themes that support the possibility of enhancing resilience for cardiovascular health include optimal energy management and substrate diversity, a robust immune system that safeguards tissue homeostasis, and social and community support. The report also highlights existing research challenges, along with immediate and long-term opportunities for resilience research. Certain immediate opportunities identified are based on leveraging existing high-dimensional data from longitudinal clinical studies to identify vascular resilience measures, create a 'resilience index,' and adopt a life-course approach. Long-term opportunities include developing quantitative cell/organ/system/community models to identify resilience factors and mechanisms at these various levels, designing experimental and clinical interventions that specifically assess resilience, adopting global sharing of resilience-related data, and cross-domain training of next-generation researchers in this field.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between the rapid growth and suppression of tumorigenesis during antler regeneration. This study investigated the role of a novel miRNA, PC-3p-2869 (miR-PC-2869), in antler growth and its therapeutic potential in human osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Stem-loop RT-qPCR showed that miR-PC-2869 was expressed extensively in diverse layers of antler tissues. Overexpression of miR-PC-2869 suppressed the proliferation and migration of antler cartilage cells. Similarly, heterologous expression of miR-PC-2869 reduced the proliferation, colony formation, and migration of osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and U2OS and chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353. Moreover, 18 functional target genes of miR-PC-2869 in humans were identified based on the screening of the reporter library. Among them, 15 target genes, including CDK8, EEF1A1, and NTN1, possess conserved miR-PC-2869-binding sites between humans and red deer (Cervus elaphus). In line with this, miR-PC-2869 overexpression decreased the expression levels of CDK8, EEF1A1, and NTN1 in MG63, SW1353, and antler cartilage cells. As expected, the knockdown of CDK8, EEF1A1, or NTN1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of MG63, SW1353, and antler cartilage cells, demonstrating similar suppressive effects as miR-PC-2869 overexpression. Furthermore, we observed that CDK8, EEF1A1, and NTN1 mediated the regulation of c-myc and cyclin D1 by miR-PC-2869 in MG63, SW1353, and antler cartilage cells. Overall, our work uncovered the cellular functions and underlying molecular mechanism of antler-derived miR-PC-2869, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic candidate for bone cancer.

AB  - Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intrahippocampal (IH) administration of amyloid-beta (A beta) are widely used in current research. It remains unclear whether these models provide similar outcomes or mimic pathological mechanisms of AD equally. The aim of the work was to compare two models induced by ICV or IH administration of A beta 25-35 oligomers to C57BL/6 mice. Parameters characterizing cognitive function (passive avoidance test), protein expression (IBA1, A beta, LC3-II) and expression of genes for neuroinflammation (Aif1, Lcn2, Nrf2), autophagy (Atg8, Becn1, Park2), or markers of neuro-degeneration (Cst3, Insr, Vegfa) were analyzed. Cognitive deficits, amyloid accumulation, and neuro-inflammatory response in the brain evaluated by the microglial activation were similar in both models. Thus, both ways of A beta administration appear to be equally suitable for modelling AD-like pathology in mice. Our findings strongly support the key role of A beta load and neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus and frontal cortex for the progression of AD-like pathology and development of cognitive deficits. There were certain minor differences between the models in the mRNA level of genes involved in the processes of neuro-inflammation, neurodegeneration, and autophagy. Modulating effects of the central administration of A beta 25-35 on the mRNA expression of Aif1, Lcn2, Park2, and Vegfa genes in different brain structures were revealed. The effects occurred to be more pronounced with the ICV method compared with the IH method. These findings give insight into the processes at initial stages of A beta-induced pathology depending on a primary location of A beta oligomers in the brain.

AB  - Defoliation by insects is a major source of damage in field crops such as rapeseed, Brassica napus L., and an economic evaluation of resulting yield losses is essential for guiding management decisions. In this study, different intensities of defoliation were simulated at different growth stages of rapeseed plants in three sets of experiments. In the first experiment, three levels of defoliation were imposed in a single event at either the 2-, 4- or 8-leaf stage. In the second experiment, similar defoliation treatments were imposed at one of four flowering stages: pre-bloom, early bloom, mid-bloom, or late bloom. In the third experiment, 80% of leaf area was removed in weekly increments, either throughout the flowering period, or during the first or last half of it. In all experiments, various plant metrics, components of yield, and seed yields per unit area were compared to undefoliated (control) plants. Plant phenology (onset of flowering, time to flowering, and ripening time) was delayed, and growth and yield components were reduced by defoliation occurring in vegetative, pre-bloom and early bloom stages, but plants compensated for up to 25% defoliation that occurred mid- to late flowering. The economic injury level ranged from 3.7% defoliation at the 2-leaf stage to 5.7% at the 8-leaf stage, whereas it was < 2% just prior to flowering and 5.6% during early bloom. Moderate levels of defoliation late in the flowering period resulted in some overcompensation (yields greater than controls). The economic threshold for defoliation during flowering was calculated to be 3.2 and 3.7% for gradual and sudden defoliation events, respectively. These findings can be linked to leaf consumption by defoliators to aid decision-making by farmers.

AB  - Argopistes tsekooni Chen (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a flea beetle native to Asia, is reported for the first time in North America. It is established in the southeastern U.S.A. where it is causing substantial damage to Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour.; Oleaceae), one of the most problematic invasive plants in the region. A. tsekooni was identified as a promising biological control agent in previous work, which led to a series of no-choice and choice tests to clarify its host range. The results from that work are presented here. Of the 22 test species included in no-choice tests, A. tsekooni feeding damage was reported from 16, eggs were found on 13, and mature larvae were produced from nine members of the tribe Oleeae. Moreover, it is clear from choice tests that A. tsekooni does not strongly prefer L. sinense over other members of the tribe, also readily feeding and laying eggs on Ligustrum vulgare L., Syringa meyeri C.K. Schneid, Chionanthus virginicus L., Forestiera acuminata (Michx.) Poir., F. pubescens Nutt., F. segregata (Jacq.) Krug & Urb., and Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall. These preliminary results and observations suggest that A. tsekooni may help curtail the dominance and spread of L. sinense but not without also negatively impacting certain native species.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of orlistat on oxidative stress, spatial memory, recognition memory, and hippocampal tissue in obese rats. The study groups were divided into control, high fat diet-induced obese (HFDIO), HFDIO+orlistat (HFDIO+ORL) groups, each consisting of 8 animals. While control fed with standart diet, HFDIO and HFDIO+ORL fed with high-fat diets for 8 weeks to induce obesity. Then, ORL treated 10 mg/kg for 7 weeks, while control and HFDIO get water. At 16th week, novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed. TNF-alpha, IL-1beta levels in hippocampal tissue, and total/native thiol/ disulphide levels in serum were measured. TNF-alpha level of HFDIO was higher than control, while lower in HFDIO+ORL compared to HFDIO as like IL-1beta level. On the contrary, serum total thiol level was lower in HFDIO than control and higher in HFDIO+ORL compared to the HFDIO, while disulphide level was opposite of the total thiol levels. While recognition index was higher in HFDIO+ORL, in MWM, latency of finding platform in HFDIO was higher than control and latency of HFDIO+ORL was very similar to control in 2-4 days. The HFDIO group demonstrated decrease in time spent in platform zone compared to control, whereas time spent of the HFDIO+ORL was higher than HFDIO. Our study demonstrates that orlistat administration exerts beneficial effects on oxidative stress, spatial memory, recognition memory, and hippocampal tissue in obese rats. It shows that orlistat may have potential therapeutic implications for obesity-related cognitive impairments and hippocampal dysfunction.

AB  - In order to examine the stock management unit of the slime flounder Microstomus achne, this study estimated the population structure of this species on the basis of sequence variations of 480 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region and morphological variations in three meristic counts of dorsal, anal, and pectoral fin-rays. High genetic diversity of this species in the mitochondrial control region was observed, but no genetic differentiation was detected between individuals from the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, the number of dorsal and anal fin-rays differed significantly between individuals from those two regions, with Pacific individuals having a higher number of fin-rays. The pelagic larval period of this species is very long (about 85 days), and although dispersal in the early life stage has resulted in gene flow between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean, the migration range after settlement is relatively limited, suggesting that migration between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean is restricted. Thus, these results suggest that it is necessary to distinguish between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean as a stock management unit for this species.

AB  - In Mexico, for the past 30 years, a continuous decrease in the incidence of clinical taeniosis/cysticercosis has been documented. This work aimed to determine the influence of improvement in socioeconomic conditions on the prevalence of Taenia solium in four endemic communities in northwestern Mexico. This study was carried out in two phases. First, documentary information (1989-2018) was collected about the prevalence of Theridion solium in the federal entity of Sinaloa State. Second, a pilot study was performed in four communities of Sinaloa, which had an endemic history of Taenia transmission. In each community, a risk factor questionnaire was applied, and serum and stool samples were collected for convenience in a non-probabilistic way. Anti-cysticercus antibodies and adult worm coproantigen were determined. The documentary analysis showed the incidence of taeniosis and cysticercosis to have decreased by 98 and 53%, respectively, while the human development index increased by 5% (1992-2017). Our data suggest that the risk of parasitic transmission is low, although female sex was a risk factor for reporting tremors or seizures (prevalence rate 2.1336, CI: 1.1821-3.8508) and background of tapeworm infection (prevalence rate 1.2893, CI: 0.9795-1.6972). No tapeworms or eggs were found while examining stool samples, but protozoa cysts were observed in four samples. Unexpectedly, only one of the 79 stool samples was positive for coproantigens. This positive result was confirmed in a second sample. However, the evaluation of a third sample was negative. No antibodies were found in human (n = 377) or pig (n = 69) samples. These data suggest parasite transmission has been interrupted and could be possibly associated with improving socioeconomic conditions. Further studies are needed to determine the real prevalence of zoonoses in Mexico.

AB  - The young leaves of many plant species exhibit red or purple coloration. It has been proposed that the red/purple coloration serves as a warning signal, indicating that defense chemicals against herbivores are highly concentrated in young tissues. In particular, it is expected that generalist herbivores will not like red/purple leaves because the chemical defenses developed by young leaves are generally more toxic or less nutritious to generalist herbivores than to specialists. To test this hypothesis, the color choices made by a generalist grasshopper, Acrida cinerea, were assessed using colored paper discs impregnated with feeding stimulants under three light conditions: white light, blue light, and darkness. Only under white light did A. cinerea eat less red paper and more yellow paper than green paper. They ate blue paper as well as green paper, indicating that they do not consider only green items to be food. These findings support that A. cinerea likely dislikes red foods not simply because red is different from the typical color of leaves but rather because red is a warning signal.

AB  - Simple Summary It is well known that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) seriously affects the postnatal growth and intestinal health of piglets. Keeping intestinal health is of great importance to pig production. Numerous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) has a positive effect on the repair of intestinal injury of animals. However, whether EGF can promote the intestinal health of IUGR piglets is unknown. Therefore, in our present study, a total of 12 IUGR piglets and 6 normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were selected to study the effects of EGF on the growth performance and intestinal health of IUGR piglets. Our study found that basal diet supplemented with 2 mg/kg EGF significantly improved the growth performance, jejunum morphology, jejunum glucose absorption and antioxidant capacity, and jejunum barrier function of piglets with IUGR. Therefore, this study confirmed that EGF has positive effects on the growth and intestinal development of piglets with IUGR. EGF plays an important role in the intestinal repair and nutrients transport of animals. However, the effect of EGF on the intestinal health of piglets with IUGR has not been reported. Thus, the present study was performed to investigate the effects of EGF on the intestinal morphology, glucose absorption, antioxidant capacity, and barrier function of piglets with IUGR. A total of 6 NBW piglets and 12 IUGR piglets were randomly divided into three treatments: NC group (NBW piglets fed with basal diet, n = 6), IC group (IUGR piglets fed with basal diet, n = 6), and IE group (IUGR piglets fed with basal diet supplemented with 2 mg/kg EGF, n = 6). Growth performance, serum biochemical profile, jejunum histomorphology, jejunum glucose absorption and antioxidant capacity, and jejunal barrier function were measured. The results showed that EGF supplementation significantly increased the final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of piglets with IUGR; EGF supplementation significantly increased the total protein (TP), glucose (GLU), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels compared with the IUGR piglets in the IC group; EGF administration effectively exhibited an increased jejunum villus height (VH) and the villus-height-to-crypt-depth ratio (V/C) of IUGR piglets compared with the IC group; EGF supplementation significantly increased sodium/potassium-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) activity, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, glucose transporter sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 1 (AMPK-alpha 1) mRNA expressions in the jejunum of IUGR piglets compared with the IC group; EGF supplementation exhibited increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels, tended to increase glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities, and tended to decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the jejunum of IUGR piglets compared with the IC group; EGF supplementation significantly increased ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin, and MUC2 mRNA expressions and improved secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) secretion in the jejunum of IUGR piglets compared with the IC group and tended to decrease the interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in the jejunum of IUGR piglets compared with the IC group.
   Pearson's correlation analysis further showed that EGF can promote intestinal development and nutrient absorption by promoting intestinal barrier function, thus improving the growth performance of IUGR piglets.

AB  - Cancer tissue often comprises multiple tumor clones with distinct oncogenic alterations such as Ras or Src activation, yet the mechanism by which tumor heterogeneity drives cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we show in Drosophila imaginal epithelium that clones of Ras- or Src-activated benign tumors interact with each other to mutually promote tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, Ras-activated cells upregulate the cell-surface ligand Delta while Src-activated cells upregulate its receptor Notch, leading to Notch activation in Src cells. Elevated Notch signaling induces the transcriptional repressor Zfh1/ZEB1, which downregulates E-cadherin and cell death gene hid, leading to Src-activated invasive tumors. Simultaneously, Notch activation in Src cells upregulates the cytokine Unpaired/IL-6, which activates JAK-STAT signaling in neighboring Ras cells. Elevated JAK-STAT signaling upregulates the BTB-zinc-finger protein Chinmo, which downregulates E-cadherin and thus generates Ras-activated invasive tumors. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how tumor heterogeneity triggers tumor progression via cell-cell interactions.

AB  - The success of reprogramming is dependent on the reprogramming factors enriched in the cytoplasm of recipient oocytes and the potential of donor nucleus to be reprogrammed. Histone 3 lysine 9 trime-thylation (H3K9me3) was identified as a major epigenetic barrier impeding complete reprogramming. Treating donor cell with vitamin C (Vc) can enhance the developmental potential of cloned embryos, but the underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. In this study, we found that 20mg/mL Vc could promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of BFFs, as well as down-regulate the H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin and increase chromatin accessibility. Inhibited the expression of KDM4A resulted in increasing apoptosis rate and the H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin, which can be restored by Vc. Moreover, Vc up-regulated the expression of KDM4A through PI3K/PDK1/SGK1 pathway. Inhibiting any factor in the signal axis of this PI3K pathway not only suppressed the activity of KDM4A but also sub-stantially increased the level of H3K9me3 modification and the expression of the HP1a protein. Finally, Vc can rescue those negative effects induced by the blocking the PI3K/PDK1/SGK1 pathway. Collectively, Vc can down-regulate the H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin in BFFs via PI3K/PDK1/SGK1/KDM4A signal axis, suggesting that Vc can turn the chromatin status of donor cells to be reprogrammed more easily.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Genetic predisposition and environmental stress are known etiologies of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Environmental stress during adolescence is assumed to be particularly detrimental for adult affective behaviors. To investigate how genetic stress-reactivity differences modify the effects of stress during adolescence on adult affective behaviors we employed two inbred strains with differing stress reactivity. The Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) rat strain show increased stress-reactivity and despair-like behaviors as well as passive coping compared to the nearly isogenic control strain, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile (WLI). Males and females of these strains were exposed to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) during early adolescence (EA), between 32 and 34 postnatal days (PND), and were tested for the consequences of this mild EA stress in adulthood. Early adolescent stress significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior, measured in the open field test (OFT) and increased social interaction and recognition in adult males of both strains compared to controls. In contrast, no significant effects of EA stress were observed in adult females in these behaviors. Both males and females of the genetically less stress-reactive WLI strain showed significantly increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST) after EA stress compared to controls. In contrast, immobility was significantly attenuated by EA stress in adult WMI females compared to controls. Transcriptomic changes of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1, GR) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) illuminate primarily strain and stress-dependent changes, respectively, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of adults. These results suggest that contrary to expectations, limited adolescent stress is beneficial to males thru decreasing anxiety and enhancing social behaviors, and to the stress more-reactive WMI females by way of decreasing passive coping.

AB  - The long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the Platybelodon clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends.

AB  - Whilst the world sees the tremendous growth of mobile phone technology, radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) induced possible health effects have emerged as a topic of recent day debate. The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that chronic 900 MHz radiation exposure would potentially dysregulate the stress response system (HPA axis) in vivo, via, its non-thermal mechanisms, leading to alterations in the microarchitecture of the adrenal gland, vulnerable brain regions such as the hippocampus which may results in altered behaviours in rats. Male albino Wistar rats aged four weeks, weighing 50-60 g were subjected to 900 MHz radiation from a mobile phone for four weeks at a rate of one hour per day. On the 29th day, animals from the control, sham exposed and RF-EMR exposed groups were tested for contextual fear conditioning. They were later euthanized to study hippocampal and adrenal gland cytoarchitecture. Bright and dark compartment transitions in the avoidance box were considerably elevated in the RF-EMR exposed group and they exhibited a significant decrease in the latency to enter the dark compartment during the contextual fear conditioning test. Apoptosis was apparent in the CA3 region and perivascular space was significantly increased in the hippocampus of the radiation-exposed group. In addition to lymphocytic infiltrates, congested sinusoids, apoptotic-like changes were evident in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. However, the cytoarchitecture of the adrenal medulla was comparable in all three groups. Chronic RF-EMR exposure caused changes in contextual fear conditioning, enlargement of hippocampal perivascular space, apparent CA3 apoptosis, and apoptotic-like changes in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland in rats.

AB  - This study evaluated the use of flunixin meglumine to prevent the occurrence of premature corpus luteum (CL) regression in superovulated ewes, improving embryo recovery and viability. Ewes (n=23) submitted to conventional superovulatory protocol and laparoscopic artificial insemination were treated with 2.2 mg/kg/day of flunixin meglumine (FLU, n=12) or 1.5 mL saline solution (CONT, n=11) on Days 2, 3, and 4 (Day 0 = 48 h after device removal). Serum progesterone (P4) concentrations were measured (Day 1-6). Ultrasound (US, Days 3 and 6) and laparoscopic evaluation (Day 6) were performed to identify luteinized structures. In the US, laparoscopy, and P4 assessments, the percentage of ewes with premature CL regression differed (P<0.05) between CONT (54.5; 63.6; and 54.5%) and FLU (0.0; 0.0; and 0.0 %), respectively. The US exams revealed the effect (P<0.05) of treatment on the number of regressing CL between CONT (1.4 f 0.6) and FLU (0.0 f 0.0). Greater (P<0.05) number of normal CLs (10.5 f 1.8 vs. 4.4 f 1.5), ova/embryos (9.1 f 2.1 vs. 3.7 f 1.3), viable embryos (5.1 f 1.1 vs. 2.6 f 1.2), and recovery rate (79.5 f 9.6 vs. 41.3 f 15.0 %) were observed in FLU compared to CONT, respectively. The embryo viability rate did not differ (P>0.05) between FLU (60.7 f 10.5 %) and CONT (45.5 f 16.1 %). In conclusion, the flunixin meglumine protocol was able to prevent the occurrence of premature CL regression in superovulated ewes, increasing the recovery rate and embryo production.

AB  - IntroductionThe presence of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonates triggers a strong neuroinflammatory reaction. Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism associated with inflammation, plays a crucial role in HIBD. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays a significant role in connecting metabolic processes and inflammatory responses, but whether it affects hippocampus pyroptosis in HIBD is unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of PKM2 in HIBD and to propose a novel therapeutic approach for neonatal ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy.MethodsIn this study, we employed neonatal 7-day-old Sprague Dawley rats to establish a model of HIBD using the Rice-Vannucci surgical technique and a hypoxia device. To inhibit the elevation of PKM2, we utilized the PKM2 inhibitor shikonin. The rats were categorized into four groups: Sham, Shikonin, HIBD, and Shikonin + HIBD. Behavioral tests, hematoxylin eosin staining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA (IL-1 beta, IL-18), and LDH were conducted in each group to evaluate neurological function, hippocampal damage, the occurrence of neuronal pyroptosis, and the neuroinflammation. Western blot was used to assess the expression levels of PKM2, NLRP3, Caspase-1, Cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMDN, and IL-1 beta.ResultsThe expression of PKM2 elevated in hippocampal tissues of the HIBD model and the localization of PKM2 in the hippocampus was activated in neurons instead of microglia during the HIBD. Meanwhile, the inhibition of PKM2 improved the behavioral test scores and the body weight of rats, the neuronal damage in the CA1 region of hippocampal tissue was also attenuated. In addition, inhibiting PKM2 alleviated neuronal pyroptosis by decreasing the expression of PKM2, NLRP3, Caspase-1, Cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMDN. Furthermore, serum levels of LDH and inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and IL-18 decrease with PKM2 inhibition.ConclusionsBased on these findings, we can conclude that PKM2 plays a crucial role in regulating hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis of HIBD rats via NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway. Therefore, inhibiting PKM2 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neonatal ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy.

AB  - The pathogenesis of schizophrenia is believed to involve combined dysfunctions of many proteins including microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) and Kv3.1 voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel, but their relationship and functions in behavioral regulation are often not known. Here we report that MAP6 stabilizes Kv3.1 channels in parvalbumin-positive (PV+ ) fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons, regulating behavior. MAP6-/- and Kv3.1-/- mice display similar hyperactivity and avoidance reduction. Their proteins colocalize in PV+ interneurons and MAP6 deletion markedly reduces Kv3.1 protein level. We further show that two microtubule-binding modules of MAP6 bind the Kv3.1 tetramerization domain with high affinity, maintaining the channel level in both neuronal soma and axons. MAP6 knockdown by AAV-shRNA in the amygdala or the hippocampus reduces avoidance or causes hyperactivity and recognition memory deficit, respectively, through elevating projection neuron activity. Finally, knocking down Kv3.1 or disrupting the MAP6-Kv3.1 binding in these brain regions causes avoidance reduction and hyperactivity, consistent with the effects of MAP6 knockdown. Thus, disrupting this conserved cytoskeleton-membrane interaction in fast-spiking neurons causes different degrees of functional vulnerability in various neural circuits.

AB  - The stem gall fly (Procecidochares utilis) significantly impacts host-plant biology by inhabiting specific parts of stem tissue, ensuring its own survival. Despite this, comprehensive identification of the primary bioactive compounds within host plants that are involved in gall formation remains elusive. This study aims to elucidate the crucial volatile compounds utilized by gall flies to alter host-plant defenses, either through direct or indirect manipulation via the release of an enticing volatile compound attractive to the fly. Employing Y-tube olfactometer assays, we examined the response of Procecidochares utilis to host plants from three Asteraceae weed species-Ageratina adenophora, Ageratum conyzoides, and Praxelis clematidea. Volatile compounds were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and SPME-FIBER. Subsequently, gas chromatographyelectroantennography and electroantennography were employed to analyze the antennal responses to individual odorants. The analysis revealed that the primary bioactive compound varied among the three weed species. Out of a total of 805 known volatiles, 65 main active compounds were exclusive to Ageratina adenophora (host plant). Remarkably, only 8 bioactive compounds were identified to elicit an antennal response from Procecidochares utilis. Notably, caryophyllene, (3-bisabolene, and 4-thujen-2-alpha-yl acetate exhibited the remarkable ability to elicit an attraction response from both sexes of Procecidochares utilis. Among these, (3-bisabolene emerged as the key compound, eliciting the most significant response from the gall fly antenna. Our findings offer novel insights into the specific attraction of the stem gall fly to Ageratina adenophora, utilizing key odorants as unique cues for initiating gall formation on its host plant. This discovery highlights how these cues enable the gall fly to exert direct or indirect control over its host. Additionally, these findings underscore the potential of this approach in the development of sustainable pest management strategies in the context of field trials.

AB  - Sympatric host-associated genetic differentiation is a prominent pattern that could lead to speciation. In insects, there are numerous examples of host-associated differentiation among herbivores that prefer different plants, and parasitoids that prefer different hosts, but few examples for specialist predators. We developed new microsatellite loci for two species of silver fly, Leucotaraxis argenticollis (Zetterstedt) and L. piniperda (Malloch) (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae), being evaluated as biological control agents for the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), in eastern North America where it is a nonnative pest. We obtained DNA from specimens of both fly species feeding on native A. tsugae in western North America, as well as on other western and eastern adelgid species. We performed population genetic analyses using the new loci and DNA barcode sequences. Our results confirmed east-west allopatric divergence and uncovered nested genetic differentiation associated with different adelgid prey species and their host plants in western North America for both species of silver flies. For both species, there is also evidence for a longer history of diversification in the west, with ancestral specialization of feeding on pine adelgids, which was retained after range expansion to the east. More recently, divergence to feeding on new adelgid prey species occurred in the west. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that host-alternating life cycles in Adelgidae may provide temporary escape from specialist predators. We discuss the implications for biological control efficacy and potential for lineage hybridization as western flies are released in the east to control A. tsugae.

AB  - Argentine stem weevil adults (ASW, Listronotus bonariensis) feed on the leaves of agricultural grasses and their larvae mine the pseudostem, causing extensive damage that can result in plant death. Plants emit volatiles that serve as signals to host-searching insects and these odours can be altered by both herbivory and fungal endophyte-infection. This study investigated whether ASW adults utilise olfaction to identify their host plants, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), and if conspecific herbivory or the presence of Epichloe festucae var. lolii fungal endophytes (strain wild-type or AR1) influenced such responses. Results from olfactometer bioassays established that ASW adults were able to utilise their olfactory response to orient towards volatiles released by perennial ryegrass and further, the weevils displayed a preference for plants previously damaged by conspecific weevils. However, there was no evidence that weevils had the ability to distinguish between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants using olfaction alone. Using a push-pull extraction technique, thirteen volatile compounds were identified in the blend released by perennial ryegrass. Endophyte and herbivory were found to alter these volatile compounds and quantities emitted by this forage grass. This study suggests that despite observing differences in the plant volatile blend, ASW do not perceive endophyte (wild-type and AR1) using olfaction alone and must rely on other cues, e.g. contact chemoreception or post-ingestional malaise, to detect the presence of a bioactive endophyte in an otherwise acceptable host plant.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Glycyrrhiza glabra, a family of licorice and a traditional Chinese medicine with sweet taste and favorable smell, has anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and immunomodulatory functions.
   Aim of the study: We developed a licorice extract (LE) by using glycyrrhiza glabra and administered it through nasal irrigation to treat allergic rhinitis (AR).
   Materials and methods: LE was prepared into extract powder, and the anti-inflammatory effect of the LE was evaluated by calcium ionophore-induced activated mast cell model (in vitro). Then, local passive anaphylaxis assays were applied to investigate the anti-IgE-mediated allergic reaction of the LE in mice (in vivo). A developed LE was administered through nasal irrigation to treat AR in clinic settings. A total of 60 participants diagnosed with AR were included in this clinical trial; they were randomly assigned to three interventions: licorice nasal irrigation (LNI), corticosteroid nasal irrigation (CNI), and saline nasal irrigation (SNI). They performed nasal irrigation once a day for 1 month. Both subjective questionnaires (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22] and visual analog scale [VAS]) and objective examinations (acoustic rhinometry and nasal endoscopy) were used for effectiveness assessments.
   Results: All three interventions could improve SNOT-22 scores, but the effects of LNI and CNI were more significant. According to VAS scores for nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal pruritus, postnasal discharge, and olfactory disturbance, the effect of LNI was superior to those of CNI and SNI. The results of rhinometry revealed that LNI significantly improved nasal resistance. Endoscopic analysis showed that both LNI and CNI, but not SNI, could significantly improve turbinate hypertrophy.

AB  - The most popular means of plant protection is the chemical method, but this control is often connected with the need for repeating chemical treatments. Thus, eco-friendly strategies should be developed where, under the European Green Deal, aromatic plants and their repellent properties seem to constitute a good alternative. In earlier studies, we have shown that insect injury, bacteria infestation and pathogen infection induce plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission, which can provide defensive functions to plants. In this study, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae) cv. 'Jenga' wheat plants were intentionally infected with one of four Rhizoctonia species (R. cerealis, R. solani, R. zeae, and R. oryzae). The soil was inoculated by the pathogens during sowing, whereas shoots were inoculated at stage BBCH 33. In greenhouse experiments, we measured VOCs from wheat 3, 7 and 11 days following stem infestation, or 42 days following soil inoculation of Rhizoctonia spp. VOC emissions were found to be largest on days 7 or 11 post-stem inoculation (> 3 days post-stem inoculation > 42 days post-soil inoculation). T. aestivum infected by pathogens induced five common green leaf volatiles (GLVs), namely (Z)-3-hexenal = (Z)-3-HAL, (E)-2-hexenal = (E)-2-HAL, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol= (Z)-3HOL, (E)2-hexenol = (E)-2-HOL, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate = (Z)-3-HAC], six common terpenes (beta-pinene = beta-PIN, beta-myrcene = beta-MYR, Z-ocimene = Z-OCI, linalool = LIN, benzyl acetate = BAC, beta-caryophyllene =beta-CAR), and indole = IND. We found that R. cerealis infested T. aestivum emitted the largest amounts of (Z)-3-HAL and (Z)-3HAC, while T. aestivum infested by R. solani released the largest amount of LIN (7 or 11 days following stem infestation). VOCs released by the T. aestivum after R. cerealis (AGD I) and R. solani (AG 5) infestations were significantly larger in comparison to R. zeae (WAG-Z) and R. oryzae (WAG-O) for the volatiles (Z)-3-HAL, (E)-2HAL, (Z)-3-HOL, (E)-2-HOL, (Z)-3-HAC, beta-PIN, beta-MYR, and LIN. With the exception of (E)-2-HOL, beta-MYR, LIN, BAC, beta-CAR, the other VOCs were emitted in similar amounts by infected T. aestivum 3 days following stem and soil inoculation. The quantities of induced VOCs were higher at days 7 and 11 than at 3 days post-infection, and greater when T. aestivum was infected with Rhizoctonia on the stem base than through the soil.

AB  - Phytophagy has promoted species diversification in many insect groups, including Hymenoptera, one of the most diverse animal orders on Earth. In the predominantly parasitoid family Braconidae, an association with insectinduced, plant galls in angiosperms have been reported in three subfamilies, but in particular in the Doryctinae, where it has been recorded to occur in species of ten genera. Allorhogas Gahan is the most species-rich of these genera, with its species having different phytophagous strategies. Here we conducted a comprehensive phylogenomic study for the doryctine gall-associated genera, with an emphasis on Allorhogas, using ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Based on this estimate of phylogeny we: (1) evaluated their taxonomic composition, (2) estimated the timing of origin of the gall-associated clade and divergence of its main subclades, and (3) performed ancestral state reconstruction analyses for life history traits related to their host-plant association. Our phylogenetic hypothesis confirmed Allorhogas as polyphyletic, with most of its members being nested in a main clade composed of various subclades, each comprising species with a particular host-plant family and herbivorous feeding habit. The origin of gall-association was estimated to have occurred during the late Oligocene to early Miocene, with a subsequent diversification of subclades during the middle to late Miocene and Pliocene. Overlap in divergence timing appears to occur between some taxa and their host-associated plant lineages. Evolution of the feeding strategies in the group shows "inquilinism-feeding" as the likely ancestral state, with gall-formation in different plant organs and seed predation having independently evolved on multiple occasions.

AB  - A cysteine proteinase inhibitor has been purified by affinity chromatography from the liver of buffalo. Liver cystatin is subjected to incubation at low pH with co-solvent TFE, where we have studied the effect on the conformation, activity and tendency to form aggregates or fibrils. ANS fluorescence was used to study conformational changes. The fibril formation and aggregation was studied using ThT assay, CD, FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy. At pH 3.0 there was no fibril formation though aggregates were formed but in presence of TFE fibrils appeared. At pH 2.0 and 1.0, TFE induced rapid fibril formation compared to only acid induced state as assessed by Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.TFE stabilized each of the three acid induced intermediates at predenaturational concentrations (20%) and accelerated fibril formation. Solvent conditions had a profound effect on the tendency of liver cystatin to produce fibrils and aggregation.

AB  - Simple Summary Hybrid rice often has higher yields than comparable inbred varieties. However, hybrids are sometimes more susceptible to insect herbivores. Outbreeding can improve herbivore resistance in hybrids compared to one (a condition called heterosis) or both (called heterobeltiosis) of their parental lines. The frequency of heterosis for resistance has not been assessed under varying soil nitrogen conditions. Nitrogen is predicted to reduce a plant's ability to resist herbivores but increases its ability to compensate for damage, known as tolerance. We examined the resistance and tolerance of eight hybrids and their parental lines to herbivores by exposing plants to the brown planthopper, whitebacked planthopper or yellow stemborer and observing herbivore fitness responses (i.e., resistance) and herbivore-induced changes to plant biomass (i.e., tolerance). There were no consistent trends in relative resistance or tolerance to the herbivores across plant types; however, improved resistance and tolerance were frequently associated with the male parent. Nitrogen reduced resistance and generally increased tolerance to herbivores irrespective of plant type. Across the eight hybrids, relative resistance and relative tolerance were not determined by heterosis or heterobeltiosis. Our results highlight the difficulties in predicting the outcomes of crossing to achieve relatively resistant hybrids.Abstract Hybrid rice results from crossing a male-sterile line (the A line) with a pollen doner (the restorer or R line). In 3-line hybrid breeding systems, a fertile B line is also required to maintain A line populations. Heterosis is defined as a condition of traits whereby the hybrid exceeds the average of the parental lines. Heterobeltiosis is where the hybrid exceeds both parents. Hybrid rice may display heterosis/heterobeltiosis for growth, yield and resistance to herbivores, among other traits. In a greenhouse experiment, we assessed the frequency of heterosis for resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugans (BPH)), whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera (WBPH)) and yellow stemborer (Scirpophaga incertulas (YSB)) in eight hybrids under varying soil nitrogen conditions. We also assessed plant biomass losses due to herbivore feeding as an approximation of tolerance (the plant's capacity to compensate for damage). Nitrogen reduced resistance to all three herbivores but was also associated with tolerance to WBPH and YSB based on improved plant survival, growth and/or yields. Plant biomass losses per unit weight of WBPH also declined under high nitrogen conditions for a number of hybrids, and there were several cases of overcompensation in rice for attacks by this herbivore. There was one case of nitrogen-related tolerance to BPH (increased grain yield) for a hybrid line with relatively high resistance, likely due to quantitative traits. Heterosis and heterobeltiosis were not essential to produce relatively high herbivore resistance or tolerance across hybrids.

AB  - Host-plant phenology can directly and indirectly mediate the abundance of insect herbivores. Our objective was to determine how host-plant flowering phenology shapes a facultative ant-lycaenid mutualism. The focus of our research was the hops azure, Celastrina humulus Scott & D. Wright, a rare species whose larvae feed on the pollen-bearing inflorescences of Humulus lupulus var. neomexicanus. We used several approaches to evaluate the role of host-plant flowering phenology in this system. First, we monitored larvae over three study years (2020-2022) to parse the role of host-plant flowering phenology and other factors in shaping the likelihood of ant tending. Second, we tested larval performance at various phenological stages of the host plant. We also quantified variation in soluble proteins and secondary metabolites among inflorescences at varying phenological stages. Lastly, we treated artificial sugar-protein baits with extracts from different phenological stages of the host plant; this allowed us to assess how chemical variation among stages could impact ant recruitment. Monitoring results revealed that the likelihood of ant tending was lowest for larvae on host plants with early-stage inflorescences. These floral stages had the greatest concentrations of both soluble proteins and alpha-acids (humulone and cohumulone), and in the feeding trial, early-stage flowers enabled greater weight gain for larvae. However, extracts from early-stage flowers reduced ant recruitment to sugar-protein baits. Altogether, these results suggest that early-stage inflorescences enhance larval growth while also reducing the recruitment of mutualist ants. This shows an indirect mechanism whereby changing host-plant phenology can mediate herbivore populations through interactions with ants.

AB  - Exploring the interactions between host plants, herbivores, and natural enemies is an important experimental approach for enhancing biological control. Induced plant defense responses following infestation by herbivores enable plants to minimize damage. Orius sauteri (Poppius), an important generalist predator, has been widely used as a biological control agent for suppressing many agricultural pests on agronomic and horticultural crops. Because this predator oviposits and feeds on plant tissue, in this work we hypothesized that these behaviors can induce defenses that modulate the subsequent pest attack. For this, we explored the fitness parameters of two key pests, the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and the tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), on three different O. sauteri-pre-inoculated plant species, tomato, cucumber, and cowpea when compared to non-pre-inoculated plants. Pre-inoculation of O. sauteri on these three plant species decreased the performance of both herbivore pests but to differing degrees. The survival of F. occidentalis on tomato and B. tabaci on cowpea was significantly reduced on O. sauteri-pre-inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated plants. The reproduction of B. tabaci on tomato, cucumber, and cowpea was decreased in varying degrees by the pre-release of O. sauteri, whereas in the case of F. occidentalis the reproduction was only reduced on tomato and cucumber pre-inoculated plants. These results further enhance our knowledge of ecological relationships between natural enemies and herbivores and provide the context for the early release of natural enemies to control pests.

AB  - 1. Trophic interactions and plant-herbivore network structure may be regulated by ecological and evolutionary factors. The allocation of resources to physical and chemical traits may influence plant nutritional values and defence against insect herbivores. However, the elemental consistency of plant leaves is rarely considered a functional trait, despite leaf chemical traits being critical for understanding trophic interactions and network modularity.
   2. We constructed a high-resolution network of a plant-caterpillar food web in a subtropical forest in southern China using DNA barcoding. We analysed whether abundance, phylogeny, and functional traits (including leaf chemical elements) significantly differed among modules and conducted linear regressions to explore how these traits could explain the intensity and likelihood of trophic interactions between plants and caterpillars.
   3. Caterpillar feeding intensity increased with increasing specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio. The intensity and likelihood of feeding decreased with increasing calcium and magnesium levels. Leaf dry matter content and leaf concentrations of potassium, magnesium, copper, and manganese varied among modules. Caterpillar feeding likelihood and intensity were constrained by plant and caterpillar phylogenies, and module phylogenetic clustering was apparent. Species abundance of plants and caterpillars constrained the feeding intensity but not the likelihood of feeding and network module composition.
   4. We highlighted the combined roles of functional traits and phylogeny in shaping trophic interactions and modularity in plant-insect herbivore networks and illustrated the importance of leaf stoichiometry in establishing dietary associations.

AB  - Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), the main cause of low back pain, is closely related to the inflammatory microenvironment in the nucleus pulposus (NP). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in inflammation-related metabolic disturbance of NP cells. Melatonin has been proven to regulate the metabolism of NP cells, but whether it can protect NP cells from TNF-alpha-induced damage is still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role and specific mechanism of melatonin on regulating the metabolism of NP cells in the inflammatory microenvironment.
   Methods: Western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of melatonin membrane receptors (MTNR1A/B) and TNF-alpha in human NP tissues. In vitro, human primary NP cells were treated with or without vehicle, TNF-alpha and melatonin. And the metabolic markers were also detected by western blotting and RT-qPCR. The activity of NF-KB signaling and Hippo/YAP signaling were assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Membrane receptors inhibitors, pathway inhibitors, lentiviral infection, plasmids transfection and immunoprecipitation were used to explore the specific mechanism of melatonin. In vivo, the rat IDD model was constructed and melatonin was injected intraperitoneally to evaluate its therapeutical effect on IDD.
   Results: The upregulation of TNF-alpha and downregulation of melatonin membrane receptors (MTNR1A/B) were observed in degenerative NP tissues. Then we demonstrated that melatonin could alleviate the development of IDD in a rat model and reverse TNF-alpha-impaired metabolism of NP cells in vitro. Further investigation revealed that the protective effects of melatonin on NP cells mainly rely on MTNR1 B, which subsequently activates Gai2 protein. The activation of Gai2 could upregulate the yes-associated protein (YAP) level, resulting in anabolic enhancement of NP cells. In addition, melatonin-mediated YAP upregulation increased the expression of IKBa and suppressed the TNF-alpha-induced activation of the NF-KB pathway, thereby inhibiting the catabolism of NP cells.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed that melatonin can reverse TNF-alpha-impaired metabolism of NP cells via the MTNR1B/Gai2/YAP axis and suggested that melatonin can be used as a potential therapeutic drug in the treatment of IDD.

AB  - The aim of this research was to study the effect of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) isolated from the drought-tolerant plants camel thorn (Alhagi pseudoalhagi (M.Bieb.) Fisch) and white pigweed (Chenopodium album L.) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants cv. Lenigradskaya 6, growing under hydroponic conditions and osmotic stress (generated by 12% polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG)). Based on the assumption that plants create a unique microbiome that helps them overcome various stresses, we hypothesized that bacteria isolated from drought-tolerant plants may assist cultivated wheat plants in coping with drought stress. PGPB were isolated from seeds and leaves of plants and identified as Bacillus spp. (strains Cap 07D, Cap 09D, and App 11D); Paenibacillus sp. (Cap 286); and Arthrobacter sp. (Cap 03D). All bacteria produced different phytohormones such as indole acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellic acid (GAS3) and were capable of stimulating wheat growth under normal and osmotic stress conditions. All PGPB reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, increased the total chlorophyll content by increasing chlorophyll a, and modulated wheat hormone homeostasis and CAT and POX activities under osmotic conditions. Selected strains can be promising candidates for the mitigating of the drought stress of wheat plants.

AB  - Invasive plants from their native and introduced ranges differ in their interactions with herbivores but it is not known whether they also vary in their interactions with herbivore natural enemies. Here, we used olfactometer bioassays and cage experiments to investigate how foraging behaviors of 2 parasitoid and 1 hyperparasitoid species depended on plant population origin. Triadica sebifera (Euphorbiaceae) is native to China but invasive in the United States. In China, it is fed on by a specialist noctuid Gadirtha fusca (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), which hosts a parasitoid Apanteles sp. (Hymenoptera: Microgastinae) and hyperparasitoid (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) plus a generalist aphid Toxoptera odinae (Homoptera: Aphidiidae) parasitized by Lysiphlebus confusus (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae). Both parasitoids preferred plants infested by their host over herbivore-free plants in olfactometer bioassays. Apanteles sp. and Eurytomid wasps preferred G. fusca infested plants from China populations over those from US populations in olfactometer bioassays but L. confusus wasps did not discriminate between T. odinae infested plants from China vs. US populations. Similarly, G. fusca caterpillars on China population plants were more likely to be parasitized than ones on US population plants when they were in the same cage but odds of parasitism for T. odinae did not differ for those on China vs. US population plants. These results suggest that populations from the native and introduced ranges may differ in traits that impact higher trophic levels. This may have implications for successful control of invasive plants as biocontrol agents are introduced or herbivores begin to feed on them in their introduced ranges.

AB  - Most coexisting insect species exhibit stunted growth compared to individual species on plants. This phenomenon reflects an interspecific antagonism drawing extensive attention, while the underlying mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. Mirids (Apolygus lucorum) and cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera) are two common cotton pests. We identified a secretory protein, ASP1, from the oral secretion of mirids, found in the nucleus of mirid-infested cotton leaves. ASP1 specifically targets the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and inhibits NINJA-mediated recruitment of TPL, promoting plant defense response and gossypol accumulation in cotton glands. ASP1-enhanced defense inhibits the growth of cotton bollworms on cotton plants, while having limited impact on mirids. The mesophyll-feeding characteristic allows mirids to avoid most cotton glands, invalidating cotton defense. Our investigation reveals the molecular mechanism by which mirids employ cotton defense to selectively inhibit the feeding of cotton bollworms.

AB  - Plants produce a diversity of secondary metabolites including volatile organic compounds. Some species show discrete variation in these volatile compounds such that individuals within a population can be grouped into distinct chemotypes. A few studies reported that volatile-mediated induced resistance is more effective between plants belonging to the same chemotype and that chemotypes are heritable. The authors concluded that the ability of plants to differentially respond to cues from related individuals that share the same chemotype is a form of kin recognition. These studies assumed plants were actively responding but did not test the mechanism of resistance. A similar result was possible through the passive adsorption and reemission of repellent or toxic VOCs by plants exposed to damage-induced plant volatiles (DIPVs). Here we conducted exposure experiments with five chemotypes of sagebrush in growth chambers; undamaged receiver plants were exposed to either filtered air or DIPVs from mechanically wounded branches. Receiver plants exposed to DIPVs experienced less herbivore damage, which was correlated with increased expression of genes involved in plant defense as well as increased emission of repellent VOCs. Plants belonging to two of the five chemotypes exhibited stronger resistance when exposed to DIPVs from plants of the same chemotypes compared to when DIPVs were from plants of a different chemotype. Moreover, some plants passively absorbed DIPVs and reemitted them, potentially conferring associational resistance. These findings support previous work demonstrating that sagebrush plants actively responded to alarm cues and that the strength of their response was dependent on the chemotypes of the plants involved. This study provides further support for kin recognition in plants but also identified volatile-mediated associational resistance as a passively acquired additional defense mechanism in sagebrush.

AB  - Background: Neuroinflammation induced by lead exposure (Pb) is a major cause of neurotoxicity of Pb in the central nervous system (CNS). The NLR family, domain of pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3) involves in various neurological diseases, while the question of whether NLRP3 plays a role in lead-induced neuroinflammation has not yet been reported. Methods: Developmental and knockout (KO) NLRP3 mice were used to establish two in vivo models, and BV2 cells were used to establish an in vitro model. Behavioral and electrophysiologic tests were used to assess the neurotoxicity of Pb, and immunofluorescence staining was used to assess neuroinflammation. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to examine the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasomes. siRNA technology was used to block NLRP3 expression. Results: Pb exposure led to neural injure and microglial activation in the hippocampus region, while minocycline intervention attenuated Pb-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting neuroinflammation. Pb increased the expression of NLRP3 and promoted cleavage of caspase-1 in mRNA and protein levels, and minocycline partially reversed the effects of Pb on NLRP3 inflammasomes. Blocking of NLRP3 by KO mice or siRNA attenuated neural alterations induced by Pb, weakened microglial activation in vivo and in vitro as well, without affecting the accumulation of Pb. Pb increased autophagic protein levels and phosphorylation of NF-Kappa B, while suppressing autophagy or NF-Kappa B inhibited Pb's effects on NLRP3. Conclusions: NLRP3 is involved in the regulation of Pb-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Ageing is associated with impaired performance in recognition memory, a process that consists of the discrim-ination of familiar and novel stimuli. Previous studies have shown the impact of ageing on object recognition memories. However, the early stages of memory impairment remain unknown. To fill this gap, we aimed at evaluating the ability of young (Y), middle-aged (MA), and senile (S) female Sprague-Dawley rats to retain 24 h long-term recognition memory. The MA cohort was included to characterise early memory deficits under two behavioural paradigms based on spontaneous location recognition (SLR) and spontaneous object recognition (SOR) tasks. In the SLR task, there was a markedly diminished novel discrimination capacity in the MA and S rats compared with the Y ones. In the SOR task, S rats evidenced a deterioration in novelty discrimination, while MA rats partially preserved the capacity to distinguish the new stimulus as compared with Y rats. Regarding early changes from MA to S rats, immunohistochemistry showed a marked decrease in the number and diameter of adult-born immature neurons in the Dentate Gyrus (DG) with a positive correlation with behavioural perfor-mance in the SLR task. Furthermore, we found a slight reduction in CA3 mature neurons and a decrease in the number of total microglia in the perirhinal cortex (Prh) in MA and S rats as compared with Y rats. As regards changes that were only observed in S rats, we found an increase in the number of total and reactive microglia in CA3 and a reduction in the number of total microglia in the DG. We conclude that spatial discrimination capacity could be affected earlier than feature discrimination capacity. We suggest that early depletion of neurogenesis in MA rats is involved in object location recognition deficits, whereas the disruption of microglial homeostasis in the Prh could be associated with object feature discrimination capacity.

AB  - Simple Summary The quantity and quality of forage grass may decrease to some extent in autumn and winter, and feeding with such forage grass may temporarily cause malnutrition and ovarian oxidative stress in ewes. Arginine is one of the most abundant amino acids enhancing the antioxidant capability in animal tissues. Thus, this study investigated the effects of arginine on ovarian antioxidant capability during the luteal phase in ewes. Our results showed that nutrition restriction can reduce the ovarian antioxidant capability in ewes, while arginine supplementation can significantly improve it, which was associated with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 pathway. This study evaluated the effect of arginine (Arg) on ovarian antioxidant capability during the luteal phase in ewes. A total of 108 multiparous Hu sheep at two years of age were randomly allocated to three groups: a control group (CG), a restriction group (RG), and an Arg group (AG), with six replicates per group and six ewes per replicate. Our results showed that the end body weight was significantly decreased in the RG group (p < 0.05), while the Arg addition reversed this reduction. The estrous cycle days were significantly increased in the RG group (p < 0.05), while Arg addition reversed this time extension. Compared with the control group, restricting feeding could significantly enhance the number of small follicles (SF), total follicles (TF), large corpora lutea, and the SF/TF (p < 0.05), while Arg addition reduced the number of SF and TF. However, the large follicles/TF were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while Arg addition reversed this reduction. In addition, nutrition restriction significantly increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level (p < 0.05), while significantly decreased the glutathione/glutathione disulfide and the activities of superoxidative dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in the ovaries (p < 0.05). However, Arg addition reversed this enhancement of the MDA level and the reductions in these antioxidant enzymes activities. In addition, positive relationships occurred between antioxidant enzyme activities and the enzyme mRNA expressions. Meanwhile, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA expression was positively connected with antioxidant mRNA expressions and negatively related to the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mRNA expression. The Nrf2 protein expression was negatively related to the Keap1 protein expression. In conclusion, nutrition restriction reduced the ovarian antioxidant capability in ewes, while this was significantly improved by Arg supplementation, which was associated with the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.

AB  - This work was the first to report twelve natural estrogens (NEs) in the urines of six threatened or endangered mammalians in a Zoo Park of Guangzhou (i.e., panda, gorilla, elephant, African lion, jaguar, and leopard). Ten out of twelve NEs were detected at least in one urine sample of the six mammalians studied, including the four major NEs (i.e., estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-estradiol (alpha E2), estriol (E3)), and six other NEs (i.e., 4-hydroxyestrone (4OHE1), 2-hydroxyestradiol (2OHE2), 4-hydroxyestradiol (4OHE2), 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha-OHE1), 16ketoestradiol (16ketoE2), and 17epiestriol (17epiE3)). The six studied mammalians, ranked in the order of high to low urinary concentration of total NEs, were jaguar, African lion, gorilla, elephant, panda, and leopard, with respective urinary concentrations of 110.4, 86.4, 71.4, 66.0, 55.9, and 52.8 ng/ mL. According to the average urinary concentration of NE in the six mammalians ranked from high to low, the top five NEs detected were 16 alpha-OHE1, 4OHE1, El, E3, and 17epiE3, respectively. These clearly indicated the occurrence of NEs other than the four major types in urines of animals in a Zoo Park. Moreover, the daily excretion rates of the five detected NEs by one elephant ranged from 1162-2254 mu g/d with a total daily excretion rate of 8260 mu g/d, suggesting that the total urinary excretion of NEs by one adult elephant was equivalent to that by 170 premenopausal women or 506 adult men. Consequently, it appears from this study that NEs in the urines of zoo animals should be considered an emerging source of NEs.

AB  - The problem of human-elephant conflict (HEC) now appears to be one of the greatest challenges in the forest-based mouzas of West Bengal as well as in India. As per the field survey from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021, a total of 277 (16.55%) and 920 (4.21%) mouzas were identified as HEC-affected out of 1674 and 21,832 recognized mouzas in Northern and Southern parts of West Bengal, respectively. Here, the destruction of crops, huts, death and injury of human, livestocks, and even elephants have been increased year after year. Crop-raiding incident is the most common problem among all that occurs during the milky stage and harvesting stage of paddy. Numerous studies have been carried out showing the pattern of HEC incident in some areas of West Bengal, but none of them have tried to identify the HEC risk depending upon crop-raiding incident in this state. Here, it has been tried to examine the mouza-wise HEC risk based on crop-raiding incident in the stated two parts of West Bengal. Two important parameters, the number of crop fields raided and the total number of crop fields present but not raided, were taken into consideration to measure the HEC risk. The result shows that the Jhargram (0.75-0.98), Medinipur (0.68-0.89), and Rupnarayan (0.68-0.89) forest divisions are the highest HEC risk areas in West Bengal. The most dominant factor as determined from the principal component analysis is the lack of fodder and other biological requirements that are one of the basic needs for survival of the elephants within the forest (0.864). The total risk for raiding crop is 3.21 and 2.93 in the two parts of West Bengal. Here, the paddy and vegetables fields are more prone to be raided. Moreover, descriptive statistics were also used to explain the patterns of crop-raiding incidents. The findings may provide a way out for the sustainable management of HEC risk like establishment of micro-habitat, creation of elephant proof trench/electric fences, and rapid plantation of indigenous plant species in the vacant forest areas, thereby helping the policymakers in wildlife conservation.

AB  - Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) precipitation generally requires an external phosphorus source to increase the recovery of NH4+-N from biogas slurry. However, P-rich piggery biogas residue has been ignored as a phosphorus source. In this study, biogas residue was carbonized into biogas residue biochar (BRC), followed by acid leaching to synthesize functionalized BRC and release PO43--P from its ash as the phosphorus source. The effects of different acids on the leaching efficiency and morphological changes of P in BRC were investigated, and NH4+-N and PO43--P in the biogas slurry were recovered with functionalized BRC and MAP precipitation. The results showed that oxalic acid-hydrochloric acid mixed acid could leach more than 96% of P in BRC, while weakening the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on MAP precipitation. The BRC was mainly composed of inorganic P, and most nonapatite IP and apatite P (Ca-3(PO4)(2)) were leached during acid leaching, with the latter more easily leached. Under optimal recovery conditions, the method had a significant recovery effect on NH4+-N (96.4%) and PO43--P (99.3%) in biogas slurry. The recovery of NH4+-N and PO43-P by functionalized BRC was mainly through chemical precipitation (forming NH4MgPO4 center dot H2O precipitate) while bonding with -OH, C = O and C-H functional groups. The final recovery product was also a BRC-based slow-release N-P fertilizer rich in struvite. This study solved the disposal problems of P-rich biogas residue and N-rich biogas slurry while providing an innovative technology for the resource utilization of faecal sewage at pig farms.

AB  - Ten Canadian-grown lignocellulosic agro-forestry residues were screened for non-catalytic, catalytic, and composition effects in biocrude production via hydrothermal liquefaction. Evaluation of Canadian agricultural residue availability indicated a significant variation, with wheat straw determined to be the most abundant at 38.3 million metric tonnes annually, while flax straw and dried distillers' grains had limited availability for a hypothetical biorefinery. Comparing K2CO3 + Fe catalyst and non-catalytic screening revealed a pronounced catalytic effect for softwoods over straws and hardwood due to higher lignin content. Trends included increase in biocrude and oxygen content with holocellulose, while higher lignin tended to decrease oxygen content of the biocrude. Catalytically, pig manure performed poorly with the lowest biocrude yield (9.3 wt%) while dried distillers' grains was desired due to high biocrude yield (25.3 wt%) with the lowest oxygen content (10.2 wt%). Barley among straws and aspen among woods were promising based on high catalytic biocrude yields (23.3 & 26.5 wt%) and moderate oxygen content (20.8 & 21.4 wt%). Catalytic effects for both straw and wood included changes to product yields, increase in degree of degradation, energy recovery, and biocrude volatility, as well as a decrease in biocrude acidity, density, and heteroatoms. A fibre-based multiple linear regression model had a strong fit (R-adjusted(2) = 0.87) for catalytic biocrude yield, with positive contribution in the order of extractives > cellulose > hemicellulose > lignin, while volatile matter had the strongest individual correlation to catalytic biocrude yield (R-2 = 0.94). Next steps in HTL optimization and biocrude upgrading were identified to advance the feasibility of lignocellulosic biocrude production for sustainable transportation fuel production through integration with existing crude oil refineries.

AB  - Objective: Remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine, is widely used as an anesthetic in endoscopic procedures; however, its effects on cognitive function remain unclear, limiting its broader application in general anaesthesia. Neuroinflammation is a well-established key factor in the etiology and progression of cognitive dysfunction, including conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, postoperative delirium, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that remimazolam exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and clinical reports indicate a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium in patients treated with remimazolam. Nevertheless, whether remimazolam improves cognitive function through its antiinflammatory properties remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of remimazolam and its underlying mechanism in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of neuroinflammation, neuronal injury, and cognitive dysfunction Methods: C57BL/6 J male mice were administered LPS intraperitoneally to establish a model of neuroinflammation-induced cognitive impairment. A subset of mice received remimazolam via intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes prior to LPS administration. Cognitive performance was evaluated using behavioural tests, including the Morris Water Maze (MWM), Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test, and Open Field Test (OFT). Hippocampal tissues were analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to assess structural changes. Inflammatory markers, including Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were quantified using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative PCR. Immunofluorescence was used to detect translocator protein (TSPO) and markers of microglia activation (IBA-1, CD16/32, and CD206). Results: (1) Remimazolam reversed LPS-induced cognitive deficits, as evidenced by shorter spatial exploration latency and increased platform crossings in the MWM, and an elevated recognition index in the NOR test. (2) Remimazolam improved hippocampal morphology, reducing LPS-induced neuronal damage. (3) Remimazolam significantly decreased levels of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, inhibited microglial activation, promoted M2-type microglia polarization, and increased TSPO expression. Conclusion: Remimazolam demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects in a mouse model of LPS-induced cognitive impairment. These effects are likely mediated through the regulation of TSPO, which inhibits microglial activation and promotes the polarization of microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.

AB  - Grayanotoxin I (GTX I) is a major toxin in leaves of Rhododendron species, where it provides a defence against insect and vertebrate herbivores. Surprisingly, it is also present in R. ponticum nectar, and this can hold important implications for plant-pollinator mutualisms. However, knowledge of GTX I distributions across the genus Rhododendron and in different plant materials is currently limited, despite the important ecological function of this toxin. Here we characterise GTX I expression in the leaves, petals, and nectar of seven Rhododendron species. Our results indicated interspecific variation in GTX I concentration across all species. GTX I concentrations were consistently higher in leaves compared to petals and nectar. Our findings provide preliminary evidence for phenotypic correlation between GTX I concentrations in defensive tissues (leaves and petals) and floral rewards (nectar), suggesting that Rhododendron species may commonly experience functional trade-offs between herbivore defence and pollinator attraction.

AB  - Camellia luteoflora Y.K. Li ex Hung T. Chang & F.A. Zeng belongs to the Camellia L. genus (Theaceae Mirb.). As an endemic, rare, and critically endangered species in China, it holds significant ornamental and economic value, garnering global attention due to its ecological rarity. Despite its conservation importance, genomic investigations on this species remain limited, particularly in organelle genomics, hindering progress in phylogenetic classification and population identification. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing to assemble the first complete mitochondrial genome of C. luteoflora and reannotated its chloroplast genome. Through integrated bioinformatics analyses, we systematically characterized the mitochondrial genome's structural organization, gene content, interorganellar DNA transfer, sequence variation, and evolutionary relationships.Key findings revealed a circular mitochondrial genome spanning 587,847 bp with a GC content of 44.63%. The genome harbors70 unique functional genes, including 40 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 27 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes. Notably, 9 PCGs contained 22 intronic regions. Codon usage analysis demonstrated a pronounced A/U bias in synonymous codon selection. Structural features included 506 dispersed repeats and 240 simple sequence repeats. Comparative genomics identified 19 chloroplast-derived transfer events, contributing 29,534 bp (3.77% of total mitochondrial DNA). RNA editing prediction revealed 539 C-to-T conversion events across PCGs. Phylogenetic reconstruction using mitochondrial PCGs positioned C. luteoflora in closest evolutionary proximity to Camellia sinensis var. sinensis. Selection pressure analysis (Ka/Ks ratios < 1 for 11 PCGs) and nucleotide diversity assessment (Pi values: 0-0.00711) indicated strong purifying selection and low sequence divergence.This study provides the first comprehensive mitochondrial genomic resource for C. luteoflora, offering critical insights for germplasm conservation, comparative organelle genomics, phylogenetic resolution, and evolutionary adaptation studies in Camellia species.

AB  - The application of laser-synthesized nanodiamonds (LNDs) is of great interest to biomedical researchers and drug developers because this emerging method of synthesis yields nanodiamonds of consistent size (<5 nm diameter) and surface chemistry that can be functionalized to perform a staggering range of highly specialized tasks. The present study assessed the threshold at which LNDs in various conjugations and concentrations triggered immune responses and cytotoxicity in peripheral mononuclear blood cells from healthy donors, as assessed by changes in ATP concentrations and induced secretion of the cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Conjugations assessed were raw (unconjugated) NDs, PEGylated (PEG5k-NDs), and antibody conjugated to goat anti-mouse antibodies (IgG-NDs). Concentrations of each conjugation were prepared and tested at 50.0, 10.0, 2.0, 0.4, and 0.08 mu g/mL. Results showed that pegylated and raw NDs were well tolerated, with the indicators of inflammation or minimal cytotoxicity emerging only at the highest concentrations tested (50.0 mu g/mL). IgG-NDs showed signs of inflammatory responses at the two highest concentrations tested (10.0 and 50.0 mu g/mL). There was some evidence that the dilutant vehicle used for ND suspension may have contributed to the immune response. All three ND configurations increased ATP concentration in a dose-dependent manner, up to a concentration of 10.0 mu g/mL. At the highest concentration (50.0 mu g/mL), the ND solutions showed minimal signs of cytotoxicity. Conclusion from this testing suggest that LNDs are likely to offer substantial utility in biomedical applications because of their capacity to evade the immune response at concentrations at least as high as 2.0 mu g/mL and potentially up to 50.0 mu g/mL.

AB  - Text-to-SQL leverages large language models (LLMs) for natural language database queries, yet existing benchmarks like BIRD (12,751 question-SQL pairs, 95 databases) suffer from inconsistencies-e.g., 30% of queries misalign with SQL outputs-and ambiguities that impair LLM evaluation. This study refines such datasets by distilling logically sound question-SQL pairs and enhancing table schemas, yielding a benchmark of 146 high-complexity tasks across 11 domains. We assess GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini, Qwen-2.5-Instruct, llama 370b, DPSK-v3 and O1-Preview in zero-shot scenarios, achieving average accuracies of 51.23%, 41.65%, 44.25%, 47.80%, and 49.10% and a peak of 78.08% (O1-Preview), respectively. Prompt-based strategies improve performance by up to 4.78%, addressing issues like poor domain adaptability and inconsistent training data interpretation. Error-annotated datasets further reveal LLM limitations. This refined benchmark ensures robust evaluation of logical reasoning, supporting reliable NLP-driven database systems.

AB  - Herbivore-induced defense responses are often specific, whereas plants could induce distinct defense responses corresponding to infestation by different herbivorous insects. Brown plant hopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a phloem-feeding insect, and rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, a chewing insect, are both specialist herbivores on rice. To characterize the distinct resistance primed by prior damage to these two specialist herbivores, we challenged rice plants with two herbivores during vegetative growth of parent plants and assessed plant resistance in subsequent ratoons. Here, we show that LF and BPH induce different suites of defense responses in parent rice plants, LF induced higher level of JA accumulation and OsAOS, OsCOl1 transcripts, while BPH induced higher accumulation of SA and OsPAL1 transcripts. Moreover, an apparent loss of LF resistance was observed in OsAOS, OsCOl1 RNAi lines. Ratoon plants generated from parents receiving prior LF infestation exhibited higher jasmonic acid (JA) levels and elevated levels of transcripts of defense-related genes associated with JA signaling, while ratoon generated from parents receiving prior BPH infestation exhibited higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and elevated levels of transcripts of defense-related genes associated with SA signaling. Moreover, previous LF infestation obviously elevated ratoons resistance to LF, while previous infestation by BPH led to enhanced resistance in ratoons to BPH. Pre-priming of ratoons defense to LF was significantly reduced in OsAOS and OsCOl1 RNAi plant, but silencing OsAOS and OsCOl1 did not attenuate ratoons resistance to BPH. These results suggest that infestation of two specialist herbivores with different feeding styles in parent crop led to distinct defense responses in subsequent rations, and the acquired resistance to LF in ratoons is associated with priming of jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses.

AB  - Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner (variegated thistle, milk thistle) is one of the worst weeds of hill country pasture in the east coast regions of New Zealand. As part of an initial investigation into the potential for biocontrol, a survey of the phytophagous insects associated with S. marianum in New Zealand was carried out at 16 populations from 29 November to 16 December 2021. Phytophagous associations were determined by collecting insects on the plant and by seedhead dissections. The species collected were grouped into three categories: 'specialists', 'generalists', and 'tourists' that comprised 27.4%, 66.3%, and 6.3% of the total number of specimens collected, respectively. The specialist group was almost entirely comprised of the seedhead weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus (Fr & ouml;lich). While adults of R. conicus were commonly collected on variegated thistle, only 6.5% of seedheads contained larvae of the weevil, indicating that S. marianum is not a common developmental host. Generalist species commonly collected on S. marianum included: Nysius caledoniae Distant, Rhypodes clavicornis (F.), Closterotomus norwegicus (Gmelin) and Nezara virdula (L.). Overall, the field surveys document low levels of attack from generalist herbivores and minimal attack by the specialist weevil, R. conicus. Vacant niches are present on the weed in New Zealand, providing a strong case for introducing specialised biocontrol agents.

AB  - Place cells and grid cells are important neurons involved in spatial navigation in the mammalian brain. Grid cells are believed to play an important role in forming a cognitive map of the environment. Experimental observations in recent years showed that the grid pattern is not invariant but is influenced by the shape of the spatial environment. However, the cause of this deformation remains elusive. Here, we focused on the functional interactions between place cells and grid cells, utilizing the information of location relationships between the firing fields of place cells to optimize the previous grid cell feedforward generation model and expand its application to more complex environmental scenarios. Not only was the regular equilateral triangle periodic firing field structure of the grid cells reproduced, but the expected results were consistent with the experiment for the environment with various complex boundary shapes and environmental deformation. Even in the field of three-dimensional spatial grid patterns, forward-looking predictions have been made. This provides a possible model explanation for how the coupling of grid cells and place cells adapt to the diversity of the external environment to deepen our understanding of the neural basis for constructing cognitive maps.

AB  - Giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis spp. feed mainly on browse in the wild. The logistical challenges, especially in temperate climates, to provide these animals with fresh browse year-round have resulted in zoos resorting to alternative feeds. Amongst these, high-sugar or high-starch concentrates can lead to pathologies which may, in part, be recognised by a reduced body condition score (BCS). Questionnaire data were obtained from 125 European and North American zoos with information on the animal's identity, health status, husbandry conditions and diet. The feed was summarised by season and compared to the animals' BCS assessed from photographs. There were no relationships between BCS and group size, enclosure size or feeding frequency. Over 80% of zoos offered browse (fresh, dry, frozen or silage) to giraffes in summer and winter, but the amount varied from a small branch daily per animal to feeding for ad libitum consumption. In most zoos, lucerne was offered as hay or fresh, and was fed for ad libitum consumption in 66% of facilities. 98% of zoos offered a high-fibre pelleted feed, but only 6% provided this feed for ad libitum consumption. Cereals and low-fibre pellets were fed in varying quantities in 50% of zoos, and their use was negatively related to BCS. Offering higher amounts of a high-fibre pelleted diet had an optimising effect on the BCS, especially in senescent animals. Together with browse and lucerne, high-fibre herbivore pellets should form the continuously available staple diet of zoo-housed giraffes to maintain an optimal body condition score.

To understand the regulatory mechanism of golden color formation, the metabolites of C. nitidissima petals at five different developmental stages were detected, a proteome map of petals was first constructed via tandem mass tag (TMT) analysis, and the accuracy of the sequencing data was validated via parallel reaction monitoring (PRM).ResultsNineteen color components were detected, and most of these components were carotenoids that gradually accumulated, while some metabolites were flavonoids that were gradually depleted. A total of 97,647 spectra were obtained, and 6,789 quantifiable proteins were identified. Then, 1,319 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found, 55 of which belong to the flavonoid and carotenoid pathways, as revealed by pairwise comparisons of protein expression levels across the five developmental stages. Notably, most DEPs involved in the synthesis of flavonoids, such as phenylalanine ammonium lyase and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, were downregulated during petal development, whereas DEPs involved in carotenoid synthesis, such as phytoene synthase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, and beta-cyclase, tended to be upregulated. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that these 55 DEPs formed two distinct PPI networks closely tied to the flavonoid and carotenoid synthesis pathways. Phytoene synthase and chalcone synthase exhibited extensive interactions with numerous other proteins and displayed high connectivity within the PPI networks, suggesting their pivotal biological functions in flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis.ConclusionProteomic data on the flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways were obtained, and the regulatory roles of the DEPs were analyzed, which provided a theoretical basis for further understanding the golden color formation mechanism of C. nitidissima.

AB  - Tea plant can enrich a large amount of fluorine (F) in the cell wall of its mature leaves, thus posing the risk of excessive intake of F for tea consumers. This study investigated the effect of foliar calcium (Ca) application (0.05-1 mM) on F accumulation in tea plant leaves by analyzing the association of F with cell wall materials, pectin methylesterification structure, and cell wall genes. Ca spray could effectively reduce the F level, the content of wall carbohydrates (excluding the chelate pectin fraction) and the pectin methylesterification degree in tea plant leaves. Correlation analysis further revealed that the tea leaf F content was positively correlated with most of the cell wall materials. Transcriptomics analysis indicated that the key genes involved in reorganization of cell wall polysaccharides (such as CslE6, XTH32, PG, PGIP, PME18, PMEU1, and PMEI9) were associated with the variations in F content and cell wall components. All the results suggest that Ca may lessen the tea leaf F level by reducing the accumulation of cell wall materials and intervening the cell wall structure and gene expression. This study provided useful information for reducing the F level and solving the F safety problem in tea plant.

AB  - Plants have evolved elaborate surveillance systems that allow them to perceive the attack by pests and pathogens and activate the appropriate defenses. Mechanical stimulation, such as mechanical wounding, represents one of the most reliable cues for the perception of potential herbivore aggressors. Here we demonstrate that mechanical wounding disturbs the growth versus defense balance in tomato, a physiological condition where growth reduction arises as a pleiotropic consequence of the activation of defense responses (or vice-versa). We observed that multiple lesions on tomato leaves impairs the formation of several growth-related traits, including shoot elongation, leaf expansion and time for flowering, while concomitantly activating the production of defense responses such as trichome formation and the upregulation of defense-related genes. We also provide genetic evidence that this wound-induced growth repression is possibly a consequence of tomato plants sensing the injuries via jasmonates (JAs), a class of plant hormones known to be master regulators of the plant growth versus defense balance. Besides providing a mechanistic explanation on how the growth and defense balance is shifted when plants are subjected to a specific type of mechanical stimulus, our results may offer a practical explanation for why tomato productivity is so negatively impacted by herbivore attack.

AB  - The number of olfactory receptor genes (ORs), which are responsible for detecting diverse odor molecules varies extensively among mammals as a result of frequent gene gains and losses that contribute to olfactory specialization. However, how OR expansions/contractions in fish are influenced by habitat and feeding habit and which OR subfamilies are important in each ecological niche is unknown. Here, we report a major OR expansion in a freshwater herbivorous fish, Megalobrama amblycephala, using a highly contiguous, chromosome-level assembly. We evaluate the possible contribution of OR expansion to habitat and feeding specialization by comparing the OR repertoire in 28 phylogenetically and ecologically diverse teleosts. In total, we analyzed > 4,000 ORs including 3,253 intact, 122 truncated, and 913 pseudogenes. The number of intact ORs is highly variable ranging from 20 to 279. We estimate that the most recent common ancestor of Osteichthyes had 62 intact ORs, which declined in most lineages except the freshwater Otophysa clade that has a substantial expansion in subfamily beta and epsilon ORs. Across teleosts, we found a strong association between duplications of beta and epsilon ORs and freshwater habitat. Nearly, all ORs were expressed in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in three tested fish species. Specifically, all the expanded beta and epsilon ORs were highly expressed in OE of M. amblycephala. Together, we provide molecular and functional evidence for how OR repertoires in fish have undergone gain and loss with respect to ecological factors and highlight the role of beta and epsilon OR in freshwater adaptation.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explores the production of Mortadella from Cinisara cow and young bull meats with pork lard, with animals primarily fed on natural resources. The investigation delves into the physicochemical, nutritional, and sensory aspects of Mortadella, aligning with the global interest in healthier meat products. Findings reveal a distinct fatty acid profile influenced by raw materials, with pistachios demonstrating a healthy fatty acid composition. Sensory evaluations underscore richer color, enhanced fat cube adhesion, and pronounced odors in cow-based formulations. While Mortadella formulations exhibit different nutritional profiles, the study emphasizes the impact of raw materials on these properties and highlights opportunities for interventions to improve fatty acid compositions in processed meat products. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into producing healthier alternatives and supporting traditional farms, emphasizing regional diversity in the market.Abstract The rising interest in healthier meat options prompted the exploration of alternatives to traditional pork-based products, incorporating meat from different livestock species, feeding regimens, and functional ingredients. This study investigates the production of healthier meat products by examining the physicochemical traits, fatty acid profile, and sensory properties of mortadella made with Cinisara meat of four young bulls and four adult cows, and four females of the Nebrodi Black Pig. All the animals were fed principally on natural resources. Nutritional analysis revealed different levels of moisture, protein, fat, and ash in raw materials, with pistachios contributing to a healthy fatty acid profile rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Formulations using cow meat exhibited higher fat content and caloric value, resulting in sensory attributes such as more intense color, improved fat cube adhesion, and pronounced odors compared to young bull and control mortadella. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated distinctive profiles influenced by the meat type used and, as expected, bovine products showed higher contents of rumenic and other conjugated linoleic acids. Pork mortadella displayed greater omega 6 and omega 3 values, with a healthier omega 6/omega 3 ratio comparable to those found in cow products. Young bull mortadella showed the worse atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. The findings underscore the impact of raw materials on the nutritional and sensory attributes of mortadella, emphasizing the necessity for interventions to enhance fatty acid composition in processed meat products.

AB  - Animal model studies used to predict vaccine efficacy in humans present a considerable challenge, as direct extrapolation of experimental results to humans is impermissible for a number of reasons. One of the primary causes of differing responses to vaccination between humans and rodents lies in interspecies differences in pathogen recognition receptors. Additionally, there are species-specific repertoires of B and T cells, as well as HLA-mediated presentation of dominant epitopes to CD4 and CD8 T cells. Due to these limitations, candidate vaccines are tested in several species of both small and large animals, which is expected to yield data that are more applicable to humans. Objective of the study was a comparative assessment of the protective efficacy of the 231 Delta nlpD and EV Delta lpxM strains of the plague bacterium, which differed in antigenic composition, in two species of laboratory animals following a single subcutaneous administration, either separately or in combination. The protective efficacy of the tested strains was evaluated by calculating the immunity index following subcutaneous challenge in mice and guinea pigs. As in previous experiments [1], administration of monocomponent vaccines based on attenuated Yersinia pestis strains 231 Delta nlpD or EV Delta lpxM selectively induced protection in only mice or only guinea pigs, respectively. Immunization with a mixture of the attenuated strains yielded an immunity index greater than 108 in both species of laboratory animals. Combined subcutaneous immunization of mice and guinea pigs with the attenuated Y. pestis strains 231 Delta nlpD and EV Delta lpxM enhanced the intensity of immunity against plague upon subcutaneous challenge with the wild-type strain 231.

AB  - The rhinocricid genus Alcimobolus is a monotypic genus endemic to the Dominican Republic. Herein, we provide a redescription of Alcimobolus domingensis (DeSaussure & Humbert, 1972) based on freshly collected material. In addition, we place Alcimobolus in a phylogenetic context. We performed a parsimony analysis under implied weighting with a total of 17 taxa and 32 morphological characters. All K values resulted in a single most parsimonious tree with the same topology (length = 48 steps; total fit = 23.500; CI = 0.70; RI = 0.80). The genus is recovered as the sister group of Neocricus Chamberlin, 1941. The clade Alcimobolus + Neocricus is supported by one synapomorphy (telopodite of the anterior gonopod distally elongated) and one homoplastic transformation (opening of the paraproct not prolonged).

AB  - The mammary gland is a unique apocrine gland made up of a branching network of ducts that end in alveoli. It is an ideal system to study the molecular mechanisms associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. MFG-E8, also known as Lactadherin, is a vital glycoprotein related to the milk fat globule membrane and initially identified to get secreted in bovine milk. Our previous report suggests that a high level of MFG-E8 is indicative of high milk yield in dairy animals. Here, we showed that MFG-E8 controls the cell growth and morphology of epithelial cells through a network of regulatory transcription factors. To understand the comprehensive action, we downregulated its expression in MECs by MFG-E8 specific shRNA. We generated a knockdown proteome profile of differentially expressed proteins through a quantitative iTRAQ experiment on a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Q-TOF). The downregulation of MFG-E8 resulted in reduced phagocytosis and cell migration ability, whereas it also leads to more lifespan to knockdown vis-a-vis healthy cells, which is confirmed through BrdU, MTT, and Caspase 3/7. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that MFG-E8 knockdown perturbs a large number of intracellular signaling, eventually leading to cessation in cell growth. Based on the directed network analysis, we found that MFG-E8 is activated by CX3CL1, TP63, and CSF2 and leads to the activation of SOCS3 and CCL2 for the regulation of cell proliferation. We further proved that the depletion of MFG-E8 resulted in activated cytoskeletal remodeling by MFG-E8 knockdown, which results in the activation of three independent pathways ZP4/JAK-STAT5, DOCK1/STAT3, and PIP3/AKT/mTOR. Overall, this study suggests that MFG-E8 expression in mammary epithelial cells is an indication of intracellular deterioration in cell health. To date, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the downstream targets of MFG-E8 involved in the regulation of mammary epithelial cell health.

AB  - Using fMRI, we investigated the effects of age and divided attention on the neural correlates of familiarity and their relationship with memory performance. At study, word pairs were visually presented to young and older participants under the requirement to make a relational judgment on each pair. Participants were then scanned while undertaking an associative recognition test under single and dual (auditory tone detection) task conditions. The test items comprised studied, rearranged (words from different studied pairs) and new word pairs. fMRI familiarity effects were operationalized as greater activity elicited by studied pairs incorrectly identified as 'rearranged' than by correctly rejected new pairs. The reverse contrast was employed to identify 'novelty' effects. Behavioral familiarity estimates were equivalent across age groups and task conditions. Robust fMRI familiarity effects were identified in several regions, including medial and superior lateral parietal cortex, dorsal medial and left lateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral caudate. fMRI novelty effects were identified in the anterior medial temporal lobe. Both familiarity and novelty effects were largely age-invariant and did not vary, or varied minimally, according to task condition. In addition, the familiarity effects correlated positively with a behavioral estimate of familiarity strength irrespective of age. These findings extend a previous report from our laboratory, and converge with prior behavioral reports, in demonstrating that the factors of age and divided attention have little impact on behavioral and neural estimates of familiarity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zhichuanling (ZCL) Injection, is a compound formulation containing extracts of mahuang (Herba Ephedrae, dried stem or aerial part of Ephedra sinica Stapf), bitter almond (Semen Armeniacae Amarum, seeds of Prunus armeniaca var. sibirica (L.) K. Koch), yangjinhua (flower of Datura metel L.) and Fructus Forsythiae (fruits of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl). Intramuscular injection of ZCL has been used in the clinical practice to control asthma. The aerosol inhalation of ZCL has been shown to be effective on allergic bronchial asthma. However, the underlying mechanisms remain established. Aim of the study: To investigate the underling mechanism by which ZCL inhibits the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Methods: The guinea pig tracheal rings and human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells were used to assess ZCL's impact on acetylcholine (Ach) induced tracheal contraction, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced bronchial inflammation, and transforming growth factor-(31 (TGF-(31) induced airway remodeling. Cell viability and gene expression were assessed using MTT assays, qPCR. RNA-seq (gene expression analysis) was employed to explore the novel mechanisms of ZCL in OVA-induced bronchial asthma. Results: In this study, we found that ZCL reduces Ach-induced contraction of isolated guinea pig trachea, suppress TNF-alpha-induced interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 and TGF-(31-induced E-cadherin, alpha-SMA, Vimentin, N-cadherin mRNA expression in the 16HBE. Transcriptomic analysis of lung tissue from mice with OVA-induced bronchial asthma suggests that ZCL may alleviate asthma symptoms by modulating BPIFA1, HIF3 & Acy;, CTXN3, GRFA3, PPEF1, KSR2, and CDSN. Conclusion: ZCL alleviates asthma by suppressing tracheal contractions, inflammation, and epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition. ZCL effect on asthma is likely through the upregulation of BPIFA1 expression thus providing the molecular insight for the treatment of asthma. The findings suggest that ZCL holds promise as a asthma therapeutic approach, and further research is needed to explore its full clinical potential. Future studies should focus on optimizing dosage, evaluating long-term efficacy, and investigating potential synergistic effects with existing treatments to enhance asthma management and patient outcomes.

AB  - As the main coffee polyphenols, caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) are abundant in coffee-derived products and have the potential to act as novel feed additives for animals. However, research on the side effects of dietary CQAs supplementation is scarce, especially in young animals. Here, we explore the safety of CQAs derived from green coffee beans. Results showed that ingesting 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg of dietary CQAs for 55 days is associated with greater final body weight, average daily gain, and feed efficiency in piglets compared with the control group (P < 0.05). CQAs also increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and gross energy at a dose over 50 mg/kg (P < 0.05). Interestingly, CQAs supplementation with 500 mg/kg increased the white blood cell count (P < 0.05). Moreover, CQAs supplementation at a dose over 50 mg/kg decreased the serum total cholesterol concentration but increased the immunoglobulin M level in serum (P < 0.05). Importantly, CQAs supplementation had no side effects on organ histopathology and organ weight (P > 0.05). These results suggest that CQAs could serve as a secure and effective additive to improve growth performance without negatively affecting the organs of piglets.

AB  - The hippocampus is essential for episodic memory, yet its coding mechanism remains debated. In humans, two main theories have been proposed: one suggests that concept neurons represent specific elements of an episode, while an-other posits a conjunctive code, where index neurons code the entire episode. Here, we integrate new findings of index neurons in humans and other animals with the concept-specific memory framework, proposing that concept neurons evolve from index neurons through overlapping memories. This process is sup-ported by engram literature, which posits that neurons are allocated to a memory trace based on excitability and that reactivation induces excitability. By integrating these insights, we connect two historically disparate fields of neuroscience: engram research and human single neuron episodic memory research.

AB  - Measurement of in vivo strain patterns of musculoskeletal soft tissues (MSTs) during functional activities reveals their biomechanical function, supports the identification and understanding of pathologies, and quantifies tissue adaptation during healing. These scientific and clinical insights have motivated the development and application of various strain sensors to quantify MST strains in either intraoperative or dynamic in vivo conditions. In this study, a strain sensor system is developed based on stretchable electronics and radio frequency identification technologies. In this system, a flexible inductor-capacitor-resistor sensor is fabricated such that it can be wirelessly excited by a custom-designed readout box through electronic resonance. The resonant frequency of the sensor changes when the capacitor is stretched, which is then also recorded by the readout box at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. Suturing the stretchable capacitor onto the MST allows it to be stretched in line with musculoskeletal deformations, hence providing an indirect method to assess strain patterns in vivo. Application of the system ex vivo indicates that the signal remains linear between 0 and 25% strain and is electronically stable in a simulated in vivo environment for one week and over 100 000 cycles of fatigue loadings. The strain sensor exhibits excellent resolution (0.1% strain, approximate to 9 mu m) during wireless strain measurement. Finally, sensor implantation and strain measurement onto the medial gastrocnemius tendon of a sheep indicate that the sensor is able to record repetitive strain patterns in vivo during dynamic movements. This study indicates the potential scientific and clinical applicability in vivo.

AB  - Clam Cyclina sinensis behaves a stronger ammonia nitrogen tolerance, whereas the molecular regulation mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, C. sinensis was exposed to ammonia nitrogen (32.90 mg/L) for 0 h (the control), 12 h (T1) and 24 h (T2). Integrated analysis of miRNA-mRNA was conducted to reveal the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the metabolism of C. sinensis exposed to acute ammonia nitrogen. Numerous genes involved in detoxification and ammonia excretion expressed differently indicate that nitrogen assimilation and utilization is adjusted to accommodate ammonia exposure. The clam has to alter their glucose and lipid metabolism to meet energy requirements to adapt acute ammonia exposure in the environment. 12, 948 genes were identified as target genes of the differently expressed miRNAs. Most of mRNA-miRNA pairs were involved in metabolisms of carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid. miRNA-mRNA integrated analysis revealed involvement of Purine metabolism, Wnt signalling pathway, Hippo signalling pathway, PI3K-Akt signalling pathway in ammonia-stress response of C. sinensis. Exposed to ammonia, clam may suffer hypoxia exposure. Overall, exposed to ammonia, clam has to alter their glucose and lipid metabolism to meet energy requirements. Numerous mRNA-miRNA pairs were involved in metabolisms of carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid and miRNA can regulate the metabolism of C. sinensis by regulating the expression of target genes during acute ammonia nitrogen stress. The net result is that nitrogen assimilation and utilization is adjusted to accommodate ammonia exposure. The current study is helpful for further investigation into the ammonia nitrogen response mechanisms in mollusks.

AB  - Camellia quephongensis Hakoda et Ninh, a plant species in the Theaceae family, is native to Vietnam. In this study, the effects of various solvents used for extracting Camellia quephongensis flowers on phenolic content, antioxidative, and in vitro anti-inflammatory activities were assessed. The highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant properties were observed for the ethyl acetate extract. Catechin and epicatechin in the ethyl acetate extract showed the highest concentrations (17.23 +/- 0.57 mg/g and 3.86 +/- 0.42 mg/g, respectively) whereas epigallocatechin gallate had the highest concentration in methanol extract (10.66 +/- 0.33 mg/g). Most of the other phenolics were also found at greater concentrations in the ethyl acetate extract in comparison to the other extracts. The results also demonstrated that ethyl acetate displayed the strongest antioxidant potential assessed by ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays. The albumin denaturation inhibition assay showed that the ethyl acetate extract had the greatest efficacy, followed by the ethanol and methanol extracts. Chlorophyll and carotenoids were found in smaller amounts compared to those in other Camellia species' leaves. These findings provide deeper insights into obtaining extracts with high levels of bioactive compounds, antioxidative potential, and anti-inflammatory effects from C. quephongensis. .

AB  - Since essential oils-such as cinnamaldehyde, thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol-have antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, this study aimed to examine the supplementation of different essential oil mixtures together with 1600 mg/kg zinc oxide (ZnO) on growth performance, incidence of diarrhea, serum immune indices, fecal volatile fatty acids, and microflora structure in weaned piglets. A total of 240 weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) with an average body weight of 8.85 +/- 0.21 kg were randomly allocated to 30 pens (6 pens per diet, 4 males and 4 females per pen). Five different experimental diets were prepared and administered for 28 days: (i) a control diet (C), a corn-soybean basal diet without antibiotics, ZnO, or a supplementation of growth promoters; (ii) a control diet with 400 mg/kg essential oil mixtures 1 (EOM1); (iii) a control diet supplemented with ZnO at 1600 mg/kg (Z); (iv) a diet incorporating the Z diet with the addition of essential oil mixtures 1 at 400 mg/kg (ZOM1); and (v) a diet incorporating the Z diet with the addition of essential oil mixtures 2 at 400 mg/kg (ZOM2). During day (d) 14-28 and d 1-28 of the experiment, the average daily gain (ADG) in piglets in the ZOM1 and ZOM2 groups were higher (p < 0.05) compared to the C group. The diarrhea incidence of the Z, ZOM1, and ZOM2 groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), and the piglets of the ZOM1 group exhibited the lowest diarrhea incidence throughout the trial period. Additionally, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ash, organic matter (OM), and ether extract (EE) were higher than those fed the Z diet, and higher levels of NDF, ADF, and crude protein (CP) were observed in groups other than those fed the ZOM1 diet (p < 0.01). On d 14, the pigs fed EOM1 and ZOM2 diets showed a somewhat lower (p < 0.1) immunoglobulin G (lgG) level in serum than those fed the C diet. Additionally, the IL-8 level in serum in the ZOM1 group tended to be higher than that in the other groups (p < 0.1). The piglets fed the ZOM1 diet showed a tendency of lower (p = 0.05) acetate concentration in feces on d 14. Principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in the composition of fecal microbial communities among the groups. Dietary EOM1 significantly increased the number of fecal bacteroides (p < 0.05) and tended to increase the number of Prevotella (p < 0.1). Therefore, EOM1 combined with 1600 mg/kg ZnO tends to reduce diarrhea incidence, tends to improve the fecal microbial community structure and growth performance of weaned piglets, and has the potential to replace pharmacological dosages of ZnO.

AB  - Genital tumours are rare among cattle, largely due to their relatively short lifespans. Leio-myoma, a smooth muscle tumour being more prevalent in dogs, appears only at a rate of 1.00-2.00% in cattle, affecting reproductive efficiency in cases of complete uterine obstruction. This case report involves an 8-year-old cow with repeated insemination attempts unveiled 5.00 cm intra-luminal uterine mass, obstructing the right uterine horn. Transrectal sonography (TRUS) revealed a highly vascularized mass with normal ovarian function. Confirmation of clinical condition, i.e., uterine leiomyoma, viauterine biopsy concluded the presence of neoplastic smooth muscle cells arranged in interlacing bundles showing mild pleomorphism, and special staining using Masson's trichrome revealed an unappreciable amount of connective tissue; subsequently right flank celiotomy was performed to remove the benign tumour. Forty-five days after celiotomy, TRUS examination confirmed an unobstructed uterine horn, and bilateral oviduct patency was adjudged with 2.50% methylene blue. Following treatment for chronic endometritis, artificial insemination led to conception nearly 90 days post-procedure. The TRUS aids preliminary diagnosis, while definitive identification demands necropsy and surgical methods. This case underscores the diagnostic significance of TRUS, histopathology and celiotomy for identifying and managing uterine leiomyoma in cattle. (c) 2024Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wuyi Rock Tea (WRT) is cherished for its exceptional "rock flavor" and its quality shows obvious regional differences. However, the flavor characteristics of Primary Wuyi Rock Teas (PWRTs) from different production areas remain unclear. Here, the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. 'Rougui' and 'Shuixian', two quintessential cultivars for making WRT, planted in Zhengyan, Banyan, at high elevations, and Waishan production areas were used to make PWRTs. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the sensory attributes, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and macro-compositions of PWRTs of 'Rougui' and 'Shuixian' cultivars from different producing areas. Sensory evaluation indicated that both 'Rougui' and 'Shuixian' PWRTs from Zhengyan exhibited the best flavor qualities, followed by those from Banyan, at high altitudes, and Waishan production areas. The results of the determination and analysis of VOCs showed 680 VOCs in 'Rougui' and 'Shuixian' PWRTs, and that the different production areas mainly influenced the quantitative pattern of VOCs and rarely the qualitative composition. Integrated multivariate statistical analysis methods revealed that benzyl alcohol, hotrienol, butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, hexyl ester, benzene, (2-nitroethyl)-, and geranyl isobutyrate may be the key VOCs affecting the aroma differences in PWRTs from different production areas. In addition, water-extractable substances, tea polyphenols, caffeine, and free amino acids may be the important macro-compositions that distinguish PWRTs from different production areas. The metabolite basis for differences in the flavor qualities of PWRTs across production areas was elucidated, which may be helpful for the production of high-quality WRT.

AB  - Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by an infectious agent and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a global concern, since it is one of the major causes of severe illness in humans and animals. The study of the changes that can occur in saliva and serum in sepsis can contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the process and also to discover potential biomarkers that can help in its diagnosis and monitoring. The objective of this study was to characterize the changes that occur in the salivary and serum proteome of pigs with experimentally-induced sepsis. The study included five pigs with sepsis induced by LPS administration and five pigs with non-septic inflammation induced by turpentine for comparative purposes. In saliva, there were eighteen salivary proteins differentially expressed in the sepsis condition and nine in non-septic inflammation. Among these, significant increments in aldolase A and serpin B12 only occurred in the sepsis model. Changes in aldolase A were validated in a larger population of pigs with sepsis due to Streptococcus suis infection. In serum, there were 30 proteins differentially expressed in sepsis group and 26 proteins in the non-septic group, and most of the proteins that changed in both groups were related to non-specific inflammation. In the saliva of the septic animals there were some specific pathways activated, such as the organonitrogen compound metabolic process and lipid transport, whereas, in the serum, one of the main activated pathways was the regulation of protein secretion. Overall, saliva and serum showed different proteome variations in response to septic inflammation and could provide complementary information about the pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in this condition. Additionally, salivary aldolase A could be a potential biomarker of sepsis in pigs that should be confirmed in a larger population.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the relationship between body condition score (BCS) and reproductive recovery in Sarda dairy breed ewes, as well as its association with some hematochemical parameters, focusing on the male effect as a method to induce out-of-season ovulation. The male effect is commonly used in sheep farming as an alternative to hormonal treatments, but its success can be influenced by factors such as BCS. In this experiment, 200 healthy lactating ewes (aged 3-5 years) were divided into four groups based on BCS (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5). BCS was measured on a 1-5 scale by touching the amounts of muscling and fat deposition in the loin region. On 15 May, 10 rams of proven fertility were introduced, and removed 50 days later. Blood samples were collected at days 15, 30, and 50 for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, and albumin analysis, along with BCS evaluations. Lambing dates, fertility rates, litter size, and the time from ram introduction to lambing were recorded. The results showed that ewes with a higher BCS (3.0 and 3.5) had improved fertility rates, earlier lambing, and a better overall reproductive performance compared to ewes with a lower BCS (2.0 and 2.5). Higher BCS groups also exhibited higher levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The study concluded that a BCS of 3.0 is optimal for reproductive efficiency in Sarda ewes during the male effect in spring, promoting better reproductive outcomes and animal welfare without the need for hormonal treatments.

AB  - Ecology is an essential discipline for understanding the biology and behavior of organisms. This study increased knowledge of three sympatric species of ground w & emacr;t & amacr; ( Hemiandrus spp.). Hemiandrus ground w & emacr;t & amacr; are nocturnal Ensifera that live in burrows during the day, and for these reasons, there is limited knowledge of their activity, development, and diet. We examined the diet of Hemiandrus electra, Hemiandrus 'disparalis', and Hemiandrus nox by examining the crop contents of specimens caught in malaise traps set in a native forest (St Arnaud) over seven months during two spring-summer-autumn seasons (2004/2005 and 2005/2006). The three species investigated varied in the plant and invertebrate fragment proportions in their diets. Hemiandrus electra and H . 'disparalis' were predominantly herbivores, while H. nox was primarily carnivorous, although plant matter constituted 20% of its diet. We identified the species and sex of 966 Hemiandrus w & emacr;t & amacr; that were intercepted by the same malaise traps. Our results showed that H. electra was the most abundant species, with 701 individuals, while 157 and 109 were identified as H. 'disparalis' and H. nox, respectively. Surprisingly, the species with maternal care (H. electra) was the only one of the three sympatric Hemiandrus to have an even sex ratio; for the other two species, more males were caught in the traps. Using hind leg dimensions, we categorized each female H. electra specimen using na & iuml;ve Gaussian mixture model clustering, which identified five size clusters (putatively corresponding to instars). Based on the month of collection and the growth category, we observed no seasonality in the development of this species of ground w & emacr;t & amacr;, as almost all instars were found in each month of the sampling period. This study found no evidence that these nocturnal forest species synchronize their growth or reproduction with seasons.

AB  - Interactions between ants and plants are classic examples of cooperation between individuals of different species. Usually, plants provide shelter or food for ants and in turn are defended against her-bivores by their insect allies. To coordinate attacks, ants use multi-modal alarm signals consisting of vibrational and chemical components. This can also be observed in Borneo, where two Camponotus species inhabit the ocreas (diverging, tubular leaf sheaths) of the rattan palm Korthalsia robusta. When ants are disturbed, they beat or scratch mandibles and abdomens on the plant surface resulting in loud rustling sounds. To describe the characteristics of these signals, we recorded them with a Laser-Doppler-vibrometer in the field. Analyses of temporal patterns and dominant frequency revealed that the signals of the two species differ fundamentally. To assess transmission characteristics of the rattan palm, we conducted experiments under controlled lab-conditions. We show that the ocrea is an adequate struc-ture for converting airborne sound into substrate vibrations, acting as a mediator between these two modalities. We hypothesize that the ants' vibratory signal has multiple functions, with the substrate -borne component used as an alarm signal for conspecifics, and the airborne component acting as vibro-acoustic aposematism against predators or herbivores to protect the host plant.

AB  - Simple Summary Termites are structurally destructive pests that can infest a consumer's most important investment, their home. The evolution of termite control is complex, involving people's understanding of termite biology and behavior, building construction, the use of soil termiticides, baits, wood treatments, and physical barriers, as well as regulations from different industries (pest control and building construction). Soil termiticides have been the standard method of treatment for decades, but the concern for human and environmental health has driven the development of alternatives. This article discusses the evolution of termite control methods that were alternatives to the standard of the time and the regulatory structure that provides a level of consumer protection for some products. The global economic impact of termites is estimated to be approximately USD 40 billion annually, and subterranean termites are responsible for about 80% of the total impact. Twenty-eight species of termites have been described as invasive, and these termites are spreading, partially due to global trade, making effective control methods essential. Termite control is complex, as is the biology and behavior of this social insect group. In the U.S., termite prevention and control (with claims of structural protection) is regulated by more than one industry (pest control and building construction), and at the federal and state levels. Termite prevention has historically relied on building construction practices that do not create conducive conditions for termite infestations, but as soil termiticides developed, heavy reliance on pesticides became the standard for termite control. The concern for human and environmental health has driven the development of termite control alternatives and regulation for products claiming structural protection. Product development has also provided unprecedented opportunities to study the biology and behavior of cryptobiotic termites. Technological advances have allowed for the re-examination of questions about termite behavior. Advances in communications via social media provide unrestricted access to information, creating a conundrum for consumers and science educators alike.

AB  - Mutations in Talpid3, a basal body protein essential for the assembly of primary cilia, have been reported to be causative for Joubert Syndrome (JS). Herein, we report prominent developmental defects in the hippocampus of a conditional knockout mouse lacking the conserved exons 11 and 12 of Talpid3. At early postnatal stages, the Talpid3 mutants exhibit a reduction in proliferation in the dentate gyrus and a disrupted glial scaffold. The occurrence of mis-localized progenitors in the granule cell layer suggests a role for the disrupted glial scaffold in cell migration resulting in defective subpial neurogenic zone-to-hilar transition. Neurospheres derived from the hippocampus of Talpid3(fl/fl)UbcCre mouse, in which Talpid3 was conditionally deleted, lacked primary cilia and were smaller in size. In addition, neurosphere cells showed a disrupted actin cytoskeleton and defective migration. Our findings suggest a link between the hippocampal defects and the learning/memory deficits seen in JS patients.

AB  - The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of different concentrations of rutin on primordial follicle survival and development after in vitro culture of sheep ovarian tissue, and to verify the possible involvement of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway in the rutin actions. Ovarian fragments were fixed for histological analysis (fresh control) or cultured in alpha-minimum essential medium alone (alpha-MEM+: control medium) or in alpha-MEM+ supplemented with different concentrations of rutin (0.1; 1 or 10 mu g/mL) for 7 days. Inhibition of the PI3K activity was performed in fragments cultured with 50 mu M LY294002. Thereafter, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (apoptosis) and Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt). The results showed that 1 mu g/mL rutin has a greater percentage of normal follicles (P < 0.05) than those of alpha-MEM+ and other rutin treatments. In addition, 1 mu g/mL rutin maintained the follicular apoptosis similar (P > 0.05) to that of the fresh control and lower than alpha-MEM+ and 10 mg/mL rutin. All rutin concentrations increased (P < 0.05) follicular activation compared to fresh control and alpha-MEM+. Furthermore, follicular and oocyte diameters increased (P < 0.05) only after culture with 1 mu g/mL rutin. After PI3K inhibition, there was a reduction (P < 0.05) of rutin follicular effects. In conclusion, rutin at 1 mg/mL reduces apoptosis, promotes activation and growth of sheep primordial follicles through the modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway after in vitro culture of ovine ovarian tissue.

AB  - The guayulins are a family of sesquiterpene compounds that consist of an isoprenoid nucleus substituted either by trans-cinnamic or p-anisic acid, and are present only in the resinous fraction of the rubber plant guayule (Parthenium argentatum, Gray). While the natural role of the guayulins remains enigmatic, they may serve as a defense function against other plants or herbivores by virtue of the accumulation of cinnamic acid. Prior research has suggested seasonal variation in guayulin content, which has been shown to decrease as winter arrives in two different varieties. In the present study, the effect of guayulins has been evaluated in 13 different accessions cultivated under the same conditions during autumn. A general reduction in guayulin content was found in the stems from all varieties between the September and November harvest, which was accompanied by an increase in the resin content. With respect to individual guayulins, while guayulin A was the most prominent member during most of the year, guayulin C had more prominence when temperature started to decrease. In this seasonal period, the production of each member of the guayulin family in the leaves was very balanced.

AB  - The annual bluegrass weevil (Listronotus maculicollis) is the most damaging insect pest of short-mown turfgrass on golf courses in eastern North America. Listronotus maculicollis larvae cause limited visible damage as stem-borers (L1-3), compared to the crown-feeding (L4-5) developmental instars. Prolonged larval feeding results in discoloration and formation of irregular patches of dead turf, exposing soil on high-value playing surfaces (fairways, collars, tee boxes, and putting greens). Annual bluegrass (Poa annua) is highly susceptible to L. maculicollis compared to a tolerant alternate host plant, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). This study explored whether defense signaling phytohormones contribute to A. stolonifera tolerance in response to L. maculicollis. Concentrations (ng/g) of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonic-isoleucine (JA-Ile), 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA), and abscisic acid (ABA) were extracted from turfgrass (leaf, stem, and root) tissue samples as mean larval age reached 2nd (L2), 3rd (L3), and 4th (L4) instar. Poa annua infested with L. maculicollis larvae (L2-4) possessed significantly greater SA in above-ground tissues than A. stolonifera. Levels of constitutive JA, JA-Ile, OPDA, and ABA were significantly higher within non-infested A. stolonifera aboveground tissues compared to P. annua. Inducible defense phytohormones may play a role in P. annua susceptibility to L. maculicollis but are unlikely to provide tolerance in A. stolonifera. Additional studies in turfgrass breeding, particularly focusing on cultivar selection for increased constitutive JA content, could provide a non-chemical alternative management strategy for L. maculicollis for turfgrass managers.

AB  - Fruit lignification is of significant economic importance because it affects the quality of fruit and the production of seed oil. The specified lignification pattern in Camellia chekiangoleosa fruits plays critical roles in its seed oil yield, but little is known about how this lignification process is regulated. Here, we report on a comprehensive tissue-specific transcriptomics analysis conducted for C. chekiangoleosa fruit. By mining the differentially expressed genes, we found that lignin biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation pathways were significantly enriched in the lignified tissues. The homolog of NST-like transcription factor, CcNST1, was highly expressed in lignified seed coat and endocarp tissues; transgenic analyses of CcNST1 in Arabidopsis and hybrid poplar revealed the enhanced lignification levels of various tissues. Gene expression analysis of the transgenic lines uncovered potential downstream genes involved in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis. This work provides a valuable gene expression resource and identified the pivotal role of CcNST1 in regulating the lignin biosynthesis underlying fruit lignification.

AB  - Supplementation with Silicon (Si) is well-known for increasing resistance of grasses to insect herbivores. Although the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown, Si accumulation interacts with the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, which modulates herbivore-induced plant defences. We examined whether Si supplementation alters direct and induced indirect defences in maize plants in ways that deter the initial infestation by the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith). We assessed the herbivore's oviposition preference, neonate and third-instar larval performance as well as the recruitment of a predator of young larvae, the flower bug Orius insidiosus (Say), by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In choice tests, S. frugiperda deposited about two times more eggs on -Si than on +Si maize. The mortality of neonate S. frugiperda larvae was about sixfold higher in +Si compared to -Si plants, even though they consumed similar leaf area on both treatments. Although there were no mortality differences, Si supplementation also impacted third-instar larvae that gained about twofold less weight than those fed on -Si maize. In olfactometer assays, O. insidiosus was not attracted to volatiles of uninfested maize plants with or without Si supplementation, but it was attracted to those emitted by fall armyworm-infested plants, irrespective of whether plants received Si supplementation. However, when the flower bug could choose between the volatiles released from -Si and +Si fall armyworm-infested plants, it preferentially oriented to +Si fall armyworm-infested plant. Our results show that Si supplementation in maize may deter fall armyworm colonization because of greater direct defences and attractiveness of HIPVs to the flower bug.

AB  - Sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense Stapf) is widely cultivated as a summer annual forage across the southern Great Plains because of its robust forage yield potential. However, the accumulation of nitrates and the potential harm to livestock have restricted the use of Sudangrass for feeding ruminants. Since 2013, the sorghum aphid (SA), Melanaphis sorghi (Theobald) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), has been damaging sorghum and Sudangrass production. However, the interaction between SA feeding and nitrate accumulation in Sudangrass has not been determined. In this study, we evaluated the effect of SA feeding on different Sudangrass lines, comparing them to a susceptible and a resistant sorghum variety and measuring the physiological responses and nitrate concentration after aphid feeding. Additionally, we evaluated the use of these grass lines on SA demographics. Initial infestations of 100 SA per plant that were allowed to feed and proliferate for 20 days increased nitrate concentrations in Sudangrass by more than 60% compared to controls. Concurrently, the Sudangrass lines selected for high nitrate levels drastically reduced SA demographic parameters, comparable to those of the resistant sorghum control. Although the adoption of resistant cultivars is recommended for aphid management, the Sudangrass lines selected may not be the best option for SA management because their accumulation of nitrates in response to herbivory can cause ruminant poisoning.

AB  - The elevated accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and tea (Camellia sinensis L.) grown in agricultural soils may lead to a variety of adverse health effects. This study collected and analyzed crop samples along with paired rhizosphere soil samples from 61 sites in Cd-contaminated regions in Anhui Province, China. The findings revealed that both the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) and soil solution were capable of effectively predicting Cd contents in crops. Conventional chemical extraction methods were inappropriate to evaluate the bioavailability of Cd. However, the effective concentrations (CE) corrected by the DGT-induced fluxes in soils (DIFS) model exhibited the strongest correlation with crop Cd contents. Except for CE, various measurement methods yielded better results for predicting Cd bioavailability in tea compared to rice. Pearson's correlation analysis and the random forest (RF) model identified the key influencing factors controlling Cd uptake by rice and tea, including pH, soil texture, and contents of zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) in soils, which antagonize Cd. To reduce the potential health risk from rice and tea, the application of soil liming and/or Se-oxidizing bacteria was expected to be an effective management strategy.

AB  - Sugar transport from the source leaf to the sink organ is critical for seed development and crop yield, as well as for responding to abiotic stress. SWEETs (sugar will eventually be exported transporters) mediate sugar efflux into the reproductive sink and are therefore considered key candidate proteins for sugar unloading during seed development. However, the specific mechanism underlying the sugar unloading to seeds in Camellia oleifera remains elusive. Here, we identified a SWEET gene named CoSWEET10, which belongs to Clade III and has high expression levels in the seeds of C. oleifera. CoSWEET10 is a plasma membrane-localized protein. The complementation assay of CoSWEET10 in SUSY7/ura3 and EBY.VW4000 yeast strains showed that CoSWEET10 has the ability to transport sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Through the C. oleifera seeds in vitro culture, we found that the expression of CoSWEET10 can be induced by hexose and sucrose, and especially glucose. By generating the restoration lines of CoSWEET10 in Arabidopsis atsweet10, we found that CoSWEET10 restored the seed defect phenotype of the mutant by regulating soluble sugar accumulation and increased plant drought tolerance. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CoSWEET10 plays a dual role in promoting seed development and enhancing plant drought resistance as a sucrose and hexose transporter.

AB  - Early-life adverse events exert persistent effects on brain functions and may increase the risk of psychopathology in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of our study was to study the long-lasting effects of maternal deprivation (MD) on depression-related behaviors and microtubule dynamics, and to illuminate the underlying molecular mechanism. Rat pups were separated from the dams for 360 min (MD) or 15 min (brief maternal separation) each day from postnatal day 4 through 10. Rats with MD experience showed significant depressive-like behaviors in adulthood, while brief maternal separation did not alter the behaviors. Behavioral alterations in the MD group were accompanied by alterations in the AKT/GSK3 beta/CRMP2 signaling pathway and hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2. CRMP2 interacted and colocalized with the cytoskeleton in the hippocampus, and the overlap of CRMP2 and tubulin staining in the hippocampus of MD rats was decreased. In MD rats, the expression of the alpha-tubulin isoforms Acet-tubulin and Tyr-tubulin changed, and the ratio of Tyr/Acet-tubulin, which is an important marker of microtubule dynamics, was decreased, indicating decreased microtubule dynamics. Furthermore, regulation of the AKT/GSK3 beta/CRMP2 signaling pathway by an LY294002 microinjection in the hippocampus resulted in cytoskeletal alterations and depressive-like behaviors in rats. These findings suggest that early-life MD induces depressive-like behaviors and cytoskeletal alterations in adult male rats and that the effects may be partly mediated by the AKT/GSK3 beta/CRMP2 signaling pathway. An understanding of the mechanism underlying the effect of MD on behaviors is crucial for developing pharmacological and psychological interventions for childhood neglect.

AB  - Plant volatiles are important to herbivorous insects for foraging and determining host location. Considering the damage caused by the moth species, Trabala vishnou gigantina Yang, 1978 (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae), to sea buckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae), plantations, this study examined the antennal and behavioral responses of T vishnou gigantina to the volatiles produced by H. rhamnoides. Electroantennographs revealed large differences between males and females concerning active odor profiles. Subtractive bioassays conducted in a flight tunnel showed that the 14-component mixture (BLE) and a subtracted five-component mixture of 2-ethylhexyl acetate, longifolene, 3-heptanone, alpha-ocimene, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (treatment T-13) elicited equivalent responses in females. The BLE and a four-component mixture of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-ethylhexyl acetate, and longifolene (treatment T-n) elicited equivalent responses in males. These findings indicate the potential for developing specific synthetic host plant lures and traps for T. vishnou gigantina. The attractive volatiles will also be helpful in future studies to gain further insights into the olfactory information processing in these insects.

AB  - Rhinogobius zhoui is found only in streams on Lianhua Mountain, Guangdong Province, China. Juveniles of Rhinogobius zhoui bred in an artificial environment do not undergo a planktonic period and have a landlocked life history. At present, there is not much published literature regarding this species. To study the structural characteristics and phylogenetic information of the mtDNA of Rhinogobius zhoui, the mtDNA of R. zhoui was obtained by next-generation sequencing. The mtDNA was assembled, annotated, and analyzed using a bioinformatics method, followed by alignment of mtDNA and analysis of sequence differences. R. zhoui was analyzed phylogenetically using data on 48 species of Gobiiformes and 2 species of Cypriniformes downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and phylogenetic trees were generated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The results of our analysis showed that (1) the length of the mtDNA of R. zhoui was 16,491 bp, according to next-generation sequencing and its mitochondrial structure included 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and one non-coding region and (2) from the phylogenetic tree thus generated, it can be seen that R. zhoui and Rhinogobius duospilus are closely related. This study will re-examine the Phylogenetic tree of the major lineages in Gobiiformes.

AB  - The effects of reversal of hypotension on the cerebral microcirculation, oxygenation, and metabolism in septic shock remain unclear. In 12 sheep, peritonitis was induced by injection of feces into the abdominal cavity. At the onset of septic shock (mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg, unresponsive to fluid challenge), a norepinephrine infusion was titrated in eight sheep to restore a MAP >= 75 mmHg; the other four sheep were kept hypotensive. The microcirculation of the cerebral cortex was evaluated using side-stream dark-field video-microscopy. Brain partial pressure of oxygen (PbtO(2)) was measured, and cerebral metabolism was assessed using microdialysis. All animals developed septic shock after a median of 15 (14-19) h. When MAP was raised using norepinephrine, the PbtO(2) increased significantly (from 41 +/- 4 to 55 +/- 5 mmHg), and the cerebral lactate/pyruvate ratio decreased (from 47 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 4) compared with values at shock onset. Changes in the microcirculation were unchanged with restoration of MAP and the glutamate increased further (from 17 +/- 11 to 23 +/- 16 mu M), as it did in the untreated animals. In septic shock, the correction of hypotension with vasopressors may improve cerebral oxygenation but does not reverse the alterations in brain microcirculation or cerebral metabolism.

AB  - Plants have developed chemical defence strategies which can either be triggered in response to herbivory or by the exogenous application of phytohormones, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJa). Tuta absoluta is the main pest associated with tomatoes worldwide. However, studies on the impact of plant hormones on this system are still scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the chemotactic responses and oviposition of T. absoluta towards tomato plants induced by MeJa and herbivory injuries. We conducted dual-choice olfactometry bioassays evaluating the response of virgin T. absoluta males and females exposed to plants with conspecifics (eggs and caterpillars) and sprayed with MeJa (0.5 mM) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the treatments. We also evaluated the oviposition preference of mated T. absoluta with the chance of choosing plants exposed to water, herbivory and three phytohormone concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mM). The males were mostly responsive to plants with conspecifics, while the females preferred intact plants over those sprayed with MeJa and with the presence of eggs. Furthermore, plants with MeJa (0.5 and 2.5 mM) and injured by conspecifics had less oviposition by T. absoluta. The results show that spraying MeJa on tomato plants is a potential tool for managing and controlling the tomato moth.

AB  - The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), is an invasive herbivore that attacks many gramineous host plants. The species is an economic pest of several grass crops in North America including sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). The species was first detected in the United States in 1980 and has since expanded its range eastward along the Gulf Coast reaching Louisiana in 2008. A disjointed introduction was detected in Florida in 2012, though range expansion of this population within the state has been limited. Most recently, a separate introduction was detected along the Atlantic coast of Georgia near the South Carolina border (32.19884 degrees N, 81.35894 degrees W). Larvae were collected from sugarcane in 2020 and 2021 and identified as E. loftini. The identification was confirmed with genetic analysis showing >99% similarity with most mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences of known E. loftini. This is the furthest north and east of any established population in North America. Potential routes of introduction and impacts to crop production along the U.S. Atlantic Coast are discussed.

AB  - Type II diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders considered chronic hyperglycemia resulting from deficits in insulin secretion or insulin function. This disease usually links with various psychological problems such as anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions. Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) is a natural and healthy substitute sweetener for sugar and artificial sweeteners. It has become essential for human diets and food manufacturers. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of Stevia and Nano-stevia on the regulation of anxiety and memory processes in male diabetic rats. The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test-retest procedure was used to assess anxiety and memory in male diabetic rats. The findings exhibited that induction of diabetes caused a distorted cellular arrangement in the liver tissue of male rats. On the other hand, intra-gastrically administration of Stevia (1 ml/kg) and nano-Stevia (1 ml/kg) indicated a normal appearance in the liver tissue of male diabetic rats. Moreover, induction of diabetes caused the augmentation of blood glucose, reduction in time spent in%open-arm time (%OAT) on the test day, and enhancement of%OAT on the retest day. Therefore, induction of diabetes in rats produced hyperglycemia, anxiogenic effect, and memory impairment and these responses were reversed by drug treatment. Furthermore, intra-gastrically application of Stevia (1 ml/kg) and nano-Stevia (1 ml/kg) reversed the hyperglycemia, anxiogenic effect, and memory impairment in male diabetic rats. Interestingly, Nano-Stevia exhibited the highest significant response rather than Stevia. In conclusion, the results of this research suggested the beneficial properties of Stevia and particularly Nano-Stevia on inducing anti-diabetic effects, anxiolytic behavior, as well as memory improvement in male diabetic rats.

AB  - Several diseases are associated with improper regulation of the Hippo pathway, which plays an important role in cell proliferation and cancer metastasis. Overactivation of the YAP and TAZ proteins accelerates cell proliferation, invasion, and migration during tumorigenesis. Tolfenamic acid (TA) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits activity against various types of cancer. In this study, we observed that TA decreased YAP and TAZ protein levels in cancer cells. TA increased the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, leading to the degradation of YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm and nucleus. TA predominantly affected multiple phosphodegron sites in the YAP and TAZ and lowered 14-3-3 & beta; protein expression, causing YAP and TAZ to enter the ubiquitination pathway. Proteins that affect YAP and TAZ regulation, such as NAG-1 and several YAP/TAZ E3 ligases, were not involved in TA-mediated YAP/TAZ degradation. In summary, our results indicate that TA affects phosphodegron sites on YAP/TAZ, demonstrating a novel effect of TA in tumorigenesis.

AB  - Urban/peri-urban dairying in East Africa used to be typified by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schumach) as the primary forage. However, the ever-declining space for farming has made forage cultivation increasingly difficult. As a coping strategy, farmers are harvesting vegetation biomass from natural environment, particularly common reed (Phragmites australis, Cav.) from wetlands. This study aimed to compare elephant grass and common reed in terms of chemical composition and in situ rumen degradation. Samples were collected (in dry and wet seasons) and analyzed for chemical composition, and in situ rumen degradation of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) determined. Rumen degradation was determined by incubating triplicate nylon-bagged samples in rumens of three cannulated Ankole-Friesian crossbred steers. The CP content ranged from 10.8% to 16.2% DM (common reed), and 9.9-12.5% DM (elephant grass). Common reed showed lower DM, and ADF compositions, and higher effective rumen degradability of DM, CP, and NDF in both seasons. For both forages, CP content was higher during the dry season, while effective rumen degradability of DM, CP, and NDF were higher in the wet season. In summary, the chemical and rumen degradation results suggest that common reed may be nutritionally superior to elephant grass.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The chafer beetle, Holotrichia parallela, causes damage to numerous economically significant crops worldwide. Adult beetles exhibit aggregation behavior likely mediated by a male-produced pheromone. Advancements in biological research technology have facilitated the identification of insect aggregation pheromones and promoted their applications as bait for trapping and monitoring pests. Currently, only a few active components of aggregation pheromones from Holotrichia species have been identified. However, the specific components of aggregation pheromones produced by H. parallela remain unknown. RESULT: In this study, we initially observed from Y-tube olfactometer assays that both male and female H. parallela were significantly attracted to volatiles emitted by males, but not to those from females. We then collected hindgut crude extracts of male adults and carried out gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to identify potential aggregation pheromone components. Pentadecyl acetate, cis-13-docosenol, and behenic acid were identified as male-specific compounds in comparison to female extracts, serving as components of the aggregation pheromone in H. parallela. We further evaluated their attractiveness to H. parallea in both laboratory and field experiments. In laboratory settings, pentadecyl acetate, cis-13-docosenol, and behenic acid evoked significant responses to both males and females at specific concentrations, as evidenced by both electroantennography tests and behavioral bioassays. Under field conditions, traps baited with these three compounds captured significantly more H. parallela adults compared to control traps. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that pentadecyl acetate, cis-13-docosenol, and behenic acid are specifically present in male H. parallela, serving as aggregation pheromones. Both laboratory and field-trapping experiments suggest their potential as monitoring and controlling tools against H. parallela adults. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In herbivorous insects, antennae play a crucial role in chemical communication and orientation when locating host plants and mates. To evaluate antennal sensitivity in response to odor stimuli, electroantennography (EAG) has been a practical technique. In the current study of the invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), we evaluated and compared their antennal sensitivity to a series of volatile chemicals collected from their bodies, honeydew, and host plants. To do this, we exposed the antennae of SLF fourth-instar and adult males and females to individual chemicals at a fixed dose of 50 ng. Further, a series of dose-response tests were carried out within a range of 0.5 to 100 ng. Although the amplitude of antennal responses varied among stages and sexes, adult males generated the strongest antennal responses in both experiments. In dose-response experiments, increased doses of chemicals up to 50 ng revealed the saturation points except in adult females which required a higher dose (100 ng) to reveal the saturation point. Although EAG does not provide any information on behavioral responses, our results are consistent with the olfactory bioassays in previous publications in which adult males, not females, were attracted to natural volatiles of their conspecifics. EAG indicated a higher sensitivity of adult male antennae to odor stimuli, particularly conspecific volatiles, than female antennae and highlighted sexual differences in the perception of chemical cues in SLF.

AB  - Simple SummaryMulberry leaf is widely used in ruminants feeding, such as sheep, beef cattle, and dairy calves. Due to the high content of crude fiber in mature mulberry leaves and branches and the presence of anti-nutritional factors such as tannin, excessive addition will affect the production performance and health of livestock and poultry, and limit its large-scale application in animal production to a certain extent. The disadvantages of woody plants can be improved by microbial fermentation, which can reduce the content of anti-nutritional factors, and increase the content of peptides and amino acids, probiotics, and bioactive components. In this study, Lactobacillus, Saccharomycetes, and Bacillus subtilis were used to make mixed strains to ferment mulberry leaf powder, and different proportions were added to the diet of yellow feathered chicken broilers. The results showed that the addition of fermented mulberry leaf in the diet could improve the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and then improve its growth performance, and increase the contents of inosine monophosphate (IMP), total amino acids, essential amino acids, and delicious amino acids in breast and thigh muscle, and improved polyunsaturated fatty acids and essential fatty acids in breast muscle; this also has a positive effect on improving meat quality.This study was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding fermented mulberry leaf powder (FMLP) on growth performance, slaughter performance, and meat quality of broilers. A total of 360 1-day-old chickens were randomly divided into 5 groups. The control group was fed basal diet (CON), 3% FMLP, 6% FMLP, 9% FMLP, and 3% unfermented mulberry leaf powder. The (MLP) group was fed basal diet supplemented with 3%, 6%, 9% fermented mulberry leaf powder, and 3% MLP, respectively. The experiment lasted for 56 days, with 1-28 days as the starter phase and 29-56 days as the grower phase. The results on the growth performance showed that diets supplemented with 3% FMLP significantly increased the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of broilers, enhanced the activity of intestinal amylase and digestibility of dry matter and crude protein, improved the average daily gain (ADG), and decreased the feed to gain ratio (F/G) (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group diet, the 3% FMLP group diet significantly increased the breast muscle yield (p < 0.05), reduced the abdominal fat ratio (0.1 < p < 0.05), and improved the slaughter performance of broilers. The 3% MLP group diet increased the shear force of breast muscle (p < 0.05) and thigh muscle of broilers compared to the control group, and adding FMLP could reverse the above results. Additionally, relative to the control group, FMLP supplementation improved the contents of inosine monophosphate (IMP), total amino acids (TAA), essential amino acids (EAA), and delicious amino acids (DAA) in breast and thigh muscle, and improved polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and essential fatty acids (EFA) in breast muscle; the 6% and 9% FMLP groups showed preferably such effects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of FMLP can improve the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and then improve the growth performance of broilers; it also has a positive effect on improving slaughter performance and meat quality.

AB  - Bioaugmentation of veterinary antibiotic (VA)-contaminated feces with VA-degrading bacteria, can reduce the VA-selective pressure on manure microorganisms toward antibiotic resistance during organic soil fertilization. We explored the efficiency of a Sphingomonas isolate, able to degrade tiamulin (TIA), as a bioaugmentation agent for removing TIA from pig manures fortified with TIA at two concentrations (5 and 50 mu g g(-1)). Bioaugmentation efficiency was compared with stockpiling and anaerobic digestion. Bioaugmentation accelerated TIA dissipation (DT50 = 32.3 and 66.2 days) compared with anaerobic digestion (DT50 = 103 and 126.7 days) and stockpiling (DT50 = 95.38 and 113.8 days). Furthermore, we determined the impact of TIA on methane production and followed microbial succession during anaerobic digestion. The lower TIA concentration stimulated biomethanation, seemingly, through induction of the increase of Methanosarcina (from below detection at the TIA-free samples to 17.1% of relative abundance at the low in TIA content samples), commonly linked with aceticlastic biomethanation. Our findings highlight (i) the potential of bioaugmentation in treating VA-contaminated manures for mitigating the dispersal of VA residues in agricultural settings (ii) the high risk of contamination of agricultural soils by the use of TIA-contaminated manures that have been stockpiled or anaerobically digested before their use in agricultural settings.

AB  - The tea green leafhopper, Empoasca onukii Matsuda (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae, Typhlocybinae), is a serious pest of tea plants in East Asia. In the laboratory, tea genotypes CA278, Cd19, and Cd289 [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze (Theaceae)] sustain fewer feeding damage symptoms known as hopperburn than the susceptible cultivar 'Yabukita,' and E. onukii excretes less honeydew on them than on Yabukita. Here, we evaluated whether these genotypes have practical and sufficient resistance under field conditions. The densities of E. onukii eggs, larvae, and adults on tea shoots and the degree of feeding damage were compared as indicators of resistance. Genotypes Cd19 and Cd289 showed strong resistance and CA278 showed moderate resistance under field conditions. Therefore, Cd19 and Cd289 are favorable materials for breeding tea cultivars with resistance to tea green leafhopper. We propose selection methods for breeding new resistant tea cultivars.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation results in the differential remodeling of the molecules presented in sperm, and these alterations related to reductions in sperm quality and its physiological function have not been fully understood. Given this, this study aimed to investigate the cryoinjury mechanism of goat sperm by analyzing changes of the metabolic characteristics in sperm during the cryopreservation process. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) technique was performed to explore metabolite profiles of fresh sperm (C group), equilibrated sperm (E group), and frozen-thawed sperm (F group). In total, 2570 metabolites in positive mode and 2306 metabolites in negative mode were identified, respectively. After comparative analyses among these three groups, 374 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in C vs. E, 291 DAMs in C vs. F, and 189 DAMs in E vs. F were obtained in the positive mode; concurrently, 530 DAMs in C vs. E, 405 DAMs in C vs. F, and 193 DAMs in E vs. F were obtained in the negative mode, respectively. The DAMs were significantly enriched in various metabolic pathways, including 31 pathways in C vs. E, 25 pathways in C vs. F, and 28 pathways in E vs. F, respectively. Among them, 65 DAMs and 25 significantly enriched pathways across the three comparisons were discovered, which may be tightly associated with sperm characteristics and function. Particularly, the functional terms such as TCA cycle, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, sphingolipid metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, as well as associated pivotal metabolites like ceramide, betaine, choline, fumaric acid, L-malic acid and L-lactic acid, were focused on. In conclusion, our research characterizes the composition of metabolites in goat sperm and their alterations induced by the cryopreservation process, offering a critical foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of metabolism influencing the quality and freezing tolerance of goat sperm. Additionally, the impacts of equilibration at low temperature on sperm quality may need more attentions as compared to the freezing and thawing process.

AB  - As a kind of metabolically triggered inflammation, obesity influences the interplay between the central nervous system and the enteral environment. The present study showed that beta-elemene, which is contained in various plant substances, had effects on recovering the changes in metabolites occurring in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6 male mice brains, especially in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). beta-elemene also partially reversed HFD-induced changes in the composition and contents of mouse gut bacteria. Furthermore, we evaluated the interaction between cerebral metabolites and intestinal microbiota via Pearson correlations. The prediction results suggested that Firmicutes were possibly controlled by neuron integrity, cerebral inflammation, and neurotransmitters, and Bacteroidetes in mouse intestines might be related to cerebral aerobic respiration and the glucose cycle. Such results also implied that Actinobacteria probably affected cerebral energy metabolism. These findings suggested that beta-elemene has regulatory effects on the imbalanced microbiota-gut-brain axis caused by obesity and, therefore, would contribute to the future study in on the interplay between cerebral metabolites from different brain regions and the intestinal microbiota of mice.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call on the zoonotic viral spillover events and the need to be prepared for future outbreaks. Zoonotic RNA viruses like the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are potential pathogens that could trigger the next pandemic. Dromedary camels are the only known animal source of MERS-CoV zoonotic infections, but little is known about the molecular antiviral response in this species. IFN-beta and other type-I interferons provide the first line of defense against invading pathogens in the host immune response. We identified the IFNB gene of the dromedary camel and all extant members of the family Camelidae. Camelid IFN-beta is unique with an even number of cysteines in the mature protein compared to other eutherian mammals with an odd number of cysteines. The viral mimetic poly(I:C) strongly induced IFN-beta expression in camel kidney cells. Induction of IFN-beta expression upon infection with camelpox virus was late and subdued when compared to poly(I:C) treatment. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant dromedary IFN-beta induced expression of IFN-responsive genes in camel kidney cells. Further, recombinant IFN-beta conferred antiviral resistance to camel kidney cells against the cytopathic effects of the camelpox virus, an endemic zoonotic pathogen. IFN-beta from this unique group of mammals will offer insights into antiviral immune mechanisms and aid in the development of specific antivirals against pathogens that have the potential to be the next zoonotic pandemic.

AB  - Rabbit duodenum has been used for examining the ability of motilin to cause muscle contraction in vitro. A motilin-related peptide, ghrelin, is known to be involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) motility in various animals, but its ability to cause rabbit GI contraction have not been well examined. The aim of this study is to clarify the action of rat ghrelin and its interaction with motilin in the rabbit duodenum. The mRNA expression of ghrelin and motilin receptors was also examined using RT-PCR. Rat ghrelin (10(-9)-10(-6 )M) did not change the contractile activity of the duodenum measured by the mean muscle tonus and area under the curve of contraction waves. In agreement with this result, the distribution of ghrelin receptor mRNA in the rabbit GI tract varied depending on the GI region from which the samples were taken; the expression level in the duodenum was negligible, but that in the esophagus or stomach was significant. On the other hand, motilin (10(- 10)-10(-6) M) caused a concentration-dependent contraction by means of increased mean muscle tonus, and consistently, motilin receptor mRNA was expressed heterogeneously depending on the GI region (esophagus = stomach = colon = rectum < duodenum = jejunum = ileum < cecum). Expression level of motilin receptor was comparable to that of ghrelin receptor in the esophagus and stomach. Pretreatment with ghrelin (10(-6) M) prior to motilin did not affect the contractile activity of motilin in the duodenum. In conclusion, ghrelin does not affect muscle contractility or motilin-induced contraction in the rabbit duodenum, which is due to the lack of ghrelin receptors. The present in vitro results suggest that ghrelin might not be a regulator of intestinal motility in rabbits.

AB  - Drought stress is a critical environmental factor that significantly impacts plant growth and productivity. However, the transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress in Camellia oleifera Abel. is still unclear. This study analyzed the transcriptome sequencing data of C. oleifera under drought treatments. A total of 20,674 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified under drought stress, with the number of DEGs increasing with the duration of drought. Specifically, 11,793 and 18,046 DEGs were detected after 8 and 15 days of drought treatment, respectively, including numerous upregulated and downregulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were primarily involved in various biological processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that carbon metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, proteasome, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were the main affected pathways. Among the DEGs, 376 protein kinases, 42 proteases, 168 transcription factor (TF) genes, and 152 other potential functional genes were identified, which may play significant roles in the drought response of C. oleifera. The expression of relevant functional genes was further validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These findings contribute to the comprehension of drought tolerance mechanisms in C. oleifera and bolster the identification of drought-resistant genes for molecular breeding purposes.

AB  - The high viscosity of Camelidae semen continues to present a major impediment for its application in assisted reproduction technology. The exposure of epididymal spermatozoa (ES) to seminal plasma (SP) may provide an approach to enhance the development of assisted reproductive techniques in these important domestic species. Since the sperm glycocalyx plays a key role in reproduction we aimed to evaluate whether SP exposure modifies the surface glycosylation patterns of cryopreserved dromedary ES. Epididymal sperm was collected through retrograde flushing of the cauda epididymidis that were obtained from orchidectomized mature dromedary bulls. The collected samples were then cryopreserved after dilution with a tris citrate clarified egg yolk extender, with and without the supplementation of 15% SP. Post-thaw carbohydrate surface profiles of both control and SP-treated spermatozoa were analyzed using 15 fluorescent lectins. Morpho-functional properties were also investigated via computer assisted sperm analysis. Lectin-binding analysis of the glycocalyx in control sperm revealed the presence of (1) N-glycans terminating with lactosamine (Con A, PHA-L, and RCA(120)), in both acrosomal and tail regions. Whilst (2) alpha 2,3-/alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids (MALII, SNA), and O-linked glycans terminating with a single N-acetylgalactosamine residue (Tn antigen) (HPA, SBA) along with galactoseb1,3N-acetylgalactosamine (T antigen) (PNA) were observed in the acrosomal cap. The expression of both N-acetylglucosamine (sWGA and GSA II) and terminalagalactose (GSA I-B-4) residues was also noted in the acrosomal cap region of control sperm. Compared with controls, SP treated samples displayed: 1) the appearance of bisected ditriantennary complex-type N-glycans (PHA-E), terminating with lactosamine, as well as an increase of Oglycans terminating with Tn and T antigens in both the acrosomal and tail regions; 2) an increase in glycans containing alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and agalactose in the tail region. The cytoplasmic droplets of both control and seminal plasma-treated sperm bound Con A, PHA-E, PHA-L, RCA(120), HPA, PNA, sWGA, GSA I-B-4, and GSA II. These results indicate that SP treatment affects the glycan composition of the dromedary camel ES glycocalyx. More comprehensive studies are required in order to evaluate the fertilization capacity of SP-treated ES in order to facilitate its application in dromedary camel assisted reproduction technology.

AB  - Pruning is an important agronomic measure in tea plantation management. In this study, we analyzed the effect of pruning on gene expression in tea leaves from a transcriptomics perspective and verified the results of a transcriptomic analysis in terms of changes in physiological indicators of tea leaves. The results showed that pruning enhanced the gene expression of nine metabolic pathways in tea leaves, including fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and plant hormone signal transduction, thereby promoting the growth of tea plants and increasing tea yield. However, pruning reduced the gene expression of nine metabolic pathways, including secondary metabolites biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, and lowered the content of caffeine, flavonoids, and free amino acids in tea plant leaves. In conclusion, pruning could promote the growth of tea plants and increase the yield of tea, but it was not conducive to the accumulation of some quality indicators in tea leaves, especially caffeine, flavonoids, and free amino acids, which, in turn, reduced the quality of tea. This study provides an important theoretical reference for the management of agronomic measures in tea plantations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the onset of intramammary infection (IMI) on the electrical conductivity (EC) of ewe milk and assess the detection capability of various algorithms based on daily glandular milk EC measurement. An experiment was carried out with 26 Manchega sheep located at the farm of the Miguel Hernandez University, Elche, Spain. The variables in milk from the gland (production, EC) were monitored daily for 2 weeks during the morning and evening milking; once infection was established in the gland, the variables were measured for a further 4 weeks. In addition, the SCC, sodium, potassium, chloride and milk macro-compositions were analysed. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values for IMI detection of different algorithms were calculated using the EC variable. It was observed that the onset of IMI resulted in an increase in SCC and a significant decrease in yield, and EC rose significantly when infection occurred bilaterally. The best results for IMI detection were obtained with the algorithm that detected deviations greater than 3s of the conductivity ratio between collateral glands with respect to a moving average calculated with a time horizon of 10 days (50% sensitivity and 100% specificity).

AB  - Understanding the neural correlates of repetitive retrieval of emotional events is critical in addressing pathological emotional processing, as repeated processing is central for a number of different therapeutic interventions. In the current study, single-trial functional brain activity was assessed in key regions implicated in episodic retrieval, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus, and the posteromedial parietal cortex (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus) following repeated retrieval of pleasant and unpleasant autobiographical events. Replicating previous studies, repetition prompted reduced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) amplitude in the anterior hippocampus and the mPFC, but not in the posterior hippocampus, due to no functional activity during mental imagery, or in the posteromedial parietal cortex, due to enhanced activation that was sustained across repetitions. Neural activation during pleasant and unpleasant autobiographical retrieval did not differ as a function of repetition, indicating similar processing effects regardless of motivational relevance. Taken together, the hedonic valence of retrieved memories does not affect functional activity associated with repeated retrieval of episodic events, in which the pattern of BOLD amplitude change suggests a dissociation between the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit, which shows repetition suppression, and the posteromedial parietal cortex, which shows sustained activation.

AB  - Manganese (Mn), a common environmental and occupational risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause central nervous system damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The melatonin has been shown to effectively improve neural damage and intestinal microbiota disturbances in animal models. This research investigated the mechanism by which exogenous melatonin prevented Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment and neural damage. Here, we established subchronic Mn-exposed mice model and melatonin supplement tests to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. Mn induced neurogenesis impairment and microglia overactivation, behavioral dysfunction, gut microbiota dysbiosis and serum metabolic disorder in mice. All these events were reversed with the melatonin supplement. The behavioral tests revealed that melatonin group showed approximately 30 % restoration of motor activity. According to quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, melatonin group showed remarkable restoration of the expression of dopamine neurons and neurogenesis markers, approximately 46.4 % (TH), 68.4 % (DCX in hippocampus) and 48 % (DCX in striatum), respectively. Interestingly, melatonin increased neurogenesis probably via the gut microbiota and metabolism modulation. The correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with hippocampal neurogenesis indicated that Firmicutes-lipid metabolism might mediate the critical repair role of melatonin in neurogenesis in Mn-exposed mice. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin supplementation can promote neurogenesis, and restore neuron loss and neural function in Mn-exposed mice, and the multi-omics results provide new research ideas for future mechanistic studies.

AB  - The usefulness of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is augmented by a low defect and impurity density in the surrounding host material, and applications benefit from the ability to control the position of the NV centers. Herein, a process to create NV centers on single-crystalline diamond microstructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is presented. Pyramidal structures with {111} side facets are formed during the intrinsic overgrowth of dry chemically etched cylindrical pillars on a substrate with {100} surface orientation. A thin nitrogen-doped epitaxial layer is deposited on top of the pyramids resulting in the creation of NV centers exclusively on the {111} pyramid side faces. Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and spin echo measurements reveal preferential alignment of the NV centers in a single {111} direction and a T 2 time of 55 mu s . The T 2 time of the NV centers is limited by the surrounding substitutional nitrogen (P1 center) concentration of [P 1 ] = 5 ppm . A low density of other paramagnetic spin noise is detected by double-electron electron resonance (DEER) measurements.

AB  - Thirty-six healthy 21-day-old weaned ternary piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) were randomly divided into two treatments with 18 replicates per treatment and one pig per replicate. The control group was fed with a basal diet and the test group was fed with diets supplemented with 1 kg/t tea residue. The test period was 28 days. The results are as follows: The addition of tea residue in the diet had no significant effect on the growth performance of weaned piglets (p > 0.05), but it could significantly reduce the diarrhea rate of piglets from 1 to 7 days and 1 to 28 days (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the dietary supplementation of tea residue had no significant effect on nutrient apparent digestibility, plasma biochemical indexes and plasma immune indexes (p > 0.05) but increased the content of glutathione in plasma (p < 0.05). Tea residue had no significant effect on the morphology of the jejunum and ileum of piglets (p > 0.05), but it could significantly reduce the content of chloride ions in feces (p < 0.05). Compared with the basal diet group, there was no significant difference in the relative expression of TMEM16A and CFTR mRNA in the colon of weaned piglets (p > 0.05). The whole-cell patch clamp recording showed that the TMEM16A and CFTR ion channels could be activated by ionomycin and forskolin, respectively. However, when HT-29 cells transfected with TMEM16A and CFTR channels were treated with tea residue extract, it could significantly inhibit the chloride current of the TMEM16A and CFTR ion channels (p < 0.05).

AB  - Cyfluthrin is a widely used insecticide, and studies have shown that its exposure during pregnancy is associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities in offspring, but the mechanism of toxicity is unknown. In this study, we observed the neurodevelopmental toxicity of Cyfluthrin in rat offspring of different ages due to pregnancy exposure, which manifested a series of impairments such as persistent cognitive impairment, neuronal loss in hippocampal tissues, synaptic damage, and altered expression of neurodevelopmental-related factors. Hippocampal scRNA-seq in neonatal rats showed specific cellular responses to prenatal Cyfluthrin exposure. Through DEG intergroup difference analysis, intercellular communication analysis, and mimetic timing analysis, we found that the change in the fate of neural stem cells-alterations in differentiation direction, proliferation, and apoptosis levels-was the main cause of the offspring's developmental toxicity induced by prenatal Cyfluthrin exposure. This inference was verified by our in-vivo and ex-vivo experiments. Our study first constructed a single-cell atlas of the offspring's brain hippocampus exposed to Cyfluthrin during pregnancy. It warns about pesticide intake during pregnancy and nursing in women and provides a theoretical basis for neurodevelopmental toxicity from early-life exposure to environmental pollutants.

AB  - As the demand of consumers for good meat quality is increasing, there is more interest in improving pork quality by nutritional regulation. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a group of bioactive flavonoids, exhibits excellent biological functions and pharmacological activities. This study aimed to investigate whether dietary DHM supplementation in growing-finishing pigs could provide high-quality pork. A total of 24 healthy castrated Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) pigs with an average body weight of 26.95 +/- 0.26 kg were randomly divided into four groups (basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with 100, 300 and 500 mg kg(-1) DHM) with 6 duplicates and one pig per replicate. The growth performance, carcass traits and pork quality of growing-finishing pigs were detected. Then, tandem mass tag (TMT) based quantitative proteomics, western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to explore the regulatory mechanism of DHM on pork quality. The results showed that DHM decreased the feed to gain ratio (F/G) and improved the sensory quality (shear force and meat color) and nutritional value (crude protein content and amino acid composition) of pork in growing-finishing pigs. Totally 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified, among which the down-regulated heat shock protein-beta 1 (HSPB1) and up-regulated Troponin C-slow (TNNC1) contributed towards explaining the positive effect of DHM on the tenderness and meat color of pork. GO enrichment analysis revealed that better meat color was also linked to higher levels of oxidative metabolism and hemoglobin complexes in pork. Western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis showed that DHM induced a muscle fiber type transformation from fast-switch to slow-switch by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal, thereby improving the pork quality. Taken together, our findings provide effective evidence for the application of DHM in high-quality pork production.

AB  - Bladder cancer (BC) is the 10th most common neoplasia worldwide and holds expensive treatment costs due to its high recurrence rates, resistance to therapy and the need for lifelong surveillance. Thus, it is necessary to improve the current therapy options and identify more effective treatments for BC. Biological models capable of recapitulating the characteristics of human BC pathology are essential in evaluating the effectiveness of new therapies. Currently, the most commonly used BC models are experimentally induced murine models and spontaneous canine models, which are either insufficient due to their small size and inability to translate results to clinical basis (murine models) or rarely spontaneously observed BC (canine models). Pigs represent a potentially useful animal for the development of personalized tumors due to their size, anatomy, physiology, metabolism, immunity, and genetics similar to humans and the ability to experimentally induce tumors. Pigs have emerged as suitable biomedical models for several human diseases. In this sense, the present perspective focuses on the genetic basis for BC; presents current BC animal models available along with their limitations; and proposes the pig as an adequate animal to develop humanized large animal models of BC. Genetic alterations commonly found in human BC can be explored to create genetically defined porcine models, including the BC driver mutations observed in the FGFR3, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB1, HRAS, and TP53 genes. The development of such robust models for BC has great value in the study of pathology and the screening of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches to the disease.

AB  - Elephant grass has high biomass production potential and can benefit from biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) as its main external nitrogen source. This study evaluated the effect of BNF on biomass productivity and total nitrogen accumulation in different elephant grass genotypes. This experiment was conducted in a 120 m(2) concrete tank filled with soil labeled with N-15 to estimate the contribution of BNF. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications, and the evaluation was over three years of cultivation, with semiannual cuts. The productivity of fresh and dry mass of the shoot, Nitrogen (N) accumulation, and the contribution of BNF by the N-15 natural abundance technique were evaluated. The annual average of BNF was 38%. There was a statistical difference between the treatments, with the genotype P13G13 presenting fresh and dry mass productivity 50% higher than P6G4. The annual average of fresh mass, dry matter, total N, and N derived from BNF in the genotypes was approximately 70, 30, 100 Mg ha(-1), and 35 kg ha(-1), respectively. The results obtained by the P13G13 genotype allow us to recommend its use for biomass production aimed at bioenergy, favoring sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and dependence on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.

AB  - Patients with chronic pain often complain about memory impairments. Experimental studies have shown neu-roprotective effects of Carbamylated erythropoietin (Cepo-Fc) in the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions. However, little is currently known about its precise molecular mechanisms in a model of inflammatory pain. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate neuroprotective effects of Cepo-Fc against cognitive impairment induced by the inflammatory model of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). Carbamylated erythropoietin was administrated Intraperitoneally (i.p) on the day CFA injection, continued for a 21-days period. After conducting the behavioral tests (thermal hyperalgesia and novel object recognition test), western blot and ELISA were further preformed on days 0, 7, and 21. The results of this study indicate that Cepo-Fc can effectively reverse the CFA induced thermal hyperalgesia and recognition memory impairment. Additionally, Cepo-Fc noticeably decreased the hippocampal microglial expression, production of hippocampal IL-1 beta, and hippocampal apoptosis and necroptosis induced by the inflammatory pain. Therefore, our findings suggest that neuroprotective effects of Cepo-Fc in the treatment of pain related recognition memory impairment may be mediated through reducing hippocampal microglial expression as well as IL-1 beta production.

AB  - Astrotactin2 (ASTN2) regulates neuronal migration and synaptic strength through the trafficking and degradation of surface proteins. Deletion of ASTN2 in copy number variants has been identified in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder in copy number variant (CNV) analysis. Disruption of ASTN2 is a risk factor for these neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the importance of ASTN2 in physiological functions remains poorly understood. To elucidate the physiological functions of ASTN2, we investigated whether deficiency of ASTN2 affects cognitive and/or emotional behaviors and neurotransmissions using ASTN2-deficient mice. Astn2 knockout (KO) mice produced by CRISPR/Cas9 technique showed no obvious differences in physical characteristics and circadian rhythm. Astn2 KO mice showed increased exploratory activity in a novel environment, social behavior and impulsivity, or decreased despair-, anxiety-like behaviors and exploratory preference for the novel object. Some behavioral abnormalities, such as increased exploratory activity and impulsivity, or decreased exploratory preference were specifically attenuated by risperidone, but not by haloperidol. While, the both drugs did not affect any emotion-related behavioral abnormalities in Astn2 KO mice. Dopamine contents were decreased in the striatum, and serotonin or dopamine turnover were increased in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala of Astn2 KO mice. In morphological analyses, thinning of neural cell layers in the hippocampus, reduction of neural cell bodies in the prefrontal cortex, and decrease in spine density and PSD95 protein in both tissues were observed in Astn2 KO mice. The present findings suggest that ASTN2 deficiency develops some emotional or cognitive impairments related to monoaminergic dysfunctions and abnormal neuronal morphogenesis with shrinkage of neuronal soma. ASTN2 protein may contribute to the pathogenic mechanism and symptom onset of mental disorders.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda is a significant global agricultural pest, particularly fond of maize. In agroecosystems, the interactions among plants, phytophagous insects, and their natural enemies form a complex web at three trophic levels, with volatile compounds playing a pivotal role in these interactions. Phytophagous insects utilize plant volatiles as chemical cues to accurately identify and locate their hosts. Furthermore, herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) act as critical chemical messengers and play an essential role in mediating interactions across the three trophic levels. These interactions include inducing defense mechanisms in neighboring plants, attracting natural enemies to help suppress pest populations, or directly producing repellent substances to deter pests. Oral secretions (OS) play a vital role in this interaction, acting as a critical signaling conduit that modulates plant responses. In this study, the major agricultural pest S. frugiperda was examined, with the GOX gene targeted as a molecular focus. The findings indicate that the GOX gene influences HIPV emission in maize, providing valuable insights into plant-insect interaction mechanisms and laying a foundation for innovative plant protection strategies. The intricate relationships between plants and insects are essential for understanding ecological dynamics. Among these interactions, HIPVs serve as a pivotal defense mechanism. Our findings reveal the highly conserved nature of the GOX gene within the Lepidoptera order, highly expressed in the salivary glands of S. frugiperda, and its role in mediating maize's defense responses. Notably, salivary GOX activity expression significantly decreases subsequent gene knockout. The presence of GOX in the saliva of S. frugiperda significantly modulates the emission of HIPVs during maize consumption. This research delineates that GOX selectively inhibits the emission of certain green leaf volatiles (GLVs) while concurrently enhancing the release of terpene volatiles. This study unveils a novel mechanism whereby S. frugiperda utilizes GOX proteins in OS to modulate volatile emissions from maize, offering fresh perspectives on the adaptive evolution of phytophagous insects and their interactions with their preferred host plants.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common and severe form of epilepsy in adults; however, its underlying pathomechanisms remain elusive. Dysregulation of ubiquitination is increasingly recognized to contribute to the development and maintenance of epilepsy. Herein, we observed for the first time that potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 13 (KCTD13) protein, a substrate-specific adapter for cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, was markedly down-regulated in the brain tissue of patients with TLE. In a TLE mouse model, the protein expression of KCTD13 dynamically changed during epileptogenesis. Knockdown of KCTD13 in the mouse hippocampus significantly enhanced seizure susceptibility and severity, whereas overexpression of KCTD13 showed the opposite effect. Mechanistically, GluN1, an obligatory subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs), was identified as a potential substrate protein of KCTD13. Further investigation revealed that KCTD13 facilitates lysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of GluN1 and its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Besides, the lysine residue 860 of GluN1 is the main ubiquitin site. Importantly, dysregulation of KCTD13 affected membrane expression of glutamate receptors and impaired glutamate synaptic transmission. Systemic administration of the NMDAR inhibitor memantine significantly rescued the epileptic phenotype aggravated by KCTD13 knockdown. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an unrecognized pathway of KCTD13-GluN1 in epilepsy, suggesting KCTD13 as a potential neuroprotective therapeutic target for epilepsy.

AB  - Elephant grass is an outstanding crop biomass for sustainable energy generation. Here, the effect of plant parts (stem, leaf, and whole plant) at four ages (90, 120, 150, and 180 days) on the proximate, chemical, and elemental characteristics of elephant grass cultivar BRS Capia & ccedil;u is investigated. From proximate analysis, the heating value is dependent on the water content regardless of plant part and age. A linear model allowing the prediction of heating value solely based on water content is derived from measurements. Density is modelled as a quadratic function of water content across ages and plant parts. Such a model can be used to predict the moisture-dependent weight of the biomass and its parts. Cellulose content is at the upper bound of benchmark values found in the literature. The highest lignin content, which tends to increase with age, is found in the stem. From elemental analysis, a much higher mineral content increasing with age is produced by the leaf. Contrarily, significantly lower mineral content is generated by the stem, bottoming out at 180 days. This is reflected in five predictive indices for slagging and fouling, which suggest that the stem at 180 days is the optimal part and age for energy purposes.

AB  - Dietary intake of toxic elements (TEs) and essential trace elements (ETEs) can significantly impact human health. This study collected 302 samples, including 78 food, 104 drinking water, 73 cultivated topsoil, and 47 sedimentary rock from a typical area of Tethys-Himalaya tectonic domain. These samples were used to calculate the average daily dose of oral intake (ADD(oral)) and assess the health risks of five TEs and five ETEs. The results indicate that grain and meat are the primary dietary sources of TEs and ETEs for local residents. The intake of manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) is mainly from local highland barley (66.90% and 60.32%, respectively), iron (Fe) is primarily from local grains (75.51%), and zinc (Zn) is mainly from local yak meat (60.03%). The ADD(oral) of arsenic (As), Mn, Fe and Zn were found to be higher than the maximum oral reference dose in all townships of study area, indicating non-carcinogenic health risks for local residents. Additionally, lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) in 36.36% townships, and Cu in 81.82% townships were above the maximum oral reference dose, while As posed a carcinogenic risk throughout the study area. The concentrations of As, mercury (Hg), Pb, Mn, Cu Fe and selenium (Se) in grains were significantly correlated with those in soils. Moreover, the average concentrations of As in Proterozoic, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous was 43.09, 12.41, 15.86 and 6.22 times higher than those in the South Tibet shell, respectively. The high concentrations of TEs and ETEs in the stratum can lead to their enrichment in soils, which, in turn, can result in excessive intake by local residents through the food chain and biogeochemical cycles . To avoid the occurrence of some diseases caused by dietary intake, it is necessary to consume a variety of exotic foods, such as high-selenium foods, foreign rice and flour in order to improve the dietary structure.

AB  - The current study was conducted with the aim to investigate effects of PPAR. ligands on synthesis of nuclear receptor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and selected cytokines (IL-1 beta, IFN gamma, TNF alpha, IL-4, IL-10, LIF) in the pig myometrium on days 14-15 of the estrous cycle (late-luteal phase) and days 14-15 of the gestational period (beginning of embryonic implantation). The myometrial slices were incubated in vitro for 6 h in medium containing PPAR. ligands, agonists: 15d-prostaglandin J(2) or pioglitazone, and antagonist - T0070907. The mRNA transcript and protein abundances were evaluated in tissues and culture medium. During the estrous cycle, PPAR gamma ligands did not have an effect on the mRNA transcript abundance of the immune response mediators used for treatments. The IL-10 protein abundance in the tissue was less when there was inclusions of pioglitazone in the medium, while the treatment with T0070907 resulted in a larger abundance of NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta (in the tissue) and IL-4 (in tissue and culture media). During the gestational period, pioglitazone or PGJ(2) suppressed mRNA IFN gamma and IL-10 transcript and protein abundances (in the tissue and culture media), whereas there was an enhanced NF-kappa B protein abundance (in the tissue). Treatment with T0070907 had diverse effects (e.g., for NF kappa B inhibited mRNA transcript abundance or enhanced protein abundance). The observed changes are related mainly in tissues from pregnant animals. Responses to PPAR gamma antagonist are indicative of the possible involvement of PPAR gamma-independent factors as well as ligand-independent activation of the receptor, ligand selectivity/functionality or tissue receptivity to the factors evaluated.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The development of chemically defined media has become a particularly important task for in vitro embryo production systems, which require maintained reproducible results when new additives are tested for culture, beyond observational studies. Specifically, we need studies measuring the impact of these media on the embryonic transcriptome, particularly those negatively affecting embryo quality. Consequently, this study evaluated by using a microarray approach the transcriptome of porcine embryos produced in vitro, cultured in a defined vs. an undefined medium and contrasted with in vivo-derived embryos. No significantly altered genes were found between in vitro-produced embryos, despite the theoretical limitations that usually accompany defined media. However, when they were compared with in vivo-derived embryos, many altered genes were observed, reflecting how current culture conditions deeply modify the embryonic transcriptome. A better understanding of these alterations may offer new ways to improve in vitro embryo production systems. Likewise, developing a chemically defined medium capable of producing embryos of a similar quality to traditional media may contribute to this task.
   The development of chemically defined media is a growing trend in in vitro embryo production (IVP). Recently, traditional undefined culture medium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been successfully replaced by a chemically defined medium using substances with embryotrophic properties such as platelet factor 4 (PF4). Although the use of this medium sustains IVP, the impact of defined media on the embryonic transcriptome has not been fully elucidated. This study analyzed the transcriptome of porcine IVP blastocysts, cultured in defined (PF4 group) and undefined media (BSA group) by microarrays. In vivo-derived blastocysts (IVV group) were used as a standard of maximum embryo quality. The results showed no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the PF4 and BSA groups. However, a total of 2780 and 2577 DEGs were detected when comparing the PF4 or the BSA group with the IVV group, respectively. Most of these genes were common in both in vitro groups (2132) and present in some enriched pathways, such as cell cycle, lysosome and/or metabolic pathways. These results show that IVP conditions strongly affect embryo transcriptome and that the defined culture medium with PF4 is a guaranteed replacement for traditional culture with BSA.

AB  - Secondary osteonecrosis (ON) is a common complication in paediatric cancer survivors. Combining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with core decompression surgery halts disease progression and stimulates bone regeneration. However, the success of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) requires versatile "off-the-shelf" tissue engineering products (TEPs). This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of TEPs loaded with allogeneic MSCs from Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSCs) in a large-animal model of bone regeneration to support a paediatric investigational plan for ON patients. WJ-MSC-laden fibrin-based hydrogels combined with a synthetic bone substitute (PRO-DENSETM) were tested in 16 juvenile sheep (8 males and 8 females) distributed in four experimental groups. Each animal received four cylindrical bone defects in the femoral and tibial epiphyses and was assessed at 6 and 12 weeks. Safety was confirmed, and bone regeneration was observed across all groups. A combination of WJ-MSCs with PRO-DENSETM led to improved histological scores, osteogenesis, and construct integration. Trabecular bone volume also increased more in cellular groups over time. However, effects were inconsistent across groups, reflecting the variability seen in clinical trials and highlighting the significant impact of factors such as immunogenetic compatibility, MSC batch potency, and interaction with the recipient's microenvironment on the therapeutic effectiveness and successful clinical translation of allogeneic ATMPs.

AB  - Inactive behaviour is essential to life. However, specific forms of inactivity may be indicative of compromised welfare in certain captive conditions. Inactive but awake behaviour (IBA - spontaneous, motionless awake behaviour without interacting with the surroundings) has been documented in some species and may be associated with poor welfare and negatively valenced affective states. In our previous work in laboratory mice, we have identified environmental risk factors (non-enriched housing) and curative factors (antidepressant drug Venlafaxine) for IBA and we hypothesise that greater levels of IBA may represent a depression-like state in this species. Here we aimed to identify which specific sub-characteristics of IBA would show construct validity as a depression-like state by exploring the posture (i.e. lying, curled lying or sitting), social contact position (i.e. in physical contact with a cage mate or not) and location of mice while performing the behaviour during two experiments (respectively investigating the aetiology and the curative factors of IBA). In both experiments we expected that more IBA would be displayed in standard (non-enriched) laboratory cages, compared with large highly-enriched cages and that a move from a highly-enriched to a non-enriched cage would increase IBA, while the opposite treatment would result in a decrease. In our second experiment (curative factors investigation), we predicted that less IBA would be displayed by mice that voluntarily ingested an antidepressant (Venlafaxine) versus a placebo. Because we could not control the number of instances of each IBA sub-characteristic we measured and we had no a priori predictions about which IBA sub-characteristics would match our general IBA treatment predictions, we compared the effect size and the direction of the effect between our treatment groups to explore which of the sub-characteristics matched our general IBA predictions. Overall, we found little variation in the location IBA was performed, with the majority being seen in the nest. Across treatment comparisons in both experiments, overall, the largest effect sizes were measured for IBA performed when in contact with the cage mate and performed when lying and both characteristics generally matched the direction of our treatmentrelated predictions. We suggest that future work should perform more detailed analyses of the specific characteristics of IBA by identifying behavioural sequences and the co-occurrence of the sub-characteristics to obtain a more complete picture of IBA as a depression-like indicator.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are tiny membranous structures that mediate intercellular communication. The role(s) of these vesicles have been widely investigated in the context of neurological diseases; however, their potential implications in the neuropathology subjacent to human psychiatric disorders remain mostly unknown. Here, by using next-generation discovery-driven proteomics, we investigate the potential role(s) of brain EVs (bEVs) in schizophrenia (SZ) by analyzing these vesicles from the three post-mortem anatomical brain regions: the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), and caudate (CAU). The results obtained indicate that bEVs from SZ-affected brains contain region-specific proteins that are associated with abnormal GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission. Similarly, these vesicles from the analyzed regions were implicated in synaptic decay, abnormal brain immunity, neuron structural imbalances, and impaired cell homeostasis. Our findings also provide evidence, for the first time, that networks of molecular exchange (involving the PFC, HC, and CAU) are potentially active and mediated by EVs in non-diseased brains. Additionally, these bEV-mediated networks seem to have become partially reversed and largely disrupted in the brains of subjects affected by SZ. Taken as a whole, these results open the door to the uncovering of new biological markers and therapeutic targets, based on the compositions of bEVs, for the benefit of patients affected by SZ and related psychotic disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ylang-ylang essential oil (YEO), obtained from the flowers of the tropical tree Cananga odorata (Lam.) Hook. f. & Thomson (family Annonaceae), has been largely used in the traditional medicine with many uses, including anxiety and altered neuronal states. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain condition with a high incidence of comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, that drastically affect the patient's quality of life. The currently available drugs used for the management of neuropathic pain are inadequate due to poor efficacy and tolerability, highlighting the medicinal need of a better pharmacotherapy. Several clinical studies have reported that massage or inhalation with selected essentials oils reduces symptoms associated to pain and anxiety. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to investigate the analgesic properties of YEO and its efficacy in reducing neuropathy-associated mood alterations. Materials and methods: The analgesic properties were tested in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model using male mice. Anxiolytic, antidepressant, and locomotor properties were also evaluated using behavioural tests. Finally, the YEO mechanism of action was investigated in the spinal cord and hippocampus of neuropathic mice. Results: Oral administration of YEO (30 mg/kg) reduced SNI-induced neuropathic pain and ameliorates pain related anxiety symptoms that appeared 28 days after surgery. YEO reduced the expression of MAPKs, NOS2, p-p65, markers of neuroinflammation, and promoted normalizing effect on neurotrophin levels (BDNF). Conclusions: YEO induced neuropathic pain relief and ameliorated pain-associated anxiety, representing an interesting candidate for the management of neuropathic pain conditions and pain-related comorbidities.

AB  - Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are a major contributor to the risk factor for the developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study explored the protective efficacy of puerarin (Pue), a key bioactive ingredient derived from Radix Puerariae, against cardiac damage induced by Hcy, along with its underlying molecular mechanisms. Using H9c2 cardiomyocytes and a guinea pig model of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), we demonstrated that Pue attenuated Hcy-induced cardiotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The cardioprotective effects of Pue were exerted by activating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis. In vitro, Pue pretreatment markedly enhanced cell viability, diminished the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in Hcy-injured H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, Pue upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, two key regulators of the antioxidant response, and alleviated Hcy-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. These beneficial effects were abrogated by the HO-1 inhibitor Znpp and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, indicating the contribution of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 axis. In vivo, Pue treatment significantly reduced serum Hcy levels, decreased serum biomarkers of myocardial injury, lowered MDA levels, and increased SOD activities in HHcy guinea pigs. Additionally, Pue improved cardiac remodeling and attenuated myocardial apoptosis, accompanied by upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and an increased p-Akt/ Akt ratio within myocardial tissues. Overall, these findings suggest that Pue protects against Hcy-induced cardiac injury via the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis, offering a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention and management of CVDs associated with elevated Hcy levels.

AB  - Poor sleep quality is associated with age-related cognitive decline, and whether reversal of these alterations is possible is unknown. In this study, we report how sleep deprivation (SD) affects hippocampal representations, sleep patterns, and memory in young and old mice. After training in a hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition (OPR) task, control animals sleep ad libitum, although experimental animals undergo 5 h of SD, followed by recovery sleep. Young controls and old SD mice exhibit successful OPR memory, whereas young SD and old control mice are impaired. Successful performance is associated with two cellular phenotypes: (1) "context'' cells, which remain stable throughout training and testing, and (2) "object configuration'' cells, which remap when objects are introduced to the context and during testing. Additionally, effective memory correlates with spindle counts during non-rapid eye movement (NREM)/rapid eye movement (REM) sigma transitions. These results suggest SD may serve to ameliorate age-related memory deficits and allow hippocampal representations to adapt to changing environments.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The banker plant system may provide an effective and economical method for long-term suppression of insect pests. We developed a non-crop banker plant system aiming to improve the control of stick tea thrips Dendrothrips minowai in tea plantations. In this system, we used the polyphagous predator Orius strigicollis (Poppius) as the biocontrol agent, the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Scopoli) as an alternative food, and the faba bean Vicia faba L. as the banker plant to support the predator in controlling pest thrips. Laboratory tests revealed that the control efficacy of the banker plant system was higher than that of directly releasing O. strigicollis. These results indicate that this banker plant system may be used in the field to provide a more effective and economical way to control pest thrips in tea plantations compared with the direct release of O. strigicollis.
   The stick tea thrip Dendrothrips minowai (Priesner) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is a destructive pest in tea plantations in south and southwest China. To control this pest, a non-crop banker plant system was developed using a polyphagous predator Orius strigicollis (Poppius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) with the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Scopoli) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) as an alternative prey and the faba bean Vicia faba as the banker plant to support the predator in targeting the pest. The fitness of A. fabae on tea plants and faba bean was evaluated to determine its host specificity. Moreover, the control efficacy of the banker plant system on D. minowai on tea plants was tested in the laboratory and compared with that of direct release of O. strigicollis. The experiments showed that faba bean was an excellent non-crop host for A. fabae because, while the aphid population increased quickly on faba bean, it could only survive for up to 9 days on tea plants. Compared with direct release of O. strigicollis, lower densities of pest were observed when introducing the banker plant system. Our results indicate that this banker plant system has the potential to be implemented in the field to improve the control of the pest thrips.

AB  - Analyses of Pleistocene fossil proboscideans have long been used as indirect evidence for climactic and environmental shifts in the Sunda shelf of Southeast Asia. Reconstructing the biological effects of rainforest expansion at the Last Glacial Maximum on elephants can be enhanced by a better understanding of fossil proboscidean palaeobiology. We studied fragmented post-cranial fossil remains of an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) from Pulau Bangka, an island to the east of Sumatra, hypothesised to be within the Late Pleistocene Sundaland savannah corridor. Bone histology of the humerus, rib, and vertebrae from the Bangka fossil were examined and compared with modern conspecifics to reconstruct remodelling. We measured secondary osteon population density, osteon area, diameter, and infill ratios in Haversian bone. Intra-skeletally, we found that the histology of the largely weight-bearing humerus indicated slower remodelling than that of the ribs and vertebrae, which are less biomechanically constrained. Inter-skeletally, the fossil rib histology showed relatively smaller osteons and Haversian canals when compared to the modern samples. Differences in lifestyles, including range-expansion, may have influenced micro-morphometric differences in elephant rib histology. Our results contribute indirect evidence of the effects of climactic variability in the Sunda palaeoenvironment on Pleistocene fauna.

AB  - Hipposideros galeritus was described in 1846, with subsequent studies suggesting four subspecies across South and Southeast Asia. Our study indicates that the Indian and Sri Lankan populations previously considered subspecies of H. galeritus are, in fact, distinct species in need of taxonomic revisions. Based on the morphometric analysis, structure of the baculum, molecular phylogenetics, and echolocation call analysis, the Indian, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asian populations of Hipposideros galeritus are distinct. We provide a detailed description of H. brachyotus Dobson, 1874 and describe a new species-H. srilankaensis sp. nov.-from Sri Lanka. Key morphological differences were found in the noseleaf, ear shape, and cranial features between the Indian (H. brachyotus), Sri Lankan (H. srilankaensis sp. nov.), and Southeast Asian populations (H. galeritus s.l.). Substantial genetic distances were found between H. galeritus populations, suggesting cryptic diversity that is yet to be resolved.

AB  - Pest management is challenged with resistant herbivores and problems regarding human health and environmental issues. Indeed, the greatest challenge to modern agriculture is to protect crops from pests and still maintain environmental quality. This study aimed to analyze by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to the feasibility of using the inhibitory protein extracted from mammals - Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) as a potential inhibitor of digestive trypsins from the pest Anticarsia gemmatalis and comparing the results with the host-plant inhibitor - Soybean Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor (SKTI). BPTI and SKTI interacts with A. gemmatalis trypsin-like enzyme competitively, through hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds. A. gemmatalis larvae exposed to BPTI did not show two common adaptative mechanisms i.e., proteolytic degradation and overproduction of proteases, presenting highly reduced trypsin-like activity. On the other hand, SKTI-fed larvae did not show reduced trypsin-like activity, presenting overproduction of proteases and SKTI digestion. In addition, the larval survival was reduced by BPTI similarly to SKTI, and additionally caused a decrease in pupal weight. The non-plant protease inhibitor BPTI presents intriguing element to compose biopesticide formulations to help decrease the use of conventional refractory pesticides into integrated pest management programs.

AB  - Many native South African grass species have become invasive elsewhere in the world. The application of biological control to invasive grasses has been approached with trepidation in the past, primarily due to concerns of a perceived lack of host specific herbivores. This has changed in recent times, and grasses are now considered suitable candidates. The Tetramesa Walker genus (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) has been found to contain species that are largely host specific to a particular grass species, or complex of closely related congeners. Very little taxonomic work exists for Tetramesa in the southern hemisphere, and the lack of morphological variability between many Tetramesa species has made identification difficult. This limits the ability to assess the genus for potential biological control agents. Species delimitation analyses indicated 16 putative novel southern African Tetramesa taxa. Ten of these were putative Tetramesa associated with Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees and Sporobolus pyramidalis Beauv. and S. natalensis Steud., which are alien invasive weeds in Australia. Of these ten Tetramesa taxa, eight were only found on a single host plant, while two taxa were associated with multiple species in a single grass genus. The Tetramesa spp. on S. pyramidalis and S. africanus were deemed suitably host-specific to be used as biological control agents. Field host range data for the Tetramesa species on E. curvula revealed that the wasp may not be suitably host specific for use as a biological control agent. However, further host specificity testing on non-target native Australian species is required.

AB  - Plants can trigger their systemic resistance by receiving chemical cues from neighbors attacked by herbivores or pathogens. In this study, the possibility of conferring resistance from donor tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) to receiver neighbor tomato plants via common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) of Funneliformis mosseae was studied. A split-root system was exploited to avoid direct pathogen-mycorrhizae interaction in donor plant. Our results showed that signal transduction from donor to receiver plant led to an increase in disease resistance through the expression rate of three defense-related genes of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), pathogen-related protein (PR1a) and proteinase inhibitor II (PI II) in neighbor plants. Mycorrhizal network established between donor and receiver plants after six weeks. The expression level of all three marker genes significantly increased in receiver plants compared to the control in 0 (T1), 48 h (T2) and 72 h (T3) after pathogen inoculation to receiver plants. The relative gene expression for PI II, PAL and PR1a increased 14.3, 17.98 and 8.49-folds at T1, 69.82, 40.24 and 65.54-folds at T2 and 47.85, 48.10 and 25.79-folds at T3, respectively. The disease intensity index and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) in the CMNs-connected receiver plants were reduced by 66.7 and 69.84 %, respectively, compared to the control without CMNs connection. Our findings indicated that F. mosseae CMNs like an underground communication channel could transmit warning signals and activate defense reactions in healthy plants before disease incidence, representing a promising strategy for priming and resistance induction in plants.

AB  - Neurogenesis encompasses the formation and development of neurons in the mammalian brain, mainly occurring in hippocampus and the olfactory system. This process is rapid, accurate, and very sensitive to the external stressors including environment, diet, age, anxiety, stress, depression, diet, and hormones. The range of stressors is big and directly impacts the generation, maturation and migration, efficacy, and myelination of the neuronal cells. The field of regenerative medicine focuses on combating the direct or indirect effects of these stressors on the process of neurogenesis, and ensures increased general and neuronal communications and functioning. Understanding the deep secrets of brain signaling and devising ways to increase drug availability is tough, considering the complexity and intricate details of the neuronal networks and signaling in the CNS. It is imperative to understand this complexity and introduce potent and efficacious ways to combat diseases. This perspective offers an insight into how neurogenesis could be aided by nanotechnology and what plausible nanomaterials are available to culminate neurogenesis-related neurological disorders. The nanomaterials are promising as they are minute, robust, and effective and help in diagnostics and therapeutics such as drug delivery, maturation and neuroprotection, neurogenesis, imaging, and neurosurgery.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is discussed to play a role in specific subgroups of different psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders. We have previously shown that a mouse model of trait anxiety (HAB) displays enhanced microglial density and phagocytic activity in key regions of anxiety circuits compared to normal-anxiety controls (NAB). Using minocycline, we provided causal evidence that reducing microglial activation within the dentate gyrus (DG) attenuated enhanced anxiety in HABs. Besides pharmacological intervention, "positive environmental stimuli", which have the advantage of exerting no side-effects, have been shown to modulate inflammation-related markers in human beings. Therefore, we now investigated whether environmental enrichment (EE) would be sufficient to modulate upregulated neuroinflammation in high-anxiety HABs. We show for the first time that EE can indeed attenuate enhanced trait anxiety, even when presented as late as adulthood. We further found that EE-induced anxiolysis was associated with the attenuation of enhanced microglial density (using Iba-1 as the marker) in the DG and medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, EE reduced Iba1 + CD68+ microglia density within the anterior DG. Hence, the successful attenuation of trait anxiety by EE was associated in part with the normalization of neuro-inflammatory imbalances. These results suggest that pharmacological and/or positive behavioral therapies triggering microglia-targeted anti-inflammatory effects could be promising as novel alternatives or complimentary anxiolytic therapeutic approaches in specific subgroups of individuals predisposed to trait anxiety.

AB  - Numerous studies suggest the involvement of adenosine-5 '-triphosphate (ATP) and similar nucleotides in the pathophysiology of asthma. Androgens, such as testosterone (TES), are proposed to alleviate asthma symptoms in young men. ATP and uridine-5 '-triphosphate (UTP) relax the airway smooth muscle (ASM) via purinergic P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) receptors and K+ channel opening. We previously demonstrated that TES increased the expression of voltage-dependent K+ (K-V) channels in ASM. This study investigates how TES may potentiate ASM relaxation induced by ATP and UTP. Tracheal tissues treated with or without TES (control group) from young male guinea pigs were used. In organ baths, tracheas exposed to TES (40 nM for 48 h) showed enhanced ATP- and UTP-evoked relaxation. Tetraethylammonium, a K+ channel blocker, annulled this effect. Patch-clamp experiments in tracheal myocytes showed that TES also increased ATP- and UTP-induced K+ currents, and this effect was abolished with flutamide (an androgen receptor antagonist). K-V channels were involved in this phenomenon, which was demonstrated by inhibition with 4-aminopyridine. RB2 (an antagonist of almost all P2Y receptors except for P2Y(2)), as well as N-ethylmaleimide and SQ 22,536 (inhibitors of G proteins and adenylyl cyclase, respectively), attenuated the enhancement of the K+ currents induced by TES. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry studies revealed that TES did not modify the expression of P2Y(4) receptors or COX-1 and COX-2, while we have demonstrated that this androgen augmented the expression of K(V)1.2 and K(V)1.5 channels in ASM. Thus, TES leads to the upregulation of P2Y(4) signaling and K-V channels in guinea pig ASM, enhancing ATP and UTP relaxation responses, which likely limits the severity of bronchospasm in young males.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder associated with traumatic memory, yet its etiology remains unclear. Reexperiencing symptoms are specific to PTSD compared to other anxiety-related disorders. Importantly, reexperiencing can be mimicked by retrieval-related events of fear memory in animal models of traumatic memory. Recent studies revealed candidate PTSD-associated genes that were related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate the tight linkage between facilitated cAMP signaling and PTSD by analyzing loss- and gain-of-cAMP signaling effects on fear memory in mice and the transcriptomes of fear memory-activated mice and female PTSD patients with reexperiencing symptoms. Pharmacological and optogenetic upregulation or downregulation of cAMP signaling transduction enhanced or impaired, respectively, the retrieval and subsequent maintenance of fear memory in mice. In line with these observations, integrative mouse and human transcriptome analysis revealed the reduced mRNA expression of phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), an enzyme that degrades cAMP, in the peripheral blood of PTSD patients showing more severe reexperiencing symptoms and the mouse hippocampus after fear memory retrieval. Importantly, more severe reexperiencing symptoms and lower PDE4B mRNA levels were correlated with decreased DNA methylation of a locus within PDE4B, suggesting the involvement of methylation in the mechanism of PTSD. These findings raise the possibility that the facilitation of cAMP signaling mediating the downregulation of PDE4B expression enhances traumatic memory, thereby playing a key role in the reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD patients as a functional index of these symptoms.

AB  - Low urinary tract dysfunctions and symptoms (LUTS) affect both men and woman, with the incidence increasing with age. Among the LUTS, urinary incontinence (UI) is a common dysfunction, characterised by the involuntary loss of urine. These medical conditions become debilitating, with a severe impact on patients' routines and overall well-being. To mitigate LUTS-associated symptoms, the mechanical behaviour of both normal and LUTS-affected urethrae can be an important tool. The current work approaches the porcine urethra as a mechanical replacement candidate for the human urethra. It aims to provide a framework based on in silico (numerical) simulations and experimental data, to compare the candidate's mechanical behaviour against the human urethra. Porcine urethral samples were mechanically evaluated through low-cycle fatigue tests in both circumferential and longitudinal orientations. The specimens were collected from porcine urethrae from crossbred pigs raised for human consumption. The experimental results were compared with human references found in the literature, with similar experimental conditions. The experimental data were used as the input for the mechanical properties estimation (nonlinear fitting to hyperelastic constitutive models) and for the simulation of the urethral tensile behaviour, using those models. In the longitudinal orientation, the results for the porcine and human urethra were in good agreement, while in the circumferential direction, the differences increased with deformation. Previous data on the mechanical behaviour of the equine urethra is in line with these findings. The nonlinear mechanical behaviour of a porcine urethra was modelled using the finite element method (FEM) and hyperelastic constitutive models. For the longitudinal urethra, the simulation results approximate experimental data for stretches up to lambda approximate to 1.5 (50% deformations), whereas for the circumferential urethra, the same was true for stretches up to lambda approximate to 1.35 (35% deformations). The hyperelastic models with a higher number of parameters performed better with the third-order Ogden model (six parameters), displaying the best performance among the studied models. The pig urethra is a suitable candidate for an implant targeted at human urethra replacement or as a model to study the human urinary system. Nevertheless, the data available on the circumferential mechanical behaviour need to be consolidated with additional mechanical tests. The tensile behaviour of the porcine urethra over large deformations can be modelled using the third-order Ogden model; however, to extend the modelling capabilities to larger deformations requires the use of hyperelastic models more adequate to soft tissue behaviour.

AB  - A presynaptic active zone organizer protein Bassoon orchestrates numerous important functions at the presynaptic active zone. We previously showed that the absence of Bassoon exclusively in forebrain glutamatergic presynapses (Bsn(Emx1)cKO) in mice leads to developmental disturbances in dentate gyrus (DG) affecting synaptic excitability, morphology, neurogenesis and related behaviour during adulthood. Here, we demonstrate that hyperexcitability of the medial perforant path-to-DG (MPP-DG) pathway in Bsn(Emx1)cKO mice emerges during adolescence and is sustained during adulthood. We further provide evidence for a potential involvement of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the high-affinity receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mediated signalling. We detect elevated TrkB protein levels in the dorsal DG of adult mice (similar to 3-5 months-old) but not in adolescent (similar to 4-5 weeks-old) mice. Electrophysiological analysis reveals increased field-excitatory-postsynaptic-potentials (fEPSPs) in the DG of the adult, but not in adolescent Bsn(Emx1)cKO mice. In line with an increased TrkB expression during adulthood in Bsn(Emx1)cKO, blockade of TrkB normalizes the increased synaptic excitability in the DG during adulthood, while no such effect was observed in adolescence. Accordingly, neurogenesis, which has previously been found to be increased in adult Bsn(Emx1)cKO mice, was unaffected at adolescent age. Our results suggest that Bassoon plays a crucial role in the TrkB-dependent postnatal maturation of the hippocampus.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cornua cervi degelatinatum (CCD) is formed by removing the gelatinous substance from deer antlers according to traditional methods. It was first recorded in the Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica and has been included in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. It is commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and infertility. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the impact of CCD aqueous extract on the proliferation and stemness of breast cancer (BC) cells, with an emphasis on its regulation of miR-148a-3p expression and associated molecular pathways. Materials and methods: Breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of CCD to assess its effects on cancer stem cell (CSC) features, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and overall plasticity. The UALCAN platform was utilized to analyze the relationship between miR-148a-3p and Smad2 expression. Functional experiments involving miR-148a-3p overexpression were performed to elucidate CCD's modulatory effects on the TGF-beta/Smad2 pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis was conducted to predict the binding affinity of CCD's active components to Smad2. Results: The CCD aqueous extract significantly reduced BC cell viability in vitro and dose-dependently suppressed the expression of stemness- and EMT-related proteins. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays validated miR-148a-3p as a direct regulator of Smad2, inhibiting the TGF-beta/Smad2 signaling pathway. Molecular docking revealed strong binding interactions between CCD's active components and Smad2. Conclusions: CCD exhibits anti-BC effects by working synergistically with miR-148a-3p to inhibit the TGF beta/Smad2 pathway, thereby reducing BC stemness and EMT progression. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CCD's therapeutic potential in BC treatment.

AB  - The safety of food of animal origin is closely related to feed quality. Feed pollution by brominated flame retardants (BFRs) leads to the exposure of animals and consumers of food of animal origin to these substances. The study aimed to assess the concentration of ten PBDE (BDE-28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183, and 209) congeners and eight nBFRs (TBX, PBT, HBB, PBEB, EH-TBB, BTBPE, BEH-TBPH, and DBDPE) in 59 feed and feed materials from six different feed categories (277/2012/EU). The quantification of analytes was based on isotopic dilution and gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). All 59 feed samples were contaminated with at least one of the analytes. PBDEs and nBFRs were found in 78% and 91% of the samples, respectively. BFR content ranged from 0.18 to 5.87 mu g kg(-1) in feed with a 12% moisture content, and the most contaminated category was vegetable oils, followed by fishmeal, feeds for fish, animal fats, and compound feeds for pigs. The least contaminated samples turned out to be compound feeds for chickens. This study confirms the general trend of decreasing PBDE concentrations in fishmeal. In the investigated samples, BDE-47 and BDE-209 contributed the most to the Sigma PBDE content. DBDPE, HBB, and PBT contributed the most to the investigated Sigma nBFRs. The widespread occurrence of nBFRs in feed seems disturbing because these compounds have replaced PBDEs. Their concentrations in the feed may most likely exceed those of PBDEs in the coming years.
